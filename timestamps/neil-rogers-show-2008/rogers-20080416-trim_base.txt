New push of the

[00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.720]

[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.200]
What's you?

[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.420]
Yeah, I'm doing great

[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.320]
The biggest name of this talent

[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.000]
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM

[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]

[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.120]
Black hole

[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.580]
The Ford engine is just here

[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.280]
You could have fixed the problem with the phone

[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.660]
The engine is quite big, it's going to be a bit biased around the world

[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.180]
Not all I can tell you are WQAM presents the Neil Roger show

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.200]

[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.380]
Except it was great playing playing the Neil

[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.640]
Neil goes for $150

[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.720]
With no feelings in mind, the last wireless phone

[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.500]
The opinions expressed by Neil, his guests or his colleagues

[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.420]
Do not represent those of WQAM management

[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180]
Stinger will sponsor all

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.600]
Now the Neil Roger show

[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.140]

The Neil Rogers are sports Radio WQAM

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120]
Oh, but I tried to put me to the down

[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.200]
I can't stop my nomination

[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.000]
But now you know it's all stick around

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.200]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.020]
Won't give up my supergidded delegate

[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.400]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100]
If he thinks I will, he must be not

[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.740]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.300]
This is my nomination, baby

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240]
Black wants me to flip a fade away

[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.380]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.140]
What else do you think his pastor will fix his head?

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.220]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.160]
I'm not trying to cause a big altercocation

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.060]
Talking about my nomination

[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.800]
But I'll fight to the death

[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.300]
Remind an nomination

[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.080]
This is my nomination

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.340]
This is my nomination, baby

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.200]
Hey, nomination rise with appreciation

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.060]
Oh!

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220]
Don't do this the word shrill come to mind

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.800]
Every time I hear that shrill

[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.580]
I'm happy Wednesday

[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.080]
We got the whole crew of George's here, Chris's here

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.040]
The Toronto engineer was here for about an hour

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.220]
And came up with a conclusion that the router was shot

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.540]
Which everybody already told us

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.420]
And he said my first inclination was to go out and pick up a new one

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.800]
And bring it by and hook it up for you

[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.720]
But they said, oh no just go over and take a look

[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.820]
We don't want to spend that 142 bucks

[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.180]
Hey, they got that money we can give to George and Chris

[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]
We won't do that

[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.040]
But we could give to them

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.960]
So you're still punching buttons

[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.240]
It's just a very bad

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.340]
Like I told you

[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.860]
Whatever

[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.780]
I have a do it yourself studio here

[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.620]
I should just do it on my own

[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.380]
We'll see what they say

[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.720]
Maybe they'll spring for it you know

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.320]
No

[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320]
It's not a question what I'll spring for

[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.520]
It's a question of how soon they'll get it here

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.300]
Right

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.980]
But we don't get a response by end of showtime

[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.020]
Then we'll take matters into our own hands obviously

[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.660]
Mmm

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.900]
Well wait till you hear this story

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.940]
This is probably before we do any stories

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.660]
Join WDQM today from Noon to One for a Florida Marlin Ticket Hit

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.760]
A Ticket Hit

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.300]
Ticket Ticket Ticket Hit

[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.160]
Swing by the hooters at Pines in University and get free tickets to see your Florida Marlins take on the Atlanta Braze

[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.060]
I saw about two minutes of that game last night

[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.840]
It looked like you could be on bowling in the stands

[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.340]
Hurry because once they're gone they're just going

[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.480]
It says here but I don't know

[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.520]
I think you'll have like 8,000 people lined up there to get to free your Marlin Tickets

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.380]
Because they just like the thing with Jack Martin

[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.600]
Jack Martin that Joe was screaming about there at the end of his show

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.780]
Nobody cares Joe

[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.880]
Nobody can run me there are few people but you can put him in a phone booth and have room for the Chinese Army left over

[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.380]
Nobody gives a flying crap don't you understand these things

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.760]
And the same thing like with the Marlins is anybody care?

[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.280]
No

[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.740]
But they're getting that new stadium

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.740]
George has said it about that he wants to go down there

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.580]
Thrilled

[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.720]
Aren't you?

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.400]
Oh yeah

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.980]
We love the Marlins they want again

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.900]
Oh yeah

[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.420]
There were a few games everybody's all kissing ass

[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.020]
That's right they didn't even leave the division

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.380]
Yeah I know big deal

[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.020]
Who cares

[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.100]
And you know something nobody still cares

[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.520]
Well you know

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.500]
Here what?

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.700]
Well you know

[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.360]
Well I know what

[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.280]
Nobody cares

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.600]
We got that thing on did I? Yes we do

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.780]
First pitch

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.760]
10 to 7

[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.640]
Now let me ask you this

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.960]
Now that Mad Dog's getting cut down all baseball season two hours and 50 minutes most days

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.820]
Are they like

[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.780]
You know reducing his pay for that?

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.340]
Because how many days a year does he work anyhow?

[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.220]
About 30 minutes

[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.580]
And it works 30 days a year and now that he's only working till 10 to 7 you think that they would make an adjustment on that wouldn't you?

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.520]
The only reason I'm sticking my nose in there is because that money could be going to George and Chris

[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.420]
Yeah

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.660]
And once you've been launched with Joe Bell

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.400]
I don't know

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.260]
What do you mean you don't know?

[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.660]
He said that he would get with me this week about about what we were going to get together

[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.840]
He wasn't at me like in the tea room?

[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.780]
Yeah well I'm not in position to jump up and down or anything like that so I'll just wait

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.320]
I got unfastened my belly

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.040]
I got my clothes on

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.920]
Oh my god because the engineer was here in a show

[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.620]
Oh that's right

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.880]
Oh that's right

[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.400]
That's right you had to get this

[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.400]
I'll rectumify that situation

[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.080]
You'll take your pants off? Yes

[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.940]
Yes I will

[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.760]
Well here's the guy who I guess won't be taking his pants off again

[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.680]
A man fell to his death after a baseball game between the midst of the Washington

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.380]
NASA Chase Stadium last night

[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.160]
The man was sliding down an escalator as fans left the stadium and he'd lost his balance

[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.500]
and fell four stories around 10 o'clock last night the New York Police Department said

[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.320]
He died about 25 minutes later in Boothham, or real hospital

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.100]
Police identified the man who's 36 year old Antonio, Naurar and Sami, a Brooklyn

[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.880]
They say they're investigating that this isn't accident

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.180]
No, maybe the escalator died

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.240]
Fry the escalator, put it in jail

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.420]
He was sliding down the escalator

[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.620]
36 year old guy, not something like that, 16 year old punk

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.780]
Not somebody who's sitting at Noam better but some guy who's 36 years old now he's dead

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.180]
Because he was going to see, he's going to beat everybody to the bottom of the escalator

[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.220]
He was going to slide on down and show everybody how cool he was

[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.920]
Well guess what? Now? I'm dying out of here

[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.380]
He's dead

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.500]
Very sad, oh speaking of dead people

[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.080]
I always like to get to dead people out of the way at the beginning of the show

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.400]
So for the late tuners in they don't have to put up with that crap

[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.740]
And if I really end up dead people and tune in right to beginning every day

[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.860]
and we like to get them all out of the way

[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.220]
Police are investigating the apparent suicide for a former drummer for Rocker Ted Nugent

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.880]
Too bad Ted Nugent didn't kill himself or somebody

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.240]
It kills me

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.160]
Corporal Brandon Gurley with the Paul Ding County Sheriff's Department says 59 year old Clifford Davies

[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.800]
Brandon Gurley, I wonder if he's came to Hell and Gurley Brown

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.640]
Because it's spelled the same way

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.360]
How'd you like to be named Gurley? Hey Gurley man

[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.960]
No thank you

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.280]
59 year old Clifford Davies was fond of from a gunshot wound in his suburban Atlanta home Sunday

[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.440]
Gurley said Tuesday authorities are awaiting the results of an autopsy

[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.600]
Woman of Wants of the phone at Davies Home Defined comment

[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.560]
She confirmed that Davies was a drummer with Ted Nugent

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.300]
Was

[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.680]
Reed Beaver, who owns Eccometric Studio in Marietta where Davies was a chief engineer

[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.760]
Says Davies played on a recording of Nugent's trademark song Cat Scratch Fever

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.600]
Beaver says Davies called on Saturday extremely distraught over money from medical bills and men

[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.540]
But I'm bang! Wait, there's not to worry about it anymore

[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.040]
Remember Frankie Pantangely when Tom Hagen went to visit him in jail?

[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.580]
That's right

[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.280]
And he gave him the story about the ancient Romans and how they would go home and open up their wrist

[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.000]
They get in the bathtub

[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.600]
That's right

[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.200]
And how their families would be taking care of all of these things

[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.160]
All of these things

[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.100]
So if you can't play your medical bills George or any of your other bills

[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.020]
Things would get really tight

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.440]
I got a big plan for that, that's right

[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.700]
Washington News Alert, uh-uh, what is this?

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.820]
Oh the Pope's White House visit, I don't care

[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.380]
I don't care how them been dreared

[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.160]
The Pope's White House visit, I'm my Blackberry no less than Washington News

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.880]
Breaking news, noos alert, breaking news

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.400]
Every time somebody farts the wrong flavor, it's breaking news

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.460]
When break the news?

[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.040]
Oh didn't we do this one before somebody suggested this poll, one of our, where they maroonly dodge

[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.860]
Well they're really chronic over there man

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.800]
All day long they're pumping out faxes to us

[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.540]
I hope there's some as many cars that are sending faxes to us

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.240]
The dead former South Florida broadcaster I miss most is

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.680]
And of course this has only got a few on here, there's so many

[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:51.000]
It's got an ambitious Bob Weaver, Walter Cronice, Don Cox, Ralph Redneck, Chuck Zink, or Big Wilson

[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.520]
What about my cranberry? What about Bill Cawdler?

[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.040]
Who else am I leaving off here?

[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.060]
Dead broadcasters

[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.900]
Bob Weaver, it's on here

[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.440]
Anybody?

[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.700]
Well that's one for, I'm sure we've done that

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.040]
We have, I think

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.260]
But we can do it again

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.160]
Here's the poll from yesterday, 179 Holtz boys

[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.300]
The numbers on these polls are last today

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.440]
It's not to encouraging probably because it's paysoft coming up this weekend

[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.860]
You think that's got something to do with it?

[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.360]
Not

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.060]
I wish Neil would change nothing, candidate before

[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.160]
Except maybe those nasty, court-a-work pants

[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.540]
The ones that swish against each other when you walk

[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.080]
You keep asking me about that

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.980]
They make those sounds

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.000]
I've got that sound here somewhere

[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.920]
Wait a minute

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.580]
In the 360

[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.340]
Here it can go, that's not the right one

[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.980]
I gotta be very sure I don't play the wrong one

[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.480]
That's right

[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.560]
Or in deep cramp

[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.920]
I'll never find it, it's not important

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.880]
Change nothing 384

[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.520]
Take calls 294, I don't know where I can find it

[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.700]
It's number three

[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.220]
There it is

[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.960]
That's the sound that your pant legs make

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.240]
Right

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.220]
It's the quarter-royd rubbing together there

[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.960]
That's all I did

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.420]
Oh no, that's the fart sound, we know it

[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.040]
If anybody ever heard a fart that sounded like that boy

[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.820]
I'd sure I'd pay money to hear that live

[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.400]
Of course remember, none of those fart sounds are actual fart sounds

[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.260]
Of course not

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.960]
They're comedy, but then they get all of them

[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.740]
It's funny about farting, especially if it's wet

[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.200]
I wish Neil would take calls 294

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.000]
Or what we are and we do, I don't know

[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.280]
I don't know why you people are so stubborn about that crap

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.500]
Oh yesterday were okay, not spectacular

[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.060]
They were okay, but they were okay

[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.900]
It was a movement in the right direction

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.200]
I wish Neil would live forever 274

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.560]
And I'm getting tired

[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.800]
Old and tired, like the Pope there he is

[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.460]
Now, I rule hot thought and I take off the Yamaha

[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.080]
Okay, you still look from the Jews

[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.940]
Stop reading story 61

[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.900]
Well that's not very many, only 5.5%

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.040]
So that's the message to me that

[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.820]
If the people we have left listening out there

[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.140]
They don't mind the stories, they got a lot of good stories today

[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.320]
Many stories

[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.540]
Remember he said there are all kinds of stories on the street

[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.800]
About down corridor and everything

[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.880]
And then suddenly he got a little bit upset

[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.440]
Suddenly he had that the famous temper

[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.760]
That's right, hot head

[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.100]
I wish Neil would retire

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.820]
42, Crocan die wicked death 24

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.300]
Out of 1049, Crocan die wicked death

[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.320]
2.2% 2.2

[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.900]
Very nice, that's South Florida for you

[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.580]
In fact I should be surprised it's so low

[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.980]
Today is full, what's the most exciting play in sports?

[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.960]
There's too many choices on there, I better do the break

[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.380]
Because by the time I read them

[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.840]
It'll be midnight

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.000]
And you see what's winning, I hate sports

[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.580]
100 and 3, I hate sports

[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.180]
But what about Jock Martan and the

[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.560]
Fired coach is going to choose the next coach

[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.780]
And oh, aren't you all upset?

[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.980]
And what about my keen and let's get him back again

[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.920]
And what about the Alan Cohen is an A-hole

[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.900]
And what about all of that? You know, we know that

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.500]
We know these things

[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.580]
And not that anybody cares

[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.060]
Just amazing when you've got 16 sports stations on here

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.260]
And a market where all of the sports, all the venues

[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.060]
Have these big chunks of empty seats for every event

[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.840]
Where the teams suck and the fans don't care

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.740]
And it's like, oh you're wrong

[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.400]
That's all Alan guys, real guys

[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.540]
That's all they talk about is sports

[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.280]
That's right, like George

[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.340]
Right, roller skating

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.920]
Yeah, I'm doing things, not watching things

[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.260]
Well, you're doing it

[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.020]
That's right

[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.620]
From minutes after 10 to 5, 60 to everybody

[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.520]
QM, we got the Jack Show at 2

[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.180]
Wow, that's still on, Mad Dog 4 to 6, 50

[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.060]
First pitch with Jesse Aglid in Marlena Marlon pregame report

[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.400]
For 10 minutes with 8 minutes of sports

[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.000]
Then we got the Dolphins All Asses 7-9

[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.340]
And then the A-Show has to follow all of that

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.200]
Poor D-A-Man, I feel bad for him

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.840]
Oh God

[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.340]
Norma can

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.180]
This is Clear Channel, we're prepared to offer you

[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.800]
Let's see, where's my Mickey Mantle Rookie card

[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.400]
Norma can

[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.880]
Hello Mr. Canth, this is XM

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.980]
We're looking for an anchor show for our network

[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.440]
And would you...

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.180]
Where's my Ed Crane pool

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.220]
There it is

[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.940]
Norma canth

[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.140]
Hello Mr. Canth, this is no commissary

[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.040]
I'm not following up to find my mark, Drone Berry

[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.580]
Oh, Norma canth

[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.320]
Hoho, Joe Bell here

[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.980]
Hi Joe

[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.460]
Oh, I'm just calling to let you know

[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.340]
And I'm leaning for more of the same of nothing

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.920]
To go nowhere is still underway

[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.040]
Hohohoho

[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.080]
Okay

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.940]
Ooh, I find my coolest Joe Jackson card with Ringtone

[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.060]
Ha-Da

[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.940]
La-Da

[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.040]
La-Da-Da

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.280]
La-Da-Da

[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.400]
La-Da-Da

[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.480]
La-Da-Da-Da

[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.080]
Already on set

[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.060]
Ten, seven, five, sixty, ne'vete, q-a-m

[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.960]
Happy Wednesday, it's April 16 whatever that means

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.560]
There's nothing significant about today although

[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.880]
we got April going up peace off comein' up this weekend

[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.540]
and we got April 20th coming of soon

[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.600]
Yes

[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.160]
And you want me to read this long

[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.620]
Well you to, because it's right up your alley

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.800]
the stone or holiday. Just in case you were short on stories today. I'm not. I remember a

[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.220]
while back we had a conversation about the 420 thing and I just didn't know if you

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:17.220]
still understood it or not or cared. So there you go. You don't remember that? Yeah.

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.340]
Okay. You have to work here. Okay, because you asked where it came from and what it meant

[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.660]
and all that. So there you go. For years it says the 420 label remained obscure enough

[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.940]
to be a viable code inside joke. But by the late 90s it was being pressed and used everywhere

[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.420]
from personal ads for 20 friendly to clots and scoreboards in the background scenes and

[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.680]
popular movies. Perhaps it's most noticeable effect was the treasuries of April 20th as

[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.860]
the day of a reefer reverence chief of the American college campuses. So everybody light

[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.660]
up on the 20th which is what the 18th Sunday. Oh never on Sunday on on. Oh my. Oh my.

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:59.180]
Oh my. Oh my. You're going to be burdened a fat one in hell. I'll say that right now.

[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.800]
A once clandestine counterculture, post-smoking holiday, observe each April 20th has crossed

[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.860]
into the mainstream this year with public gatherings that will attract thousands of participants

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:17.260]
in marketing campaigns that count a trio of marijuana themed movies. Even with fire

[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.280]
fox. Yeah. There's still a little pop-ups every once in a while. It's just just castle

[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.180]
media, whatever that is. I'd like to kill whoever's respawn. I mean, it takes half a second

[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.700]
to get rid of them, but I just I don't like it. Indeed. I don't want to see them. I don't

[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:36.160]
want them. As anti drug activists, shape the so-called 420 celebrate. Now what does it say?

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.760]
It shows the number and then it says pronounce 420. In case you think it's put up. You're

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:46.200]
going to say 420? Yeah. Yeah. No. Really slow out there. The so-called 420 celebrations

[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.000]
are taken on the life of their own. Said Alan St. Pierre, executive director of the National

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.640]
Organization of Reform marijuana law. His own norma, I'm sure, is still big on that.

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.340]
Who's been working on marijuana issues for 17 years. Normal. Normal and normal. St.

[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.260]
Pierre, who thought the phenomenon was peaking about 10 years ago, instead of watching

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.420]
the continued growth, thanks to the commercial efforts and the remarkable cultural push

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.980]
for something that is not owned by anything that nobody profits from per se. And it goes

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.500]
on about all their chapters and but I beat but I'm up and I'm up behind it's like

[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.680]
he said, if I write on a material someday, I'll put that down or it about my pile. There

[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.260]
you go. God. Oh, and I tried. Look at that. I tried to print out the poll so I could read

[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:33.820]
it off the sheet and didn't work just a clock. I looked at it. 10 19 21. That's because

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.900]
I didn't click on the screen before I went to my print and sometimes that makes a difference

[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.720]
and sometimes it don't. You know, all this, all this age of computers, man. It's good

[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.540]
to magic. It will fart like me messing around with computers. That's bad. I was explaining

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.100]
to where Toronto engineer here about how I ordered that backup power supply. Power supply

[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:59.560]
unit and hooked it up and plugged it in and diddled it and paid for it myself, of course.

[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.000]
What's the most exciting play in sports? 582 votes so far. Chris is very dismayed at

[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.040]
that number and that we're not going to make a thousand again. And I'm making a thousand

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.840]
times. We got nobody out there. What? I'm so sad. What was it yesterday? Not good.

[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.460]
Well, it's a time we left. I think it was like, I don't know. I mean, we wound up with

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.220]
a thousand seventy nine, but that was after the show. No, we're near a thousand. Maybe

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.200]
we got to 900. I don't know. Remember George? George is no one doesn't care. Most exciting

[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:36.680]
playing sports. 582 on the full. I hate sports is winning. 106 18% of this audience. I

[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:43.420]
don't know. What are you laughing about? Oh, Chris made a funny face. I'm so sad. That's

[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:49.960]
not funny stuff. That's our bread and butter. It is right. Kick return for a touchdown.

[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.540]
96 Hail Mary 55. Like that. Flute against the hurricanes. I'm ready to use it. I remember

[00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:05.260]
that like it was just yesterday. Hail Mary. Play at the plate. 46. Buzzer meter. 35. Stretch

[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:12.300]
roll line. Stand 32. Inside the park home. Run 32. Knockout punch 29. Breakaway goal.

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.620]
25. On that says hockey and friend like like we have to point out that it's in hockey.

[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:25.680]
Oh, stock car crash 25 penalty shot 19. Suicide squeeze 12. That's what I was going to help

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.880]
me. I felt like a suicide. I was I wasn't squeezing them. Didn't have to. 5 on 3 penalty

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.820]
kill. That's hockey 12. Mededore toss 6. Heter goal and soccer 6. Shoot out 5. That's

[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:45.120]
because most of the audience have been my deal with this. All you have to. Salky crash 2.

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:51.360]
I mean that is just so grotesque. Salky crash is a play in sports. That's an even

[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.580]
beyond there. Well, the car crash is on there. But neither one of them is a play in sports.

[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.380]
Well, that's just that's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for

[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.060]
savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:32.360]
That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:19:49.720 --> 00:20:02.340]
That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:32.320]
That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:20:48.360 --> 00:21:02.300]
That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:29.260]
That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings. That's just a venue there for savings.

[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.660]
Don't look at me like that.

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:29.240]
Don't look at me like that.

[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.120]
I think at all times, at least have one in your...

[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.580]
Blackcomb has nobody we looking for there. Business owners have argued that they have a Constitution right to set the rules on their own property.

[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.260]
They say they should be able to ban guns if they choose in order to protect employees and patrons.

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.340]
The Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Retail Federation have already hired an attorney to sue the state over a new law. Good.

[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:58.360]
The grounds for the challenge will be based on the Constitution's fifth amendment, so the attorney of very rich earth, who plans to file the lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the two organizations as soon as next week.

[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.540]
The amendment forbids the government from taking a person's private property without compensation. What does that mean?

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:14.220]
I don't know. Although the government would not actually be transferring the title of the property from the owner, it will be placing a new restriction on private property by forcing businesses to store unwanted guns Richard said.

[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.560]
What? Boy, you talk about convoluted reasoning.

[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.420]
There will most likely be other aspects that the challenge will Richard said he's still putting the case together. Mary and Hammer.

[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.160]
Hey Hammer!

[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.300]
A spokesman put the NRA said she doesn't believe the new law conflicts with the Constitution and only upholds right citizens already here.

[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:35.060]
The NRA people are all crazy as a bed bug. Don't you effort our guns now! You old faggot! Don't you effort our guns!

[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.800]
That's what America is all about is guns, baby! Guns!

[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.740]
Am I right, yes? Guns in a lot of shooting and a lot of dead people. That's all about it.

[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:53.020]

[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.440]
Thanks.

[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.720]
Fourth leader.

[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.900]
Yankee baby.

[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.060]
A rare lot tastes from Starbucks and hot Asian women.

[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:03.260]
Truffles of chocolate and books by John Christian in France for the misses I feel shopping.

[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.760]
These are a white person's favorite things.

[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.260]
Hedge funds for profit and rap songs by Diddy for a go-bama and keep friendly cities.

[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.380]
Both of them sushi at dinner parties.

[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.640]
These are a white person's favorite things.

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.340]
Farmer's market's doing yoga, riding mountain bikes.

[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.600]
Remember when you see some folks who are white.

[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.380]
These are the things they love.

[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.580]
Tend to eat three.

[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.320]
Here's the caustic facts and of course how unusual is that?

[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.420]
A caustic facts from somebody on the side of course.

[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.660]
And it says, Router's don't go bad.

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.940]
Now Erica, a semi-imested, said that after three, seven years they do funky things and they do go bad.

[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.060]
Chris was telling me the other day, weren't you telling me that Router's do go bad?

[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.540]
Yeah, they do.

[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.480]
And in my experience, I'm not a technical guy but in my experience I've had to replace Router's several times.

[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.720]
Well, you guys don't know squat according to this guy.

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.600]
Uh, okay, admittedly.

[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.060]
I don't.

[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.820]
Router's don't go bad.

[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.860]
Neil, Router's just don't go bad unless they were abused or damaged.

[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.620]
The firmware needs to be upgraded from time to time but they really just go bad.

[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.340]
Well guess what?

[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.100]
My engineer here tried to update the firmware online and it wouldn't accept the update.

[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.060]
It didn't work.

[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.580]
The upgrade.

[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.900]
Maybe the router went bad.

[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.040]
I mean, the router's don't go bad.

[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.740]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.820]
This guy says, I'm using an 8-year-old router that works like an ad-bottied.

[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.460]
Well, good, good, good, good, good, good, good for you.

[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.500]
Hot shot.

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.620]
Secondly, they don't cost 150 bucks either unless you're getting a special router with special firewalls and extra protection build-in.

[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.640]
Don't take my word for or go to any website, bestbuy.com or taggerdirect.com and check for yourself.

[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.520]
And of course, taggerdirect.com is where I found that one that Eric recommended that was 142 bucks.

[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.500]
On D-Link or Linksysregular, 4-port router is 50 bucks and they now come wired and wireless all in one.

[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.680]
So, actually, we're so called tech what he's going to do with the extra 100 bucks.

[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.640]
First of all, our so-called tech wasn't going to buy the router.

[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.380]
And he's going to make 100 bucks on that deal.

[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:08.740]

[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.860]
That was one that I was going to buy online, Schmuck.

[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.100]
But again, this guy, this is what I'm getting lately from all these experts out there.

[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.740]
Tell me how to live my life, how to renegotiate my contract, my Charlie B,

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.780]
who sent me some of the most incredible swill the other day.

[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.440]
Oh, and demand you can play the farts, hold them by the balls, and you've got to buy the balls, right?

[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.980]
I've got to buy the balls.

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.040]
This is the man who has got any idea what he's talking about.

[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.280]
You people are listening out there and thank God we've got some,

[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.100]
but you don't understand the nature of this business.

[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.120]
It ain't what he used to be in case you haven't noticed, okay?

[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.200]
It's a shadow.

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.340]
It's a faint shadow of what he used to be.

[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.080]
In this crap about I've got to buy the balls, how many choices have I got?

[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:46.940]
Norma can't.

[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.580]
I've got no choices. I'm here.

[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.160]
I'm not complaining about it either because like I said,

[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.400]
sometimes the poison that you know is better than the unknown poison.

[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.360]
Anyway, this guy goes on.

[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.520]
On an 8 plus and n plus computer tech I've set up many router systems.

[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.500]
I've never seen a router just go bad and never paid more than 50 bucks for new and accepting rare cases.

[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.700]
PSF, I'm this bridge in Brooklyn.

[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.420]
I'm going to bring it up this weekend to sell it to you.

[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.920]
Like I'm some kind of a schmuck.

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.320]
Because I don't know how much routers cost.

[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.800]
Well, excuse me.

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.220]
Excuse me.

[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.160]
The just like this backup power supply that has been 180 bucks on.

[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.060]
I've probably got ripped off.

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.200]
Oh, geez, you could have bought that for 40 bucks.

[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.800]
Five bucks.

[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.820]
Maybe not five bucks, but I guarantee you.

[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.280]
Eight bucks.

[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:28.840]
That's right.

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.800]
Mr. Smarty fans.

[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.420]
Now, although I do find something interesting and I did look on there on Vestify.com,

[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.800]
they have wireless routers.

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.180]
Yes.

[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.340]
So you don't have to like, I'll plug in all that crap into them.

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.260]
Well, for your wireless devices.

[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.160]
What does that mean?

[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.120]
In other words, you know, you have your wireless laptop,

[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.720]
your laptop that can, you know.

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.600]
I don't have any of that.

[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.000]
Okay.

[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.640]
So that's the previous one.

[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.120]
Right.

[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.100]
So in other words, that was also something you didn't need to have by the time.

[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:00.720]
Correct.

[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.520]
A D-link regular 4.4 routers, 50 bucks.

[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.160]
Yeah.

[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.140]
I mean, there are different kinds of routers,

[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.700]
just like there are different kinds of cars, refrigerators, you know.

[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.320]
Some with lots of stuff.

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:12.920]
One of the other instruments.

[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.860]
I'm in 42 bucks.

[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.020]
Now, who do you think knows more about?

[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.500]
My setup here, what I need and what I got, what I should get.

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.580]
Eric or this anonymous jackass.

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.300]
I don't know.

[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.140]
An anonymous jackass.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.740]
He's an expert.

[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.860]
Routers don't go bad.

[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.620]
Well, as soon as I saw the heading on it, the first line I should have known this was an idiot.

[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.560]
But that's where it's at these days.

[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.560]
It's either people giving me a saw that ends about how I should negotiate my deal or where I should be working

[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.820]
and what I should do and what I should have her breakfast and...

[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.980]
What is that all about?

[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.100]
Talk about arrogance.

[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.020]
People you don't even know telling you how to live your life and how to do your job and how to do your job.

[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.400]
They know you.

[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.240]
You're on the radio.

[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:47.840]
They listen to the scream.

[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:48.860]
They know you.

[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.240]
They don't know squat.

[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.360]
Oh, there's the Pope.

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.540]
Oh, and they're singing in the dwelling.

[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.780]
No, you're in pain.

[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:12.340]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340]

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.500]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:12.500]

[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:12.560]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.560]

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.640]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.380]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:13.880]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.340]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.320]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.820]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.100]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.760]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.620]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:32.620]

[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:33.800]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:33.800]

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:33.800]

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:33.800]

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:33.800]

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:33.800]

[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.080]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.040]
I'm in pain.

[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.160]
What's the use of saying that being so begins with during puts into holiness.

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.160]

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.160]

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.160]

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.160]

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.740]
And then I think I should find out,

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.840]
I should find out by Uhh....

[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:54.960]
Whatever is the reason that you should take the lesson of repentance to not fool you

[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.500]
minutes. But when the Pope shows up, oh my God, there's going to be angels singing in the world is

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.960]
going to like us, start spinning around like at 78 RPM and people are going to have a nervous breakdown.

[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.680]
And there's Bush and the Pope. Bush and Alora, welcome to the White House.

[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.120]
We welcome you with the ancient words commanded by Saint Augustine.

[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.900]
Potspego. Potspego. You hear he's already picking on the Faggot. Potspego.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.520]
Well, he's got the right one.

[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.120]
Godfather, that's what they're serving for lunch, Faggot.

[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.440]
They still make that? Faggot? Soda Pop.

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:38.420]
Have a soda pop. 640 votes in a pool. Most exciting, praying sports and leaning, I hate sports

[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:45.320]
115. Now, do we correct that? The sulky crack. Stealing home at a boy or a exe, he's on top of it.

[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.720]
And about to Eric sends me an email maybe even during the break about that fact I just read about

[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.640]
routers don't go bad. Even my engineer that was here before he agreed with me that they do funky

[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.380]
things and that they don't last all that long. All isheans wear out. Yeah.

[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.540]
And routers sooner than most, for whatever reason, I don't know why, because I don't know damn thing about

[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.720]
them. I don't pretend to know. I know how to hook them up though. I know how to hook up the name

[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.320]
all the stuff in here. I'm doing this is a do-it-yourself studio. When those dead in CDX went bad,

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:19.020]
who ordered the new ones and hooked them up? I did. Am I right? When the power packed the

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.000]
backup power was going out and starting to chirp and burp and fart, who ordered the new one and

[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.760]
hooked it up and paid for it I did. When the facts machines are going out, I don't want to start

[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.480]
panting myself on the back to art because then I'll breath. I'll puke all over the place, but it's

[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.520]
just all these experts. Oh, you're, I'll send in the Brooklyn Bridge, Neil. Yeah, for the 100 bucks

[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.120]
extra. Suppose I did pay a night. Eric says they're routers for 19 bucks, but they're crap.

[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.640]
They're crap. That's right. They're cheap routers and of course cheap. That's what this guy is,

[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.100]
this A plus N plus, yeah. A plus A whole.

[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.620]
What's your biggest name? The best talent. You're his real largest sport radio 5.

[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.620]
60 K.A.M. The sports leader.

[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.320]
The bandit.

[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.320]
The temperature is zero.

[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.120]
It is cold.

[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.380]
It is so freaking cold.

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.680]
And I cringe every time the wind blows.

[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:29.460]
In my pants, something is shrinking.

[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.520]
I'm so cold I can't lip-sync.

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.880]
Let's be cosy, dear, oh baby.

[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.720]
And I cannot feel my toes.

[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.020]
There's a tingling in my fingers.

[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.820]
And my pride that parts are fruits.

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.600]
Oh, my nose is about to fall.

[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.200]
There's a cloud every time that I call.

[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.220]
And my hands are blue.

[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.400]
They are turning on.

[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.500]
They might have you take my thumbs.

[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.160]
All right.

[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.300]
Let's be cosy, oh baby.

[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.680]
I can barely move my mouth over.

[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.980]
I'm a red heart like the lover.

[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.760]
Oh, great boy.

[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.200]
But first I need to be thought out.

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.580]
And that's because it's real.

[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.880]
I said, feel, I said, feel.

[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.500]
1046, 14 before love boys, you haven't played that in a long time.

[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.300]
So Eric has found because this guy is so persnickety that's any of that jackass facts.

[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.380]
He found the same router for 91 bucks now.

[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:22.940]
Okay.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.820]
But by the time I would pay customs and shipping up to here,

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.380]
it would probably be worth the same amount.

[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.520]
But if we make that guy happy, I'll buy the one for 90 bucks.

[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.620]
Oh, you're still getting ripped off.

[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.400]
I'm not sure Eric is getting 80 bucks to that.

[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.060]
Oh, great.

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.560]
Kick back.

[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.560]
Right, that's right. He's kicking it back.

[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.620]
So there was no follow-up facts from this jackass.

[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:42.320]
No.

[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.560]
Have you given me instructions on life?

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.860]
I hate people like that.

[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.820]
No matter what you know or what you say, they know better.

[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.620]
What doesn't mean that sometimes we can't be wrong.

[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.360]
All of us can be wrong sometimes George.

[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.160]
Yeah.

[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.060]
You know what I mean?

[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.580]
Yeah.

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.700]
Like, uh,

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.460]
Look at Brass, he sleeps with the fish.

[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:58.900]
Like that.

[00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.600]
All the time.

[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.420]
Margaret Kimberley on this working team says,

[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.320]
Pope Benedict go home and I say amen.

[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.620]
To bring Bernstein.

[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.720]
Bring another man.

[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.700]
Bring another candle.

[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.180]
Right here and put everybody into ovens and yeah,

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.500]
miserable old creep.

[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.480]
Oh, he's talking about the Holy Father, yeah.

[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.020]
Another guy in a dress.

[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.960]
Margaret says,

[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.540]
Why would American media politicians and average citizens welcome a Hitler youth member

[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.640]
who personally work to ensure Bush's reelection

[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.700]
and who openly praised the genocide conducted against American Indians?

[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.380]
If the man in question becomes Pope,

[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.360]
it obviously doesn't matter what he says or does.

[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.100]
Otherwise, sensible people suddenly act like a literate mediaeval peasants

[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.560]
and fight to kiss his ring.

[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.560]
Benedict XVI will make his first visit to America's Pope this week,

[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.580]
since his elevation in 2005,

[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.160]
Benedict has proven himself to be among the worst most

[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.660]
retrograde Pope's in modern times,

[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.200]
worse even than his predecessor, John Paul the tooth.

[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.080]
John Paul's iconic Pope will be on international visits,

[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.560]
given the appearance of a warm and cuddly spiritual leader.

[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.560]
Yet he was every inch of politician and a right wing wanted that.

[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.880]
John Paul personally and forcefully opposed the liberation theology movement that swept

[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.440]
Latin American the 70s and 80s.

[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.200]
Colonel Joseph Rantziger, now Benedict XVI, was just like his boss.

[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.160]
His head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith which used to be called the Inquisition,

[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.880]
Rantziger crushed all efforts to question church authority to promote leftist political activity,

[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.840]
notice God's right-wiler, Rantziger forced Father Leonardo Bough,

[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.360]
Father of the Liberation Theology to return to a monastery,

[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.620]
and shut up about liberating oppressed people.

[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.360]
Rantziger didn't confine his politics to Latin America in 2004,

[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.320]
George W. Bush asked the Vatican for help in his election campaign.

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.920]
Not all the American vishops are with me, he whined. Bush's wish was Rantziger's command,

[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.560]
Rantziger would letter to American vishops and instruct it into the Nye Communion,

[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.640]
the politicians who supported abortion rights.

[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.620]
This letter was written in 2004 when John Kerry, a pro-choice Catholic ran against Bush.

[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.180]
The communion controversy was just one of the ways in which the Kerry campaign

[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.720]
was weakened by the Bush administration's successful mobilization of conservative right Christians.

[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.080]
It is certain that no punitive politician will bring up this disgraceful activity when

[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.660]
Benedict visits Washington and New York.

[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]
If a foreign religious leader can work to keep a favorite American president in power

[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.900]
and never be reproached, then he's treated to deliver words of hate.

[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.340]
Since he became pro-Benedictist heathen's self-sufficient American Indians and Muslims

[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.400]
all over the world, he said that Christianity was not imposed on Indians because they were

[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:31.040]
secretly because they secretly longed for it. Rubbing salt into the gaping wound Benedict

[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.940]
added that worship of traditional Indian religions would be a step backward.

[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.640]
Not content to insult the Indians who survived the Holocaust and flicked it upon them by Europeans,

[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.360]
Benedict proved himself to be just as big an introred Muslims.

[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.200]
He quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor who said that the prophet Muhammad bought only

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.220]
evil and inhuman things to the world. Despite his blatant bigotry of Benedict,

[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.560]
he still treated with respect and admiration, it certainly is good to be the Pope.

[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.600]
The reading in Sismar's house on the grounds that sits table?

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.800]
How do you like that? It sounds like an old Jew with that thish matan. He said,

[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.880]
maybe he's getting ready for a Passover sater, huh?

[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.700]
But we'll have to know, you crazy old cout.

[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.600]
While European Asians were killing Indians, they also began to enslave

[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.660]
the Indians of Americans. The church put the full force of its authority behind slavery

[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.880]
from the earliest days of European incursions around the world. In 1455,

[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:25.580]
Pope Nicholas V gave permission to invade search out, capture bankushans of do all sarsans,

[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.820]
and pagans of whatsoever, and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery.

[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.620]
What are sarsans? Sarsans? Yeah, Arab types. No!

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:40.740]
The church didn't stray from that point of view for centuries as late as 1866 the church said,

[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.800]
it is not contrary to the natural and divine law for a slave to be sold,

[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.700]
but it's changed or given. When Benedict visits Washington, he

[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.040]
seen New York City who will say be massed before huge crowds, and politicians will sharpen

[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.520]
elbows and call in favors in order to be seen with him. No one has asked him to apologize for the

[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.720]
church's past support of these genocides or for his own hate speech. Unlike Jeremiah,

[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.380]
right who spoke truthful words, Benedict will be lionized for telling lies for justifying centuries

[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.580]
of atrocities because the perpetrators look like him. Catholics are not the only Christian

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.920]
denomination to justify genocide and enslavement, America's true national religion manifests

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.320]
destiny in white privilege, has very old and very deep roots. They start with the premise that

[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.280]
Europeans have the right to claim foreign lines as their own and killed by and sell human beings.

[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.300]
Most Americans, regardless of denomination of religious affiliation, see nothing wrong with

[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.700]
Pope Benedict's racism. That's why he'll be welcomed with open arms, the German-born ruler of

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:37.880]
the Vatican may be very American after all. Hey, let's hear it from Papa, the Pope is smoking a big fat one.

[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.140]
Listen to the property, there's one butcher standing near applauding, your president,

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.420]
and another butcher just sat down on his old pimpley ass. Sound like he was talking, but I Jewish

[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.360]
accent didn't it? It's not like it to me. It did. Who the hell are you kidding, Pops?

[00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:00.220]
God. By the way, do you hear a buzz saw sound effect? No. Okay, because the DCS computer in

[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.220]
here is about to blow up. So if you hear an explosion, that's what it is. Well, that's not good.

[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.980]
No, I know. What do you mean it's a bad idea? I emailed George Corso like it's the fan, I think,

[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:17.520]
not being a technical guy, making some fan kind of noises, like a buzz saw kind of a sound effect.

[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:23.440]
Hey, let's say that's the fan noise. So he does a fan will quit and then it'll be quiet or the

[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.540]
computer will blow up. Well, that's not bad. I was just talking to our engineer here before,

[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:33.020]
who is one of the real engineer, about the DCS, that's my only concern in the student,

[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.020]
another son, another 400 year extension of my contract. Right. And he said, well, you know,

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.220]
it's already outlived. It's in other words, any day. Any day, right? Same for this one here.

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.160]
Well, what happens then? What do we do then? I mean, I got a lot of stuff on the regular computer,

[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.820]
but not nearly what we have on the DCS, as you know. That's the main library.

[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.320]
That's the question, the heart. The question was, what do we do then?

[00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.240]
Punt. What word was that? Oh, punt with the pain. Now, you have a...

[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:06.940]
You're calling me names again. I presume, based on nothing, that your DCS is actually two computers,

[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.560]
you have a primary and then one that backs it up. I'm just presuming that.

[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.220]
What do you mean by that? Up there in your studio, you have a DCS computer.

[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.840]
Another... It backs it up. I don't think so. Ah, well, then maybe we should talk to someone about...

[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.520]
Is that a big one sitting on a floor there? Maybe we should.

[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.860]
Maybe we should talk to someone about having a backup system for your DCS, because once it's

[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.880]
gone, it's gone. Yeah. If you're a hard drive, it should become...

[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.120]
And they don't make it anymore. Right, no, but the problem is the hard drive.

[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.660]
If you're a hard drive, it becomes corrupted. That's it for that library there.

[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.280]
Have to ship you one of these hard drives. It's the hard.

[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.320]
I know if you have an extra one there somewhere.

[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.220]
Yes. We have a floor. My work fan crisis is in there.

[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.900]
We're backed up. I mean, they all get used up. We have a backup system here, like you should have up there.

[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.860]
I don't think so. I could start making a list.

[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:04.000]
No, don't, not now. Listen, don't start making a list because now that's money that's going to come off that big increase.

[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.140]
Okay, like I said, everything's fine. Everything is great.

[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.260]
There's no version. There's no version. There's no version.

[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.840]
Start, start, start, start, start.

[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.880]
I choose those. Go stepping on. Oh, my God. What kind of crap.

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.280]
This is your government at work. This guy isn't a leader. I mean,

[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.920]
world leader, he's the leader of the Vatican for quite a lot. It's a religious bunch of crap.

[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.440]
But oh no. We have to, everything has to come to a screeching halt because the Pope is here,

[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.440]
and there are going to be millions of young people out there.

[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:45.200]
Oh Papa Papa because they've been brainwashed from the 10-day world enough to say they make gurgling sounds

[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.540]
Look at this

[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:57.940]
It's a long time ago. I'm a different I couldn't watch it. I changed it a long time ago

[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.160]
Graded with a 21 gun salute

[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:03.660]
No

[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:10.420]
Oh, oops. Yeah, 670 votes on the pull Chris. What do you think and we got a outside shot at a thousand during the show?

[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.980]
We sure has a hell better get one

[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.880]

[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.960]
Any questions?

[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.360]
If you're one of the millions of people who've been praying to hear the Pope singing on his own CD your prayers have been answered

[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:12.680]
Now through a special arrangement with the Vatican his holiness is back and he's singing better than ever on the Pope's sing

[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:19.200]
He's the only to introduce myself by name is Pope John Paul

[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.600]
Yes, it's Pope John Paul the second singing songs that will lift you up and make you get down

[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.400]
He's turned around and starting to play that organ music choir boy

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.060]
Play that organ music right

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.680]
Play that organ music choir boy

[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:44.740]
Play that organ music to my life

[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.060]
This might be so

[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:51.160]
The Pope sings gives you the chance to hear the many sides of the owner of the Pope's wheel

[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.380]
On the other of the Pope's wheel

[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.460]
My child and the owner of the stool

[00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:00.640]
And he's the bottom and on this CD he's the boss

[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.800]
You should be playing finger

[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.340]
You should not go me camping and get that judge

[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.480]
Play high stakes if you want to

[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.640]
You're helping to fool if you lose your shorts or come out and play finger

[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.560]
Beep beep beep beep beep

[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.260]
Be a bean please

[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.540]
Oh 69

[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.820]
I try to do

[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:36.100]
For the minute, chief, so Pope sings as a bit of a mile and a special introductory prize

[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.500]
Get it and save yourself

[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.220]
Buy dollars. It's a one right to speak of that

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:44.480]
So I can't order that one for a 90 bucks for the $20 rebate because they won't ship to Canada

[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.220]
Poor Eric. He's trying I think I could probably go to like a future shop or best buy one of those

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:54.340]
Walk in the door and buy me your cheap router right right not real cheap, but a good one medium cheap

[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.400]
And then that's right medium cheap kind of like QAM real real cheap medium

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.340]
That's what we are wearing real cheap medium they hard find I'm very proud of routers. They're not hard to find

[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.500]
Probably get one of the gas station probably probably right out of the Chinese market

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.800]
The convenience store

[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:14.900]
680 on the pool

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.720]
We need to get the 800 by a new owner you're not gonna make your thousand. I'm telling you that right now

[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.860]
So they better really they better put on some heavy-duty pressure on that pool. So the people

[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.880]
Yeah, there's Chris giving you the big push. We got a pull for tomorrow

[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.880]
Oh, it's an old one. We are doing it again. That's all right

[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.760]
And the pope they got a special room there in a west wing with all the young altar boys really young and really fun

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.860]
I don't want to say hung

[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.280]
Also, that for the pope just like Cardinal Spellman in New York they used to like have a limousine that would bring him

[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.360]
The boy to the back of the rectumry

[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.660]
Are you aware of that?

[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.780]
You've mentioned that before first name was Francis Francis Cardinal Spellman

[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.760]
Would you show me a guy named Francis other than maybe Francis? Oh here and I'll show you

[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.880]
Well, the next one contended Barack Obama has wiped out his democratic rival Hillary Clinton's yawning lead in Vienna

[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.480]
And preels by just five points in Pennsylvania according to a new pool. Yes, Tchard Day

[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:14.480]
Ahead of the quench Pennsylvania primary next Tuesday the LA Times Bloomberg poll suggested that Obama has not suffered

[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.760]
Overly from his description of working class voters as bitter as if

[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:25.500]
The poll gave the former first lady a lead of a bomb over Obama 46 to 41 in Pennsylvania down from double-vigied margins in earlier polls

[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.600]
And also had her losing in both indian and north-thirland in which both vote on May 6th

[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.060]
Stick a fork at her. She's done well done

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.660]
She don't want to get the message which he's done finito

[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:41.500]
Unless of course like I said yesterday they come up with some way to make sure that he don't uh get in

[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.840]
Nothing would surprise me even that. You know what I mean? Yep

[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.960]
Analyst say Clinton needs a thumping victory in Pennsylvania next week to persuade democratic Hillary is known as super delegates

[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.460]
What was that? Thumping

[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:02.820]
The persuadant democratic luminary is known as super delegates that Obama who leads an overall delegate count is unelectable against John McCain

[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.840]
Like Pennsylvania

[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.660]
Indiana's a rust belt state full of the kind of blue collar voters that have formed the bedrock of sweltery support

[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:12.580]
Another poll released Monday by survey USA gave her a 16-poinley there but

[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:20.600]
The LA Times pool conducted from Thursday to Monday at the height of the bitterfuerre had Obama ahead in Indiana 40 to 35 over swallery

[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.480]
The LA Times pool also had Obama up 13 points in North Carolina

[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:33.920]
Other surveys also suggest the man bidding to be the first African-American president will benefit from the southern states' large number of black democratic voters

[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:41.060]
Another poll by Quinnipiac University out earlier yesterday a Clinton leading Obama in Pennsylvania by only six points 50 to 44

[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:46.840]
Oh

[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:53.000]
I thought maybe this was going to be a follow-up thanks from the self-appointed maven the expert who wants to sell me the Brooklyn bridge the router expert

[00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:00.440]
Yeah, what's your claim to fame? Oh, I'm a router expert. It's like, you know, I played golf all my life. I'm a great golfer. I'm a router expert

[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.400]
Ron says don't enjoy your show glad to have you around for five more

[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.400]
Did you happen to look at the central jica blog? Yeah, I read it on the area yesterday

[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.480]
Couple of comments call out time and away he's changed his tune in your possibility of success

[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.220]
Yeah, I read the comments too and I keep in mind Ron the people are right the comments most of them are

[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.600]
All our time never did the right of calm suggesting, you know

[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.100]
I saved that for a long time that when he wrote when I came up here six seven years ago

[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.560]
Oh, how is he going to keep it touched with South Florida? It's going to be a real challenge. Well somehow I've done it

[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.040]
Just like during the hurricane during Katrina man we we had great coverage on that from here

[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.980]
Because I wasn't losing the power and I had the internet and I had the CNN and I had everything

[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:47.260]
So seems like time is also very thin skin quite funny though. You should take a look already saw it Ron

[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.720]
You should take a look see what I mean

[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.920]
Already saw it and read it on the air run yesterday

[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:59.320]
And also try to put it on our website, but it didn't get on her for some reason. I sent that story to um

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.460]
Nucle nuts

[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.600]
Cornies

[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.560]
Nucle nuts never heard that one

[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.520]
Just made it up by the way that the fans stop making noise which could be a good thing or bad thing good

[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:20.780]
And it's still working try to these years. No, it's still working. Well, you want to hear us a sound effect? Oh look at this

[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.320]
Here's another great fool. Yeah, yeah

[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.160]
I knew you'd like that

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.660]
Oh

[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:33.880]
What is you know Charlie Charlie B would be so impressed by this what is the best sub or sandwich of all time oh

[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:43.320]
And it's got Ruben Rachel Cuban Ruben Cuban Philly Cheese steak hero Italian anico's on

[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.360]
rake

[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.360]
Sandwiches and sandwiches. What's the favorite kind of bread you like?

[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.640]
Ribbread, Papa Nickel white bread

[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.400]
Wonder bread that'll make your body croak 80 different ways or however that many that is

[00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:01.280]
My god, I went speaking to that. I got a strip of vitamins my kid. Yeah

[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.540]
Really yeah, I take what every day every day. I mean here's a quit uh-oh

[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.980]
Taking antioxidants like vitamins A and E which I do every day to prolong life may actually have the opposite effect new research

[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.840]
Is fun. How do you like that? I?

[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.320]
Quit taking those vitamins cold just like Oprah

[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.420]
She'd never touched another piece of meat

[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.120]
I'm not gonna say that yeah well

[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:33.080]
I'm aware 67 studies involving more than 230,000 people found no convincing evidence that the vitamins prolonged life

[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.720]
Even more beta-carotene vitamin A and vitamin E seem to increase mortality

[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.840]
According to researchers. I'm dying of it. Yes correct

[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.940]
However other health specialists said the research was flawed and supplements were safe to take

[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:54.760]
The review published by the Cochrane collaboration involved trials on beta-carotene vitamin A vitamin C vitamin E and selenium which I also take

[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.000]
The experts said the studies involved different doses of each antioxidant a total of 232,000 people were involved

[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:08.480]
47 trials included 180,000 plus people why did they keep throwing in numbers and had a low risk of bias

[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:15.020]
And these trials with low risk of bias the antioxidant supplements significantly increased mortality the reports authors wrote

[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:21.080]
When the different antioxidants were assessed separately and low risk of bias trials included in selenium excluded vitamin E

[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.620]
Was linked to a 16% increased risk of dying

[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:31.620]
Beta-carotene to a 7% increase and vitamin E to a 4% increased risk. However, there was no significant detrimental effect caused by vitamin C

[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.360]
So those of you who are taking your vitamins every day. I don't know

[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.220]
See you never know what to believe right this line is pauling and all I crap

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:43.200]
Well, if you take enough vitamin C to make you have wild diarrhea, it's gonna be real good for you know

[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.900]
That doesn't make your your pee fluorescent

[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.060]
Does it really yeah, I had no fluorescent green then goes in the dark

[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:57.640]
I take vitamin E every once E or C it's C but it's a lot of it and it'll make it neon neon green

[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:03.660]
P and neon yeah, we found the evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention

[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:09.760]
Beta-carotene vitamin A and E given singly were combined with other antioxidant supplements significantly increase mortality

[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:10.960]
well

[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.260]
There was no evidence C increased longevity though

[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.740]
selenium tends to reduce mortality, but only when high risk high bias risk trials were considered

[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.720]
Accordingly, we need more research on vitamin C and selenium

[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.860]
tend to reduce mortality seen other words, it might be good for you. I think it every day

[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.180]
growing

[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.420]
Ben

[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.440]
How have you said?

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.180]
Vellicovic

[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.760]
It was any researcher cared off the new

[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.100]
Review at Copenhagen University in Denmark

[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:44.300]
Totally a press association we could find no evidence to support taking antioxidant supplements to reduce the risk of dying earlier and health people and healthy people are patients with various diseases

[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.320]
The findings of our review showed that if anything people in trial groups give the antioxidants

[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:53.740]
Beta-carotene vitamin A and vitamin E showed increased rates of mortality. They were all screaming

[00:55:55.100 --> 00:56:05.080]
Packed for culfur nutritionists who's formulated some supplements for the firm biocare told press cockin that ca-

[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.320]
No one in Brit the lower one is any a stichop

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:08.860]
Yeah, I don't know

[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.700]
Antioxidants are not meant to be magic bullets and should not be expected to under a lifetime of unhealthy habits

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.460]
All for it said but when used properly

[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.400]
In combination with eating a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables

[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.000]
Getting plenty of exercise and not smoking any accident supplements can play an important role in maintaining and promoting health overall

[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.780]
Dr. Michele Savler the health food manufacturers association said the analysis was flawed

[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.580]
Well, of course, she would say they want to put a whole bunch of vitamins

[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.480]
Healthy consumers can still feel confident they can safely take their antioxidant supplements

[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:41.240]
She said based on what based on she said it and they want to sell a lot of stuff to make a lot of money

[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.140]
Well, I don't know what to do about that. What is that?

[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.420]
I'm going to continue a lot. I'm going to keep taking them

[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.220]
Considering, you know, the evil all the crap that I eat and no exercise. Although I do a lot of walking

[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.900]
Right, what's thinking about the yesterday just walking from the parking lot when I drive to woodline? Which I do a lot

[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.740]
Uh, and I did win yesterday again by the way 900 bucks Chris oh

[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.120]
I

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.860]
Walking from the apartment logist into the inference and walking around inside

[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.680]
That's for walking that I do just in one visit that I would do in a whole year in Florida, right?

[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.260]
Were you gonna walk in Florida? I don't around the house

[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.860]
Around a block

[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:20.280]
Sure, no sidewalks up. I mean, oh today is the Pope's 81st birthday. Where you know what? I still say a hubman drew

[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.720]
The best

[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.120]
That house

[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:46.880]
Yeah

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.340]
Jesus, please stop back.

[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.760]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:04.260]

[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:04.560]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:04.600]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:04.640]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.320]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.320]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.520]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.500]
Jesus, please stop back.

[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.660]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.580]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.340]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.060]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.700]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.720]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:00.760]
Jesus, please stop.

[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.260]
Ah, yeah, oh, yeah.

[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:10.340]
Ah, yeah, the thousandth dot.

[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.420]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.900]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.120]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.540]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.020]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:22.920]

[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.260]
The whip at getting higher.

[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.720]
The Country seas in the grass.

[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.000]
the world's best.

[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.520]
He likes his token ass.

[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.600]
The world's best.

[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.160]
He's a good way to ask.

[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.280]
The world's best.

[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.420]
The world's best.

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.060]
The world's best.

[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:40.260]
The world's best.

[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.260]
The world's best.

[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.080]
The world's best.

[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:43.660]
The world's best.

[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.780]
It's been said that the down's got 100 and seven.

[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.320]
This is 24 in the pink.

[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.280]
4 in the green.

[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.120]
You want to do it?

[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:58.880]
No.

[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.040]
A point I joined QNM today from moon to one from a Marlon ticket hit.

[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:03.820]
A ticket hit.

[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.780]
Ticket ticket ticket.

[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.520]
Maybe that's what these guys ought to do instead of sitting around on their ass all day.

[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:11.020]
Go across the street and make a ticket hit.

[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.680]
I'll let Joe Feinberg in there anymore.

[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.880]
Stop by the Hooters location at Pines in University and get free tickets to see your Florida Marlins.

[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.280]
Take on a braves.

[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.400]
Although it doesn't say what day.

[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.200]
I know they're playing in this series.

[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.040]
Is that for tonight?

[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.840]
I guess so because they're playing today and tomorrow.

[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.880]
Who knows? I don't know because it doesn't say so.

[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.800]
Hurry because once they're gone, they're just gone.

[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.540]
And I'm sure there'll be people lined up for blocks for miles from here to Uranus.

[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.360]
For those three Marlon tickets because they're free.

[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]
That's from moon to one.

[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.140]
Look for the what's going to be there.

[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.160]
I give up the QNM van.

[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.420]
The Humper.

[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.320]
The Humper?

[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.100]
Well, one of my in my space people rick confuses me even more.

[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.480]
It says, PSI, I hope I didn't confuse you with all the technical talk.

[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.960]
Well, of course you did. Rick has a manidian.

[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.720]
It says you can have a wireless router and give it to all the cables running around.

[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.620]
I didn't in my house. George was half right.

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.640]
They're used for wireless devices, but you can hook up your computers as well.

[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.800]
All you will need is a wireless card installed.

[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.920]
Any two of you desktop computers you want to hook up.

[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.700]
Well, there's only two.

[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.580]
Well, duh.

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.360]
If you put a wireless card in your computer then it becomes a wireless device.

[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.760]
When you stick it, if you put a wireless card up your butt then you become a wireless device.

[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.800]
Oh, sure. When you stick it in the back it's in your desktop.

[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.540]
It has all these module slots in it.

[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:38.740]
You have to open up the computer and install it.

[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.500]
Yes, past it.

[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:46.360]
Just remember to pass it and protect your wireless router so nobody else can hook up by using your internet connection.

[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.580]
By the way, it says that prices a lot for a router.

[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.100]
142 bucks.

[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.900]
Well, I can get it for 77 now, but they won't ship it here.

[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.760]
Because there's a $20 rebate.

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.020]
And it's going to be the Hummer and there will be tickets for both games.

[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.040]
It's the QM Humper is out there and tickets for the 9th and the Mara.

[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.700]
To see the Marlins, they want again.

[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.720]
Oh, yeah, everybody's all whipped up about the Marlins.

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.320]
Because somebody's hoping we got a half way decent team, even though they know we won't.

[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.600]
Because what they're doing is slashing burn all the time.

[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.160]
Slashing burn cuts the payroll.

[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.560]
$21 million payroll.

[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.980]
Doesn't payroll make more than that all by himself?

[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.160]
Yes, he's making like 25.

[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:29.120]
When one player on another team is making more money than your whole payroll, that's probably not a good sign.

[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.180]
That's like comparing my current salary with the salaries of all the people across the street, put together.

[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.540]
Isn't that a good analogy?

[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.280]
I think so.

[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.180]
All right, times two.

[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.800]
Well, of course, now I'm talking about it now.

[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.660]
Oh, now next year, different story.

[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.980]
When I'm making 40 bucks a year and Georgia's getting the big bucks though next year.

[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.820]
He's going to have a sit down with Jolly Joe.

[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.680]
And they're going to like hammer out the fugula.

[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.780]
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of hammering mostly on my head.

[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.380]
That was funny.

[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.520]
Yeah, hysterical.

[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.720]
So go get your marlin tickets.

[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.600]
Okay, who's over there?

[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.340]
Flea.

[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.540]
I guess not because he just told us who?

[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.080]
Flea just told us that the specifics.

[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.940]
So I guess it's someone else.

[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.280]
Well, these people want to know who they're going to meet and greet when they go over there to uh...

[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.980]
Could leaders where they could be corn.

[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.900]
Rolly and Juan or Jaime Slanko.

[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.080]
Jaime, uh...

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.140]
Oh, there's the Pope and a present.

[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.340]
I wonder what kind of clientist and plans they're making, huh?

[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.880]
The face and having standard conversation.

[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.080]
Much more.

[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:34.920]
Candid conversation.

[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.180]
Somebody needs the smasher and a head with a two by four.

[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.480]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.100]
All these suck-ups in the media.

[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.380]
All they're having a candid conversation about what?

[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.500]
About child molesters?

[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.300]
About butchers who start wars and invade other countries?

[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.100]
About what?

[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.500]
Butchers of a feather stroll together.

[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.560]
Having a candid conversation.

[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.660]
All these bubble-headed bitches there on CNN and MSNBC.

[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.120]
I'll align them all up.

[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.680]
When did Thou take them up?

[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.880]
Except I've chewed one of them.

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.960]
How's that her? No.

[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.800]
What's the little like her? Is that her?

[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.480]
She's on a location in Blacksburg.

[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.500]
From really compassionate leaders?

[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.120]
Is that the blonde chick that's usually the anchor?

[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.080]
You're going to make me change it now?

[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.500]
Well, do you know the one I'm talking about?

[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:14.920]
Yes, no.

[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:15.640]
This Alice, right?

[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:16.840]
It'll be Drew.

[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.220]
What? Drew.

[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.640]
Drew, what?

[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.720]
Well, we're friendly neighborhood, uh, hand out guy.

[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.640]
I'm talking about somehow chick on TV and you're giving me a song to dance about.

[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.920]
Well, he was changed on channel.

[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.140]
Nobody cares Chris. Nobody cares.

[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.660]
Somebody might.

[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.860]
Well, they don't.

[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.780]
All they want is the free tickets.

[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.480]
They don't give a crap.

[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:47.140]
If they're like, uh, no matter who it is.

[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.820]
Isca Bibbel, if he's there, handed out the tickets.

[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.000]
They don't care.

[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.940]
If it's the ghost of Big Wilson, they don't care.

[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.320]
If it's Greg Reed's brother-in-law, they don't care.

[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.300]
720 votes. You're not going to make no thousand a day, Mr. No chance.

[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.020]
What are you talking about? I'm talking, honest.

[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.060]
What's the most exciting play in sports?

[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.540]
I hate sports, 124.

[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.760]
Hate it. Don't just dislike it.

[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.420]
I hate it. That's what George voted.

[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.520]
I did not.

[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.820]
You voted for one of these?

[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.520]
No, I was locked out. Somebody had already voted.

[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.180]
Oh, good.

[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.140]
Would have voted for the car crash or something like that.

[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.300]
It's not a plain sports.

[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.440]
It's on the pole.

[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.280]
So guess what?

[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.180]
I was voted for that.

[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.640]
Medigor toss. That's what I would have been for.

[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.040]
That's exciting.

[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.800]
I see a medicine for a guitar.

[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:33.800]
I see a medicine for a play in sports.

[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.660]
Yeah, I see a film of it. It's a thrill.

[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.360]
It's not a play in sports.

[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:38.880]
And I don't hate sports.

[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.340]
Kick return for touchdown on 19.

[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.580]
Hail Mary 69.

[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:43.880]
Holy Mother of God.

[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.160]
Blessed out, Thou much sinners.

[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.860]
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.800]
Play at the plate 55, buzzer beater 49.

[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:56.300]
Stretch run and thurbered racing 44, especially like a firmed in Aladar.

[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.320]
Or what was the other one?

[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.360]
Easy, easy gore.

[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.860]
And what was it?

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.920]
Sensational, spectacular bid.

[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.760]
No. Sunday silence.

[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.900]
Oh, we used to have that on a cart with Tom Durkin.

[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.420]
You can hear that his chair squeaking.

[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.280]
Because he's a big fat guy, Tom Durkin.

[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.620]
You can hear the chair actually squeaking on it.

[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.320]
Inside the park, home 141, goal line stand 39.

[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.960]
Knockout punch 30, fold.

[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.400]
Breakaway goal in 30.

[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.740]
I ain't hockey 30.

[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.420]
Yeah.

[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.240]
Stockhart crashed 28.

[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.240]
Pemily shot 22.

[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.500]
There's too many choices on here.

[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.060]
Suicide squeeze 18.

[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.820]
Five on three.

[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080]
Pemily kill 13.

[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.140]
Manitour toss 11.

[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.300]
Stealing home 8.

[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.580]
Heter goal in soccer 7.

[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:44.960]
Shootout 6.

[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:45.960]
Alupe 3.

[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.040]
Salky crash 3.

[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.140]
And fast break 1.

[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.640]
Salky crash my ass.

[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.580]
That's just not a playing sports.

[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.480]
It's an accident.

[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.220]
That's like saying, all the most done like the stock car thing.

[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.140]
For example, what's the most exciting thing you see all day?

[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.720]
Oh, bad car crash when a whole bunch of people get killed like that.

[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.480]
You know, a bus in a van like that.

[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.600]
And then that's exciting.

[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.140]
Sean.

[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.600]
Salky crash.

[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.900]
This is a man who obviously is the hardest racing expert at a Fissiano.

[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.680]
And you've been falling down on the job today.

[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.700]
We haven't had much race talk.

[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:18.840]
Well, it's big numbers.

[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.200]
And now is the trick right here.

[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.340]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:21.800]
Let me go back.

[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.180]
I don't know.

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.180]
I'm looking at some ugly queen on the HPI and the racing network.

[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.120]
Because I think it's the one that we were talking about before.

[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.340]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.740]
Yeah, she looks just like intern Shannon.

[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.440]
She's beautiful.

[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:31.900]
She is a lover.

[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.320]
Former intern Shannon, I should say.

[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.920]
Yeah, the one that used to do a crotch on the floor a lot with you hovering over her ass.

[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:37.420]
Yeah.

[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.360]
What's your point?

[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.500]
You gave her a lot of ass assignments.

[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.200]
That's my point.

[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:41.560]
That's right.

[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.580]
She took right to them.

[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:43.600]
Evidently.

[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.700]
Well, that's George Boyman.

[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.600]
He's a afflanderer and a whatever.

[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.320]
And that's why he's sick all the time.

[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:50.940]
What is it?

[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.200]
The best talent.

[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:52.780]
Boyman.

[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.720]
The project is 4.560 km.

[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.660]
The fourth leader.

[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.220]
Holy Makin'on.

[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.860]
This is Joe Bourne, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.800]
And you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God.

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.420]
Well, I was shopping at the store for some food.

[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.580]
Buying groceries never felt so good.

[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.920]
To that, I didn't know my credit was waxed.

[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.740]
Nor security was breached in the database.

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.420]
Got a CRAP that spells me.

[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.540]
My credit is crap.com, baby.

[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.980]
I'm as crude as I can be.

[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.980]
Not about killing myself, baby.

[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.880]
Now instead of eating, I'm getting fat.

[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.920]
My identity was stolen and now my life is this crap.

[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.000]
CRAPE that spells me.

[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.980]
My credit is crap.com, baby.

[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.720]
All right, 1131 at 560, nobody QAM.

[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.220]
Guess what, Mr. President?

[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.020]
Well, we have to take some causes, half hour.

[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.120]
Okay?

[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.320]
56670560, 0560, 0560, in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.640]
George has been after a bunch of them up there

[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.900]
because my router is dead here.

[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.920]
And I don't have my other computer working in handles

[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.980]
the internet for the phone.

[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:51.820]
Right.

[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.640]
So as a result, George will punch them up.

[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.360]
But he can handle it.

[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:55.840]
It's right.

[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.720]
We would have the thing here if, of course,

[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.440]
or whoever got in touch with our Toronto engineering

[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.660]
would have said, you know, go ahead and pick one up

[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.260]
and put it in new router.

[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.180]
Because that's what he said.

[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.680]
The first thing that came to his mind was,

[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.700]
and why would that be the first thing he came to his mind

[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.720]
if routers don't go bad?

[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.500]
Of course, that jacket is as stupid as the facts.

[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.740]
The really, really stupid idiotic facts.

[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.820]
The dollar sank to an all-time low against the Euro today

[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.400]
with US inflation coming in three times as high as expected

[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.900]
and March on top of escalating food and energy prices.

[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.080]
Well, the inflation is, how come the market is up?

[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.560]
Can you answer that question?

[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:33.940]
I give up.

[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:34.840]
Look at that.

[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.980]
The S&P is up 19.

[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.420]
That I was up 184.

[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:38.480]
Woo!

[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.460]
And oil is up a whole over $113 a barrel again.

[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.620]
Inflation also rose overseas in the Euro reached $159.66,

[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.020]
almost $1.60.

[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.100]
After the EU's statistical agency, EuroStat,

[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.900]
said that anyone inflation rose on higher prices

[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.820]
for transport fuel, heating, dairy products and bread

[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.920]
was the quickest increase in 16 years.

[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.140]
The Euro surprised its previous record of $159.12, said April 10.

[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.880]
The Euro rose because inflation overseas was likely muffled calls

[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.820]
for the European Central Bank to lower its interest rate from 4%.

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.140]
The bank's primary mission is to combat inflation.

[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.180]
Well, thank you, Mr. President, and the British pound

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.360]
which slipped to the end of series of Dow economic reports

[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.240]
climbed back to $1.97.62, almost two bucks, almost double.

[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.400]
Wow.

[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.020]
Thanks for that great American dollar, Mr. President,

[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.880]
there was low gas prices and at low price of oil

[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.520]
that's destroying the economy all around the world.

[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.400]
Thank you, thank you, and your Saudi buddies.

[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.720]
See, he hangs out with all the crooks, all the criminals,

[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.440]
the Pope, the Saudis, all of these criminal bastards.

[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.560]
But the only father who is here in the EU, you don't understand.

[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.440]
It means so much here. Why is that?

[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.100]
Why does it mean anything?

[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:47.720]
I don't know.

[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.740]
The fact that he's here, we ought to put him on trial

[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.720]
for crimes against humanity, things like that.

[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.940]
You can imagine all the people, all the unwanted babies

[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.140]
that are crawling around on the unfed, unwanted babies.

[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:00.920]
Right.

[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.740]
And all the people with AIDS and other diseases

[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.780]
because of the Vatican, the condemns, condoms, they condemn condoms.

[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.920]
They're rich and they take money from poor people.

[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.080]
What else do you need to know besides the whole?

[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.140]
Well, today I'm going to take the hour risk,

[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.240]
because then they can pay off all those people they used to be rich

[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.260]
until they had to pay off hundreds of millions

[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.660]
and maybe a couple of billion dollars to settle all those lawsuits

[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.240]
against those people that were abused by the church.

[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.380]
There's one thing I've been trying to tell you people for years

[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:25.880]
is it's...

[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.240]
There's no signs in the church.

[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:27.640]
Right.

[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.740]
Like no mistake of booted.

[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.840]
You're not going to get your thousand even close today.

[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.920]
Boy, we are slip and bad.

[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.260]
We'll do it.

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.600]
747.

[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.260]
Great plane to fly, but not a really high total on the pull-out

[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.300]
1134 in the morning.

[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.240]
For his 847, I'd say no problem, no sweat.

[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.460]
But 747.

[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.100]
No chance.

[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.580]
No effing chance.

[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.300]
We'll see what we have again.

[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.240]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.480]
Just a lump.

[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.340]
You just sit there in that chair and say idiotic and anything.

[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.280]
That's what you do.

[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.640]
Well, you at least agree that the routers go bad.

[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.140]
Yes.

[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.820]
You would've got to tell me that.

[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:03.360]
Correct.

[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.800]
And Eric doesn't understand that first one.

[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.600]
He said, I'd be more than happy to pay 142 to Tiger.ca, whatever.

[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.680]
They won't ship it to somebody who's building addresses in the USA.

[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.540]
Building addresses has to be, I don't have no building address here.

[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.380]
I got a home address, but I got no building address.

[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:18.680]
Huh.

[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.320]
Huh, what?

[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.940]
Nothing, just acknowledging it.

[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.300]
So I should go on and just buy one, right?

[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.740]
That would be the quickest and easiest way to do it.

[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:27.900]
Right.

[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:28.320]
Production.

[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.720]
Go to your nearest best buy or whatever, even radio schlock hasn't.

[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.000]
Radio schlock?

[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:33.980]
Do they have those in Canadian?

[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:34.620]
Yeah.

[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.660]
Alright, well then.

[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.760]
They got a router.

[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.340]
Yeah, there's a radio check in the 8th and center.

[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:39.900]
It's a matter of fact.

[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.660]
Maybe I'll go stop by there and do a little eaten.

[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:42.140]
Sure.

[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.940]
At the eating center, maybe I'll go to bastard robins.

[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.980]
I just change your route a little bit.

[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:52.920]
And get a three school pot five Sunday with Rocky Road.

[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.560]
Oh God.

[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:55.980]
You sure you don't hear that?

[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.840]
No, I don't.

[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.640]
It says, quiet as a church mosque.

[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.280]
I hear nothing.

[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.560]
The line is as clean and silent.

[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.540]
It was starting up again.

[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.400]
Oh, it's starting up again.

[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.240]
When he's starting up again, it's just getting louder and louder.

[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:08.860]
Quite you told me.

[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.660]
Didn't he tell me a few minutes ago that it was quiet?

[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.200]
Well, yeah, they'd go to died, but then it came back.

[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:13.620]
No.

[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.680]
Look at that.

[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.480]
I can't hear it.

[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.200]
Cortus came in here.

[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.100]
He heard it from the other room.

[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.160]
Alright, here's what you do.

[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.380]
Turn it off and then turn it back on again.

[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:24.920]
I did.

[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.580]
All the files are going to have to reboot.

[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:27.680]
I already did that.

[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.000]
I already did that.

[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:29.660]
You already did that?

[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.140]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:30.940]
It came back quite hard.

[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.400]
I think I heard it.

[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.020]
After a little rest, it came back real loud.

[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:36.400]
Really?

[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.020]
It's going to blow up.

[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.480]
So, but you got a backup one there.

[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.340]
Right, no, we're not going to lose the files.

[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.480]
I'm just going to lose the ability to play things until they replace it.

[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.900]
What do you mean until they replace it?

[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.960]
This computer, you know,

[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.320]
until they swap it out with the other one.

[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.600]
So they get a computer that works in here.

[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.880]
Assuming the computer blows up.

[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.900]
But they don't make those anymore.

[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.100]
No, no, no.

[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.440]
The DCS is software.

[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.140]
You know, you can make it work with a computer.

[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.120]
You can?

[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:06.920]
Yeah.

[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:08.740]
Are you sure?

[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.600]
Pretty sure.

[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.960]
But if you lose the hard drive, you lose all the information on there, all the files.

[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.020]
The files are backed up on two other hard drives here in the US studios.

[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.820]
Oh, well, thank God.

[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.440]
I love it.

[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.320]
We got enough problems with something as simple as a little freaking router.

[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.080]
Have you got any calls on there or what?

[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:24.760]
Yeah.

[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:25.220]
Got some.

[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.340]
Points went up.

[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.040]
QA and hello.

[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:29.540]
You can go Andy.

[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.080]
Andy.

[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:30.840]
Okay, good.

[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.640]
QA and hello.

[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:33.740]
Hello.

[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:34.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:36.060]
Good morning, sir.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.400]
Will Simeiger from the Salvation Army and Homeless Shelter in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.360]
I have a question regarding former employment for a possible future resident.

[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.620]
Hank Goldberg.

[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.460]
No, sir.

[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:53.980]
Yeah.

[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.940]
I thought he was driving.

[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.520]
No, he thought he was very funny, obviously.

[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.880]
So the thing with Hank is at least he had the ESPN backup, which I'm sure he probably makes more for them than he was with us or whatever.

[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.000]
But he's okay.

[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.700]
And he can do some ESPN radio and other stuff.

[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.660]
With me, this is it.

[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:18.320]
And I started to say the other day and I should have finished the story, but I got it kept interrupting myself.

[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.500]
This whole thing was handled so badly as you recall those really ugly days back in December and early January.

[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.020]
When I was on the ripping them and asked every day.

[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.880]
And I mean, it was because I was under the impression that they basically didn't want to renew.

[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.240]
They didn't want me to stick around.

[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.200]
They were like the Humper.

[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.300]
They wanted him out.

[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.780]
So they kept making more and more insulting offers until he finally said, screw you in goodbye and all like that.

[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.360]
Because he's got some default back on.

[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.460]
So to speak.

[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.020]
Now, what's his name?

[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.040]
Steven Streewer here.

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.780]
Maybe I'd have something to fall back on.

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.980]
No, not back on.

[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:52.520]
Up around.

[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.100]
So that was that deal.

[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.100]
You got any more calls?

[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:56.640]
Yeah.

[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.460]
See, this is awkward without having to route it here so I can't look on the thing and see it for myself.

[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.580]
But that's the way it goes because our outfit is real, real cheap and all that.

[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.320]
Let's avoid that if we possibly can't.

[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.240]
We don't want to spend like, and if they are cheap like 70-rated books, what kind of money is that?

[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.400]
Like I wouldn't pay for it myself?

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.000]
Secure it and hello.

[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:14.460]
Hey, Neil.

[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.140]
How's it going?

[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.000]
All right.

[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.720]
Thanks for taking my call.

[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.520]
And me, sir, bro.

[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.160]
Hello.

[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.160]
And I'm listening.

[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.200]
Why would you ignore your policies?

[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.800]
You're no better reason of the show.

[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:27.740]
Yeah, okay.

[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.360]
What do you got for us?

[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:36.180]
Hey, do you know, do you have an idea how many, how many meters of dollars the government is paying for the bulk trip to come over here?

[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.340]
No, I don't.

[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:37.860]
I wish I did.

[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.380]
It would make me sick.

[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:39.600]
It would make me sick.

[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.440]
Why would they get the money and give it to the poor, you know?

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.040]
Yeah.

[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.320]
It's all I want to say.

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.360]
Okay.

[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.360]
Go to church to the son to ask him the same question.

[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520]
Why don't you get that money to the poor?

[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.000]
Would you get rid of him?

[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:52.960]
Oh, yeah.

[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.340]
I thought that was a cue.

[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.260]
He was a skew, all right?

[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.340]
Yeah, why did you turn your back on the callers?

[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.360]
Were they, yeah, you're the meat and potatoes of the show, right?

[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.020]
That'll be the day.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.440]
Even buddy, Holly ain't buying that.

[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.860]
Meat and potatoes, my ass.

[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:08.760]
God.

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.100]
Potatoes, maybe.

[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.580]
You know how much money do you owe us?

[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.460]
But I just get through San Edelow a while ago.

[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.820]
I was ranting and raving about that.

[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.020]
Yes.

[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.980]
But it's much more meaningful if they say it.

[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.580]
Over there, Supreme Court upholds Kentucky's lethal injections by a vote of seven or two.

[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.320]
All right.

[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.420]
Let's fry some people, buddy.

[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780]
Look at that needle.

[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.080]
The stick is out.

[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.380]
You know what he's saying, Roger?

[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.680]
Stick it.

[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.200]
Stick it.

[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.580]
You lay out the meat for its leader.

[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.220]
What's wrong with that?

[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.640]
Oh, Papa.

[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.500]
We like craving.

[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.440]
We like craving.

[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.040]
This is my life.

[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.040]
We saw these like craving you.

[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.560]
And don't you agree with me?

[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.300]
And what's nice is, with the oil price rises.

[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.420]
There's nothing you can do.

[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.980]
Not only you, Frank.

[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:06.520]
We got the way with the night of love ever, Frank.

[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.040]
And you bring this thing with us.

[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.400]
Our state on your fly, got it right.

[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.600]
So we keep craving.

[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.600]
We carry the play and the meat.

[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.500]
We saw these keep craving you.

[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.780]
And we've been craving.

[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.620]
And now you can craving.

[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:28.980]
Why not?

[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:33.340]
You do a fantastic smooth.

[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.700]
This is awesome.

[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.060]
It's amazing.

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.480]
It's a hell of a real raising.

[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.800]
This is my hand with all the ways of the food.

[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.940]
So keep on dreaming.

[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.800]
About alternative fuels will keep on streaming.

[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:59.660]
Today is an inch of youth, way night-raping.

[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.600]
You're a lesser playing and game thing.

[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.860]
For the head-wrap, ever-its-of-do-fire.

[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.220]
Bye-bye, 1146-14-115-60W-QAM.

[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.400]
Barack Obama picked up another celebrity endorsement today.

[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.040]
Singer values that turn very loosely.

[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.200]
Bruce Springsteen announced his support for Obama

[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.840]
and no posted to his website.

[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.440]
Do you think we'll do it?

[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:27.520]
Must.

[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.320]
The boss.

[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.180]
The boss.

[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.220]
Thanks for that faux-pah there.

[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.460]
The rocker became famous singing of his blue collar roots

[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.700]
and recent comments from Obama

[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.280]
that were portrayed by his opponents as Senate and the working Americans.

[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.480]
We're taking out a context.

[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.380]
He's speech to the America I've envisioned in my music for the past 35 years, Springsteen writes,

[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.580]
a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle new onsen complex problems,

[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.940]
a country that's interested in its collective destiny,

[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.280]
and then the potential of its gathered spirit.

[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.260]
Whatever all I've made.

[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.560]
Springsteen apparently is doing its supporting a bottle by Stephen Van Zant,

[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.320]
who plays guitar in the East Street band.

[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:11.280]
According to this report, Van Zant played concertiery Silvio Dothi in the sopranos,

[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.640]
refused to appear in Hillary Clinton's campaign ads,

[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.260]
hooking the HBO series last year.

[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:19.820]
It's unclear who East Street sacks player Clarence Clemens' backing,

[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.680]
but a recipe for his big man Oyster Stew was put in a cookbook for these five

[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.360]
Bill Clinton's presidential library, his big man Oyster Stew.

[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.280]
Whatever the hell all that crap means.

[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.180]
I don't know.

[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.100]
That's what it's all about, baby, a bunch of crap.

[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.320]
Forget about issues, forget about solving problems,

[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.760]
forget about really making any changes, just talk a lot of crap.

[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.240]
Go bowling, you know, who's got the better bowling score?

[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.660]
That is pretty weak though, 37 for 7 frames.

[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.160]
Yeah, huh?

[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.140]
Pretty weak.

[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.180]
Ain't it? Yeah it is.

[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.120]
Just like Chris' pool today, 775 oats at its almost noon,

[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.240]
not even close to 800 that you need.

[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.260]
There's the Pope again.

[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.100]
The fairs, I mean, Pope's are very well aware.

[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.100]
He looks like an old lady with a bad cap on.

[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.460]
With a cap on.

[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.300]
And he does have a cap on.

[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.380]
If they would dye his hair blue, he doesn't have a cap on the cap.

[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:16.700]
They know.

[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.260]
Probably, he probably is a cap on.

[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.260]
And slippery.

[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.620]
Don't talk about me that way.

[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.720]
Don't you hear my Jewish accent?

[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.740]
I'm not dreaming at all.

[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]
Okay, I got out of the way.

[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.800]
What about Oyster Stew?

[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.680]
He is really something, man.

[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.220]
I can't say the word on a ear.

[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.020]
Sure you can.

[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.880]
Supreme Court upheld can tell you, according to a Charlie B,

[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.580]
I can say it.

[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.240]
Oh, you hold, get him by the balls and you demand the fart sounds back.

[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.520]
I'm going to tell you something.

[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.980]
Those people who believe that demanding fart sounds was like assuming

[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.880]
there weren't any negotiations, what's there weren't.

[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.740]
But assuming there would have been, can you imagine me saying,

[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.240]
oh, well, I got to have the fart sounds back, but I'm not signing.

[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.240]
Can anybody, oh, with an IQ more than six,

[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.940]
even imagine such a thing?

[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.180]
I'd make a good story.

[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.300]
What's this thing you're faxing me now?

[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.840]
Oh, the best anticipated facts of the day.

[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:06.520]
Really?

[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:07.200]
Okay.

[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.480]
Here we go.

[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.040]
I got it.

[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.140]
Oh, here you go.

[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.900]
Router is don't go bad.

[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:15.820]
Rebuff.

[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.140]
Okay, Neil.

[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:18.120]
And it's a lot.

[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.800]
I mean, give a life.

[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.540]
I have no life.

[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:20.540]

[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.060]
First, excuse me for not knowing your setup or possible special needs.

[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.740]
Unless you're a multi-million dollar business protecting fear for hundred

[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.200]
computers from the constant hackers and virus writers, it looked for just that.

[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.140]
Big business.

[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.220]
You should eat nothing more than the average home user.

[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.080]
I assume you were only putting more than one computer on a wire, which a fifty-dollar

[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.120]
D-link will make sense.

[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:39.760]
We'll do this fine.

[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.260]
Well, that's what I got right now is a link to.

[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:41.660]
It's okay.

[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.880]
That's the one that burned out.

[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.220]
Piece of crap.

[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.740]
No, that's seven years.

[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.240]
That's pretty good.

[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.760]
Like I said, it lasted a good service the last of the seven years.

[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:51.720]
It's a great link to this one.

[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.020]
Why don't I get a new one just like this one?

[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.660]
At least I know where to stick all the things.

[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.020]
I can stick it in the ticket.

[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.700]
Second, go get my facts out of the garbage.

[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.880]
Temporary I said, I was a router expert.

[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:04.760]
That's your assumption.

[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.000]
No, you said you were a technical expert.

[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.100]
A plus and plus, D plus, F plus.

[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.920]
Also, look where I said they really go bad.

[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.680]
That was the heading under them.

[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.380]
And facts that routers don't go bad.

[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.600]
Okay, I admit if you can't update the firmware, then yes, you fall into this category.

[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.220]
I didn't just get you telling you the first facts that they don't go bad.

[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.240]
Wasn't that the big headline on the page of the facts?

[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.980]
routers don't go bad.

[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.220]
Maybe we were unasseted.

[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.860]
Maybe he was unasseted.

[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.460]
Maybe he was unasseted to the kid.

[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:37.920]
Ass.

[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:42.140]
I was only telling you, my ten years experience using these routers,

[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:47.180]
you actually think that D-Link and Lixis would still be in business with a good reputation by selling crappy $15 routers?

[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:47.960]
I think not.

[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.120]
These routers are probably 90% of all the networks and work great, home networks.

[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.700]
And you're welcome because it seems that since you read my facts that just pisses you off to no end,

[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.860]
all of a sudden it's $70, not $140.

[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:06.320]
So this guy talks just out of your ass, sir.

[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:12.060]
Out of your ass, there is a nasty gas coming out of your ass and it's on this page.

[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.900]
Also, my five-year-old kid can replace a battery pack rack up.

[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:16.860]
You put it on the flag.

[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.400]
I was joking about that.

[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.320]
Okay, this guy's an idiot.

[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.140]
You put it on the floor, plug it in, put it in the computer,

[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.180]
motor plugs in the protected side.

[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.460]
Yeah, you plug in two plugs.

[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.500]
That takes brains.

[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.140]
Glad you figured it out.

[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.020]
And what this guy doesn't understand is that most of the people in his business who do what I do wouldn't be able to do it.

[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.360]
Am I right?

[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:34.740]
Yes.

[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:35.220]
Yes.

[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:40.560]
And if you have very important information on a hard drive and don't have the brains to back it up,

[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.520]
that tells me how smart you aren't.

[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.820]
Because when it's gone, you know what they say, it's gone.

[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.060]
PS, congrats on your five-year extension on your contract.

[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.380]
You're still the best amp for hours on A and radio will continue to listen until I die.

[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.580]
Hopefully, that last part might be soon.

[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.320]
Because you obviously are a real hard ass.

[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:03.320]
I was joking about the fact that I plugged that thing and it's got two plugs that plug in the back and you plug it into wall.

[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.600]
Wow, what a concept!

[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.580]
And then it charges up and it's got a bad reason inside and what we do.

[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.460]
But at least when it started fluttering and puking, which I think that's when you were on vacation, wasn't it Chris?

[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.500]
I guess so, yeah.

[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.720]
At least I knew I better do something.

[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.020]
Okay, so Eric told me where to go, where to go online and buy it.

[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.300]
They delivered it the next day.

[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.100]
And there it is.

[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.180]
My God.

[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.160]
I have no life.

[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:28.760]
That's obvious.

[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.080]
And here's the guy that started out.

[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:32.940]
Adamant.

[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:33.500]
Adamant.

[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.260]
Hostile.

[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.360]
Robbers don't go bad.

[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.080]
And I was like, oh, well, maybe that's so the problem.

[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:37.880]
Maybe yours is bad.

[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.960]
And then Denyze and he said it.

[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.480]
Just like Swarie, she was tired.

[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.600]
It was 11 o'clock at night.

[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.420]
It was 3 in the morning.

[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.480]
It was 4.30 in the morning.

[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.160]
It was 3 in the morning when the phone was ringing and she was in coherent.

[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.060]
Corrine to her husband.

[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.300]
And that's why she blurted out the crap about that sniper fire.

[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:57.620]
Yeah.

[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.080]
She was glirrious.

[01:25:59.740 --> 01:25:59.920]
Sure.

[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.440]
In coherent to 3 in the morning.

[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:03.880]
Go let her answer the phone, especially if it's Monica.

[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.760]
Now, if it's Stephen Strait that calls it 3 in the morning, I'll answer the phone, okay?

[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.380]
Now, you still haven't seen that movie, right?

[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:13.300]
Correct.

[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.340]
And I still don't have your book about the slots.

[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.420]
I'm not in here today.

[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.700]
I'm not going to press my luck.

[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.320]
Yeah, don't.

[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.720]
Well, I want a few bucks yesterday and believe me, it wasn't easy.

[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.720]
Those dollar Wheel of Fortune man, they're torture.

[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.880]
It's the Wheel of Torture.

[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.680]
I went to the $5 room and I got a little bit lucky and then I went back.

[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.520]
Well, actually I did do okay in the dollar one.

[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.120]
The old ones in the back there.

[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.200]
For those of you who would buy in people, what's there aren't any?

[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.060]
Thank God.

[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.980]
And I put in 100 bucks and I played 97 bucks.

[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:40.760]
Never got a spin.

[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.880]
I got a couple of cherries.

[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:44.340]
And my last three bucks, I got 300 on the line.

[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:47.060]
How do you like that?

[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:47.840]
All right.

[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:52.580]
And I cashed that ticket out and I was 900 ahead and I said, I'm going, I'm getting out of here.

[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.620]
I'm going upstairs, give me a slice of pizza and the cafeteria.

[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.440]
I did not eat the macaroni and cheese, by the way.

[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.280]
Aren't you proud of me?

[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:58.880]
I am very.

[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.100]
I've let you restill very, very high today.

[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.500]
Unacceptably high and I will buy soon if I don't cut the crap, but I did not eat the macaroni

[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:05.780]
and cheese.

[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.520]
And that takes a lot of wheel park because they have a great, not good, but great macaroni

[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.380]
and cheese that would buy.

[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:12.980]
They do.

[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.060]
All race tracks, I don't know why that is.

[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.560]
Maybe it's something that they have back in a barn area that they stick in there.

[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.120]
You know, like in the cheese?

[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:21.380]
Light.

[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.160]
I have an oil.

[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:23.840]
Special sauce.

[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.460]
The special sauce here.

[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.480]
The Supreme Court of Health Kentucky's use of lethal injection executions today, likely

[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.240]
clearing the way to resume execution had been our hope for nearly eight months.

[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.120]
Adjustances by 72 vote turn back a constitutional challenge to the procedures in prison

[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.480]
Kentucky, which uses three drugs to sedate, paralyze and kill inmates, similar methods are

[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.900]
used by roughly three dozen states.

[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.200]
We agree that petitioners have a carry their burden of showing that the risk of pain from

[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.720]
maladministration of a conceitably human lethal injection protocol and the failure to adapt

[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.080]
untried, untested alternatives, constitute cruel, unusual punishment, Chief Justice John

[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.840]
Amanazi Robertson, an opinion that garnered only three votes.

[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.140]
Four other justices, however, agreed with the outcome.

[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.800]
Roberts' opinion did leave open subsequent challenges to lethal injection practices of a

[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.120]
state-refused, out-of-the-out alternative method that significantly reduced the risk of severe

[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:11.440]
pain.

[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.260]
Justice's Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter descended.

[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.240]
I wonder if he's kin to Bruce Souter.

[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:18.460]
Who?

[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.900]
Picture for the Cardinals.

[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:22.800]
Oh, look at this.

[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.820]
Prosecutors for his vanity tag contains vulgarity.

[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.120]
Be something.

[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.240]
What?

[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:31.900]
Be something.

[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.120]
It's an interesting story.

[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.160]
Oh, by the way, the beast.

[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.580]
They were, is the Joe Roe show.

[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.340]
I thought that Zach was issuing executive orders evidently, and joining pain and tension

[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:40.760]
is Zach.

[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.680]
Because the whole show is about to be.

[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.080]
I was sitting here this morning.

[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.900]
Well, but then I'm talking about how he's going to eat himself with that stuff.

[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.500]
No, he wasn't talking about it.

[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.540]
He was playing a clip from his show and some interview in the hand.

[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.640]
I wrote a windbag on the phone.

[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.340]
They were both ripping the beast and yawning on it.

[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.680]
It's Joe Roe show about the beast.

[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.960]
The best out of two is no Rogers.

[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:01.880]
435.

[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:02.900]
62 AM.

[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.200]
The sports leader.

[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:06.020]
The stick chainy.

[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.800]
I like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers

[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.820]
12-1 hour movie.

[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:11.560]
Hey.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.720]
16 seconds.

[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.500]
I'm going to snap.

[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.680]
6-10 seconds into the lead zone and goes to the fire wing to Elmen.

[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.500]
Elmen is set by the foot.

[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.500]
I'm going to wait for you.

[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.440]
5 seconds.

[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.900]
I'm going to Elmen Go.

[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:25.680]
He's going.

[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.240]
He's going.

[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:28.700]
Go.

[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:29.440]
Go.

[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:29.740]

[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:29.880]

[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:29.940]

[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:30.000]

[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:30.200]

[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:30.260]

[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:30.300]

[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:30.640]

[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:30.640]

[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:30.640]

[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:30.640]

[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:30.700]

[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.020]
Go.

[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:31.020]

[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:31.520]
Go.

[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.120]
Go.

[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:47.600]
We are the winner of theullovell lorsque.

[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:54.180]
I'm going to tune you in to your music with the level sings of this sound.

[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.180]
435.

[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:55.180]

[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:55.180]

[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:55.180]

[01:29:55.180 --> 01:30:08.840]
Åre覺 keyboards.

[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:08.860]

[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:08.880]
Please stay out of posture and wide range.

[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:08.880]

[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.100]
offer the fourth time you've been on the show for two hours at your time

[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:09.100]

[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.680]
Take over the log of both

[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.340]
You need to drop that there's a runner good. It's the name of old coach

[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:21.140]
Riley how about that you heard me how about that?

[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:29.540]
Yeah, go try

[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.620]
It is coach Riley

[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.740]
Not Rick Riley

[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:42.460]
A little bit of a deal just through Riley. Oh, we got the wrong guy Riley

[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.960]
Well, we can't talk about anything of the support as you know

[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.680]
Do you know anything about sports?

[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.800]
Well, I wasn't expecting just to Riley

[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.880]
You say something about the board to go right ahead

[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.000]
15

[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:10.020]
Don't call on the kind of doctor says the free hour and 50 minutes of play

[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.460]
Hey, oh, oh

[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:28.400]
Love it yeah, who you can trouble to it 560 W. Who 5M the jerk show at tuba sav known shocking isn't it?

[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.520]
Now are you gonna should we have an office pool and pick a day for his last show?

[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.100]
What

[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.580]
He's the pool by the way speaking of that you want to know why why?

[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.480]
Why is it a person's only chance to get into a thousand a day?

[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:47.840]
You need 213 more you're not you're not even an 800 with this. This is a turkey of a pool. Sorry Sean and Hollywood

[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:52.160]
What's the most exciting play in sports 787 on this pool week?

[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:52.900]
week

[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:55.740]
I hate sports 133

[01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:01.420]
Kick return for touchdown one the reason I played the breakaway goal nearby Bob Pohlford is because breakaway goal is on here

[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.400]
Maybe it'll get down a little something

[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.720]
Kick return for touchdown 127 Hail Mary 77 play at the plate 58

[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:14.500]
Buzzard beater 55 it was Jackie Robinson at the plate and Yogi bear applying the tag in a 1953

[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.200]
World Series wasn't I think

[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.780]
You're 55. I don't know what it was

[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.400]

The best male singer of all time and look at that

[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:27.920]
Elvis and Freddie Mercury are tied well, I thought our audience hated Elvis the Elvis don't they?

[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:40.840]
Orbison one which I like Roy Orbison, but if he was the best and you know who else was on a pool I got one vote

Frank says just wanted to add my two cents to the pool or too bad the one we just ended I

[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:10.000]
Voted for the buzzer beater, but some of the most exciting plays in sports are at the end of a hockey game when the team by down by one pulls the goalie empty net

[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.800]
It's packed full of desperation usually ends up with either a great save or as Jim Houston would say great

[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:23.220]
See it's a great see he makes me one up here Jim Houston. That's for my two Canadian listeners. He sucks

[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.620]
It's a great scene or by the goalie or the friends been covering for the goalie or it ends in a game time goal

[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.200]
How much more exciting can it get empty net goal?

[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:35.200]
The NCAA tournament. They'll make pretty good argument for bussard beaters with

[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.260]

[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.040]
How much you want to bet?

[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.280]
And see part of the problem is on on the show my space the friend requests you know how usually it'll it'll like

[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.380]
Light up on there or like it'll it'll have like a little thing but I get a friend request. It doesn't show

[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.900]
So I have to check them manually, you know, I mean right?

[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.080]
I've seen I got to go over the other oh Christ

[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.200]
This better be worth it Frank

[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.000]
Oh nothing for no reason

[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:24.760]
All right friend requests

[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.660]
No, yeah, I'm gonna approve it

[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.620]
I'm not unless you need to set it again. Yeah, but there's only one other super speed which I was to prove that that's it

[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.000]
They're all approved, baby. They're all approved Frank

[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.280]
Unless I didn't approve for some reason that maybe we're jerk or something like that which I don't think so I don't know

[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.160]
Maybe it's a goofball

[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.900]
Now why are we just playing that?

[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:57.040]

[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.200]
Yeah, they did and then they went out of business. They went there and they were defund

[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:17.520]
So I don't know what the story is there Frank, but I have approved everybody or approved or rejected as the case may be

[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:23.940]
Now here's the story that the beast said well, I just I got it plus we got to take at least two 300 calls between now and two

[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:29.180]

[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.260]
hip not

[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.060]

I'm a squares a cardboard box and that's I've been all my life

[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.980]
So I don't try to be cool in hip, but when somebody tries very hard and you can tell that they're trying

[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:52.320]
You know what that tells you that they're not that's correct good. Yes

[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:22.760]

Pressed lots of rapists lots of child monsters. I'm not approved

She said I'm all for freedom of expression

[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:40.380]
But there are certain words that are so objectionable and so disgusting and I've nobody deemed social value

[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:47.200]
And that's one the tag a Marine Corps specialty plant on 2006 white, that's a bishie raider is registered a Stuart

Tabarra's 28th of Pembroke Pines he couldn't be reached her comment

[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:55.100]
However, Tabarra's offered an explanation when he applied for the tag of the West Regional Courthouse in plantation

[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:59.340]
He told a clerk that the T word is a tactical group in the Marine Corps. He was in

[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:06.200]
Tactical wire assault team abbreviated as TWA T

[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.820]
He served with the Marines for years 2002 to 2006

[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:14.480]
He did a four-month Afghanistan tour attended the rank as tainted rank as sergeant said major manual

Delarosa Marine Corps spokesman for the Pentagon he worked in telecommunications as a field wireman

[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.160]
And

[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.220]
Wikipedia says so in other words he didn't make it up a common colloquialism for and amongst field telecommunications personnel in the Marine Corps is

[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.360]
Tactical wire assault team

[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:35.720]
So they did make it up obviously for for reasons but nevertheless at least they it exists

[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.240]
You know I'm saying right he didn't make it up just to put on a plate and be vulgar rift in one of the tag pulled

[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:46.700]
She called the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to complain. I spoke to three different people last person said

When Harbors Chris Matthews appeared recently on the Colbert report Stephen Colbert asked him

[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.300]
There's a lot of tough it you might be running for all inspectors seen Pennsylvania any truth to that

[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.340]
You want to give me a scoop Colbert went on you want to respond to that in a form of an announcement?

[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:01.180]
Matthews seemed bemused at first asking a six-year term representing all the people of Pennsylvania

[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:06.500]
However he was soon admitting to Colbert when you know when you grow up some kids want to be a firm and I wanted to be a similar

[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.900]
That's an announcement Colbert declared a cheer from the audience. Oh

[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.540]
According to recent listen Colbert could have said anything could have said oh I just farted and he would have had cheers from the audience

[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:22.540]
It would could have said Chris is illiterate and they would have wild tears from the audience. It would have it

[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.680]
Especially when it comes to politics

[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.020]
According to recent posting at the website of longtime Republican operative Roger Stone

[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:37.620]
MSNBC TV star Chris Matthews has been quietly sounding out Democrats across Pennsylvania about seeking the Democratic nomination of post-Senator Arlen

[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.420]
Magic bullet specter

[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:47.180]
Matthews has been meeting with former Philadelphia City Controller Timing Leonard and as a coach governor Ed Randell to require about recruiting campaign personnel

[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:52.540]
After watching the Colbert report clip the morning Joe host were enthusiastic. I think he'd be a great public

[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:54.620]
What?

[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.100]
You just hit something man disappeared. Oh there you are wait a minute. Oh, what is that?

[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.380]
He just sent the F.I. I dumped it, but you know, what is that? We are on the air?

[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.800]
Some of what is that somebody in the control room is doing something they should know?

[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.720]
There's all kinds of

[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.860]
Profession right

[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.880]
We've only done that so many times. Do whatever you're doing

[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:17.560]
Oh

[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.240]
In there and stop it. He ran in there. He ran in there and stopped them from doing it

[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.200]
There we hope we had nothing to do with that

[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:30.120]
FCC find the guy in the control room. I dumped it, but I mean you can only hit it so many times. He's so epic in

[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:32.220]
Angry. Who was that was that jerks?

[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.700]
How do I know we're in this little room Chris is gonna come back and give us a full report. I'm sure

[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.640]

[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:46.180]
shopping that that was that was vintage Q.I.M. Baby sure

[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:49.340]
What I tell you about people in there posh me around in the car

[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:51.140]
We don't hire any radio people here

[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.580]
Well, that's for damn sure

[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:58.580]
The hard job. I was in the car on the way and I sure hope that this dump button is working

[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:04.500]
I'm sure you dumped it. I hit the dump button just continue. Oh, yeah, it's working. We're talking about why we were hearing them though

[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.640]
What was that? We're hearing Jason talking to a Carlos

[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:12.200]
From where where is he now there the other studio?

[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:21.060]
They're in the other studio. Yes, mm-hmm. It's 12 23. What does he do in the other studio besides swearing?

[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:27.060]
Swaring up in storm show prep so yeah prep my ass, okay? I'll go get a brush. God

[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.040]
Show prep I'll go get the Loub

[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.020]
Early other word was F and this and F and that and

[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.220]
Jesus

[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.660]
Do you hear it? No, I heard it through your monitor

[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.740]
Well, what does that mean? In other words, I heard it through your monitor like through your microphone

[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:55.280]
Yeah, like some talking in the background. Yeah, it didn't come through aren't I bar speakers in here?

[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.560]
Yeah, I was on here. Yeah, I think we were just hearing you know

[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.400]
George and I were just hearing your speakers. It's not like someone was talking at your place

[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:16.920]
So I think we're okay

[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.140]
Just remember what I told Johnny Joe that wasn't my signature on that contract

[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:23.240]
Was it a puppy popper

[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.160]
What what is that banging? Oh, oh, just

[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:29.460]
Oh

[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:35.480]
Hey, this boy you never know might be coming from the other room

[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:40.580]
It was so

[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.940]
There must have been

[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:47.340]
F bombs

[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:54.340]
She's okay, and I'm sitting here helpless like where's they oh, and I'm looking all around like where's that coming from?

[01:48:54.340 --> 01:49:00.700]
Must be the router that's what it is. It's a miss routing. Yeah, we were we rerouted through the control room

[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.440]
With Jason Jackson and his filthy potty mouth

[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:06.380]
Well, I like more now

[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.180]
No comment I'm not saying word not that word anyway all the air I will

[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:19.920]

[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:00.300]

[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:03.280]
Okay after that episode we just said I'm doing a little frustration eating a

[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.500]
Thing this and cold cut stuff all right turkey and veal sausage

[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.760]
With peppers and stuff

[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.580]
Good stuff just a little bit

[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:21.840]
How we doing on those marlin tickets out there at hooters at Pines University I don't we give anyway

[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:25.720]
Let's find out if they're all gone. I mean once they're gone. That's right

[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:30.800]
I don't want to read the promo if they're all gone, but of course why would anybody tell us right?

[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.000]
See one thing I was well aware of when I signed that document on Friday

[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.200]
Whether it's five years or a hundred years under the current regime nothing is ever gonna change

[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.580]
Nothing will ever change and what just happened in there is it's so typical

[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:53.420]
It's a playground. It's not a rate. It's not a broadcast station. It's not a radio stage not even a business

[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:55.940]
It's a playground for sports players

[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.420]
We ought to have swings and slides stuff like that. Nuri go around

[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.820]
Do you think there was fit sure?

[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:09.600]
So what's the story is anybody gonna call you from there and tell you whether we got any Marlon ticket sucked her up

[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:13.240]
I sent me a text and I presented he'll answer it. He always has

[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.040]
Assy mm-hmm. He's a good guy

[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:23.040]
860 on your total polls by the way. I'm counting the numbers all collected for you trying to get you to that thousand

[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:26.040]
I think if we change it again, you're still not gonna get there. No, we'll get there

[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:27.120]
not

[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:28.900]
We'll get there

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:33.200]
Got 88 on this one. So you got 868 total

[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.620]
You know 132 votes and you got

[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:40.640]
90 minutes less to look comfort

[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.960]
Yeah, well though now come through. You know how animated he sounds these days probably cuz he's porking up again

[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.800]
You're getting read back right actually. I'm a constant the same so I think I'm gonna need to I'm staying the same

[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.420]
But no we're the HAT fat like that big fat chick with a fat ass

[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.580]
Moe unique no green you more more Howard

[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:06.180]
Freddie Mercury 19 Elvis 13 Freddie's pulling away and that's all because you played all that queen stuff right

[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:09.760]
Speaking of fact

[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:13.700]

[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:21.440]

They don't want to hear the music they just want to vote for him

[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.340]
I was very happy he had a bad voice he had a good voice. He was a good singer. He just didn't have any good songs

[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:14.800]
Oh

[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.640]
I agree well maybe the other disc are better than that first the disc on it's a three disc set

[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.180]
Yeah, I'm sure the discs are better than each other

[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:26.540]
But they saw his baby better. Yeah. Oh come on now give the king a chance

[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.480]

New York governor Patterson and his wife last year gave a shockingly low

[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:21.360]
150 dollars to charity despite a combined incoherent nearly 270 grand the couple's income tax filing show this according to the New York post

[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:27.040]
150 bucks went to the salvation army in the form of you clothing. Oh, maybe they give it to the hopper

[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.780]

That was the couple didn't check any of the charity contribution boxes

[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.940]
This is for the world trade center memorial listed on the state tax form

[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:47.000]
The 150 dollar donation was dwarfed by two other state officials

[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:54.740]
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo reported having last year made 14 grand and charitable contributions. I'm estimated in come of 545 grand

[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.480]
You know how much I gave to charity last year nothing correct

[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:02.060]
My whole life is charity

[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.360]
That's correct

[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.560]
Controller Thomas didn't know I supposed to feel bad about that I

[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.600]
Know too. No, I don't it's my money. I'll give it to whoever I want

[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.840]
I'll do whatever if I want to wipe my ass with it. I'll do it

[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:20.220]
If I want to paper the walls with it. I'll do it

[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.220]
Controller Taliston Appali who's single before the 143 grand total income gave

[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:28.240]
$3,065 to 29 charities last year

[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:34.820]
Patterson's Palfrey giving also came up short compared to his gubernatorial predecessors multiminary Elliott Spitzer

[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:39.320]
gave a 141 grand out of this County hookers or not or

[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:46.840]
Seven percent of his and his wife's total income George Pateki was widely criticized for short-changing charities reported donating

[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:47.660]
$2,600

[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:50.180]
$94 year before he came became governor

[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:58.740]
That included $885 worth of use clothing of the Salvation Army and more than $300 in corn other produce and on profit groups corn

[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.580]
My ass get out of here. Yeah

[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.300]
What W at corn, Hulio

[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:08.580]
Be a corn cob the peasant who does it?

[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:13.260]
I'm gonna do for a man corn is where it's at remember that story we had last week corn and oil

[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:16.860]
That's what I said true special corn sure is special baby

[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:26.480]
Well enough of the Elvis okay, I'm so glad I resurrected that pool at least it's better than that the sports nerd thing, okay?

[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:30.860]
I hate sports. I hate sports. Oh

[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:33.360]
Here's something if it cues up. I don't think it's gonna cue up

[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.860]
Come on you can do it

[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:39.740]
It doesn't work real well when you put the disc in upside down in the den

[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:40.820]
no

[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.300]
Now whenever happened with the one there is it still screwed up the line of this won't play

[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.940]
There's one here that's a particularly such a

[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:12.760]
You don't want to hear that no pretty mercury, baby. No, it isn't they dug them up just for that bit then yes, it is

[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.680]
It's pretty mercury. He's singing from the other side

[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:24.220]
You know what side it is back home the other side the male best male singer of all time now

[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:27.600]
There are other names on here. I'm sure that some of the people would like some of the rappers on here

[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.320]
Which they will not get on here because they're not singers

[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.200]
But it just seems to me that most of these names are old you know

[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:35.320]
Oh

[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.060]
Like we don't have Eddie Murphy on here not that he's recent, but you know, I mean

[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.320]
Nothing is okay

[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.600]
Are there any great male singers recent that we don't have on here? I'm trying to thank

[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:53.440]

[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:04.560]

[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.220]
He could sing maybe but that we never heard it 16 to 2

[02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:01.340]
One whatever the hell it is 16 to 2 let's get out of here. So do we get a report from flee?

[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.820]
Yes, wait and all gone

[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.760]
See it's a good idea for me to not keep reading the promo once they're gone

[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.460]
They're gone and if they're all gone and no sense reading it

[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.200]
See eventually sooner or later they'll begin to understand how this is kind of like a two-pronged operation

[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.980]
You have to stick to fit the prongs together. Mm-hmm. That's how it works

[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:31.040]
Well, you got good news your Chris thanks to me again coming up with a really great idea of changing the pool 921 now combined

[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:34.580]
All right 79 and 132 there he goes with the numbers again

[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:40.280]
He's mailing in numbers and by the way, we shouldn't bring George a lot of stamps next time he's a Gulfstream. I was next time going to be

[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:45.480]
Sooner or is it going to be after the appearance one moment because I just found out

[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:49.520]
You just found out five of you will be the next Gulfstream

[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.940]
Co-show five two me two yes

[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:57.980]
A two boot which is gonna be a Friday

[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.700]
It's a lot of stamps okay or fake when I come down there

[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:05.300]
They'll bring me some Canadian stamps cuz so I can read it in right a lot of years to be mailing in shows

[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:10.220]
Oh my god, we need new young fresh. Tell me the lot that old gold on here. Well, then no listen

[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.340]
That's all in your case you can female it in

[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:14.140]
Oh

[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:20.240]
Speaking of females as the Democratic presidential campaign and after I do this story we're gonna take a lot of calls

[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.260]
maybe

[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:28.620]
5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 60 Verizon singular wireless line letter ring because George can't think of any

[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:34.660]
Unless Chris wants to screen him again not don't do it. Okay, then as

[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:40.560]
The Democratic presidential campaign is persistent new pool shows will be Clinton losing trust among voters

[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:46.800]
The latest findings from ABC News and Washington Post finds a majority of respondents find the former first lady untrustworthy

[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.240]
Compared to a majority who trusted her before the campaign began well

[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.840]
The post is her advisors efforts to deal with the problem by having a acknowledge her mistakes and cracks crack self-deprecating jokes

[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:58.220]
Don't seem to succeed it

[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:04.420]
privately the aids admit that the recent controversy over claim to have duct sniper fire on in fifth Bosnia made things worse

[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:05.680]
worse

[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:06.900]
lies

[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:08.900]
fantasies stories

[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.820]
Clinton's view is honest and trustworthy by just 39% of Americans according to a new

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:17.940]
Washington Post ABC News pool compared with 52% of male last year

[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:19.460]
That's just 39

[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:24.680]
Nearly six out of 10 in the new pool six. She is not honest and trustworthy and now compared with Obama

[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:31.820]
Clinton is a deep has a deep trust deficit among Democrats creating him by 23 pushes the more honest and area in which you once led both

[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:32.700]
Obama and John Edwards

[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:38.040]
Among Democrats 63% called her honest on 18 from 2006 among you dependant sir

[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:42.980]
Trust levels is dropped 13 points to only 37 and Republicans help Clinton low regard in this in the past

[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.760]
23% called her honest few years ago, but now it's even lower just 16%

[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.200]
Majorities of men and women now say the phrase does not apply to her two years ago

[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:54.060]
Neural majorities of both did

[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:00.500]
If I just argue that her positive ratings have dipped is she's been defined by her opponents a normal campaign occurrence

[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:04.380]
And that a honesty problem reflects the pounding she took from Republicans in the 90s, but

[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:11.940]
The Bosnia incident the way the campaign handled a blood advisor divided over what a candidate can do after such a steep drop in trust

[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:18.160]
How about we're tired that would be a good idea sure deficit. Okay get out of the way

[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.880]
Quit screwing up the worst for everybody else

[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:25.700]
Doug Thompson says we don't need one of us in the White House

[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:32.980]
As a gun owner and Hunter I have trouble welcoming Hillary Clinton to the gun fraternity or sorority in her case

[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:36.900]
And as a recovering alcoholic who used to toss down to more than his share of shots

[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:43.280]
I even have more trouble imagining an evening at the local bar tossing back boiler makers with the Democratic presidential pretender

[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:49.720]
Yet claims of honey heritage and downy shots of crown royal and chasing it with beer is part of Clinton's latest attempt to prove

[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.380]
She's just one of us. She's one of the guys. Oh

[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:54.960]
That explains a lot right

[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.520]
Hillary appealed to a coin to CNN

[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.500]
Hillary appealed a second amendment supporters on Saturday by hinting that she has some experience of her own pulling triggers

[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:08.920]
I disagree with Senator Obama's assertion that people in our country clean the guns and have certain attitudes about trading immigration simply out of frustration

[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:14.660]
She began referring to Obama's comments on small town of Americans that set off a political tumult at least in the media on Friday

[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:17.700]
She then introduced a fond memory from her youth

[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:22.120]
You know my dad took me up behind the cottage of my grandfather build on a little lake called Lake Winola

[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:26.160]
Outside of Sren and taught me how to shoot when I was the little girls you said you know

[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.380]
Some people not continue to teach their children and grandchildren. It's part of culture

[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:32.340]
It's part of a way of life. It's the American effort away. She's somebody

[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:37.560]
People enjoy hunting and shooting because it's an important part of who they are not because they're bitter

[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.860]
ABC reports clinton stood by the bar took a shot of crown royal whiskey

[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:47.740]
She took one sip of the shot then on the small sip and a few seconds later through her head back and finished off the whole thing

[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:54.320]
Clinton later sat down on a table enjoyed some pizza and beer and called over Mayor Tom McDermott of Hammond Indiana to come join the table

[02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:00.960]
Every time I get around you we start drinking Senator the mayor of Swam Clinton nodded and raised her glass at Saturday night though times

[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.740]
She said that's what she said

[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.120]
If Hillary Clinton is joining the ranks of the owners in this country

[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:12.180]
It's time to tune in our NRA cards and call Sarah Brady if there's even the slightest chance of running into her at the local pub

[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.920]
I'm headed for the nearest AA meeting

[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:20.860]
All this pathetic political pandering of course is just another attempt by Shreyl Hill to prove she's just one of us

[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:26.600]
It's even more laughable than Obama's lame attempt to become a borer when political candidates try to prove they're just plain folks

[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.400]
They come across as just plain fools

[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:32.020]
Memo to one and all you ain't one of us so drop this charade

[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:34.020]
We're not looking for one of us. We're looking for a leader

[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:39.520]
Bullying a 37 while wearing a white shirt and tie are tossing back with a few of politicals at a bar. It doesn't mean dick

[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.960]
This so-called presidential campaign as he sent into a site. That's what he said

[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:50.760]
The so-called presidential campaign is descended into a site to a photo ops meaningless diversions and comedy skits

[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.280]
So we're more from reality than the sketches on Saturday night life seem more real than what's happening out of the stunt

[02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:01.160]
Besides if the phone rings at the White House at 3 a.m. And the president's spreading over across the bed passed out and then alcohol and do

[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.160]
Stupor nobody's available to answer the phone

[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:05.940]
I just get you San Edelawada go myself. Yes, I did

[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:11.440]
Yes, I did like Thompson who's still bitter. He's out there and he's bitter even tell

[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:19.840]
I can take this promo for that stupid Marlon tickets and Schmidt can't add one thing with jerks. Well, that was a indescribable fun

[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:24.940]
Should let it go on the air

[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:26.360]
Yeah

[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:31.080]
F and this and F and that was so F and that you know

[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:37.720]
Not that I don't use the F word but I try to yeah, I try to avoid a winner. I'm near a live mic right we effort up all morning long

[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:41.520]
Do we yep that's an S and S and F

[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.120]
That's all F and Morty. Yeah, I'm F and Morton

[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:53.240]
That's because we're confident that that's not going on the air as opposed to them playing around in that control room

[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:59.060]
My suggestion is stay that F out of the control room on the shows on here until until the last bit or moment

[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.440]
See so doing what that's no fun

[02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:10.220]
Stay out of there quit not gonna solve the year quit interjecting stuff that isn't supposed to be on the air

[02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:15.400]
Quit swearing up a storm on a live mic. That's on the air. That's seriously. You don't hear this?

[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:17.020]
No

[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:21.360]
Mark most is how about Robert plan for the poll

[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:27.160]
How about shop plot Robert plans good. Yes, yes, we'll get him on here

[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:32.500]
Well, we'll add to the poll. We'll take suggestions because the more names we add on air the more votes

[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:36.120]
We're gonna get the sooner Chris. I get to his thousand combined finally all right

[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:41.400]
148 and 789 is what 937

[02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:46.360]
You got an hour and eight minutes for 63 votes if you can't do that in 68 minutes man

[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.540]
Wow, I could run strong. What is that brother plan?

[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.460]
I mean I could place a let's up on the best two. No, thanks

[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:02.180]
Yeah, yeah, there's that kid you want to get there's Ali falching

[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:05.520]
Very nice

[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:12.300]
It's about radio

[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:25.700]
148 votes on our second poll and Freddie Mercury's got 35 Frank Sinatra 17 11 16 and Marvin Gay 13

[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:28.620]
Marvin's making a move and right of boys only got 12

[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:33.740]
He won the first time that was a long time ago. I guess he might have been a little bit warmer back then, you know

[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:34.740]
maybe

[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:42.240]
Right of boy good, but I'm not I wouldn't even say he's great. I don't know great. How many singers were great?

[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:48.760]
Well, what are we we talk about great voices? He definitely had one you did yeah

[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.180]
The long

[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:56.640]
He was good not great and it's all subjective man

[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.620]
It's all subjective you say where the boy was great that means you're probably you know fried

[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:06.860]
I'm growing number of bankruptcies among US retailers is set to prompt thousands of store closings

[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:09.660]
New York Times will report on the front page of its new identity yesterday

Well, this is from two days ago. I have oh, that's right. We better take some calls before I get into many more of these stories

[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.780]
How about swills Steven swills and grow nash

[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.220]
What separately now now it's just a joke. Oh, man. You're gonna put me a young right here

[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:51.280]
Next thing you'll be put man Murray on there for crying out loud speaking to Canadians. No

[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.620]
How about great Canadian singers? We already got Burton Cummings on there. We leave anybody out

[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.600]
Gettily from rush

[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:02.160]
Okay

[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:10.860]
Anybody else anybody else robin anything else robin? No, that that I can take out. Oh good

[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:17.180]
Now the Canadian gentler groups in a little bit are our several females like man Murray whose blows and

[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:23.560]
Assuming they've it. That we worse. Who we don't have David Bowie on here David Bowie. Oh

[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:30.360]
We know I never you know I never did tell you what victim recession

[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:38.700]
You're slipping man you really some you're suppose I mean you know what this big raise now and have your big meeting with jolly

[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:39.000]
Joe

[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:48.120]
Well, I spated George this morning with the deal one. Yeah, yeah, everybody was gonna be involved in negotiations if there were any but there weren't any

[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.660]
Negotiations you know the standard right right

[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:58.200]
It was that this is what they put on a sheet of paper any and then he told normal well come back with a counteroffer

[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:02.060]
Come back with N. We did and they just like laughed and wipe their ass with it and then they said well

[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:07.540]
That we're on the outside is is what we can do and since all these other big offers were coming in even though it's only the middle of April

[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.120]
And I saw the way that things were going into business and I said to myself you know what I'd rather be safe than sorry

[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:19.260]
What if we have like two or three really bad books they say oh we don't think he's got it anymore

[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:23.080]
You know he's a dodging old fool and and you know he's done like that

[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:31.520]
There are many different things you have to consider in this business as opposed to oh I need a lot of money first of all that second kid was a bad idea

[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:40.580]
1256 at 560 to be Q. A. M. Just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon

[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:57.080]
I'm saving the quarter

[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:08.240]
I'm cutting

[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:08.240]

[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.400]
Stores

[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:23.640]
And I don't know if I'll get through it Oh no I spend too much I bounce by check this month

[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:31.100]
There goes my credit rating here I thought I had more in my savings

[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.340]
I'll take you well to lunch if you buy

[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:54.100]
It's the softy economy, it's the softy economy

[02:13:54.620 --> 02:14:00.540]
I'm saving nickels and corners I'm cutting coupons because

[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.400]
I'm a victim of recession

[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:05.920]
You're fairly

[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:10.180]
Okay what I wanted 560 WNQM, aren't we all we're bitter baby we are bitter

[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:14.060]
We're all victims of recession I don't want to get $200 bills to rub together

[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.640]
Maybe I'm going to go to Woodbind this afternoon what do you think?

[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.860]
Not a good idea, Woodbind Wednesday

[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.600]
Are you there?

[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:24.220]
Oh no, how come?

[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:25.920]
What is this new routinely?

[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.380]
I've noticed this has been going on a lot more and more I'll ask, obviously there's a question mark at the end

[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:31.940]
I think it was obvious

[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:36.080]
Maybe you should make one of those sounds like what's his name?

[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.340]
Like what's his name?

[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:40.900]
The guy that would make the sounds for the punctuation

[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.300]
I can't make those sounds

[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:45.860]
No, how about just...

[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:46.320]
Oh no

[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.840]
You better watch it Mr. because you're treading on real thin ice right now especially of intermiddle lake Ontario

[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.360]
And by the way it is just beautiful

[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:01.260]
I know that Pauli, Katherine overlissons everyday to get the Toronto weather

[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.900]
Was that a question mark?

[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:14.960]
Captain baby radio, look at that it's going to be it's already 15, it's going to be 18 at 65 degrees tomorrow's 20, 68, Friday, 66 and Saturday, 58

[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:20.800]
The sun is shining, there's no rain, there's no snow, there's no ice, there's no freezing sleep, there's no...

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.060]
I'm glad the birds are singing, the squirrels are having a... we got black squirrels here

[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:25.420]
Yeah

[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:30.280]
I've mentioned that before, you don't find that stuff

[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:32.500]
I've never seen any in Florida, have you?

[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:33.400]
No, Florida no

[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:36.220]
Why do black squirrels hang out here up north?

[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:38.520]
I don't know, there's more tolerance up there

[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:39.340]
Is that what it is?

[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:44.240]
I don't think there's a discriminative against... I don't think we got any Muslim squirrels

[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:44.700]
Have you checked?

[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.780]
In my building, we have a lot of people

[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:51.560]
85 kids

[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:55.120]
Future suicide bombers

[02:15:58.240 --> 02:15:58.600]
Oh!

[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:02.540]
The least one thing I know I'll be safe because they're not going to blow up their own building

[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.600]
I don't think, you know, not with a Muslim or a Muslim society, if they blow up themselves

[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.320]
Yeah, they might have an accident, you know

[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.240]
And somebody gets hurt

[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:15.340]
179 votes on your second pool, let's add those together and get this over with already

[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.520]
It's getting 9.68

[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.800]
Isn't the Pope-Low Bill like bulletproof?

[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:19.280]
Yeah

[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:25.240]
So why do they have to have like the social... see what service is wanting next to it?

[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:26.680]
Just in case, yeah

[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:29.080]
Just in case somebody switched the glass

[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:29.840]
Oh, okay

[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.280]
Okay, somebody has a bazooka

[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.460]
Yeah, there you go

[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:34.160]
Okay, somebody's got like a neutron bomb

[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.780]
The Pope-Mobile and he's slipping him around, he's waving and they're all...

[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.260]
Oh my God, wait till you see all the cosignans of people

[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.800]
You know what's really scary to me is that everywhere he goes to these like stadiums

[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:49.760]
And these hundreds of stuff like what he was here in Toronto, the old Pope, few years ago

[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:53.220]
All these young people come out, well what is the point of that?

[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.000]
Well, I guess it goes to show that brainwashing really works

[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.080]
Well, they start young

[02:16:58.660 --> 02:16:59.920]
Good, yeah, they sure do

[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.700]
When they're showing him this morning, I just have pictures of like the movie Omen

[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.320]
But movie? Omen? The Omen?

[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:09.160]
Oh, the Omen?

[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:11.280]
When Gregory Schmeck

[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:16.860]
And then William Holden was in Omen 2, am I right?

[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.220]
In Omen 3, forget about it

[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:20.360]
Right

[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:22.200]
Damien! Damien!

[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:23.480]
What?

[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:27.680]
I told you to get rid of that dog

[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:29.900]
What's that? I think I'm the first thing in the morning sir

[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.280]
That's not a dog

[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:32.100]
That's not a dog

[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:36.760]
Good movie, the Omen

[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.280]
There was four Omen's

[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:40.720]
There was a fourth one?

[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.160]
Oh, this is a TV one, okay

[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:44.880]
Oh my god, you think after the third one I would have been doing it

[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:46.800]
Who was in Omen 3, it was really a stiff

[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:48.360]
Omen 2 was William Holden

[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.380]
And we're not counting the remake of the Omen

[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:51.740]
I beg your pardon?

[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:53.000]
They remade the first one

[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.400]
Oh my god

[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:55.320]
Why?

[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:56.420]
Money

[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:59.320]
I guarantee they didn't make any

[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.720]
Movies that don't like Psycho

[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:05.640]
Certainly didn't need any remade

[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:06.920]
They made it like remade it

[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:08.940]
But stranger calls did not need

[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:13.080]
I mean first of all when a stranger calls wasn't even a huge hit movie

[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:16.140]
I mean it was a great movie the first one when Charles Durning

[02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:18.840]
But it was like a big hit that

[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.340]
Why would you remake it?

[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.620]
A star is born, I can see why they remade that

[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:23.400]
Right?

[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:24.620]
Yeah

[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:27.120]
Because the first one was like a hundred years ago

[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.520]
William Holden, Lee Grant

[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:32.920]
Jonathan Scott Taylor

[02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:34.240]
Omen 2

[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:36.060]
And what about Omen 3?

[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.400]
Oh I gotta find that one

[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.120]
Elizabeth Shepard?

[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:39.920]
What?

[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.120]
Elizabeth Shepard was in the second one?

[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:42.760]
Who'd act?

[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:44.820]
I don't know but she had a picture so I figured you might know her

[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:47.580]
And who else?

[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:51.580]
Oh I just switched looking for Omen 3 now

[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:52.280]
Oh

[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.000]
You know make up your mind

[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.800]
The final conflict Omen 3

[02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:59.380]
You know with M Neal?

[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.560]
Oh stand near, I'm like he's not a bad actor

[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:03.680]
Rosanna Rosanna?

[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:06.020]
No, R-O-S-S-A-N-O

[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:07.940]
Rosanna Rosy?

[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.420]
R-O-S-A-N-O

[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:10.060]
R-O-S-A-N-O

[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.020]
R-O-S-A-N-O

[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:13.720]
Actually no that was a guy because they names the Carlo

[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.220]
Don Gordon, Lee Santero

[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.760]
I'm reading you who's in the third one

[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.840]
I don't wanna hear anymore, okay

[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:22.960]
And a sandwich with my name of any note

[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.500]
I've never heard of anybody ever heard of the other people

[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:28.940]
Santero I think was in that movie where they were out on a boat

[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:30.520]
Yeah

[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:35.140]
And he like trying to rape the wife

[02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:36.420]
I can't think of any of that movie

[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:38.940]
I know you saw it, we both saw it on cable was really good

[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:40.660]
Was that Sanneal?

[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:42.100]
He played the evil doer

[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:44.960]
I'm trying to think of the movie

[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.760]
You don't know the one I'm talking about?

[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:47.860]
I got a picture in my head

[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:48.400]
30 deeds?

[02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:49.920]
What was it?

[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:50.440]
30 deeds

[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:51.640]
30 deeds is a...

[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:53.240]
30 deeds my ass

[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:54.420]
I bet it is

[02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:55.580]
30 deeds

[02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:56.240]
It is not!

[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.300]
Oh you're asses

[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.060]
Look up Sanneal, maybe he has a little look at now

[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:03.500]
The consumer spending slump and tightening credit markets

[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.760]
They're trilling away if a bankruptcies American retailing

[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:10.000]
Within suing store closures expected to be made suburban malls and downtown shopping districts

[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.840]
All across the country writes Michael Barbero for the times

[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.300]
A lot of fees kind of that dead horse

[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:15.500]
Barbero

[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.840]
Barbero notes that over half of that

[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.840]
Now they got horses writing stories for the times

[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:21.080]
That's how bad that paper is gotten

[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:25.240]
Notes that over half of it doesn't store change the file for bankruptcy in recent months

[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.980]
And amidst mounting dead and plummeting sales

[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:31.560]
Wards that financial troubles are quickly spreading to bigger national companies

[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:34.180]
We got Sura's over here and George wants a big raise

[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:36.000]
He wants big big money

[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.620]
He wants seven figures

[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:43.040]
Now what is this thing you just sent me?

[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:47.820]
Did you send this?

[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:48.580]
Yeah

[02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:49.640]
Pre-stuff

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.160]
Pope-stuff

[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.300]
14,000 felonies

[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:57.200]
Rape's by 4,500 priest

[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.700]
The king pen comes to America and you ask me to write what a Vatican PR tells them

[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:03.760]
Shamedful medium manipulation, no kidding by K. Ebbling

[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.800]
Whoever she is

[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.140]
We'll get back to you K.

[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.660]
This is one time

[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:13.220]
She says if you're not specifically Googling Pope and especially Pope sex abuse this week

[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:17.140]
You probably won't hear a read much about the thousands of felonies committed by pedophiles

[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:21.120]
And other sexual predators operating as priest in the American Catholic Church the last 50 years

[02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:24.160]
In its complete coverage of the papal press event

[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:28.700]
The New York Times does have an article about Catholic school enrollment being half-order-wise in the 50s

[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:33.900]
Which after read between the lines to say thank you thank God that Catholic parents are getting their children out of danger

[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:38.500]
Don't expect mainstream media to do much more than respond to press releases

[02:21:38.500 --> 02:21:41.960]
And for that I'm grateful to VOTF and SNAP

[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.800]
In fact the stream of demands from advocates in the past week may have caused the ponder to changes upcoming speeches

[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:50.460]
To release ignobs of crimes, crimes like these

[02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:52.560]
Sodomy with children

[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:57.040]
Men grabbed off a boy's enforced oral sex on them before going out to serve man's regularly

[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.320]
Offer worry rate before mag shows up over and over again in the documents of the come out so far

[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:06.060]
In one LA coastal town the church had a carnival every Saturday plus catechism class

[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:11.060]
And a network of pedophile priest picked children up from the carnival rides and forced them in nearby rooms to have sex

[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.440]
On church property when the children were supposed to be learning church doctrine while they were

[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.500]
Instead the children developing their gag response

[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:25.400]
Children sexualized before age 10 while staring at the stained glass windows and statues of saints to take their minds off the horror

[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:34.820]
On Saturday Yahoo reported Cardinal Tarchici over Tony, the Pope's second command, said the church had already responded with great dignity of the situation

[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:38.660]
And added that the clamor created the U.S. around the scandal is really unbearable

[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:43.480]
On Sunday morning word is quoted Fox News saying where Tony seems to have changed his tone

[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:46.000]
The Pope will talk about it in a specific way he says

[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.560]
But when you go to the actual front pages of mainstream press as usual

[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:56.100]
Thousands of felonies aided in the bed in the Catholic church are barely mentioned and only then is an upsetting dollar figure

[02:22:56.100 --> 02:23:05.260]
The New York Times refers to the thousands of felonies in its page once on the apis as the sex abuse scandals that rack the church and not causing it millions of dollars in legal fees and settlements with victims

[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:09.580]
That's a factual error in the New York Times what was once the official record

[02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:12.560]
The Times itself reported $1.6 billion last week

[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:15.400]
Today ap says it's too big in the churches paid out in settlements

[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:20.700]
Nobody knows how much more the Vatican is paid out to PR consultants and the leasons and law firms attach to each case

[02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:22.620]
Once again, it's all about the money

[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:27.960]
Nobody mentions the hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives were damaged by predator priests

[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.540]
Even the Times used to the word scandal and plies element of gossip like something bad happened and the media turned into something worse

[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:41.220]
The mainstream media reported today a little more than read press releases make a few phone calls for quotes to file their stories

[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:43.640]
They're understaffed in corporate owned news organizations

[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:47.800]
If you want real reporting you have to turn to places like City of Angels blog

[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:53.040]
Happily becoming City of Angels never see in with what casting of videos

[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:58.060]
Then there's more to this but only we didn't get it right

[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:00.440]
It's all came through

[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.400]
Follows into it to the end more than enough

[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:08.860]
Oh it's all over now a Pope says it's never going to happen again and you can press the holy father

[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:10.760]
The biggest name

[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:15.640]
The best talent he ever has in the world is 4.2562 am

[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:17.380]
The fourth leader

[02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:21.340]
In the 50s Robert Young made people laugh and father knows best

[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:29.380]
Now this great series is back starring a few Catholic priests who like it young in the return of father knows best

[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.140]
Step into the confession or believe

[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:35.260]
I don't know father this makes to 47th time I've been in there this week

[02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:37.340]
Oh Billy I wanted to be a good Catholic don't you?

[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:39.540]
Yeah but does everybody get a shrinking?

[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:44.320]
Father knows best it's the Vatican's best kept secret

[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.040]
And you've got a private see for all the fun just enter the rectory from the reader

[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:52.000]
Alright Billy boy it's time for your flute lesson

[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.500]
But father your flute has only one hole and it doesn't make any noise

[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:57.400]
Oh it will Billy it will

[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.760]
Father knows best once you've seen this new sitcom you'll wonder why you've never heard about it

[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:06.500]
Let me introduce you to Saint Peter

[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.900]
Father knows best going to church may not seem very entertaining

[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:14.700]
But there really is something funny going on here

[02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:17.760]
Oh yeah just a panic it's a real laugh right let me tell you that

[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:21.920]
Swirly thinks it's a real laugh right you know how the um

[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:25.420]
The candidates never talk about such a

[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.640]
What could be a bad idea what crap

[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.340]
What's the the epitaphile free stuff

[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:31.980]
Oh no

[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:34.800]
They need their vote

[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:37.080]
You want to piss out the religion is to even know bomb of me

[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:40.060]
Oh may those comments are right away oh geez he's knocking religion

[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.460]
Rain Dow says eggheads and cheeseballs

[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:48.400]
She says I'm not bitter I'm not writing this is because I grew up in a house with a gun

[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.500]
A strong Catholic faith and immigrant father

[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:53.700]
Brothers with anti illegal immigrants sentiments and a passion for bowling

[02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:57.000]
My bowling trophy was one of my most cherished possessions

[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.780]
My family more from the Kennedy Democrats into Reagan Republicans

[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:04.720]
Not because they were angry but because they felt more comfortable with conservative values

[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.100]
Members of my fans sometimes were overly cloistered

[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.740]
But they weren't bitter they were bonding

[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.920]
They went to church every Sunday because it was part of their identity

[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:14.940]
Not because they needed a security blanket

[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:17.160]
Behind closed doors in San Francisco

[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.280]
Aledisms epicenter Barack Obama showed his Eledism

[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.920]
Attributing the emotional spiritual and cultural values of

[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:25.900]
Working class lunchpile pensions to economic woes

[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:30.960]
The last few weeks have been kind of a Hillary but the endless end game hasn't been kind of the Wonder Boy either

[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:35.380]
Obama comes across less like a candidate in Pennsylvania than an anthropologist in Borneo

[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:39.560]
His mother got her PhD anthropologist and in the culture of Indonesia

[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:43.380]
And as Obama has quoted white blue collar voters in dear Hunter and Rocky country

[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:46.760]
He's often appeared to be observing the odd habits of the colorful locals

[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:51.020]
Resisting as the natives tried to fatten him up like a froid-graguce

[02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:55.700]
Sampling Pennsylvania beer and sports bar with her the tight awkwardly accepting bowling shoes

[02:26:55.700 --> 02:27:00.980]
And from Bob Casey, examining the cheese and salami of the tent and market here is intriguing ethnic artifacts

[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:04.540]
Purchasing Uts cheese balls at shop right in eastern Noraton

[02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:09.560]
And quizzing the women working in a chocolate factory about whether they could possibly really like the sugary due to ads

[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.540]
He hasn't pulled a John Kerryness for a fully-takes cheese steak with Swiss yet

[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:18.880]
But he has maintained a regal what did the simple folk do to help them escape when they're bluebearing

[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.900]
Unable to even feign mainstream cred

[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:26.200]
But Hillary did when she built it on a shot at Cremoral Whiskey with Vesto at Broncos and Crempoint in Diana

[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:33.240]
Just as he couldn't knock down the bowling pins, he can't knock down Andy Oakley or the girl in the race as her husband called her Tuesday

[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:39.100]
The self-style blue collar heroine reluctantly revealed $100 million fortune partially built on Bill Shady connections

[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:44.140]
Even when Hillary's campaign collapsed around her and her husband managed to revive the bullets over Bosnia

[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:48.740]
Obama has still not been able to marshal a knockout blow or even come up with a knockout economic speech

[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:50.540]
That could expand his basis of port

[02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:55.100]
Even as Hillary grows weaker her reputation for ferocity grows stronger

[02:27:55.100 --> 02:28:00.440]
A young woman in the audience of the taping of the culvert reported penthouse denied as Stephen Culver during a warm-up

[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.420]
Are you more afraid of bears or Hillary Clinton?

[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:07.440]
Even though Democratic elders worry that the two candidates will terminally bloody each other

[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.900]
They seem to be lighting their own autos d'affet, whatever that means

[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:12.200]
I have no idea what that is

[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:12.340]
Nope

[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:12.800]
Neither

[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.800]
At max points when Hillary fights like a cornered raccoon, Obama retreats into law professor mode

[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.060]
The elitism that Americans dislike is not about family money or connections

[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:24.560]
JFK&W had never been elected without them

[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:28.900]
In the scubaugh movie genre that started during the last depression there was a great tradition of the millionaire

[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:31.020]
Who was cool enough to relate to the common man

[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:34.140]
Like Carrie Grant, CK Dexter, Haven, and the Philadelphia story

[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:37.280]
What turns off voters is the detached egghead quality

[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:40.220]
They tend to equate with limpiness, wordiness, and lack of action

[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:45.280]
The same quality that cut the professional and superior Adley Stevenson mocked by critics' adelaide

[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:49.480]
The new attack line for Obama rivals has been gone from JFK to New Caucus

[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:54.780]
Just as New Caucus said it about Belgian end-ive, Obama said it about whole foods, arugula, and Iowa

[02:28:56.180 --> 02:28:58.580]
Obama didn't grow up in constant circumstances

[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:02.420]
Now when is the last time we've seen a president of the U.S. who just paid off his loan that?

[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:05.700]
Michelle Obama asked Tuesday in Heberford College, referring to Barack's student loans

[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:08.820]
While speaking in the shadow of the mansions, depicted in the Philadelphia story

[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:13.920]
But his exclusive Hawaiian prep school, and years in the Ivy League, made a matured a member of the elite

[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:16.080]
Along with the academic experts he loved to have in the room

[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:20.720]
As Colbert pointed out, the other wonky Ivy League lawyer in the primary just knows how to condescend better

[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.180]
Michelle did her best on the Colbert Report Tuesday to shoe away from the aroma of elitism

[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:30.920]
Growing up she said we had four spoons and then my father got arrested the plant and we got five spoons

[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:35.580]
That's what Marine, the Marine, besides using all his words we don't know

[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:41.220]
She seems to be flitting around, taking turns, taking shots, it's swallowing, taking shots at Obama

[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:47.260]
Taking a lot of shots, just like the ones that swallowing is drinking, drinking, dressing down

[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:49.180]
What's to do with a toilet and eleven votes?

[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:52.880]
Two eleven, we got it, so we got a thousand

[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:55.600]
Let's hear it! Let's go on Neil, bailing Chris out again

[02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:56.680]
Well thank you very much

[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:04.140]
Because we changed the poll and of course because George Gustaf had that queen thing, that pretty mercury thing

[02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:06.820]
George always goose in a queen

[02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:11.220]
Not always, so I'm so fish I'm going to Woodbine this afternoon, you excited?

[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:12.240]
I'm thrilled

[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:12.660]
Very

[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.980]
Well maybe I want a whole bunch of money and send you some

[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:15.980]
Nah, or not, right

[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.160]
Well why should I send you a bunch of money?

[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:20.660]
I give up, why?

[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:22.740]
Why?

[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:26.400]
I didn't expect you to, I didn't ask you to, I didn't think you would

[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:29.920]
Then it sounded like he was second around for some of my Woodbine winnings, Chris?

[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:31.520]
Oh yeah, totally not

[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.280]
Just relax, you're so damn easy, it's just, say

[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:37.340]
Okay, whatever you say

[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:41.160]
And it's really sad the way I pick on you, knowing that you're, you know, down and out

[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.420]
Well not out yet, but getting clear

[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:44.380]
Yeah, yeah, we'll see

[02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:46.440]
Getting close, he's hanging on

[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:48.300]
But once he has that big meeting with Jolly Joe

[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:48.640]
Right

[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:53.860]
I don't know why you make the light of that, I think that's the light of anything you are

[02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:56.160]
I think it can only be a positive

[02:30:57.460 --> 02:30:58.340]
Got the positive

[02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:01.360]
The casual to back you up, you got all those appearances to back you up

[02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:03.500]
You got Chris there to back you up

[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:06.520]
And with the money they're paying him, they ought to be paying you a reasonable living salary

[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:07.860]
Because he sure ain't getting no more

[02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:12.800]
Make sure you mention that to Jolly Joe, the Chris is overpaid

[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:13.460]
I will

[02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:13.940]
Overpaid?

[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:14.640]
Hmm

[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:18.700]
It's like I think of some of the case that you need to feed your starving family

[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:19.060]
That's right

[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:22.140]
That's right Chris, I just got one thing to tell George Wayne how's that meeting

[02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:24.240]
Oh I think it's worth it

[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:25.880]
It's what George said before

[02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:26.720]
I think that only is

[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:27.120]
Yeah

[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:28.480]
Court a lot of balls

[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:31.400]
Say what?

[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:32.940]
Where where did that come from?

[02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:33.340]
I don't know

[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.400]
Like to somebody in my voice there

[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:38.280]
No, seriously where did the mo come where?

[02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:43.440]
I don't know, maybe it was auto started in here from yesterday I don't know

[02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:46.880]
I think I heard 506 right up

[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:48.040]
And that is it

[02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:49.160]
560

[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:54.240]
Oh he's back on the ear somewhere, I read that, where did I read that?

[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.340]
He's got one of those 10 Mods stations you know that I'll call WFTL

[02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.260]
But Crow is back, let's hear it

[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:01.760]
Were you aware of that?

[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:02.880]
No, no

[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:04.960]
Does anybody care?

[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:07.280]
He and his following Greg read like them

[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:12.300]
But then again Greg read like anybody who ever wore a jog strap or a sniffing

[02:32:12.940 --> 02:32:15.660]
Exactly, well Greg was busy sniffing him in the screw-in

[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:18.640]
Well she was doing more than just sniffing

[02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:23.200]
George will be a public and starts house on proper pleasure of a leads and technique

[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:28.120]
These are the kind of Yehu rednecks man that have made America what it is today and I'm not proud to say it

[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:35.440]
A freshman Georgia Republican wanted to stress the importance and divine oversight of the U.S. as he sought portrayed in the Pledge of Allegiance

[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:39.160]
Leading the Pledge in the House floor Monday represented the Paul Brown

[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:42.580]
Lectured others in the chamber about the correct way of saying the Pledge

[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:50.980]
There should not be a comma between one nation and under God brown told his colleagues before beginning his rendition of a pause-free Pledge

[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:59.480]
It may seem a minor issue but some of our give it saying the Pledge as Brown prefers and as it was written when under God was inserted in 1954

[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:03.140]
implies a field to religion that is inappropriate in the U.S. that's correct

[02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:09.800]
A lot of comma the phrase indicates that the central characteristic of the U.S. as a political community is in its subordination to God

[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:15.200]
Road history professor Matthew Dennis after the Supreme Court rejected an intent to strike under God as unconstitutional

[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:22.080]
In short the political community is defined by its religious charge a Pledge that states this becomes in the words of the Ninth Circuit

[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:27.240]
In permissible government endorsement of religion functioning to enforce a religious orthodoxy of monotheism

[02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:35.200]
The Pledge had no reference to the enneil until 1954 when Cold War fevers its inclusion to separate Americans from those godless Communists

[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:42.760]
The Supreme Court dismissed the case arguing that the phrase violated first amendment guarantees a freedom of religion because the plate had no standing to argue the case

[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:45.420]
Not because of any inherent legal justification for the phrase

[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:52.760]
A Brown spokesman even said there should be no pause to emphasize there is no separation or implied separation between nation and God

[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:56.040]
So his house floor lesson may be more than just a pension for details

[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:02.880]
As the Marine Cleary's had to face a lot more difficult challenges than instructing members of Congress on the property of saying the Pledge of Allegiance

[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:07.640]
spokesman John Kennedy to a role calls heard on the Hill column there was in fact no comment that section

[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:13.220]
So correctly it said one nation under God no separation or implied separation between nation and God

[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:14.140]
One nation under God

[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:20.420]
A first term lawmaker from Northeastern corner of Joe Jan or Rio de A who probably from Aintree

[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:24.200]
Brown's House floor admonition was not his only attempt once he had got further into American life

[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:28.980]
Last November he supported a resolution honoring a group promoting the Ten Commandments

[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:34.280]
I commend the Ten Commandments Commission for the efforts to remind Americans that we are in fact one nation under God

[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:36.740]
He said at the time of course he was referring to...

[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:37.320]
AL GOD

[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:40.100]
The biggest name to the UN now

[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:41.680]
It was no politics

[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.000]
Forty-of-five sixty-two AM

[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.800]
The sports leader

[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:48.120]
It's a republic baby only a Miami

[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:52.840]
People are skeptical of my statements about my trip to Bosnia

[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:57.360]
Perhaps you're skeptical because the media found out it wasn't in the least bit true

[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:01.820]
But I maintain it was a terrifying trip during the flight

[02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:03.860]
Sinbad took off his shoes

[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.480]
The Inflite movie was just big-a-low male jiggle-o

[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:12.940]
My press secretary fell asleep on my shoulder and drooled on me

[02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:16.520]
There was a crying baby and they ran out of lines

[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.600]
So as you can see I truly am the crisis ready candidate

[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.600]
Oh my God was a cyber fire!

[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:24.640]
I'm gonna put the deck in coming!

[02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:27.640]
That was just a flash bulb Mrs. Clinton

[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:28.320]
Oh!

[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:33.940]
You see I cackle in the face of danger

[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:38.840]
One thirty-one and five sixty WQIM

[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:40.480]
We got jerks coming up into this afternoon

[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:42.940]
It's been through in a lot of F's and MF's and stuff like that

[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:44.780]
They may have missed when we hate how little we were there

[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:45.580]
What?

[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:46.540]
I'll listen for that

[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:47.840]
Yeah, there you go

[02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:53.160]
Then we don't have to worry about taking an office pool on when his line show is gonna be

[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:55.200]
Look, it's still do that

[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.480]
No, that's bad. That would be better

[02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:59.000]
It would be like dancing on somebody's grave

[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:01.780]
It's not their grave if they're not doing that

[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:06.360]
How come these people are sending me all these pedophile pre-stories

[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:08.020]
While the holy father is in Washington

[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:08.920]
I don't think that's why

[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:11.360]
That's bad. There he is in the pope. We'll be looking at that

[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:12.200]
Is it the White House?

[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:14.820]
Oh my God, Washington welcomes the papa

[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:16.560]
Hey, my papa

[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:20.840]
Okay, remember actually, oh that's the end of that boy

[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:22.860]
I was quick and to the point. Thank God

[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:28.540]
Frustration continues for the alleged victims of accused pedophile priest Reverend John Xanter

[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:32.100]
Xanter was back in a Worcester Mass courtroom on Friday

[02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:35.720]
A judge says he needs more time to decide if Xanter is competent to stand trial

[02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:38.900]
Although it says here to stand trails

[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.160]
Sitting in a wheelchair Reverend John Xanter appeared in Worcester District Court

[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:48.840]
The former priest in a Worcester diocese is accused of anal raping of two Worcester altar boys in the 1980s

[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:54.840]
At Frustration's competency hearing the question was whether or not Xanter is competent to stand trial

[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:57.160]
His lawyer argued his client is incapable of it

[02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.440]
His brother Paul was called in as a witness

[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:04.520]
He said his brother is suffering physically and mentally in capable of comprehending basic questions

[02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:11.000]
The prosecution pushed for a judge Richard Dony to review Xanter made to a doctor during medical evaluation

[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.340]
It says Xanter gave correct answers when a doctor asked him to remember his past dating Bollywood back to his childhood

[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.220]
One of the alleged victims, Michael Chancinus, was in the courtroom

[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:24.780]
He's been waiting for Xanter to stand trial since charges were brought against the former priest five years ago

[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.400]
I don't know who to believe or who not to believe all I can do is keep showing up and open to justice will have her ways

[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.500]
Said this priest raked me many times

[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:36.900]
He would tell me that this was how a good altar boy was to behave and that my place when heaven was secure

[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:42.000]
The things that this man made me do in the name of the Lord still makes me sick to this day he'd be saying

[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.220]
In the name of the Lord in the name of the God that's right

[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.640]
So yes they are routed up date for it

[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:52.740]
Oh oh oh

[02:37:53.900 --> 02:38:01.080]
We can buy it with the company meaning buy it have it shipped to us and then ship it to you which will take about five days

[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:03.780]
If you don't want to go out and just buy it yourself

[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:05.460]
Yeah they'll do that

[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:08.400]
Order it and then ship it to you

[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.620]
But if it's like only 50 or 60 or 70 bucks I mean for a decent one what what what's the big one

[02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:13.740]
You don't want to get one

[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:15.940]
Why? Just let you know what was said

[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.780]
I think I should just go out and get my own

[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:19.540]
Right on

[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:22.900]
Tell them I'm going to get my own like I get everything else my own

[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:23.720]
I'll do it

[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:26.320]
Or I can go on my own and get a chip and have it here one day

[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:26.900]
Right

[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:30.720]
But Tom thanks anyway that was very wide of them okay

[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:32.480]
That was a good way

[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:34.840]
Okay

[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:37.640]
Considering the stuff that did it I'll tell them

[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:39.320]
Well he's a good guy and he's a good guy

[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:41.720]
I never meant him tonight

[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:42.420]
He's off white

[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.380]
Is he off white? Yeah

[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:46.800]
He's got plenty of artisans he's a very good guy

[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:49.780]
What do you mean like plenty of artisans he's not going to start

[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:51.100]
Yeah yeah he can start

[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:54.340]

And it's a long time ago

[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:00.860]
We haven't done these music pools in a long time

[02:39:00.860 --> 02:39:03.040]
In a raccoon's age

[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:06.000]

Yep

[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:23.660]

What I mean he has three hours to make all kinds of executive decisions last week and now this week

[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:32.700]
He's like a paper tiger because Joe is so beast intensive now that it's just nauseating

[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:38.400]
The beast and I were a windbag and Ira and the beast and that's like Jimmy and Danny all over again

[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:43.540]
The best male singer is Freddie Mercury 43 George Gustat up big time

You got to die up there

[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.500]
I'll die somewhere but not until I'm through with my last contract I'll tell you that

[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.480]
I'm here I'm good you'll 2013 to the end of it February 22nd 2001

[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.020]
I was going to die so over seven years ago so people would say oh well you know I keep repeating the same old polls

[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:35.800]
Well at least we're not doing a hamburger one every day for like eight months

[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:42.180]
Now I want somebody to compile for us a list of all the places that took you head on there for the best burger in time

[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:47.580]

[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:23.640]
Jim Morrison come on people claim that he's got the greatest voice of all time it is soothing warm and soothing buttery

[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:30.320]
Yeah is that how you would describe it buttery rider is on the storm he was great I like Jim Morrison a lot

[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.000]

[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:50.800]
490 you're dead I can't feel the pedal

[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:58.880]
I won't try anymore till the price is small I think where I guess they can't afford to pay for it

[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:00.900]
There's nothing you can do about it

[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:06.240]
So if there's anybody who thinks I'm bringing one of my Corvette so period it's now over five bucks ago and for regular here now

[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:12.820]
So by the way update yes you buy that router fill out an expense report company reimbursees you how's that

[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:16.440]
And what about the 180 bucks I spent on this backup power supply

[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:18.740]
Well I did not ask about that obviously

[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:26.900]
No I don't I don't listen I don't need it okay okay people are starving all right I don't know I can handle my own studio here

[02:45:26.900 --> 02:45:30.220]
This year starting next year different story

[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:36.820]
Facts paper um facts machines anything it needs for this studio they won't be getting expense on next year

[02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:41.400]
I'll make sure you got lots of those sheets that's right give me lots of sheet oh there's Tiger Woods

[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:47.540]
He's not only for a month after surgery oh my god how are we gonna survive without the Tiger the Tiger

[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:55.540]
You people are all wrapped up with the Tiger and with golf man you desperately desperately I have no life need to see Dr. Jack Aworkin

[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:00.880]
Lifeless oh and even got Dr. Sanjay Gupta here must be really important

[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:10.360]
Apparently was causing him pain oh he's getting pain the Tiger he's got that hot blonde wife he's got millions and millions and millions of dollars for playing golf

[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:17.360]
Then I make you want to vomit yeah mix me nauseous

[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:28.380]
Global hot spots of hunger set to explode as food prices continue to escalate worldwide some of the

[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:32.120]
First nations in developing world are in danger of social and political upheavals

[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:39.800]
The unrest which is like the desperate in early 40 countries has been triggered largely by sharp increase in the prices of staple commodities including weed,

[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:45.940]
rice, sorghum, maize and soybeans according to the wind I don't even know what sorghum is it's a thing

[02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:54.840]
Oh I seen a few of those it's like a wheat to grain following last week's food riots in Haiti

[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:57.360]
Which spend the lives of four people what happened they ran out of mud?

[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:03.940]
That's gonna stay Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has appeared at the international donors for urgent assistance

[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:11.320]
Some of the poorest countries in the Caribbean take the money that you would buy for a sped on the router and send it to Haiti to feed some starving

[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:17.900]
Shluppers a meeting of the world's finance ministries of Washington over the weekend warned that rising food prices were more of a threat of

[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:25.540]
Political and social stability than the current crisis in global capital markets the food and agriculture organization the FAAO

[02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:30.000]
A single-out six countries with an exceptional shortfall and aggregate food production and supplies

[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.100]
The South O which I never heard of Somalia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Iraq and Moldova

[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:35.780]
Moldova

[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:40.340]
Where the hell are those places Moldova? Moldova

[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:42.800]
That's what happened a mosehead at Moldova

[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:51.660]
An additional six countries with widespread lack of access to food and food, Eritrea, Liberia, Mauritania, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, North Korea

[02:47:51.660 --> 02:47:52.960]
Sierra Leone

[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:56.120]
Was that a movie with John Wayne?

[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:57.440]
I don't know

[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:01.560]
Here's the facts, Neil listen to your tech guy, it's better to pay a little more, get the better router

[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:04.700]
What does that mean?

[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:07.700]
Oh, in other words listen to Eric

[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:10.160]
Is Eric our tech guy?

[02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:15.300]
Eric is our, he's our asin that like they say in America are asa, phew, ass

[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:22.320]
I assume that he's telling you to buy the D-Link gaming router which is designed for gamers who need a low latency

[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:24.760]
And is very good, well what does that mean? Gamers?

[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:28.500]
Like people who play computer games I imagine is what they're talking about

[02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:31.640]
No, I don't play no computer games, I don't gamble online

[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:33.680]
Never the last keep reading

[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:39.020]
And it is a very good router, if you're using it for phone calls you may notice a verse like the life I'm going to call a speech when you hear it

[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.040]
And the other way around if you're using a cheaper higher latency router, well I don't need that, I need a better one

[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:43.440]
Right

[02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:46.860]
Also perhaps more appropriate term would be shrillery instead of swillery

[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:48.840]
Well that's not bad, sure, I like that

[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.540]
Shrillery, I'll just say swillery, look at that 68 on Thursday and 68 on Friday

[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:58.500]
Holy cow man, spring is strong, the sun is shining, it's beautiful

[02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:01.220]
You wouldn't believe it

[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:02.820]
You believe it?

[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:04.020]
I believe it

[02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:07.880]
Oh, see just to be contrary, I told you wouldn't believe it, I believe it

[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:09.640]
It's already 17, it's 63

[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:15.440]
Do you have any idea how long and miserable and rotten this winter was here?

[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:18.180]
It was the only time since I've been here that winter was it was unacceptable

[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:22.720]
I'm protesting to Don No, even though we ain't there no more

[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.000]
No

[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:29.060]
Let's see, how about George Michael from Wham?

[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:30.760]
Do you want to miss Michael?

[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:33.460]
Is he a singer of all time?

[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:35.480]
What we can put around here?

[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:38.660]
And why does it say George Michael from Wham?

[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:42.360]
Wasn't George Michael a solo much much much much like now?

[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.740]
Longer than he was with Wayne with that to his boyfriend?

[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:48.240]
Wake me up before you go-gos

[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:49.060]
Uh-huh

[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:52.880]
God, what a horrendous, what a gay song

[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:56.700]
Yeah, what do you expect from a gay guy?

[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:02.100]
A lot of John doesn't do gay songs, I mean, although he did give all that money to Shrillery

[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:05.940]
I'm not real pleased about that, but you know it's free country, you can do whatever he wants

[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.360]
But all his big bucks, go give it to Shrillery

[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:12.980]
Like I said, it's a fag-hag thing, you know she's probably a big fan

[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:17.140]
In fact maybe they hang out in the same clubs

[02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:23.820]
Is that Miss Michael?

[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:24.760]
Of course

[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:27.740]
Why don't you play something good? He did have a couple of good songs

[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:28.620]
They were

[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:29.400]
That ain't one

[02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:31.300]
This is a big hit

[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:39.000]
We're gonna have Chris and got a thousand and fifty eight votes over here

[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.980]
Yeah, that ain't one of that crap people

[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:46.820]
Sounds like he- sounds like this time he's actually using a traffic

[02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:04.300]
Markey

[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:09.560]
Horrible

[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:36.120]
But there was Andrew it's the two, I couldn't help myself he looks so good

[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:42.800]
After all that removes with me, cold kid man, and Tom Cruiseball eyed

[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:45.900]
Glad we were sexually missed for him

[02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:52.540]
Oh, but I heard them both say, George Mike goes gone man

[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:57.240]
We were never naked with that guy on, that's a costly shame

[02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.240]
Yeah, wanna have sex son

[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:02.060]
I gotta have sex son

[02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:05.080]
Yeah, I gotta have sex, a sex, a sex son

[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:07.780]
I gotta have sex, a sex, a sex son

[02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:10.580]
What's the biggest name to the best talent?

[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:16.080]
The fourth leader

[02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:18.240]
It's day-out

[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:20.120]

WQA

[02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:37.080]
Back in the day when someone was wrong

[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:40.460]
We didn't take their crap

[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:44.560]
In Pearl Harbor, when the Japs dropped their bombs

[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:47.320]
We bombed them bad

[02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:50.860]
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard

[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:54.040]
And on our cards our little flags wave

[02:52:54.040 --> 02:53:00.480]
Has that Saudi-loving, retired voice of bombers to runway

[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:07.660]
And oven barris to be in America

[02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:11.400]

The United States of Americans

[02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:17.000]
And by push and its family

[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.940]
We they grab this country

[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:24.400]
Happening for the largest days in our history

[02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:28.620]
I don't want to be a tax-american

[02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:33.000]
In the USA

[02:53:34.660 --> 02:53:36.460]

What's a few thousand innocent lives

[02:53:42.420 --> 02:53:44.380]
Stop living in the past

[02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:48.720]
If you want that SUV to drive

[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:51.340]
You're gonna need more gas

[02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:55.700]
It's the greatest country in the world

[02:53:56.380 --> 02:53:57.940]
They train us to believe

[02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:00.940]
And anyone who says that

[02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:02.060]
Obviously

[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:07.780]
