[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660]
Back from vacation today is the great Neil Rogers. Are you there? It used to be great

[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.920]
Well, you lost today not when we're not great. We're all in the toilet nice going Greg and Joyce

[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460]
We've been having you figured it out. You're one of the few finished Jews

[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.080]
Yeah, stick of fork in his book. We're finished. We're finished. We're Scandinavian yet. We're done

[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.420]
It's been a nice run. We're done. Don't forget everybody go out and vote you get to 430 this afternoon

[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.360]
And all day tomorrow 7 to 7 vote yes

[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.640]
Do listen to our fat ass governor and all is propaganda from the Christian coalition and the Indians and all this other belonging

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.460]
This is we know some both sides have run disgraceful campaigns

[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.420]
But the bottom line is this if you wait if you're for fun and entertainment and

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.020]
Information that do which our governor is against education which the poll shows that the overwhelming majority of people in South Florida

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.180]
That's the number one priority money for education

[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.400]
Yeah

[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.500]
Not a very nice thing. Why don't we even if money but none of it stays here?

[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.380]
And believe me even if none of it's gonna stay there a part of it's gonna stay you know over the state not enough

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.260]
Well

[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.860]
Something is better than nothing. Yeah

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.040]
But you know what if this thing passes this governor has a history with the bullet train with the class size

[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.040]
Vogue you know he he rejects everything that the people want and

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.820]
You don't want to listen to the red state people. This is your chance to stand up and vote vote for what you want

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.700]
Instead of having people run your wife or Greg Reed getting lynched. That's what I say and Joyce

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840]
Like can we have a package deal a package a package lynching you weren't happy with the trends

[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.780]
You haven't lost it man

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.100]
By the way a little footnote to rich passing way by the way to top and oh far. Yeah

[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.760]
He had in his pocket he had a winning pick for ticket

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.240]
So he went out of winner a compound part. I mean it's a horrible story

[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.300]
Yeah, you know, you know some of when when Jimmy the Greek

[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.060]
die we went to a funeral and

[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.720]
Put a couple of hundred dollar mutual tickets from high alia inside the coffin. So yeah, something to think with them

[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.080]
But he was still was oh nice very nice. Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to pick on a guy when he's dead

[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.800]
You know what I'm sorry about rich I

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.660]
Last week I did good guy, but he was in denial. He was really fat

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.420]
And he had all kinds of hard problems and you know you can only full mother nature so long

[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.780]
But he was a great guy with a big heart. Wow. I know

[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.740]
I love that very sad story nobody talks about me. You'll chuck Thompson day

[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.300]
You know I did a whole thing on Chuck earlier

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.940]
When I was working at JNO in Palm Beach 1975 I met Chuck Thompson yeah, I was were playing the

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.980]
West Palm exposor. Well, whatever the hell they were what we had going there and I met Chuck Thompson and

[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640]
What's his name Milo Hamilton which everybody hates him like poison? I thought he was a pretty good guy

[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.380]
Oh, he was a terrific guy chuck and gold on all used to be a great combination on oil

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.640]
You know what I talked about this earlier in my show, Neil that

[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.700]
Yeah, signature voices like Chuck's they're all gone most of them are gone

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.840]
You know, that's what I keep that's what I keep talking about and of course pumps there like Josh quarters

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.920]
Oh, no, you're wrong. You know, I'd like to know one broadcast

[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.280]
It was come along in the last 20 years who's gonna be like legendary like a Chuck Thompson or a Milo Allen or a Bob Prince or

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.620]
The grapefruit or Harry carry that we grew up with they just don't exist their cookie cutter guys now or they're terminally

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.400]
A coma inducing like they've been boring which of course, Josh can't talk about that because he has to sit there and keep

[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.720]
Poking the ribs to keep him awake during the game. That's exactly what I was talking about. You know is the lack of signature voices in this run

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.220]
You know you think about it. Sonny was a signature voice and

[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:55.120]
River was the signature voice of the top and I think mad dog became very associated with the dolphins and I'll tell you one other guy and that's

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.400]
You know what's his name?

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.600]
Read

[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:07.360]
No, what's his name? Not Greg but Eric Reed. I forgot Greg's name actually it was Erica. I wanted to say you're trying to forget

[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.480]
That would be a good move but Eric Eric Reed has been the original preserving mental health would be to forget Greg

[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.040]
He forever but Eric Reed has been the heats and answers from the beginning

[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.660]
I wonder if we can get a hold of Luca Brotzi you think he was sleeping with the fishes. I got a package deal for him

[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.180]
He sleeps with the fishes choice and Greg

[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.400]
But anyway, you were saying that's it read I don't like Eric Reed he talks to his teeth

[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.780]
I don't like guys that yeah, he would be very good if he'd stop doing it

[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.420]
But he won't stop talking to his teeth. He does that. You're right. Yeah, he does do that

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.740]
And I don't know why because he's very very good broadcast about talks to his teeth

[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.940]
He does that affected she have an old sheavener that kind of stuff, but he's the guy who's been the heat guy

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.480]
All right, but the more I know he's not no, he's not are you forgetting Dave Halver stand? What is wrong?

[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.200]
No, no, Eric was always

[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.600]
He wasn't always to play by play guy by the way

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.520]
He started as the analyst and became the play guy

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.100]
Yeah, and he'd be and he's been the TV guy

[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.820]
Howie was the radio guy until he got screwed over and meanwhile the guy they brought in his no improvement believe me right

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.080]
Howie's a good guy. Oh, I love howie brings humontosh into the station

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.360]
Yeah, that's him. Yeah, well Neil. I went that note. I went to Gulfstream for the first time on Saturday really

[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.780]
Well, I had to do the show for you to show ID to show that you're old enough

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.320]
I had to do the ABC show from there on the fountain of youth. Yeah, and I hit five exactas in a row

[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.140]
But I'm not going back until I have you. Yeah, why don't I gonna talk dollars

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.760]
But I had two very good days of woodbine over the weekend. I'm back

[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.180]
So it I rest because you rest and by the way governor fat ass. There's no crime at woodbine. Okay, it's beautiful

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.560]
It's clean the money is poured in there people are having a good time. They got a beautiful restaurant everything is great

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.880]
Okay, you couldn't ask for a safer place in the world. There's no pick pockets. There's no crimes all of this crap

[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.220]
What was the last time you were a race once what have you ever been raped in Las Vegas? No, me neither I know somebody who was

[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.140]
Yeah, yeah, he's been raped in it everywhere. So at least he's consistent. I

[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.760]
Won't lose too much this afternoon. In fact, he might have had some impact on our numbers

[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.080]
Correct. Yeah, he might have done that to him when he did move into four o'clock

[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.320]
See that's another thing. I mean, do we want to rehash all of that nobody has any idea where anybody was on we went through

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.820]
Just a nightmare

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.600]
First I think that from what I understand it was a big big Spanish language you put when that happens

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.200]
Real radio stations now, but real radio stations will send a message to them

[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.760]
You know to you know to the people who take the surveys

[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.680]
Yeah, and what that does is the next month they'll open compensating you'll come back. That's how it works

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.760]
Well, we need their help. Let's put it that way man

[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.760]
We need to rally the troops send a message like Joey Zaza. We're sending them a message

[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.220]
Jesus I'm just a motherfucker here. We're hanging out. We're like an anchor man. We're just hanging out by our thumbs

[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.800]

[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.860]
From life from reality. He's going to the hiding again, you know

[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.040]
Well, there's a crisis on take to good time when the trend came on man. You can't complain to our about our numbers. We don't have any

[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.020]

[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.860]
How come our fat ass governor isn't all bad out of shape about that crap?

[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.820]
He can't control it. He's with their phony below me. Well, yeah, there you go. He can't control it big deal

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.860]

He wants it all going to his parochial. His a crystallized all his glam to get all the money. That's what he wants

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.620]

But Ron is looking river man's stormer. No, really we didn't meet it up this time

[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.140]
According to recently released paper co-agnes made several years ago

[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.220]
President Bush is clearly indicating that he may have tried marijuana at some time in the past

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.880]
This sparkling revolution may explain his world speech questionable intelligence and

[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.540]
Disappearance from national guard duty during the Vietnam era. No, I just can't let that go

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.500]
Sorry, not wanting to say I told his own this reporter will take the high road and say only

[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.500]

Certainly will they have this we have our ways of doing it. Okay. We'll get to the stupid ass trend

[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.260]
I don't even know if we want to bother with them. Okay, we're done. And of course it's interesting to see

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.180]

He was just he did the 60 TV call on the a world serious with Maserowski at the home run on the bottom of the tent

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.060]
That

[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.440]
My lunch would come up with conversation if her name was involved that's much because of the boobies

[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.240]
But because of the fact she was making out with that girl and then she's not here. Who cares? Is the audience really that desperate?

[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.340]
By the way, just thought I printed this pull out. Oh here it is. Here's your pull from Friday

[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.680]

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.980]

[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.820]
Oh

[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.140]
No, when I was a kid

[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.520]
All my friends just to come on over to my place because they knew my mom and been down to Windixie

[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.380]
She'd always had something good for all of us

[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:27.200]
Hey one day my sister found this dog running to the store called it he guessed it windixie

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.820]
Nowadays though things are getting tough

[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.360]
Ever since Windixie the player bank wrote it's been slim pickings around here

[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.320]
Good thing mama went belly up for Windixie did her and would have killed her

[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.180]
But everybody still comes over to my place and all those

[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.100]
coverage getting mayor waiting always whip up something good

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.320]
Windixie there

[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.640]
You're real tender aren't you?

[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.640]
Something I learned in korean

[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.760]
And if anybody complained about hearing their food

[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.700]
We'll just blame it on Windixie

[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.180]
1018 that's a beautiful thing at 560 wqam our new poll is up

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.180]
Can wqam recover from Greg Reeds latest blunders or are we doomed?

[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.400]
Are we doomed?

[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.700]
Here's the choices. Yes, I love the new lineup. We can recover. We'll be back

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.800]
That's what Claire was in Duffer try to talk each other and do and the interest is starting to scrap all what was a heavy

[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.220]
Hispanic

[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:29.820]
But I'm on the air right how how long are these kind of excuses gonna fly huh when you get the kind of numbers that we had

[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.300]
Is the first time in I've been on the market almost 30 years now

[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.480]
First time I ever had a monthly rating trend where it had a minus in front of all of our numbers

[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.200]
You know what I mean? What do you mean like we owe points anyway? Yes, I love the new lineup

[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.000]
Don't care. I only listen to Neil. We got that bunch. Greg is a genius

[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.220]
Yeah, I've actually made a bell votes for that and a couple of the other sucklings in the building there

[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:59.060]
No, you've jerked around the audience too much the stern business was the end for Greg the horse you and for leave clover must have fallen out

[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.800]
That was my vote Greg must have stood up real fast and like oh they both fell out or at wax

[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.640]
He will destroy you guys. He does every every possible angle on a right there

[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.020]
Because this trend especially after all the changes and all the format and we got Mo on it this time and

[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.600]
Mad dog is he coming is he staying is he leaving is he on two to four is he on four to seven who's on first is most staying as he leaving his

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.500]
Gully, but I ever get the hell off the air already when it's squeaky voice

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.440]
What's going on over here, huh? And then they put stern on here

[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.680]
They let him build up a little momentum even though they screwed us over big time

[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.720]
And then they yank him off all of a sudden and put Hank in there and like all of a sudden bingo magic's gonna happen

[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.120]
Well, like I keep telling everybody it's like you're in a horse race. There's seven horses in a race

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.880]
You're the best horse by far the gate opens you open up a five-length lead you're coming around the turn

[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.460]
The rest of the field he left him in the dust like secretary in a bellmont and all of a sudden

[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.600]
They blow to whistle. I guess what you got to go back to the beginning start all over again

[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.880]
Everybody else they can keep on going. They got their momentum going

[00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:00.140]
You got to go back to the beginning start all over again. Well, how many times can you do that? How many times can you overcome that handy crap?

[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.640]
You see what I'm saying? Yeah, wow and look at that phone

[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.160]
You see this tremendous response we got here on this phone here this morning. That's tremendous

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.680]
This audience ought to be worked up into a frenzy. I know you probably exhausted all the intellectual colors last week

[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.260]
Right and drug everyone else away. No. Well, wait me to everyone else

[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.880]
It's all we can't let was your intellectual crowd now

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.040]
I'm right. They heard they heard this old fag voice made it. Uh-oh. We're out of here

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.180]
WQAM are only called hello. Oh, yes, sir. What's the matter with what?

[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.640]
Hey, Neil. Yeah, hey

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.160]
I'm talking to the little doll they were

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.600]
They were on 710 WGBS in the early 70s down here

[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.780]
That's we we know all about them here too. Oh, that's right when the Orioles used to train right?

[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.260]
What if I know that but they had them the whole season down here on the radio

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.520]
Right then the other channel

[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:51.960]
710

[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.680]
GBS

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.940]
Can another used to work there WGBS and what who was the other guy with red rush with the white socks because they were on KAT

[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.920]
Uh white socks have probably my lower Hamilton. No, no, no

[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.520]
Red rush and somebody else Bob Elson

[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.420]
Bob that you're the best. Yes, I am

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.520]
I just wanted to throw that 710 WGBS. By the way, Bob Elson. He's dead too. Yeah, everybody's dead. Sorry

[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.920]
I'm sorry. Well sooner or later it'll get us all good luck to you, pal. How do you like that?

[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.540]
Somebody responding to Chuck Thompson dying. All right. What a great broadcaster. He's no dayband boring

[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.260]
Thank God. I got news for you boys and girls. I got a whole new altitude. How do you like that? Huh?

[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.340]
I'm holding nothing back. I'm letting all hang right out. You know what I mean?

[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.800]
I'm so sick and tired of mediocrity and involved all of this crap

[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.860]
We're surrounded. We're drowning in a poor pool of swill. By the way, good movie shattered with the time

[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.440]
Beringer and Bob Hoskins. Did I see that? What was that about? It's about a guy who was in his terrible car crash

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.640]
And he forgot his wife and everybody and etc and so on. I don't want to spoil that. I'm familiar

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.180]
And a wife only got like a couple of superficial scratches

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:00.620]
And he was like a and they did plastic surgery. It's got so many twists and turns and it's pretty damn good

[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.640]
I'll check it out. Some Beringer's usually pretty good. You only only one bad movie. He was ever in you know

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.060]
If that was no, I forgot it was Eddie and the cruisers. Oh, yeah, you're right boy. Yeah

[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.460]
He was another mad Tom Beringer's always in good movies, but this one's very good

[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.160]
Well, he played Eddie in the cruisers. He was in it. Okay. He was one of those. There was Doc in a world

[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.180]
I don't know what it like I know the names of the characters that he in the cruisers as long as it wasn't I know that the frog guy was in there

[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:28.320]
What that was his name Michael Pere was he Eddie? He was Eddie Michael Patten. Yeah, cuz he called me. What do we do?

[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.220]
This is Eddie

[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.880]
So Tom Beringer, Bob Hoskins and Shadard if you're looking for a DVD to render buyer steal pretty good

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.180]
I'd recommend it. Highly. I so Lansing WQ I am. Hello. Hey Neil. How are you today? You're finished station. We're done

[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.500]
Stick a fork in this baby

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:51.060]
I'm sick. Two seconds after you guys are talking about the vote for tomorrow. You guys are running a spot with the governor

[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.520]
Don't bring me for that and I can't say anything during that spot or the like sewer

[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.720]
I love you guys are idiots over there knock it off. Yeah, right. Thank you. Thank you

[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.680]
I'm like I'm not gonna say that. How can we accept that money man? We'll take anybody's money

[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.400]
That's what a bunch of whores we are putting that fat ass governor yours on here talking about crime

[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.220]
Let me tell you something Mr. Hockshot. How much crime do we have at the fair mutuals right now?

[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.140]
Is there any crime? No go out to woodbine. I don't I have never heard of it

[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.420]
There are about nine months have I even heard about a pick pocket about it? No in addition

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.480]
Which they don't hire private police they hire their own private security which they pay for how do you like that?

[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.880]
So here's another bush who lies and lies and lies in addition

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.840]
Which I thought he was governor the whole state all 67 counties and he's in Dayton, Broward County putting ads on here

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.880]
But well you're gonna be helping pay for education for the rest of the state so big deal. Okay. We'll take our piece

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.220]
Those mug ones could use a good

[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.840]
Here's the governor was supposed to be everybody's governor

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.140]
But what of course he's a lame duck anyway can't run again

[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.880]
So he doesn't have to worry about the rest of the state finding out in addition to which when they have people find out what he says behind

[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.920]
In a certain place it doesn't make any difference. They don't hold against them like that crap about his devious plans

[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.740]
This has worked the public's it's 75% of the people in South Florida the number one priority is education

[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.860]
So here's your chance to create

[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.820]
millions and millions of dollars for education all over the state including South Florida

[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.920]
And I what's the downside the downside is that there's gonna be less business for the grave robbing Indians and for Mickey Harrison

[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.060]
And that's 50 more reasons to vote tomorrow or today who want to go to 430

[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:27.540]
Don't take it for granted like the Humphor says don't just sit back and assume that it's gonna pass by a landslide because in November

[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:32.200]
Because you're only gonna get a fraction of the number of people voting this time that you had voting the presidential election

[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.700]
So don't let those born-again fanatics in the bush crowd go out there and defeat this because this this is basically your last chance

[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.680]
To emancipate South Florida from the rest of the state now. That's basically what it's all about

[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.000]
We got two different states. We got a bunch of Bible thumping redneck

[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.820]
lunatics born-again hypocrites beer swiggin

[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.760]
booze

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.040]
Likin whatever the hell they're doing. Just doing more right. That's it

[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.120]
I wonder how that governor's coke head daughters doing by the way

[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.000]
All right, she's doing pretty good. I think she's here lately. I think she sung the last noelle if he asked me

[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.680]
That bitch you're a liar you're a fat ass liar Jeb Bush okay runs in the family man you're a loser you're all

[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:19.000]
Your brother's a boozer and you're a loser. How do you like that? And your wife by the way is a smugger other than and your son is crazy

[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.780]
Than a bedbott right and your daughters are co-cat other than that

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.460]
Yeah, rumor I heard is that when he goes to the beach with that thong he wears he's got a crack problem

[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.440]
True too

[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.520]
Jeb Bush comes down here

[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.840]
Just go back to Tallahassee with a band-you-on-unee and mind your own business with all your cracker friends up there in the legislature

[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.340]
You loser man you lunatic and let the people of South Florida make up their own mind and vote

[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.420]
20 or 30 times tomorrow cut the crap all those one aren't bad. It's it's gonna be the other

[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.700]
It's okay if the Indians have got him that's all right. They're fooling me below me bingo slice slot machines

[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.520]
That's all right

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.740]
But if we have them at the paramutuals then the world is gonna come to an end as we used to know it

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.460]
God forbid that people might have a little bit of entertainment to some excitement going on

[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.320]
And then we increase the person so we have quality racing all year round

[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.600]
God forbid that good things like that should happen in South Florida where they've happened

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:12.680]
Airby place elsewhere they put in the slots from Dover Downs to Ontario, Canada every race track we got here to you name it everywhere

[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.040]
But anyway, am I getting a little bit too whipped up? I think so no

[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:23.440]
27 after 10 at 5 60 WQM where we're finished. I've been to Helsinki. It's a really great place

[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.900]
Oh the people they're beautiful. I know the ones I've seen wow

[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.180]
family

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.620]
Well, he's a talent has been at me

[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.600]
We've got the money from his daddy

[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.600]
Oh, and if I said my little friend

[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.600]
With the agenda that's right

[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.280]
Oh, well, he's a talent has been at me

[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.040]
No, but they're fillet

[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.760]
Oh

[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.380]
That is a president until son

[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.880]
Who doesn't have to run?

[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.240]
No one else is gonna win. He might as well just move right in

[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.120]
SIGHARD

[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:00.840]
SIGHARD

[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:03.940]
SIGHARD

[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.500]
He has to go to school and he was born with a disaster

[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.240]
So look out on you Jews

[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.040]
Get ready for the death. He's a talent has been at me

[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.700]
What?

[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.480]
If our table writes the whammy

[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.280]
Oh, why's he the talent has been at me?

[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.280]
No, but they're fillet

[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.180]
Well, he's a very wealthy Jew

[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.860]
With very faxous Jews

[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.140]
Who never pay his dues by makes here

[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.080]
Will all be screwed

[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.040]
SIGHARD

[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.700]
SIGHARD

[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.680]
SIGHARD

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.140]
Any spark to win that race

[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.280]
Against buddy, but hey, why do you think they call it scuba?

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.320]
Victoria, anyway, he's the talent has been at me

[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.180]
Oh, he makes it take a case, my peace

[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.340]
Oh, yeah, he's the talent has been at me

[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.320]
No, but they're fillet

[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.800]
Come home and do stuff

[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.800]
Come on, man

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.160]
Maybe we can just have a big auction in Florida raise money for education that way

[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.540]
The governor's wife can smuggle it all the goods that she wants

[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.300]
Billions of dollars worth, what do you say?

[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.020]
All right, I'm working on putting it in the wedding solid

[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.920]
Or maybe no wealth can just sell something that could powder, huh?

[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.400]
Or maybe they can all take a powder

[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.720]
Sounds like a good idea to me

[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.320]
What a bunch of crap, man, but we'll see what happens

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.160]
I think it's going to pass tomorrow. We've got to get out there and vote

[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.420]
Vote no

[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.700]
Vote yes

[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.680]
Yeah, I said boy that I was banned

[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.740]
That was an act of what's his name?

[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.060]
W

[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.760]
Vote yes tomorrow early and often, okay?

[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.580]
Then the vote no on Wednesday if you're against it you get to vote on Wednesday

[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.100]
If you're forward you get to vote yes tomorrow

[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.060]
Do you know that?

[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.540]
All right, let me say again if you're for the slots at the per mutuals

[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.160]
You vote tomorrow you vote and then you vote yes

[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.480]
If you're against it you go Wednesday and vote no

[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.240]
I got it. You got that?

[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.980]
Right away Josh Cordis, did you vote?

[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.720]
I did not. Why, why?

[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.760]
What? And why not?

[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.680]
I don't know. Now let me say this. I did get a jury duty again

[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.500]
For the second time in my life

[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.600]
You don't get jury duty because you vote, okay?

[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.740]
You don't get jury duty because you vote

[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.220]
They do that off your driver's license stuff so unless you're willing to give up your driver's license

[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.780]
You're going to continue getting called for jury duty, okay?

[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.040]
Well, I mean, this is the second time already

[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.980]
In only 21 I mean, I believe I just registered to vote and I got it again

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.520]
So you don't, you know, what did I just get through telling you?

[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.860]
They don't pick jury members by voter registration any more

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.000]
They do it by drivers license. You sure?

[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:26.620]
About that?

[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.840]
I'll bet your life on it. How do you like that?

[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.720]
Puts, so as long as you got jury duty again and you already registered to voting

[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.260]
Might as well vote anyhow, right? Tomorrow.

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.400]
All right. Now let's see. Here is a thing. Let's see.

[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.820]
I previously had no opinion on slot machines says this facts. I really don't care. But thanks to Jeff Bush

[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.740]
I'm going to plantation courthouse today to vote

[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.980]
Yes, that's right. Today is the yes vote and also tomorrow and then Wednesday if you're against the vote no on Wednesday

[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.780]
And I've played until the Bush supporters exactly that if Bush and the right wing Christians are against it

[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.040]
Then I'm for it F. Damn says this would several 80 million explanation points

[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.720]
Good going. Okay votes several times. Yes. Don't forget today tomorrow the days for the yes votes

[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.420]
Now what do we got to speaking of votes on our pool so far?

[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.500]
We are really and maybe I'm taking this a little bit to but it just gets to where you are to special when you're an old

[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.500]
troll like I am it gets to where you are a little bit that you have to keep going back into the starting gate and starting all your race over again

[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.240]
When you've run that long mile in 70 yards, you know, Jesus, K Christ

[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.500]
Every time we think we got things going like when we had Joe Rose back there in the spring

[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.940]
We somehow survived the forrel debacle somehow

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.540]
Even though we still don't have our license renewal by the way to see the story on Wednesday about the shareholders

[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.340]
We're notified about the eight complaints and speaking of complaints

[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.800]
I noticed that the unmentionable one was on 60 minutes last night. I saw

[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.040]
With a video game thing

[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.300]
Oh, yeah, yeah, the great tape crusader baby

[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.980]
Everything needs to be censored censored. Let's just go to his house. He'll tell us what's not again nice

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.420]
I'd like to get the real story on that hold here, you know, oh

[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:59.000]
Anyway 94 votes can WQM recover from Greg Reads latest blunders or are we doomed?

[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.840]
Don't care. I only listen to the ill 52 see there's a problem with this pull

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.220]
And you know what that is right off the bat sat the people who are gone aren't gonna be voting on it. There you go

[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:13.040]
That's it. They're gone like furlin husky on capital records since you've gone remember that

[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.140]
I actually had to play furlough. I know you told me that in my defenses. Why so

[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.180]
Since you've gone

[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.040]
Lordy we miss you bad. We never thought we'd miss you

[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.300]
Anyway, don't care. I'll listen to the ill 52 55.3 percent. Yes. I love the new lineup

[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.800]
We can bounce back 12 people say that a duty doesn't

[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.880]
Know you just jerk the audience around too much 11 the stern business was the n for Greg a we can only pray

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.260]
The horseshoe and for the clover must have fallen out meaning Greg's

[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.520]
Raccoon asked for said that he must have stood up real fast

[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.780]
Especially when he saw these trends. Oh the horse and let's see and Waxi is going to Greg is a genius five

[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.700]
Let's see that's Maddie Bell the water Nazi Gary Sarner and Greg must have Antarillon. Okay. That's the five votes

[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.080]
And Waxi will destroy you guys three out of 101 votes. That's what we got so far

[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.880]
Wtq a m hello

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.200]
Death now radio. How you doing?

[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.720]
Hey that movie

[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.920]
Cruises I like that movie

[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.980]
Camp it was ahead of moments now the bad one was they made you actually made a sequel to that. I know I saw that that was really bad

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:18.740]
But why did you do this? Why do you ruin the whole idea of the first movie? Right when he

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.560]
He was going to the concert and he saw the guys the other fake Eddie right

[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.580]
Oh

[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.480]
God what a chuckle anyway

[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.480]
Another movie the one you

[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:41.740]
Shattered the movie shattered Tom Barron's or dead as a good movie there's another movie that's similar to it called

[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.000]
Kill me again. Huh. It's it's like a

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.520]
Reincarnation type or something, but you're it's not really

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.940]
I think a pretty good one speaking to reincarnation. What about

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.960]
The Peter Proud. Yes, that's great one. Michael Sarasin and the one you know for O'Neil

[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.160]
Also, but there was a remake of crappy remake of that too with

[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:05.380]
What's Superman's girlfriend? Lois Lane. She was in it. Oh, it's awful. It's awful

[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.780]
For the book is good. Okay, and Richie and Richie Moe. Get back to work guys. See you

[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60 let's take about 40,000 calls this week all of us slabs like me are gonna call him

[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.940]
The intellectuals last week when George was on you have a lot of intellectual colors. Oh, yeah

[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.120]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you mean he didn't facs you his

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.920]
Gardening like he did to me that was for now what happened with our our faxing guy for I forget the deal on that the

[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.980]
Faxing guy yeah the new faxing guy we had the cut Andy and

[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:41.320]
What's his name? Oh the Greg from from a hunger all been out of shape don't remember Lyle? Oh, yeah

[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.400]
That did a lot continue faxing last week was he waiting for my return. He did not like he said he would not

[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.380]
Meaning what no, you know why he did not because because he outed himself

[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.740]
He made a little accident just like the zodiac killer there. He made a little bit of an accident there one of his messages

[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:00.300]
When he'd mentioned John Ford see there's nobody in the audience who if they said oh you picked on joy Reynolds

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.720]
You threw Chuck my run to the bus whatever, but when he threw in John Ford

[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.800]
It's obviously an inside deal right Peter both fact maybe it was John Ford only he's too a homophobic to like even be involved in anyway

[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.080]
Although he had one hell of a great show there at i and z think we got bad number as well

[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.060]
By the way, we got bad numbers folks. We're done and we're proud of it. Okay, we've come undone

[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.820]
I don't have that do you have that there my guess who just don't have that

[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.600]
We've come undone. I got so carried away in that last thing. I flopped my thing. We're off the airline

[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.420]
For the sake of Neil Rogers

Just 1995 in the yards and crafts section of your favorite department store 1046 it looks like the people who are left who are still listening to QM are very happy with the way things are going

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.260]
How many we got left?

[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.580]
Guys Merrigalati by the way, she's a real jackass. She's the mayor of Hollywood to want to get all of them right about the

[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:55.280]
Life is a beach t-shirts a few years ago, and now she's just sending out all these letters dear friends and neighbors

[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.080]
It's a vote against the slots of tomorrow, which is all of the reason to be sure and vote yes five times

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:08.020]
Okay, you're paying my dollars to send out that propaganda. Yeah, that's right bitch miserable nasty hateful bitch man uptight old

Nobody is going to drag you kicking in the street as screaming off the streets into a casino

[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.520]
It'll bet on the horses on the dogs on a highlight on slots on anything else

[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.300]
Nobody's going to force you to go there. You know what I'd about that. What is it about?

[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.620]
It's about stopping other people from doing what they wanted to well of course

How much are your schools getting zero zippity doodah bitch?

[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.540]
It's just amazing to me the way that there's still some shells in that town who want to continue

[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.680]
Suck it up to Mickey Erison and the Indians

[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.000]
I've waited though those cruise ships to nowhere that people are getting raped on and getting wild die

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.420]
Or here from the food and everything else

[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.840]
That's really a great way to gamble is go get seasick on a cruise ship because it's illegal on the mainland again

[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.480]
Of which nobody gets one dime revenue. How many times have I screamed about every single time I come back to Miami Airport

[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.660]
And as soon as you get out of the matter where you're coming from there's all these people from the cruise ships

[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.920]
They're standing there with their little book in their sign royal tour of the Caribbean whatever the hell it is Mickey Erison

[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.840]
Step lines and they they slept and they follow them like like a bunch of like like the

What's your calls used to do in higher lea for the flamingos?

[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.740]
They follow them like sheep right there and they take them right to the port on a bus

[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.180]
They don't spend one dime in the city or in the county

[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.940]
They don't leave one penny behind for the local community and they go off there and they feel his fat pants with more money

[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.320]
The Erisons are the anti-Christ. I'm going to tell you that right now

[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.320]

I think that like the same story two or three times anyway just to make sure yeah about that

[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.420]
Not a bad idea especially if airsoft on is one of his wild benders again

On Saturday level serious accusations in US troops who fired her to convoys was nearing back that airport saying the shooting had been deliberate

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.180]
The Americans and Italians knew about her car coming pierce Galaria said in living rooms

[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.460]
Salillo military hospital where she's to undergo surgery following return home

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.480]
There were 700 meters from the airport 700 yards, which means they had passed all checkpoints

[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.600]
And they were not by the way speeding lane like some dangerous bunch of terrorism that that was a lie

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:00.920]
The shooting late Friday was witnessed by Prime Minister Sylvia Brolosconi's or a fist which was on the phone with one of the secret service agents head

[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.760]
Scolotti then the US military silenced the cell phones he charged

[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.920]
Juliana had information the US military did not want it to survive yet

[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.220]
When she was kidnapped on February 4, she was writing an article on refugees from

[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.240]
Fallujah seeking shelter to bag that mosque after US forces bond the former Sunni rebel stronghold

[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.700]

[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.140]
Along with three secret secret service agents killing one of them

[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.200]
I was speaking to agent Nicola Calapari when he leaned on me

[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.600]
Probably to protect me and then collection I realized he was dead did it

[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.780]
She said it was been questioned on Saturday by two Italian magistrates

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.560]
They continued shooting the driver couldn't even explain that we were Italians really was horrible

[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.160]
She said after all the rest that I've been running I can say that I'm still fine

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.740]
I thought after I was said I was handled with the Italians danger was over

[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.540]
But then the shooting broke out we were hit like I said if the terrorists don't get you the Americans

[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.100]

[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.880]
Will how do you like that? I thought we would do things like that a kiss

[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.660]
Now speaking of the voters and speaking of elections and all these things

[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.560]
I don't have quiz talking about this the idea of giving any task break tells the Florida marlins build a new statement down time

I mean rankles voters across the state even in South Florida accord to a new statewide pool

[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.120]
If you don't know what rankles means in other words it pisses them off if we can reduce it to language that joy

[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.620]
My permit what do you say joy

[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.260]
Like it says it rankles them in a survey of 600 voters taken for the South Florida Sunset on Florida times union

[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.860]
And overwhelming majority

[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:34.660]
82% stay wide and 82% in the Marlins home turf of South Florida said they oppose any state sales tax rebate tell the team

[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.620]

[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.700]
Point less than one percent of the audience on a sports station in men. That's in men

[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.340]

[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.160]

Burdstein

[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.000]
Oh, not another Jew on this step. Oh, that's right. It doesn't work for us. He works for the marlins

[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.900]
What do the marlins know he's Jewish? Oh, what a bad guy. Oh, you think david samson knows that what about the lila

[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.100]
Men and women are equally opposed. There's our democrats and republicans political independence

[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.280]
Even knowing the team will have to leave its president home in dolphin stadium after the

[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:47.040]
2010 season. I think the general consensus is we'll pack them up a lonely sandwich. How do you like that right?

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:54.260]
Even hebronationals is in case roxy burn scenes on the bus the survey conducted February 24th the 28th by the merlin based research

Revealed that only voters in the temporary are more opposed than those in south florida the polls margin of error plus or minus four percentage points

[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.020]
Ironically, this is the first year out at last several at the legislative leadership and governor jab bush

[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.820]
Have promised to keep an open mind and this is the first year the team supporters will approach the legislature

[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.420]
Where they coordinated plan to finance and build a stadium they're hoped to open in 2008

[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.900]
I think this is the best effort they've put forth and I've seen four of them said

[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:26.480]
Representative Marco Rubio republican west Miami who plans to help champion the plan during legislative session which begins tomorrow

House speaker Alan vents

[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.820]
Republic in a Panama city agreed that having the sales pitch come from local government not the team could be a plus this year

[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.720]
I respect the leadership down here Ben said to bring a Friday trip to mommy

[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.400]

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.700]
He was having a nervous breakdown

[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.580]

[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:56.220]
Anyway, representative Susan butcher says he's even filed a proposal to take away many of the existing sports related

[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.380]
Tax groups including those for the world golf hall of fame in August the world golf hall of fame

Oh, what a bad idea that is why do we care about programs for the Indian health care?

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.380]
Within the past two weeks the city of Miami and Dade County

[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.480]
Which would own the stadium was signed off on an almost

[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.660]
$420 million financing plan for a ballpark east of the orange bull guess what people don't want to go there

[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.300]
You want to go there? No, see we just expanded our poll the two calls nobody wants to go there

[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.420]
The remaining $30 million that they need for the statement would be covered with the state money

[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.780]
But since that that would be paid off with interest at 2 million over a 30 year period

[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.720]
In a total state sales tax you may would be about 60 million that anger Susan's

[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.420]
Epony of Kiva's game her children in 10 local public schools she told Pulsar she is adamantly opposed to the rebate plan

Hi Jeff got in here with your top or bottom of the hour right wing ground. I low down

Christians rejoice it's rap Germania

[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:37.460]
Fearless leader Bose says in a White House memo written by Andrew card that gods spoke to him last night about the rapture

[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:43.280]
After reassuring fearless leader that it won't matter how bad things get we're all gonna die anyway

[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.440]
He added that after taking a closer look at fat pasty redneck Christian morons

[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:54.320]
He decided to leave their clothes on with the rapture gum and now these words from the front page of my website

[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:02.000]

I can satisfy most finishes

[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:19.400]
Including reading passages from bill o'riley's latest text novel while dressed as a Catholic school girl

[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:25.660]
If you long to feel close with a god by saying oh god, that's good. Let's just get him erected

[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:30.600]
A lot of your shirts it's 11.02.05.16 W.3. We got mohauer David and

[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.700]

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.060]
I say Gildi and Greg on a package deal and maybe through a maddie belt too

[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.200]
We'll do a swap with waxing get your words back

[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:50.380]
226 votes can WQM recover from Greg reads latest blunders or are we doomed in it after changing a format around 85 times in last three years

[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.800]
And especially in last several months. How many different morning shows have we had since summer?

[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.740]
How many different in the afternoon and how long did we go on for a would choice back and forth and back and forth

[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.420]
Is mad dog leaving as he stay in his moh on two to four was the on four to seven look all we know mo

[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.980]
You know what I mean? I'm mess

[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.120]
Absolutely that is aster. Nice going Greg. He's on vacation again

[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.020]
226 votes pretty weak don't care. I only listen to you 120

[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.900]
No, you jerked the audience around too much 29. We have no chance we're doomed

[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:25.360]
Yes, I love the new lot of 24. That's not too impressive is it no the stirred business was the end for Greg 18

[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.680]
Wastival destroy you guys 17 watch how many people they got on their staff?

[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.600]
17 the horseshoe and for the club are must have fallen out of Greg's

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.500]
rectum s9 and Greg is a genius nine which means may well voted three more times

[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.140]
Now here's the fact that I don't understand because it says from Pete and Kendall

[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.640]
For your information the early voting locations in data are closed today

[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.640]
I went to the location in the hammock's and hammocks the West kind of vote and they're definitely closed

[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:54.520]
You can check them on me date website to confirm well. I don't know about date. I know browards opened till 430

[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.600]
Okay, how come we can't find out about date? I don't know. Maybe it's a little cool

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.240]
Maybe somebody will call us in let us know about date county. I find that very hard to believe

[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.620]
Early voting supposed to go on to 430 day definitely is in broward and tomorrow 7 a.m. to 7 p.m

[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.740]
Which of course there's not a municipal elections tomorrow too. You know like for dog catcher

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.040]
Mirror of dine. Yeah things like that

[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.380]
Long gone are the long lines browers electorate saw during falls election

[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:23.140]
But voter turnout for the upcoming political contest while relatively poor has improved in the past few days official

[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:29.620]
So yesterday that's because George was on last week plugging a hell out of a wrencher right today for the last time before Tuesday's election

[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:36.620]
14 special polling locations elected by broward election supervisor Brenda schnipes will be open until 430 this afternoon

[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:42.040]
Of course people can still vote from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. tomorrow election day only if you're voting yes

[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:48.300]
If you're voting no vote on Wednesday, but they'll need to do so through a sign neighborhood precincts like any regular election right right right

[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.500]
Early voters on the other hand can cast their ballots and any one of the locations that by steps all in tears

[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:58.060]
I'll relatively although relatively few voters have shown up at the early voting locations since the open two weeks ago

[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.560]
Things were picking up over the weekend deputy election supervisor to sell us salus said

[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.180]
It really has been very smooth

[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.600]
She said the people are taking taking it in as soon as they come in

[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:15.660]
Number of voters are above a beat but about all the counties voters will have a chance to decide whether to rely on machines and racetracks and highlight frontons

[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.540]
Governor says I know it's what we say yes

[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:23.120]
The Christian coalition say no we say yes the Indian say no we say yes

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.360]
Mickey Ericin says no all over it quietly behind the scenes pull in the strings so we say yes

[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:33.060]
At the Temerak Library on commercial bull of our teenagers passed out leaflets and wore vote yes t-shirts

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:38.780]
Telling voters the referendum would fund public education in South Florida and of course since education seems to be at least allegedly

[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:42.400]
The number one issue with the people in South Florida. Here's a chance to get some cash without

[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:48.580]
Have to go through a song to dance okay that is specifically earmarked unlike the lottery which of course is governor jabs

[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:54.080]
Pet project unlike the freaking lottery which is a rip off in a scam and the money didn't go where you thought it was going to go

[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.860]
This is specifically going to be earmarked to go for public education. That's public education not private

[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.820]
Goiom education

[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.840]
Meanwhile opponents of the measure took greyhounds to the early voting location at the West Regional Courthouse in plantation

[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.860]
Arguing the measure supports businesses that treat racing dogs poorly. It took greyhounds there

[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.720]
I thought that we're going to take coach USA when you I would

[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.680]
always sure

[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.360]
slot machines won't be the only contest on the ballot for the counties elected voters in 16

[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.700]
Broward cities will decide who represents them in city or town government

[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.840]
And a partridge in perjury. Well there you go. That's uh whatever that says not much

[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.520]
Just get out there and do it okay. Don't get sucked in by a bunch of uh

[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.380]
Scare monitors. It's always the same thing man in the state always the same crap

[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.120]
Oh the world's gonna come to an end. We're gonna have so much crime have to pay for all these extra police to do what?

[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.360]
To do what? Let me say again the security and I'm sure it'll be the same with the it's the tracks

[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:50.260]
They'll have their own security there just like we do with woodbine and uh flambore and it Windsor and it uh casino

[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.360]
Casino Ramma and all these other places you know what they mean

[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.660]
What do they mean the mafia the mafia right the mafia?

[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.920]
You know they they're not in Florida now, but they will be at the slots. Oh, that's right crime man organized crime bad people

[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:11.020]
Like the boys family. How many Q a.m. Hello? Oh, thank god. Yeah. Oh, you wouldn't believe the one. I'm a lifting man. Yeah, okay. How many Q a.m. Hello

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.500]

[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.760]
That's it. This is what I got last week. What?

[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.020]
All these yes

[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.400]
You're okay great

[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:30.400]
Clean up your act speak five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on evil rise and singular wireless lines

[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.960]
You're a people man so they got all the diaries so we took it we took it up the old shoot

[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.540]
If you want to know the numbers man, I see I don't have the numbers

[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.760]
Don't waste my fax paper. I don't want to say good

[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.280]
We do have these monthly numbers man and all of a sudden again of course when stirring got taken off here

[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.620]
We started all over again. We started off when they when they took

[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.140]
What's his name for well off here? We had to start all over again

[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.780]
And then when the blue up the morning show puts stirring on the air

[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.380]
We had to start all over again and then they took stirring off here

[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.740]
And they put the Humphur on in there and we had to start all over again

[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:03.720]
Plus we had that indeterminate line up who the hell's on first and who's on second that went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks

[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.180]
And a question is can we bounce back? Oh, I don't think so. I think we're done

[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:12.200]
I think we are well done like a like a stake in Roots Chris man. We've been cooked at a very high temperature

They'll do that. They'll do that with with Greg

[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.480]
Oh, this is a bad story about Amsterdam falls out of love with coffee shops

[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.360]
His liberal stance and drugs begins to crumble. Do you see that? No

[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.760]
I also got the inquirer

[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:08.520]
Got a whole bunch of stuff in here. I've got 80 million although the case against MJ is starting to crumble

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.740]
It's been a lot of them to get outside. Don't tell me that the California is gonna blow another one of these

[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:18.000]

Hello no yes sir. How are you sir? I'm definitely for gambling

[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:42.540]
But there's gonna be one negative downfall for it. Uh-huh. Would you like to know what it is? I'm listening. Okay

[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:49.140]
The Indians made a deal with the federal government as long as class three gaming stays out of the state of Florida

[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.260]
They won't push for it

[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.140]
But they said if it ever comes in they will be allowed to have it so yeah

[00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:02.760]
Being that's gonna happen. I know what it past they've got trailer for the tables. They've got trailer for the crap tables

[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:10.160]
They've got blackjack tables. Mm-hmm whether it's gonna be a good thing hold hold it hold it. Okay, blackjack and

[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:17.240]
Crap and all those other casino games have got nothing to do with what's on the balance on the fan no no and they they can only do they

[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:22.960]
Only have the will you can I finish the show? Sure sure they can only have the kinds of gambling if they're casinos or whatever

[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.820]
That's permitted by state law. Yeah, those are not true

[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.720]
They can have anything that the federal government will allow on that they're not bound by any state laws

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.460]
They only allow for federal laws

[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:41.120]
And they made a deal with the federal government as long as the state of Florida doesn't have any type of class three gambling

[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.880]
Yeah, they will never push for it

[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.460]
But in the interim if the state ever allows and you think that this you think that this federal government

[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.600]
The we got right now that they're gonna lift them have full

[00:54:51.600 --> 00:55:01.700]
But but uh, oh wait, we don't don't I ask you a question. Yeah, no, but the Indian yes the Department of Indian Affairs will no they won't they've already got them

[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.660]
They've got them in trailers sitting at the world for building

[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:13.060]
So let me let me ask you this question and what if that does happen so what is it? No, no, it's a great thing. No, no, no

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.240]
I'm no, I'm not saying it's not bad thing. Yes

[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.460]
It's not a bad thing

[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.860]
I was just as soon passed on that okay. They're always gonna be these people

[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:29.760]
You know, it's gonna be really great but if you don't but it's okay stop being so forwardly issue, okay, right?

[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.100]
So freaking negative about every knows and then what yeah, and yeah, and who cares if you want to go subsidize the freaking Indians go have a good time

[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.720]
Okay, too of a government dread as they say in China

[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.000]
Jim in pebber pine says I listen to this anti-gambling commercial running by Bush

[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.380]
She claims the revenue collective would have to be divided up around the state and claimed stop Florida revenue may help schools in north Florida

[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.120]
He also claims there will be additional burden on local law enforcement

[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:57.280]
You know what I say cool. So what if some of the money helps north Florida central Florida schools if those kids can get a better education

[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.960]
Who cares where they live if they need more law enforcement good to create jobs

[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.600]
18,000 plus new jobs by the way of visiting passes tomorrow and they're in brown

[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.760]
Just like a hard rock casino created jobs good point Jim

[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.800]
It sounds to me that old Jed doesn't want to see Florida's economy thrive

[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.840]
Jeb can kiss my

[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.840]
By the way George in a great job last week is always I can tell by the great calls. We're getting George in a fed

Good calls last week. Didn't he guys? Oh, yeah, all the good stuff

[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.780]
See

[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.720]
Not fooling me. I've been around the law for too long. I heard I've been around sniffing those jobstrets too long

[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.200]
1113 at 560 WQM. I'll tell you what if you're sniffing your carpeting and not happening with a result

[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.600]
Your carpet is as bad as your sink when it comes to being a collector of germs

[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:20.060]
It's really great that the defter is

[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.500]
touting that

[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:28.160]
No for the casino. Yeah, and at this late and in the junction you know days before the elections

[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.100]
You know now they figured out it's a bad deal you know it's like

[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:39.640]
So I don't know he's got a panda to his Christian constituency mr. Okay to the goody two shoes Bible thumping rednext that he's all about that's him man

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.900]
Yeah, that's true

[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:47.460]
Catholic he found the Pope and why why do we have to keep getting these buttons about the Pope and whether we have

[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:52.260]
His stool and the texture of his diarrhea and all these other grotesque

[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.800]
You know, I don't really want to hear about the Pope much less about his bowel movements. Okay. No no interest here

[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:03.240]
Again, it's the arrogance of the Catholic Freaking Church trying to think that the whole world is supposed to like it all whipped up

[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.740]
But we don't care about some silly old man in a dress. Okay. It's a real drag you jackass

[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.060]
You're gonna eat the wafer in the body of Christ and all of a sudden you know, I am so I just can't take it no more no more

[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.240]
He never said that didn't he?

[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.040]

Yes, yes, hi. Let me tell you about two weeks ago. I received

[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.640]
Three solicitations to to cast early voting right right and I said sure. I'll do it

[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.420]
You know, I did it for my mom for my dad and for myself

[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:51.260]
But that was just to receive the ballot to sign it and so last week on Wednesday my dad got his on Friday my mom got it

[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.980]
And I'm still waiting for mine and I'm saying to myself why you know if we send it up on the same address

[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:04.380]
How come three people received it on different days? Well actually two because I haven't received mine and if I receive my

[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:10.340]
Post office probably because the post office. I don't remember all those absentee ballots back in the general election in November

[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:15.960]
Absolutely. I mean this is particularly this is just one question. Yes or no?

[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.820]
I mean to tell me they can't even

[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.540]
Set this right. I want to tell you something if I received mine

[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.520]
Through the post office today. Yes, I'll sign it and tomorrow come election day. I'm gonna show up as well

[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.520]
But I'll have to vote for two times. Yes

[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.340]
Absolutely you got I want

[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.400]
You know living here in South Florida brings some life back to this

[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.760]
Star for thinking God bless you. Thank you. Okay, two two and call us in the morning

All right. Oh wow. Let's get the natives whipped up into our friends. You okay?

[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.460]
I'm not talking about the Native Americans either those Indians with their cigarettes with the worms in them either. Okay

[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.400]
I'm so sick and tired of that crap and of course that's one more reason we don't need you know who back on the station

[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.360]
Yeah, what that phony deal is he still wearing an ankle bracelet or a lonesome Arthur Stewart. Yeah, it's

[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.720]
Made it round to her making the rounds by the way for fifty million dollars

[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.240]
You can go spend a couple hours at Jose Kansaka's house and give us some good roads to inject you right in the

[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.080]

Great we don't care. You care about what is worth it was no

[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:42.600]
I don't have to like five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the Verizon singular wireless lines

[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.640]
I never gave those monthly trends. I would give the rest of the numbers, but I don't have them and I don't want them

[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.940]
They're too small for me. Remember that song you can have a ride on one or two five three

[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:57.760]
Morning six to ten a.m. In a month of January and many teen plus WQM dropped from a five two that was during the last month

[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.880]
Through a two point six mid days

[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.020]
Ten to three which of course includes the two to three

[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.980]
We dropped from a five point six in December to a three point three point oh and men in midday

[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:14.880]
That is and an afternoon three to seven p.m. We dropped from a five point three in December to a two point one

[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.720]
In January and at nights

[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.300]
Now I don't know how we had the big number in December at night five six that had to be an aberration

[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.680]
What do we have on a night? I don't December. Yes, we're doing ball games. No hockey games

[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.080]
Uh

[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:35.260]
Nothing, but anyway had a bogus five six in there and in January we had a zero point nine at night

[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:41.500]
So now you understand why I'm taking that pool today and while we feel like we've been betrayed once again by Brutus

[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:47.080]

Could be no more, go cuz you go

[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:37.400]
Let you make a giant angel out through the snow

[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.440]
Go cuz you go, you're my king

[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.060]

Go cuz you go

[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.960]
You'll care that you're big, and I guess I'll

[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.800]
Bracko

[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.220]
Girl, you're pretty girl, and you got that all over six

[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.880]
Oh yeah, she's pretty disgusting, alright, 1133, 27-dil-moon

[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.020]
You got a teeny, two chocolate cakes

[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.160]
And of course, what people are realizing when they see that spot

[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.660]
That's just one meal she's ordering

[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.960]
Okay, dooo

[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.080]
You got macaroni and cheese?

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.700]
Oh boy

[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.760]
Anyway, here's a faction bill in Fort Lauderdale

[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.160]
Who's whipped up into a frenetic frenzy, okay?

[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.040]
Frenetic, frenetic, frenetic?

[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.360]
Here we go again, sis Bill

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.220]
The stupid pathetic no-life lemmings that call South Florida home

[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.340]
Are ready to head out to the ballot cliff and dive right off headfirst

[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.400]
They've gone to their various fairytale based, rather faith-based gatherings, and told

[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.940]
About to take an out of vote and ready to do their gods work by standing out the devil's ills

[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.220]
This time in a form of those wretched slot machines

[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.120]
Their preacher is on their side as long as the rent comes in his wallet

[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.320]
Their governor's instructed them to be sure to follow their own greedy will

[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.040]
And not let any tax revenue created in the southern part of the state lead to the northern part

[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.180]
I'd love to hear how his tele-hassy neighbors feel about him suddenly becoming the South Florida governor

[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.380]
At least for the duration of the vote

[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:56.440]
Hey Jackass, Webb, why don't you go to the North Florida governor

[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.960]
Take all your Bible banging out who neighbors back to the dark cages like big brothers doing your to our country

[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.440]
And leave us down here to help loan defend for ourselves

[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.600]
Everything you touch turns into a heaping pile of rhino schmit

[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:12.620]
Take your school vouchers, your thieving wife, your hatred of teachers and education, your love of the trailer trash unborn,

[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.280]
Your druggy daughter, Terry Shavo's brain dead body, and you're never ending love of the Nazi party

[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.200]
And she'll be straight up your lily white pimply fat ass, says Bill and four-large of dead-bomb

[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.860]
Nice going, Bill

[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.280]
Howdy, what do you really think?

[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.960]
5670560, pound 56 in the Verizon and Singular Rottles lines

[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.620]
Come to QA and hello

[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.260]
I'd rather listen to Kill's a Gacchi on crack

[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.860]
You know great, but why do you keep saying that?

[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.280]
I don't know

[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.200]
I don't know who it is

[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:37.920]
Reflexed

[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.120]
The same crap, or crack over and over again, okay?

[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.500]
Get a life you jackass

[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.100]
I have no life

[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:46.360]
It lost, 5670560, we're done man

[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.840]
We have to regroup and go right back to square one, I'm telling you

[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.760]
And what's really fascinating to me is that our two flunkies in there, Duff and the Clarence

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.000]
They were deniled, you know, you're really overreacting and you think, yeah, we're done

[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.280]
Stick a fork in this baby as your rentals used to say, we're done

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.220]
What I gotta start quoting him man, you know we're finished, right?

[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:05.720]
Right

[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.340]
God, you just can't keep doing it

[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:13.100]
And like I said, these pull were taken here, this is just an exercise

[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.620]
Because the stern people who were mostly gone

[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:20.300]
And the other people who just got sick and fed up with all the, the, the crappy inconsistency

[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.900]
Let me say it again Greg, consistency

[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.120]
That's the key word in broadcasting

[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.240]
People want to know who's on, who's on first, who's on second, when they're on

[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.360]
You don't turn on a TV at 630 at night to see Dan Rather and find out it's gonna be Bob Sheeper

[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.420]
Because then you're gonna turn it out real fast like you're Thursday, right?

[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.060]
Right

[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.440]
Consistency, although at least Danny Boy was there for a long time

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.080]
But not a QAM man, air every time Greg has another bad bullet grits or has a bad case of

[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.560]
Dishmits or whatever, oh here we go again, he's opted to races again showing everybody what a big shot

[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.940]
He's got in the meantime with the dolphins still gonna be on his station

[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.340]
Oh no, we got to Marlon's though, which everybody in town says we don't want any state money going for that damn stadium

[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:04.640]
And we don't want to go to Coral Gables anyway, who the hell wants to go all the way down there into the frickin orange bowl

[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.420]
You want to go down there?

[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.060]
No

[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.540]
What about you Josh, that's right, you haven't got a choice

[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.420]
Not too happy about it, but yeah

[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.340]
Here's a guy that works for the organization released used to up until about 10 seconds ago

[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.160]
Who says he's not too happy about it, now the good news is on Wednesday

[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.020]
We've got the Red Sox and a Marlon's up in Jupiter, which is right just below Uranus

[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.420]
105, the free game Marlon's on Drek at 1250, which means we got a nice short show on Wednesday

[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.980]
Oh god, now can we ring Stern back just on Wednesday till about 1115?

[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.140]
Okay, doesn't it sound like a plan?

[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.600]
Let's play a tape, we got some

[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.820]
Come in to QAV, I would love it, switch keys, holes in it, QAM, hello

[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.240]
Very weak, QAM, hello

[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:43.920]
Hey Neil

[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.440]
He lost his touch when I was away for a week, yes sir

[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.280]
Mark me down is yes

[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.340]
Mark you down, what do you mean, Mark you down, what does that mean?

[01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:00.140]
I don't actually go to the track, but anything to a spike, yes sir

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.800]
There we go, even if you don't give a crap about it, just despite his fat asses, it's a very reason to go

[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:14.000]
That's right, as far as you're your book, I think that I like Hank in the afternoon, but I think he can give him like a breathalyzer in the morning

[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.520]
I'm worried about how to get on, I think I need a little help

[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.760]
How about Simon Tino?

[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.160]
He doesn't know, he just seems like he's lost with a step for something

[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.200]
Well, give him a little chance, give him another month, then he can rip a nest

[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.620]
Okay, give the hopper another month or two, I love Hank, but I know he's real happy being on there in the morning

[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:38.700]
But I think we had, I think we had it licked there for a while, I think when we had Joe Rose, it would moor

[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.980]
It would moor on before anybody got her up, you know, right?

[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.020]
Right, right, what it was say, kind of hard getting up when he listened to Moe, but that's another stir

[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:52.520]
But we had Joe on there and then we were kicking ass and the mad dog and hopper, we had a real great thing going there like two to seven

[01:12:52.980 --> 01:13:00.040]
Everything was just fine, it was too good for you Greg, that was a problem, it wasn't broken so you had to fix it, you idiot

[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.980]
You lying sack of crap you, God, man

[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:10.080]
Talk about a general man, talk about a man who he's like dangerous, you know what he's like?

[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.680]
What's he like?

[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.580]
The mad professor, you know, with the white hair, the mad scientist, the crazy professor

[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:19.200]
That's what he's like, and he's always in the laboratory and he's mixing his potions and lotions

[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.360]
And he's got all these crazy notions, you know, I think we had a throw his ass like into the ocean

[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:33.960]
You're a little r

[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:50.000]
It's a little bit funny, a man won a drink, I saw him live, they slid loose and packed it too

[01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:07.280]
There is his side case, he got all of the numbers, he got all of the papers, it's moving her party with the New Yorkers

[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:24.420]
He got all of the text messages to her famous friends, there was some phones ringing in Hollywood and all the Mercedes fans

[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:38.500]
They've been geesh of their carter and paddle-briding him all went to the cell and storm us and turned their phones in

[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:55.500]
And now we know everybody on Paris is gone, we know the crowded number of sheriffs go home

[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:03.120]
Now that he's gone, it's gone, it's gone over the mesh

[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:10.740]
So she said he was coming to can now call the gentleman

[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:18.720]
16 they'll know in a few way and we got Moa too, nine to four, right, and then after that, good luck here

[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:30.600]
Here's a loyal listener, C-Ray, okay, since I noticed that vote no spot running on your station, our governor uses the word hour a lot as it will raise our crime or all the money won't go to our local school

[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.200]
I've just one question, since when did you have bushdard living here in South Florida?

[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.600]
Oh, he's got a house in Miami now, by the way, I say mind your own business, what?

[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:38.440]
I said does he?

[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.620]
Yeah, got the address?

[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:46.740]
I say mind your own business, C-Ray says everybody vote yes and if you don't believe in gambling, don't go there but don't stop those who want to go and have fun from doing so

[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:52.220]
And don't stop all those jobs from being created, don't stop all that money for education from being generated, etc. and so on

[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:59.020]
See there are no negatives except for those goody-two shoes who want everybody else to live miserable like they are

[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:06.260]
Now here's a very sad, I haven't even read this yet, why I voted against slots for per mutuals from a 20-year plus newly in Miami Springs

[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.860]
Oh my God

[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.680]
I mean am I not depressed enough?

[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.080]
No, no

[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:16.260]
Here's Jay Lyon says you'll never recover from Great Reads Blunders, tell you bring back the crow

[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:23.580]
Bring back the crow and get rid of Moe says Jay Lyon, do you like that?

[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:29.080]
Seriously, just the aroma alone is more than I can handle anyway

[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.080]
This 20-year plus newly in Miami Springs says I appreciate your reason why you're voting for slots

[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:39.200]
I too don't totally buy the crime and social eels that supposedly the evil of barbed products of gambling

[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.820]
I voted against this issue because I don't believe in a bailout for the rich

[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.420]
Oh you mean like Mickey Erison?

[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.420]
Right, you know what you mean? Like that

[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.280]
All slots are as a bailout for dying industries, Horace Racing Dogs in a Highly

[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.620]
But you see, let me just interject my own thoughts as I go along with this crap

[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:59.720]
The state is in partnership with the per mutuals so when a fat ass governor comes down to the audience and says

[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.720]
Well not too many people are going there anymore and it's a dying industry

[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.580]
The fact of the matter is he's supposed to be in partnership as the governor of the state with the per mutual industry

[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:11.140]
Because as you know the per mutuals tax all of the revenue, all the money that's bet

[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.920]
And there's a lot of revenue that goes there not to mention all the jobs

[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.160]
The owners of the tracks are rich entities and corporations

[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.960]
Strontic and Churchill Bounds are hardly for individuals businesses

[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.740]
Tearing on the age of financial failure

[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.160]
The people in the Horace Racing business are wealthy people

[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.600]
Oh yeah, like all the people in the Horace Racing business, the jockeys, the trainers, the drivers, and all of the owners

[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.740]
They're all wealthy people

[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.580]
Right, you have to be rich in order to own and breed horses for racing

[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.060]
It's an expensive sport, some yes, many no

[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.940]
Not to mention all the people whose job is dependent on the per mutuals

[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.040]
Most of whom haven't got two nickels to rub together, okay?

[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.880]
Schmuck, slots are not going to be kindle interest in these sports because they're becoming pass A

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.620]
And again, not having any idea what you're talking about

[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.420]
Let me say it to you right now, it's Monday last time I checked

[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.580]
Tonight, Monday, Brian Sirius will be driving it over downs

[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.140]
Why will the best driver in the world be driving it over downs?

[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.580]
Because Monday's the metal lands doesn't race in number two

[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.900]
Because the over downs is got huge persi, you know where the over downs is?

[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:03.300]
No

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.320]
It's in Delaware

[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.580]
It's in Dover Freaking Delaware

[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.360]
And why do they have huge persis?

[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.360]
And why do the best horses and drivers drive there?

[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.420]
Some of them in the world because they've got slots

[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.560]
And why will there be gigantic persis at woodbine here in Ontario right up the road of peace for more

[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.300]
I'm sitting right now

[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.980]
Why would there be big persis in quality racing and some of the best drivers in the universe there tonight?

[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.260]
Like the air five nights a week because of the fact that they've got slots

[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:30.760]
I thought in a tourist town you wanted more things for people to do when they came here

[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.500]
I see, not fewer

[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.040]
Oh

[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.580]
It says another reason I'm voting against the bill is the Vulsamit campaign regarding the money it'll generate

[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:39.660]
18,000 jobs averaging 39 grand, bull

[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.160]
122 million for our schools, you know they mean Dayton Broward? Bull

[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.560]
If they wanted my vote all they had to do is shoot straight with me and not Vulsamit me on the numbers

[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.220]
And the financial pines sky benefits

[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:52.940]
So here's a guy, a person, a guy or woman who ever this is who just made up their mind already no matter what it is

[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.820]
Tells them it's all bull and he's already a self-proclaimed expert

[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.720]
When you say slots are not going to rekindle interest in permutuals

[01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.960]
You are so full of it matter

[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.360]
I can smell it all the way up here, hey?

[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.480]
Oh my god, close that window please

[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.660]
Sorry, more bacon exits for you

[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.800]
Oh God

[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.760]
Is this another person looking for an excuse to be negative which of course is the star floor to F and Way?

[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.100]
Oh we can't have that

[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.900]
And you know something? Supposed that

[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.840]
Supposed it produced for the sake of argument

[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.860]
Supposed it brought in only half of the jobs

[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.060]
Supposed it brought in only a third of the jobs

[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.040]
Supposed it brought in only a third of the revenue

[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.960]
It's still money that you don't have now

[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.540]
And you don't have to go there

[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.900]
It won't cause you a dime

[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:30.800]
Yeah but it's better to go there

[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.700]
No, it's much better let the Indians have all of that tax for your revenue

[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.660]
And let Mickey Erison take all those people out on those damn cruise ships

[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.380]
Outside the territorial waters

[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.620]
And plunges their guts out

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.460]
That's a hell of a lot better and stick all the money in his pants

[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.360]
God, just how pathetic can you be?

[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.020]
Man, I haven't taught that guy 20 years I haven't taught him anything

[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.920]
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Singular Rivals lines

[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.420]
Somebody QAAM, hello

[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.040]
Hello, Indian Indian

[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.280]
Oh God, Dominic QAAM, hello

[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.140]
Hi, voted

[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.860]
Okay, God, Dominic QAAM, hello

[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.140]
Hey, how you doing? Hang on a second, let me turn you down

[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.400]
Please turn me down

[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.180]
Yes, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about our fat ass governor

[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:11.680]
Yeah

[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.960]
Well that's me by the way

[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:14.760]
Yes?

[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:20.980]
Hi, George, why is the governor allowed to use public funds to advertise on the radio

[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:28.620]
Right now, our Galante and Hollywood using public funds to send out those letters to all our constituents to a for partisan political purpose on a campaign issue

[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.980]
Can we get some legal eels out there to start pressing...

[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.400]
Every disclaimer at the end showing where the money is coming from supposedly

[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.000]
Yeah, where is it coming from?

[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.040]
A political action committee out of Tampa

[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.860]
Oh, with those yachts who's over there

[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.820]
Yeah, probably from the Indians, you know

[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.840]
Well, isn't that what happened in the last election?

[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.100]
That's what happened in November, they formed all these other committees

[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.900]
And nobody can trace where the money came from

[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.840]
And they don't give the report before the election

[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.680]
And I'm aware there are how much they raised and where it came from

[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.820]
And then after the fact we find out that these seminals contributed 5.6 million dollars in November

[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.940]
To try to get everybody devoted against something so that they can have the whole thing

[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:05.840]
As evil as it is, as terrible as it is, as much crimes it's going to bring in, it's going to destroy our image, it's bad for tourism

[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.320]
But if they do it, it's okay, sir

[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.980]
It's... I wanted to...

[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.980]
They don't want their peace of the pie, they want the whole freaking pie

[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.500]
And the next pie that hasn't even come out of the oven yet

[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.280]
No, that's right, and they want the pepperoni too

[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.600]
He makes me want to scream

[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]
Can't people see this?

[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.340]
I've missed that

[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.640]
Can't people see what kind of a fat ass liar he is?

[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.300]
Well, we'll find out tomorrow, won't we? We'll find out tomorrow night

[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.200]
Well, I'm voting at 16 times this afternoon

[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.540]
Excellent job, maybe and don't forget, vote yes tomorrow and no one wins there

[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.160]
No, no, you vote no one wins there, there is day at the end of the week

[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.240]
That's when the tally gets told up for the no votes, right?

[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.720]
You got it

[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.560]
Okay, thanks, absolutely

[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.880]
Top star boy George, who of course is notoriously gay, now I would say...

[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.200]
BAAAMING

[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.140]
Has slammed Madonna for embracing the Kabbalah, where's that Kabbalah?

[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:56.860]
I don't care

[01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:01.240]
The mystical offshoot of Judaism, which preaches homosexuality is a disease

[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.120]
Oh my god

[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.480]
The former culture club singer, a real screamer, is horrified

[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.560]
The material girl flirted with lesbianism, most famously, in her controversial kisses

[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.460]
with Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at 2003's MTV Video Music Awards

[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.340]
Uh, yet supports a religion which believes homosexuals can be cured

[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:23.500]
He fumes, I have a problem with Madonna's devotion to Kabbalah, Kabbalah

[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.140]
because I watch the documentary that said Kabbalah believes that gay people are disease-vited and can be cured

[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:32.480]
She's such a hypocrite, this is the woman who's embraced homosexuality and used it to her advantage

[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.740]
and now she embraces this both-craft religion, but then again, aren't they all?

[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.300]
You go born as George

[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.020]
Oh, and speaking of religious nuts

[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.240]
X-corn guitarist baptized in the Jordan River

[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.040]
Oh, right!

[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.880]
Let's all that picture

[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.620]
Kibbutz, Kinawret, Israel

[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.040]
Let's send everybody to a Kabbutz just in time for a poem

[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:50.740]
Is it a poem yet?

[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.420]
Not yet

[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.420]
Is it a soup yet?

[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.420]
No, when is a poem?

[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.660]
I've actually been thinking of it

[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.080]
Come on, let's find some good home-intotion here in Toronto, eh?

[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.040]
Got a lot of Jews here, a lot of everything

[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.600]
Too many Indians with Curry

[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.340]
Yeah, he's a looking

[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:04.540]
He's looking at it?

[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:04.980]
That's right

[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.200]
Well, while he's looking at it, because I'm sure it's-

[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.340]
Yeah, I hope we didn't miss it

[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.480]
I'm sure it's coming soon

[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.160]
I think so!

[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.080]
There you go

[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.260]
Miss her badly

[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.640]
By the way, my good friend Fat Rich had died at the table at our dining room table in Pompano Park case you missed it

[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.100]
A week ago Friday night

[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.240]
Still had the winning pick for a ticket in this pocket though they found it

[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.840]
I wonder who cashed it, Derek?

[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.100]
Let's hope it's coming in

[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:24.920]
I'm very proud of you

[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.460]
Let's hope it's brother

[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.200]
How did you find out that he had the ticket? Who told you that?

[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.280]
I think the sister, when you called it

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.960]
The sister called the teddy that Rich had a winning pick for a ticket in this pocket

[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.720]
He had the winning pick for a ticket that he got the pick for

[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.580]
He was sitting at our table there in the dining room with Pompano Park

[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.660]
By the way, thanks again to Dick Feinberg and all the people at Pompano for being so nice

[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.520]
Not only to me but to Rich and Derek and everybody over the years they've really been great

[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.320]
But anyway, sitting at the table and he put his hands out his chest

[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.960]
This is getting this like third hand

[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.880]
It said, oh, I'm in big trouble

[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.440]
And then like collapsed and that was it

[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.620]
I guess if you're going to die, huh?

[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:56.720]
Right, go out big

[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.380]
Go out of winter

[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.400]
No, I mean, no, I'm not talking about going out of winter

[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.420]
But I guess it was quick and like-

[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:01.660]
Yeah

[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.440]
It was it, you know?

[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:03.920]
Pragic, great guy

[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.400]
But he had the winning pick for a ticket in this pocket

[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.040]
Now, I wonder which pocket because he always had tickets all over the pocket all over the place

[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.820]
Right, I have to find that out

[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.940]
Maybe it was a PETA pocket

[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:19.620]
Former Corin Gatoris Brian Hed Welch was baptized Saturday in the Jordan River

[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:23.760]
Just weeks after quitting his band, drug habits in Rock and Roll lifestyle for religion

[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.960]
He found the Lord

[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.440]
Oh my God

[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.600]
Yay! Welch found a member of the multi-platinum band

[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.820]
And about 20 other white robe Christian pilgrims from a Baker's Field California Church

[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.540]
Were immersed by their pastor Ron Villetti

[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.640]
Welch said the ritual baptism is washed away his anger

[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.780]
You know, when you get angry, it builds up

[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.380]
I felt like hurting someone before

[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.040]
Now I feel like hugging people he said

[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.160]
Huh, before I wanted to hurt you, now he wants to hug you and give it a squeeze it

[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.320]
Villetti said, Welch who has Jesus tattooed across his knuckles

[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.180]
And Matthew 1128 tattooed, primarily across his neck

[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:58.760]
Hmm, is already attracting a new group of young people to the message of Christianity

[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.320]
What bad news that is?

[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.700]
To the sick twisted message of Christianity

[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:07.200]
And how somebody died on a cross so we could they could forgive all of our sins

[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.800]
Oh, what other?

[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.940]
Gambling for example, which uh...

[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:11.280]
Exactly, okay

[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.040]
There's a little cable in the Bible that never mind that

[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.120]
In recent weeks people have committed their lives to God because they're so inspired by his story, Villetti said

[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.860]
Corin announced, well, it's a Rolls-Resonization last month after 13 years with a band

[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.100]
It's Corin with a cave, by the way, and they sure are special

[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:28.860]
Well, it said he had become increasingly depressed and drug addicted in recent years but that religion helped him quit

[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:34.980]
He said he plans to relate, nothing like a dry drunk like one of these, you know, born again, used to do this, used to do that

[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.500]
And now they turn to God, okay?

[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.440]
It's called a crutch, that's what religion is, crutch for weak people

[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.160]
He said he plans to release more music without the band

[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.320]
Oh, my songs are God saying things to me, him talking to people, he's gonna use me to heal people

[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.120]
And people are gonna be drawn to it, just watch, they will be, he said, just like then he's him

[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.360]
Thousands of pilgrims are baptized annually and the Jordan River were a queen of biblical traditions

[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.900]
John the Baptist baptized Jesus, he stuck them underwater

[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.160]
You know where he stuck them?

[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.300]
Where, right there in the river

[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.000]
Was it underwater, was it in the...

[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.800]
Backed home, I'm not sure

[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.120]
By the way, remember they baptized people naked then and still didn't

[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.300]
I beg your pardon?

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.700]
Naked, you're supposed to be naked

[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.380]
Well, that's right, you've got a, that's a good way to get people naked, man

[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.660]
We're gonna baptize you, we're gonna stick you underwater

[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.820]
Why we work the runder?

[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:17.320]
Huh?

[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.900]
I worked in fatal attraction

[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.460]
Oh, he kept popping out of the water that bitch

[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.620]
Yeah, it's a man, it's a man

[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.820]
He kept popping up

[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.900]
Now let's see, who was that, don't tell me, not world-spirits, the other one, it looks like her

[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.860]
Glenda in the hood

[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:30.760]
You're very close

[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.020]
Gwinst, Meryl Streep and Glenda Close

[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:34.480]
Right

[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.140]
And up to me it's the same person, don't know, is it just me or do they, we know, they're both ugly bitches

[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.660]
Yeah, they're both nice, you know, we can't, but...

[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.540]
Who can't, we're a Purisseltin' know by the way

[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:47.520]
And we wanna apologize, George, we'll never put her ugly pictures or any other pictures of her on our website again

[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.700]
That was just, that was in the disgrace

[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.600]
That was almost as obscene as Greg Reed, Duamatti Bell

[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.940]
I think that we need a Rogers exclusive money

[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.520]
We need a Rogers exclusive money

[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.980]
This is Mark Morgan, it's the 12-1-hour on Q-A-M

[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:23.320]
The Warriors and the jury are said and said the body are Michaels on the nervous side and settling diarrhea

[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:27.260]
If they find and kill the others, fans will pull their tops

[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.160]
Then it's not the prison for the former King of Bombs

[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.260]
That was taken in a tiny cell, there's no garden, no need in them

[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.600]
But that's where we ought to be, according to Tom Sneed

[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.160]
Not the famous people will be called the testifying

[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.720]
Will Michael Jacko be great for just right now to cry?

[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.940]
Jesus, you've seen secret rooms in Cornell on video

[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.760]
He's little children playing, catch with Michaels extra spare

[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:00.400]
No, his eating cookies late at night, his team is late at still

[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:04.340]
Reading that time story, falling in the kid's warm milk

[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.340]
If they indict Michael, he'll spend 40 years behind bars

[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.320]
Say goodbye to the various wheel and IE of bumper

[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.340]
Cars, what do you fancy, be said and some apples out of wind

[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:19.260]
Send him to a LA and go with OJ Samson

[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.600]
It's probably 2 at 5.60, I was speaking to OJ, I might as well do this story right now

[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.360]
OJ is furious with his brother for making him look bad

[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.220]
Oh yeah, what did his brother kill more people?

[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.540]
Up until that episode with that bus out there, OJ everybody respected him, at least a QIM

[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:37.300]
Talk about a hypocrite, this is any inquirer by the way, I got a whole bunch of good stuff from the inquirer

[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.640]
It says, talk about a hypocrite, OJ Simpson is furious with his brother for making him look bad

[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.500]
By being involved in an accident that killed a woman

[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.600]
That a scraped football hero who stood trial for murdering his wife and her friend wasn't even concerned

[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.920]
That his 58-year-old brother Melvin ended up injured and covered in blood

[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.500]
OJ was concerned only about his own image and inside of the trolley inquirer

[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.520]
The tragedy crew, well we know about the story, right? We had that story about he was driving a bus

[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.820]
And put a beep at a boom and he was a fellow sleep at the wheel

[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.440]
Police believed Melvin had been suffering through life symptoms and was nearly 8 hours into a shift

[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.040]
Felt asleep at the wheel, Melvin voluntarily gave a blood sample for booze and drug testing

[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.920]
But police don't suspect he was under the influence

[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.520]
Later the destruct driver said nobody could be more sorry, the accident was awful, I'm still in shock

[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.100]
But Melvin was getting no sympathy from his famous brother

[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.220]
OJ is furious within the insider told the inquirer

[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:26.400]
OJ is so selfish it's truly remarkable that he sees everything in terms of how it affects him

[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.620]
Even though it was an accident, OJ blames Melvin for bringing down more negative publicity on him

[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.120]
He told a friend, it makes me look bad, is what he said

[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.480]
Make you look bad, that's a tough assignment, OJ

[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:35.820]
Right

[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.880]
Look in the mirror, it looks really bad to me

[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.720]
God, 400 and now what do we got? Very slim totaler

[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.900]
You know we got, seriously, I don't know if I can do it

[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:44.740]
You can do it

[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:48.280]
We've had to do it a million times on this radio station because Greg Reed is full of crap

[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:53.160]
And because these people are never satisfied they can never leave things alone, they can't stop dittled and would stop

[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.880]
They just can't stop messing with you

[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:03.240]
But to turn a clock back and start all over again, I just don't know if I'm a dottering old fag, you know I'm like 62 years old

[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.900]
And this coming at a time when I get an email from Norma Kim

[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.920]
Who's more concerned about the fact that WFTL has offered him to do four to six afternoons every day

[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.000]
Than worrying about what the fact that Jeremy Coleman is serious

[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.120]
Lots of security than he arrived at your show on serious radio, how do you like that?

[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.420]
He sends me that note and then oh by the way, FTL, what is it?

[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.420]
Whatever that station is, I don't know what it is

[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:33.400]
Can you believe that? This is like a player's agent in baseball saying oh by the way Alex, they want to reassign you for a couple more years or whatever

[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.880]
The Yankees want you forever, but I'm going to play third base, you know

[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:44.200]
Make up your mind, are you an agent, are you a lawyer, are you some kind of a misfit, some kind of a make believe want to be baseball player

[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:49.420]
Talk show host and by the way your antagonist was on TV last night doesn't case you missed it

[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:50.980]
Rucker Howard is it?

[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:52.120]
Taggedest

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.340]
409 votes pretty weak you see ordinarily by now an issue like this that you know that has to do with programming

[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:01.320]
We have we we be doing our thing like oh we got a shot of a thousand votes today, right?

[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:06.120]
We got a shot at 500 so we can assume half the audience is gone clearance you idiot

[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.240]
409 although the beach boys like that should we play 409 by the beach boys?

[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:16.820]
All right can you and recover from Greg Reeds latest blunders or are we doomed and around the building the scuttle

[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:24.260]
But is oh I was actually going up right again all see because that's all they understand is that everybody who listens to the radio must be a sports nerd

[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.580]
Well guess what how many sports nerds are there really?

[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:31.180]
Third man no, why see ain't going anywhere they're doing nothing they got your rose. That's it

[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:38.760]
They got the juicing toast and cornflakes. That's all they got they got squat they got Joe and actually Joe went down I understand a little bit

[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:46.360]
So it's not that our audience went over to Waxi. It's the fact that the stern people all vanish. It's the fact that the rest of the audience got sick and tired of turning in a radio

[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.420]
I have no idea who that was on the air waiting for Joyce to finally get offered them a sack that you sitting on over there

[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:57.480]
She had to send us one of those you know those rubber cushions you said I want to have bad Royds the Roy don't know

[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.740]
Yeah, that's a send us some donuts. Okay

[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:08.720]
Oh, I mean I had a line about that but I can't say it for 160 votes can we recover don't care I only listen to the O220 53%

[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:14.940]
See now ordinarily we'd say well that's really great. We got like an exclusive audience 53% that's not good see what I'm saying

[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:20.620]
Because we got nobody left and what does that say about the rest of the joint? No you just jerked the audience around too much

[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:29.780]
54 yes, I love the new lineup 44 the stern business was the end for Greg 37 we can only pray Waxi will destroy you guys look how many votes they got

[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:36.260]
Third man Greg is a genius 18 and the horse you and four leave clover must have fallen out when he stood up real fast

[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.340]
Reckon 13

[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:45.600]
What do we got here in other facts you may never know who's this from oh you may never fully recover until

[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.720]
Moe is gone although he is good for a few laughs

[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:54.360]
790 has no chance hump or a little dog or about a wash Joe show us so many ads it's almost un-listenable

[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:59.420]
Unlistenable of course Neil has no equal and that's why we got a three-share man in January because I have no equal

[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:06.380]
Audiences go I have some sweet and low but no equal what's popping with OJ is brutally bad I'd rather listen to boog over Moe

[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:11.260]
See there you go boog is on against all the one now the baseball season started how the hell can he be on Josh?

[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:16.400]
Well he won't be calling you know he's only going to call probably around 40 games so he'll be around

[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:24.680]
40 games I thought he was doing three games week for ESPN no no three games a week that's what I heard that's what we said

[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:31.980]
He's only going to be doing a total 40 games and he passed up the Marlon TV job for that let's ESPN man that's a big network

[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:38.520]
Oh yeah that's a big network ESPN that's really big time how's Dave O'Brien doing you heard from him lately

[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:48.920]
ESPN my ass let's see this is a finely lavatured can't touch the man dog no kidding by the way oh this is from Richard I heard the new Marlon's announced yes they rocked he burns

[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:56.560]
Dean oh no and the first few words I heard him say during the ball game I thought to myself what is guilty doing the baseball game for

[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:03.040]
Then I realized it was the new guy I wonder if anyone else out there heard the similarity in rock scene go these voices

[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.880]
It's early but to me sounded as boring as Dave Ann boring sorry that's my opinion well

[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.560]
I don't think he sounds like Goldie Roxy Bernstein how old is he about 15

[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:18.440]
Gildi and Roxy Roxy and Gildi sister Boca Brande could have dueling like

[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:29.520]
Yeah well I haven't heard Roxy Bernstein I have no plans and who in the world we got to game on Wednesday maybe I'll tune in for why do you think no probably not I'll probably have to lunch

[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.760]
out of the nice early lunch at 12 of 50 on Wednesday for the Marlon game and the Red Sox a growing hip hop or escalated is

[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.540]
Rapp Renegade the game took a verbal shop shot at his ex mentor 50 cent 50 cent during California content can I

[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.920]
I don't even want to read this you know something this whole rap thing

[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:51.360]
Dude what Josh told me to hear the break earlier in the show that you'd sent that story and we were both trying to figure out why

[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:58.140]
What do you mean why why that's our audience wait here we got a branch out baby we got to get the rap crowd out there

[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:03.760]
to say what I said fit to say what did I just get through saying

[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.340]
Fitty said the game took a verbal shop at a shot at his ex mentor well at least it was only a verbal shop

[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:14.360]
for a rapper that's kind of unusual usually a little more tangible than that and his ex mentor 50 cent

[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.460]
50 cent during California culture calling Fitty names and saying I ain't scared to get shot by him is

[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.280]
Larkin firm last night see this is really great for black culture in America this old rap

[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:29.420]
Cret and the fact that the media like and then they have the award shows you know the Grammys and this rapper gets it

[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.940]
Warp for this and 50 second yeah I know why I get Fitty said yeah

[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:38.520]
Yeah just blowing off some steam said the game is very Jeffrey Lickman how would anyone feel if friends their

[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:44.660]
Friends get shot he's angry this is a very bright guy he just reacted to what happened the game launched into his

[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.160]
Angry Tirey during a show with the Vault 350 Club and Long Beach Friday night

[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.040]
Lamb-based in 50 cent for what he believes with the rappers rule in the February 28 shooting outside hot 97's radio man

[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.780]
Hatton Studios. Oh let's see if we can get in on that get some shootings outside of hot 105

[01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:58.300]
I said

[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:01.420]
No, or maybe power 96 would be good to for us

[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.260]
Literally dark. In fact, I got some people in mind it worked there right down the hall from power 96

[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.640]
The brazen attack left one of the games on to rise peanut wounded

[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:17.200]
The game said at 50 cents security guards hit my boy peanut. He then derided the rappers associates his cowards who envy him

[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.880]
What's wrong with this story? I think this is very important stuff is about American culture man

[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.720]
Which really sucks? No, I just went out reading it last night. I thought there was some kind of mistake or something

[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:31.220]
Well, what do you mean by that? Well, I don't get too many 50 cent articles from you. Well, why not?

[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:35.880]
We didn't think we gotta get with it man. I gotta get it. Hey, wait till you start getting the Wilson mid stories

[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.100]
Will I look at the game also threw a challenge at 50 cents a come and get him

[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.260]
Time to cry that if 50 cent had a problem with him it could come kill me look me confirm the game

[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:52.620]
Whose real name is JC on Taylor also attacked 50 cent for criticizing him on a high 97 airwaves even as bullets were flying outside

[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.420]
How many?

[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:02.060]
Fitty the also this video is X mentors claims that he was blue different 50 cents rap group G unit

[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:07.380]
The game told the California crowd a quick to group look me confirm Taylor also said that 50 cent had a more limited role

[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:13.980]
To make me was they view out of the documentary than 50 cents been claiming police beast beef up security hip-hop spots around the city because of the

[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:20.100]
Boyling brood between the two camps the rap world's been looking vulnerable of latest 50 cent feuds with rappers such as

[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.360]
judicus fat Joe and nads judicus wait one more time

[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:24.460]
what

[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:26.180]
judicus

[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:31.640]
Jada kiss jada kiss there you go. Oh you a jada kiss fan. No, no

[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:36.700]
Fattio and nads look and said that despite his clients on stage vending what

[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:42.440]
Litman said that despite his clients on stage vent. Hey, well, I'm proud that I don't know any of these people order a music

[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:47.480]
And I took it to use the term loosely. I'm proud. I am fat and round and proud way ahead of me

[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.980]
I wasn't even aware of this story what game said in the concert had nothing to do with the shooting

[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:53.720]
He also said the game is everybody to criticize someone like 50 cent in public

[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.080]
I think the games comment speaker itself. He said we're in America. You can say whatever. He wants I support is right to pre-expression and then

[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.120]
It was great. I don't even like that. That's the American ever that's the rap in Ethan ways what we said

[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.280]
And yo yo yo set your vc ads my good TV guys the rush right out and steal yourself a TV

Maybe we should do so much

[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:43.380]
Away from me, man, what you talking about?

[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.120]

From 19 at 5.50 you see I'll teach you to make fun of my 50 cent story, okay?

[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:25.940]
Now what was wrong with that, but it had some a lot of good bleeps in it right and all the appropriate places I think I would like to think so

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.900]
I think they were just all we're fine is what I thought

[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.020]
457 votes on a pool we want to went out today that WQM is signing off here at midnight tonight

Get and speak it

[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.540]
So much better Bush's plan is unacceptable

[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.760]
But damn it, Pazza and that's the same little critical

[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.180]
They can see play me with George Bush is trying to pull

[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:26.260]
And it gets some Congress and that will be a miracle

[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:29.640]
Social security is what we have at issue here

[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.860]
You can't predict how you will be in your retirement years

[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:35.960]
You're trying to build your little nest that you're working on

[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:39.240]
Living in your new year 65 and then your money's gone

[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.280]
When you're the president sometimes you're not really low

[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.720]
Understand what I mean when I say that Bush will never be lost

[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:57.220]
What you really convinced that he can solve all the marital streams

[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.700]
He says he sees a future but that's kind of hot for us to believe

[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:09.120]
He says he sees a future but that's kind of hot for us to believe

[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.660]
Oh, 32 and 5.60. Nobody come. We got Mohawar David it. Oh,

[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.420]
Don't don't don't don't like it or not at two o'clock. We got mad dog at four and galley at seven

[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:23.080]
He did or not. Oh, guess who could have stayed alive but chose to end his own life. You know this story Johnny Carson

[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.160]
How do you know that I read the car?

[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.160]
Here Johnny

[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:33.880]
Well, we knew you already did this no, I didn't talk about it

[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.160]
He ordered the hospital staff to pull the plugs he was done. It could have kept him alive

[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.060]
They could have kept him breathing

[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.160]
Like that, but he didn't want to be a pain in the ass. He didn't think that was a way to go

[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.940]
And so he said pull a plug maybe do a you know don't keep me alive like Terry freaking shy

[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:49.780]
Well, it's a good thing Jeff Bush didn't know about it. He'd have probably flown out there, right?

[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.700]
Maybe know he does though. It's a good terrible

[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:57.640]
So if I get back to that fat ass governor, Jeff Bush, you know

[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:01.800]
I go to woodbine racetrack on an average of about two times a week sometimes three sometimes one

[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.420]
I took a couple weeks off there because I had a bad run but nevertheless

[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.120]
And they've got a beautiful casino there attached to the track

[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:13.580]
You can get on the escalator and go right up to the track and watch or you can actually go outside and be a trackside and

[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.840]
There is no crime there. There is no violence. There is no hysteria

[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:23.900]
There is a beautiful beautiful place where enormous numbers of people come where people have a good time

[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:26.620]
Most people of course lose like in any other former gambling, but nonetheless

[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:30.380]
Nobody's gonna force anybody to go there and I have a great time there

[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:33.900]
It's a beautiful place. They have a fine restaurant and what's not to like?

[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.620]
So all the this picture that they try and see this is what so amusing

[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:41.340]
It would be one thing if we were talking about opening up full casino is like we did years ago

[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:47.320]
We didn't have a china in the sense and back then the problem the biggest problem was we were always held hostage by the other

[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.860]
65 counties in the state

[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:53.740]
They didn't where I had no chance to choose their own destiny because it had a past state wide

[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.400]
So all of a sudden finally it did pass state wide back in November just barely

[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.840]
But it didn't pass state wide that they didn't buy where thank you so much rest of the state were allowed to

[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.300]
To their own destiny you want to have casino and I've got a casino

[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.460]
You want to have the slot machines and the peer mutuals?

[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:12.080]
We want to have some action if you want to improve the quality of the per mutual industry then great if you want

[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:17.460]
Zidians to dollars for education if you want 18,000 new jobs then great nobody is gonna force you to go there

[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:21.700]
All of this talk about bringing crime what is that what are these people talking about?

[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.600]
I would like to ask you this question

[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:27.660]
Where do you feel safer in a casino in Las Vegas or in downtown Miami?

[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.320]
Oh come on there. We're walking around in high alia

[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.300]
Where do you feel safer?

[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:37.500]
That's one thing I don't worry about at woodbine is like is somebody going to pick my pocket is

[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.140]
They're not enough security is uh

[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:47.400]
This is his story. It's madness the kind of image that this fat ass governor is just trying to conjure up along with his partners in crime

[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.220]
And I guarantee it I once this whole thing is over with regardless of the turnout and a better damn well-passed

[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:58.940]
But if it doesn't you're gonna fight out that a lot of this money this anti-c casino money came from the same forces who did it back in November

[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.600]
There's no reason it would be anybody else

[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:05.260]
They don't want a piece of the pie. They want the whole pie and you ain't getting any of it

[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:08.860]
You're getting nothing pie no tax benefits no nothing

[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.940]
So if you people want to continue making Mickey or us an abit or richer and richer all the time

[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:16.560]
We just cruises than all where and you want to subsidize the freaking Indians and go right ahead

[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.380]
I'll pass over this kid

[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:24.220]
Anyway, here's the fact it says to that man who said they were closed today all of the early voting places in data are closed

[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:33.420]
They accept the elections the department main office 2300 readers at 2700 Northwest 87th Avenue and Stephen Pete Clark Metro Center

[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.380]
111 Northwest first three both are open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Like right now

[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:41.600]
And of course all the voting places will be open tomorrow 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and date and in

[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:48.180]
Okay took us a long time to get this. Thank you so much whoever sent this in now. Why would they be doing that in data wonder?

[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:53.040]
I don't know they're evil because they are evil. Dave County is evil. Make no mistake about that

[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:57.500]
In fact just a couple of days before he passed away at the track fat rich and I exchanged emails

[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.740]
He said to me I'm finally taking your advice. I'm moving from day two

[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.100]
Didn't get the opportunity. Yeah, what a shame. That's probably what kill them is living in day all those years

[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:10.080]
The fat was just incidental because Dave County's a killer look when it did to Steve Clark

[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.920]
I don't think it was the booze

[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:17.320]
511 votes on a poll pretty weak. Okay. We have we have got a lot of work to do boys and girls

[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:21.000]
We got a roll-up bar sleeves just like Ross P. Rose said years ago. Remember that?

[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.700]
Right and they have a roll-up for slaves and look out of the engine and do do do and quite frankly right now

[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:28.760]
I feel like going to do in a good do-do, you know, we got some music

[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:35.680]
Not that I need to do it just feel like good the need is no longer there 514 votes can WQM recover from Greg Reeds

[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.680]
Latest blunders are are we doomed?

[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:45.460]
doomed to a fate that only someone like him a bozo like him and his partner in crime joys could create for the once great Q.A.

[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.980]
And for the once high flyers here man

[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:52.680]
We used to be high flyers now we're bottom feeders. We're calling around sucking on the barnacles. How do you like that? You?

[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:57.440]
Exactly in fact, that's probably some of the same stuff that Goli was feeding Moana one bit remember that

[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:05.220]
514 votes don't care. I only wasn't in the old 272.5% well thank God for them, but

[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:12.400]
No, you've jerked the audience around too much 68 and keep in mind this poll doesn't include all the 80 million people that have left and they come in back

[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.260]
They're not looking back. They're gone

[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.440]
Yes, I love the new line of 55

[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:22.000]
The Stern business was the end for Greg 43. Waxi will destroy you guys 37

[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:29.500]
You guys are toast Greg is a genius 23 and the horseshoe and for the clerk must have fallen out meaning you got up real fast and

[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.600]
Yeah, had a crack problem 18 said that out of 514

[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.420]
If we really press it Josh, I think we can get the 600 votes today. I think oh sure. Yeah, you can do that put on the full court press

[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.360]
56705 60 pound 560. I mean you know I go away for a week on vacation. I'll do only go to Montreal

[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:48.480]
You know what the problem is with Montreal beside the weather is too cold frauds

They are disgusting. I'm sitting in my machine. Who's my ass there in her casino?

[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:59.880]
I'm sitting there and here's this big fat French woman with her big fat purse, okay?

She looks at me and goes pardon me pardon me and I thought to myself pardon me my fat ass you crazy French bitch

[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:24.880]

[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.840]

I'm eager reelected. He's Christian. He's one of our little boi

[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.420]

[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:07.700]

What's that?

[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:16.780]
Compromptu six and five sixty wtqm against being on a dirty lyrics and violence and the 50 cent one of your favorite people

[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.300]
The Reverend Al Sharpen

[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:22.700]
Sidhill proposed a 98 ban on radio and tv or play for any performer who uses violence and their music to make a profit

[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.860]
The activist and former presidential candidate passed plans to ask the FCC and major radio broadcasters around a country to support the ban

[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:34.560]
There has to be a way to step in and regulate what's going on with the airwaves and with violence Sharpen told the leaving news and the

[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.160]
Visitions the airwaves are being used to romanticize urban violence and you know what he happens to be

[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.280]
Absolutely correction even though it's against the

[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:47.560]
censorship Sharpen's announcement follows last week shooting at the whqhd studios

[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.800]
There was suspected to be started by a few between rappers 50 cent in the game. See we got too many cent stories today

[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:57.080]
How do you like that Josh? Wow lower in that demographic to like a death plus four

[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:02.860]
Kevin read a 24 year old member of the games otterage was shot in the leg in the lobby of hot 97 soon after 50 cents

[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:05.380]
And he was booting the game from his G unit clique

[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:10.640]
We may not be able to stop people from shooting but we can stop people from profiting from the violence Sharpen said

[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.580]
He said he would not try to broker peace between artists

[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:16.020]
It would not come I specifically on the food between the two rappers

[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:22.100]
But he said in literary plans to send the FCC and broadcast networks that the outcry against violence and music should get as much attention

[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:25.280]
As Janet Jackson Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction any again is

[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:31.760]
I recall the outrage that the FCC and others displayed in response to the Super Bowl for performance ejection

[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:35.920]
Yet when acts of violence happen around radio stations that actually caused bloodshed

[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:39.580]
There's been a stranger disturbing silence from all squatters he said

[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:42.540]
I don't think it's a quarter. I think it's two quarters which is 50 cent

[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:44.760]
Emmett

[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:48.360]
Last time I checked all of course two quarters in 50 cent. They were too much nowadays

[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.840]
That's why what's his name Warren

[01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:56.280]
Beatty made all that money was that more in Buffett? No, he made all that money investing betting against the dollar

[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.280]
Do you see any millions of dollars in last a few days? I missed that

[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.580]
Warren Buffett and Little Miss Buffett I think they're going after those curds

[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:07.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a Verizon singular wireless lines

[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:13.340]
Look at these calls today man our few and far between the quality is sensational as usual but man it's kind of tough

[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.860]
Huh, well, it's kind of the turnover, you know, so that's another thing

[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:22.340]
See when clearance says to me this morning with a straight face they use the term straight very loosely in his case

[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:28.320]
Do I consider myself a three share talk show? No, I consider you a three share program director

[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.480]
That's my response. How's that?

[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.960]
Right. Is that more appropriate? Would you say I say that's right up your alley clearance

[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.760]
And by the way get that checked there by Thursday. Please on time this time as opposed to the last time when it's standard route

[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:45.100]
Some box there nothing changes remember I asked that question when I re-solve I re-appless to you

[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.800]
I said why did I do that? No, then what's gonna change and they ask you absolutely nothing?

[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.880]
Nothing will ever change in that joint

[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:52.460]
WQA and hello

[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.380]

I didn't tell you well. Let's get a two-for-deal inventory shiver on the same day. Ooh

[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:18.460]
WQA and hello

[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.440]
Give our fatties governor something else to get tied up with yes

[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.860]
You know what I didn't realize governor Bushley was so against

[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:33.440]
gambling in Florida. I guess this is a fine that he's gonna do away with the lottery. Oh no, that's a lot of money man

[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:34.300]
He loves the lottery

[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:39.680]
Sure, that's okay. It's okay to have the Indians the seminal

[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.160]
You know taking billions of dollars and not giving a dime to the state that's okay

[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:46.740]
How about fan-ass Mickey Erison what about him that great?

[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:49.580]
I don't love that sure he needs that money to pay for Shaq

[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:50.020]
Yeah

[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:56.000]
Mickey me oh I'd rather give the money to Mickey work

[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.460]
I do like that for rehab five six seven oh five sixty count five sixty the audacity

[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:05.380]
I think governor Jeb this may blow up on this face, you know what I think it may turn out to be a glanslide

[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:08.120]
On the outside. I mean I don't want people to be complacent

[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.040]
But I think he's gonna piss off so many people otherwise and we've already had fances from people who said

[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:15.200]
Well, I wasn't really interested one way to do that. I wasn't gonna make the effort to vote

[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:21.060]
But since he came out against it. I'm gonna vote for it just because he pisses me off so much because he's such a fat ass

[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:27.040]
Tipper quit okay, and he's talking about crime crime. You mean like smuggling right snorting coke

[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.080]
Is that what you're talking about that kind of crime?

[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:30.340]
Right

[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:35.220]
He's got a crack problem. That's his problem. That's what happens when he got a big fat ass

[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.840]
You got a crack problem. I should know believe me about fat ass. I thought you were talking about crack

[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.020]
Same thing like Oprah. She's got a big crack problem. Nobody Q.A. Am hello

[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:48.540]
Q.A. Am hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing, man? Okay. Just have you back

[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:51.960]
Even though George did a bang-up job last week. Yeah, I got the couple things man

[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.480]
What's the go-am I always hear you talking about? I'm a young bug. I have no idea what you're talking about

[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:03.500]
Go-am are non-juice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. And the other thing is about the about the female thing. Yeah

[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:08.360]
I think it's a good idea even though you know, they don't give them they don't give anything for education because with a lottery

[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.920]
My freaking school didn't get they didn't put a door knob on the damn school. Yeah, that's the way I feel

[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:16.280]
You know, they don't give nothing back to the school. They just keep the money from self. That's the way I feel

[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:23.460]
Okay, am I gonna argue with him? No, no, no, I might argue with city sand but then again

[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:24.680]
Maybe not

[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:29.280]
Dutch liberal stance on drugs begins to crumble oh my god

[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:36.840]
Making a hash of it is the headline in this article for the past 18 years Michael Velling and his staff have been serving up such delicious white widow and

[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.540]
Blueberry in his wood panel coffee shop in the heart of Amsterdam

[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:44.720]
Why so dad went out and got a blackberry so they're doing blueberry? Okay for the list five euros. That's

[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:52.320]
650 visitors can smoke a cannabis joint and cafe decouille and sip a beer while listening to music ranging from Frank Zappa to Mozart

[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:58.060]
Now that's I've been to Amsterdam a thousand times actually lived there. Those are two or three summers never heard

[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:00.440]
Hey there people on

[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:05.500]
No Frank Zappa while I was there. I guess I missed out. Huh you're going to the wrong clubs. Oh

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:10.720]
The 50-year-old bar owner and political activist said my main concern is to make sure there's a good mix of people at my coffee shop

[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:13.820]
And they get basically they get the best quality grass and meridioenie

[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:16.260]
But the Dutch coffee shop system is under threat

[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:23.860]
According to one of the countries leading drug specialists and a government advisor cannabis coffee shops and cafe bars will be extinct within five years

[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:28.840]
Oh my god the number of cannabis outlets is already declined from the peak of nearly 1500 to about 750

[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.640]
Only about a fifth of Dutch towns and cities have coffee shops and that number is shrinking

[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.920]
The can't clamp down camp down remember the camp town races. No

[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:42.980]
The camp town's being played on more conservative attitude by the coalition government and local mayors and pressure from other EU members

[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.300]
Who does it prove to the Dutch approach when they go to Holland? They look around and go EU like that

[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:54.120]
Right they shift in attitude was acknowledged by the UN earlier this week the annual report by the International Narcotics Control Board

[02:04:54.120 --> 02:05:00.280]
The INCB which is part of the UN noted that the Needle and government informed them of a crucial on significant change

[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.820]
And it's policy on cannabis. They're folding man used to be they were rolling and other folding

[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:08.000]
It said the Dutch government is promised to take tephoration against drug tourists

[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.760]
Street dealing what I like that. Oh man those rasta the cannabis roaring in the coffee shops

[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.680]
The report stated the Dutch government notes that coffee shops made a spread at the drug policy of the country in general

[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:24.440]
Professor Hamid Godsey president of the INCB said there's been a crucial and significant change in the Dutch cannabis policy

[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:29.100]
They stay now for the first time that cannabis is not harmless and the coffee shops are not blameless

[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:32.880]
Among the measures being introduced is a private scheme in the province of Limburg

[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:40.220]
Or I love their cheese which bands foreigners from buying drugs in coffee shops to kill the trade and tourists coming over the nearby borders with Germany and Belgium

[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:42.580]
A study is being made of strong forms of cannabis

[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.640]
Which is actually lead to a ban of these varieties

[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.280]
In addition, they place their targeting people who go cannabis at home

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.960]
If they're not going to do away with the shrooms though, that's a good thing. Seeds shrooms all these things

[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:53.280]
In Britain

[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:56.800]
There's nothing about Canada here which Canada is right on the verge

[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:01.480]
But anyway Britain cannabis has been downgraded from class B to class C position of a small amount

[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:03.460]
Seeds to be in a restable offense in most situations

[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.500]
Often they're still either part of arrest usually the drug is to be confiscated and users warned

[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:10.800]
The maximum penalty for possessive been reduced from five years to two years

[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:11.680]
Needle ends

[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:17.180]
In Holland dealing in small quantities of cannabis through coffee shops is technically illegal drug uses not an offense

[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:18.920]
Possessing up to 30 grams

[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:23.720]
As a minor offense though uses an out prosecuted possessing more than 30 grams

[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:28.340]
Is a criminal offense with a C O A E N C E got an offense

[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:33.360]
Speaking of on the fence on their tour of tsunami

[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:37.080]
Damage in Southeast Asia former president Bill Clinton once alive is predecessor

[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:41.720]
Former president George Herbert Walker bushed a sleep on the planes only bed while he

[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.280]
Stressed out on the floor wasn't that white of him?

[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:50.080]
Ice gone Bubba the jet the government playing in which the president's truly disaster area had one large bedroom

[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:53.680]
Another room with tables and seats a coin interview with Bush in this week's news week

[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:57.520]
Bush 80 said Clinton offered ahead of time to give the older former president the bedroom

[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.780]
So we could lie flat and avoid painting his body

[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:03.900]
Clinton 58 decided to play cards the other room that night got on those who he was doing there

[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:07.900]
Next morning Bush said he peeked in and saw Clinton sound asleep on the planes flow

[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.620]
We cut a switch places each getting half the night in the bed. They deferred to me

[02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:16.320]
That was a very courteous thing very thoughtful and I meant a great deal to me Bush said those are getting pretty tight

[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:17.740]
You know I noticed I noticed

[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:22.820]
Bush said he and Clinton are not close but have been compatible on the tour partly because Clinton respects his age

[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:27.500]
Because it's an old funny daddy old fart and believe me if anybody knows what that's all about trust me

[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:32.620]
Oh old funny daddy fart. Oh, well it seems to me like you're catching up. Yes, I said place

[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:34.980]
Probably Maddie Bell who wishes you would rot in hell

[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:40.320]
567 votes on the pool very weak very weak. We might get to 600. I have my doubts

[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:43.460]
Maybe if we can extend a show to like four what do you say give mode that they all?

[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:50.320]
Don't go back into like 585 can QAM recover from Greg reads blunders or are we doomed?

[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:53.800]
Don't care. I only listen to the old 297 took you 2.3 percent

[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:58.860]
No, you've jerked the audience around too much 75. Yes. I love the new line up 61

[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:05.220]
The steering business was the end for Greg 47 waxy will destroy you guys 40 Greg is a genius 27

[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:08.940]
And the horseshoe and for the clover must have fallen out. He stood up real fast

[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.780]
When in doubt they fell right out 20 for that

[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.460]
I'm a lord

[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:18.360]
His poor twin will face it to you a M

[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:23.040]
It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon

[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:31.620]
Hi from the Santa Barbara Superior Court. It's the Michael Jackson celebrity witness. I show

[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:56.600]
what they say. He's got an appetizer. He's saying that

[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.960]
Dave and Brow are how they're going to get any money because most of the money

[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.980]

QAAM. Yes, I try to come on the car. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, hello. I'm sorry. I just want to say that, uh,

[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:00.460]
for President Bush is going to deny us the right to slot and yet they're going to go ahead and approve.

[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:06.840]
President Bush, not President Bush. I'm sorry. Governor Bush, one in the same. Uh, you can

[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:11.940]
deny us the slots and yet they're going to go ahead and approve a stadium that 82% of people are

[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:16.820]
against. What happened to us, you know, people were damn working for us. Well, he doesn't give a

[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:20.140]
crap about the people. And let me see it again. I told the people before they get what they deserve.

[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:23.640]
And they put it back in there again after seeing four years of what a total jack as he is.

[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.460]
And totally irresponsible. What a dysfunctional family he's got. And a hypocrite in the

[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:30.260]
phone. He but nevertheless they put him back in there again. And now they're reaping the,

[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.240]
there's so he's sown it and now they're reaping it. Yeah. And they're reaping and weeping.

[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:38.840]
Now I can only hope we can take back the way down to 2008. It'll be great. Thanks a lot,

[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:42.580]
oh yeah, we're going to take another talking condolese. Oh,

[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:50.360]
green condolese against Hillary. Oh, that's what they're talking. That's the scuttle but that's

[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.560]
crazy. Well, aren't you seeing that? Aren't you reading it? Aren't you smelling it? I

[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:59.700]
ignore it. Oh, I'm discussing it. Starting to make Paul Martin with pretty good A. We got 600

[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:04.280]
votes yet or not. We can do it. We got 597. I think if they come pouring in and the ones like the

[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.340]
calls into one of the day, we can do the same thing. Well, this is brutal, man. This is, I just,

[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:12.040]
I was not prepared for this, you know, and I'm not just talking about the vacation because some

[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.720]
people are out of Georgia. And what's going on with George, okay? And I have to do with this,

[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:22.420]
it's been going on for weeks now. We are suffering a great-read, a traumatic blow. We have been

[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:30.080]
struck, stricken. Exactly. You jackass, Greg. In fact, let's get, let's hand him up there to

[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:33.740]
Tallahassee. He and our governor, our fat ass governor, can hang out together,

[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:37.380]
compare worse brothers suits. I'll tell you one thing. Greg can't compete with that.

[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:42.340]
Greg, don't fat ass that your governor's got. Cut. He got an ass like a Pudge Rodriguez without

[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:50.600]
the Royes. WDQYM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, this is a good news about that Bush commercial.

[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:58.460]
Yeah. He tells everyone to go vote on a Tuesday. But no. Yeah. Take a listen to it.

[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.640]
He's the wrong information. What is the right information, sir? To vote no on Wednesday.

[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:10.120]
Okay. I'm going to clarify that. That's right. I forgot. The no people you vote on Wednesday,

[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.180]
the S people vote today and tomorrow. A little slow on the uptake. Okay. I don't, you don't

[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:19.360]
get to work my way back into it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and you've a rising in the

[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:23.940]
singular wireless lines. Majority of Floridians, most of them don't, they like the idea of investing

[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:28.300]
social security tax in the stock market. But not if that means losing benefits when the market

[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:32.280]
drops. Have you heard anything so stupid in your life? Yeah. All the time. That's like saying,

[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:37.320]
oh, we'd like to go to the track, but only if we can win. Right. I mean, that story. What kind of

[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:43.220]
kaka is that? Kaka? Man. Just another excuse to reach into your pocket and put the money in the

[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:46.900]
pockets of his big money for ends. That's what it's all about. Make no mistake about it. Booted.

[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:51.540]
I think we need to take about 2000 calls between now and two o'clock to build it up to a fever

[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:57.480]
pitch for the momyze. Let's do it. 600 and some votes already. We tapped the 600 mark in

[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:02.300]
spite of Josh's skepticism. Right. But you just haven't been the same since you said that

[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:07.480]
Roxy Bernstein sounded like guilty. I thought that was a real low shot. God just comes in now. He's

[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:10.600]
brand new. You don't want to come. Some slack him. Give him a couple of weeks. Okay, then

[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.560]
Ruffman ass. He sounds like a little girl. Somebody Q a.m. Hello.

[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:16.860]
I think we need to take him like 2000 calls. Q a.m.

[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:23.400]
The building up for two or three. No, no, no patience, man. Somebody Q a.m. Hello. Neil.

[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:30.100]
Yes, sir. What makes me laugh about the fatty boy up from Calah. What makes you laugh about our fat ass

[02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:36.340]
governor, sir? Not fat ass. I just call it fatty boy. You know, if he's so much against the

[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:40.760]
crime that the that the that the uh, uh, uh, Islamist change of bringing in,

[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:45.760]
ultimately has an elected 24 foot high chain link fences around these uh, reservations.

[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:50.600]
They're not giving any money to the state. So we can direct the fence around our territory.

[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:54.180]
Well, he don't want to take on them Indians, man. They don't fight fear. You know, how they don't vote?

[02:15:54.620 --> 02:16:00.180]
They don't vote. They don't vote. They got their own people. They don't, it's it's it's just makes me

[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:07.100]
hysterical laughing that he's worried about crime and even the PBA. The cops support the

[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:12.460]
opi estimate. Right. So and he's against it, but the cops support. They they're the

[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:16.460]
least Indians. Maybe he likes smoking on those uh, those uh, uh, wormfares. They're

[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:21.580]
Yeah, peace of the fight. Have a good day. Good luck to you, pal. Who knows? Maybe he knows

[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:26.680]
Nepho for all we know, you know? Maybe few sacks getting passed around there somewhere. Who knows

[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.120]
what's going on really? For sure. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty in the

[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.300]
river. Who knows if we're going to get the real result of the poll? Oh, man, that's another thing.

[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:38.460]
See? Nobody's even talking about that yet. Oh, they wouldn't fix another election. Would they? Oh,

[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.700]
not in Florida. No, no way. No chance. Nobody to Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, Neil, how's it going? All right.

[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:49.760]
Yeah, also as far as the crime, I haven't heard any crime statistics out of the heart rock. I

[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:54.140]
don't see nobody getting beat up from robbed over there. So I, I found a loose my money. I rather

[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:58.320]
lose it and give it to the state, you know? Hey, man. Hey, man to that. So Jeff, what does

[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:03.440]
you are a jackass? Hey, man again. You are a jackass and screw the Indians is what we say.

[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:08.080]
Mickey Harrison even more. Okay, till it hurts till he's got bleeding, losing roids. You think?

[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:13.180]
I know. He makes me nauseous. And the fact that again, you know, the Mayor teeny P&E came in here,

[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:17.500]
made that backdoor deal, broke his promise to the public, built that stadium, slipped the Mickey,

[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:21.640]
the big of people in Dave County, built that monument to greed and nothing, and nothingness.

[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:26.020]
And of course, if they didn't have, they didn't have that, I hold it up, then the public

[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:29.380]
would be up at arms about that too. But now they now they're very quiet because they got,

[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:33.520]
and as far as sports, that's all they got to hang on to. Because the dolphins bite the big one,

[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:37.780]
the panthers don't exist no more. And then that's it. Am I right? That's, that's all right. And of

[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:41.960]
course, the Marlins are just getting going out with that $83,000 stadium. But then nobody wants to,

[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:46.080]
then nobody wants to pay for it. Nobody wants to go to. Nobody wants to go to their freaking

[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:49.940]
orange bowl. Why do you people go to get it? When are you going to get it? Are they ever going to get

[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:54.260]
it? No. No. No. It's this desperation about, you know, build a something, build a something,

[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:57.920]
we'll think wherever you're going to build a, do something for us, okay? And then we'll stay.

[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:02.920]
I would pack them a smoked, go back to Montreal and pack them all a smoked meat sandwich for free.

[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:07.300]
I don't know how it goes. It's good. It's not. It sucks. It's grotesque. A lot of good restaurants in

[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:13.880]
Montreal, but stay away from the smoked meat. Brutal. WQA and hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:21.320]
Spy Report. Yeah. I just saw the 560 van. The QA and van heading west on the trail headed

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:28.780]
to the Mika Suki's place. I think they're going to go for lunch. Yeah, I hope they make a good

[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.020]
investment because the way things are going, we could use the cash.

[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:48.520]
This is what sex is like with an ordinary condom. Oh my. And this is what sex is like with a broken

[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:55.020]
condom. Oh my god. That did not just happen. Did you put that on right? I think so. I better not be

[02:18:55.020 --> 02:19:02.680]
pregnant. Sorry. You are keen for this if I missed you. Broken condoms available now in the back

[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:08.540]
of the loggerings and Oscars stores in the dumpster. 117 at 560 WQA. I want to hear about

[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:15.780]
San Bernardese tragic last days. No. Tom Arnold tries to help jail the jailbird sister doing prison

[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:24.440]
time. No. No. China Phillips reverse rebellion. You want to hear about that? No. No. You want to hear

[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:28.840]
about. Oh, here you go. This is the I knew I had something good here at the inquiry. Very depressing.

[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:35.480]
You see about Regis? No. Oh, the way out? Yeah. Yes. Yes. Oh my god. It's big news.

[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.060]
I'll tell you why it's not big news. Why is that? I don't know anybody who watches Regis now.

[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:45.820]
That's because of that Vixen is going on. No. No. They used to watch because they hated

[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:49.320]
Kathy Lee so much and they hated they just couldn't turn it off. I don't know anybody to watch

[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.720]
that then. Oh. Well, so maybe you just don't know the right crowd man. It's got big numbers.

[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:57.560]
It's a horrible show. I know the right crowd. I like the way Regis holds the coffee cup though.

[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:03.260]
In a shocking move. Shocking. Oh my god. And will stun America says the inquiry. Regis

[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:07.800]
Philbin Martination's most beloved broadcasters is being dumpsters to say the producers of

[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:11.360]
live with Regis and Kelly are looking for a hot young replacement for the 73 year old star.

[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.080]
And they're especially interested in survivor host. Jeff Probst can fight insiders. You know who

[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:21.020]
that is? Yes. The survivor guy. Oh, boring. But Regis is not ready to close the door on his

[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:25.040]
phenomenal career. Say outrage pals of the TV legend and insider tool. They agree. You know,

[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.080]
there's always insiders. You know what that? The OJ story. There was an insider that said this.

[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:34.480]
There's an insider over there. Who's the insider at QAM? Maybe it's Maddie Bell. Who's the

[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.560]
most? He's the mole. They ever look at him. He looks like a mole. Just no. No, he is a mole.

[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:44.180]
Just one big one. He feels like Disney which produces the show is putting him out to pass you so

[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:48.400]
we can put a younger man's such as Prof. Pitcher next to Kelly Ripper who's very marginal at best.

[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:52.660]
But Regis won't let anyone push him around on the show. He practically created. And then it goes

[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:57.140]
on about how Pitched off he is the way ABC ruined millionaire because they put it on almost every

[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:02.040]
night. If it's good one night a week, let's put it on 15 times a week. Idiots. Michael Davies

[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.260]
executive producer and creator of the millionaires said the show is demise really wrangled

[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.580]
Regis. It was great on the way up and it hurt on the way down and it hurt more for Regis than

[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:13.660]
anybody else. He took it personally. It was business and he was taking a person like that.

[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:21.580]
Okay. A source close to life said the show's producers have quietly put out feelings. Nobody

[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:25.340]
is an old coup man. Regis. Right. It's an old coup. It's got to stick together. You know,

[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:30.460]
your day is coming man. Your day is coming. You'll be an old coup. Right. I hope up there in

[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:34.780]
North Carolina. Oh, I pray. Wondering around in the world trying to find your way back home.

[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:38.700]
You'll see I know the way trying to find a place to empty your bag right there.

[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:42.860]
Right there. Five six seven oh five sixty. This is one of the worst. If I don't know this,

[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:47.740]
I'd have taken like an extra three four weeks. We need to rebuild man. We need to like retool it.

[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:51.720]
You know what I'm saying? Retool it. A whole deal. Nobody can you annn hello?

[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:55.220]
Hi, I'm coming about Regis. Yes, sir. Go ahead.

[02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:00.000]
Oh, I was just talking. I was talking about Regis. That show is unwatchable.

[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.120]
Yeah. It's just it's a tough one. Everyone wants it. He paid me by the second.

[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:08.420]
I don't know. I haven't watched your error. Except one time my wife made me watch it.

[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:12.000]
And it was just it was just horrible. I thought I was an insane asylum. Yeah.

[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:16.940]
That's how bad it is. I just I couldn't take it. It was an idiot. They had on that.

[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:21.740]
Kelly. Whatever name is. Yeah, it's horrible. Yeah, I got it. It's just horrible.

[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:25.040]
I can't I can't even say enough. Well said man. Say it again. It's horrible.

[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:30.960]
Yeah, it's horrible. Okay. Thanks. He can't say enough. You know, it sucks. It is a bad show.

[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.760]
You're right. And when Kathy Lee was on there was one more reason not to watch it.

[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:41.760]
She is just a nasty. Just obnoxious bitch. Can't sing. Isn't funny. She just nothing.

[02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:44.880]
You know, nothing. Nothing. Nothing. That show. Big fake boobs.

[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:49.580]
Yeah. What's that fit we got? Oh, that hair. They are the kids.

[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.840]
Oh, that one. That's right. I like it.

[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:25.400]
They are the kids. They are the ones to make a bucket.

[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:35.800]
They simply come. It's just close to making the guy you love to buy.

[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:42.580]
It's you. They make a bucket. They would get me. It's good.

[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.580]
Yeah, we heard it the first time. 22 after one. Go back to Notre Dame.

[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:50.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Count 5, 60 on a Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:53.840]
You know, he's going to go out like Bert Parks. Remember that? Yes, I do.

[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:56.240]
Why can't you go out gracefully? You know, it's your time.

[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:00.360]
Just go out gracefully. Just like here with me. I can smell it. I can see it.

[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:03.820]
Just painting off these next four years. Just I mean, I check what?

[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:06.400]
Right. I can have a good time. It would buy it.

[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.300]
WQAM. Hello. Not there. QAM. Hello.

[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:13.000]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Welcome back.

[02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:16.800]
Sure. And George did a great job. George did a phenomenal job.

[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.840]
In fact, I've actually went to the audience to just praying.

[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:20.040]
I'll be back kind of getting tomorrow.

[02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:24.280]
They're entertaining. You know, I just want to wish you a happy

[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:29.000]
anniversary. What anniversary? You were born. Oh, Jesus. I forgot all about it.

[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.700]
I did. Yeah, somebody called in, you know, and I was like, yeah, it's a month

[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.000]
sometimes. That was February. March was 29 years on a year and so.

[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:39.120]
Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you.

[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:41.620]
I'm going to be proud to know how you do it.

[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.000]
God bless you. Me, me. Thanks a lot.

[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.960]
I forgot all about that. I had it on my calendar. I forgot to mention it.

[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.380]
So a couple days later. Oh, no. I got to remind me.

[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:52.560]
Holy crap. I guess I should play.

[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.200]
Oh, I can't play that because they say a D-bag.

[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.200]
Corressi Uncle D-bag in there. Can't play that.

[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.500]
That goes to show you how far we fall in

[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:07.420]
Joyce. Far fallen. That's what that describes us. Far fallen.

[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.820]
Remember, Far from the dog? That's us. Far fallen.

[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:14.580]
We've just fallen out of grace because Joyce's, we just can't continue. We can't cut it in the

[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.280]
mouth. We've had our balls cut off. We've had our arms.

[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:20.720]
We're like a little, like a little munchkin on a plate.

[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.220]
That's it. That's all we got left.

[02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:26.100]
Very sad Joyce. A nice job in those negotiations too, sweetheart.

[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:27.280]
That really helped us out tremendously.

[02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:30.060]
I see a massive lawsuit on her rise in here.

[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:33.560]
Massive humongous lawsuit. I can smell it.

[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.140]
Maybe I can get a weak lawyer to file one.

[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:39.540]
5670560, pound 560 on a variety of Singular Rivals line.

[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:40.960]
How about you QAM? Hello.

[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.840]
Hey, how's it going? All right.

[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:46.320]
Yes, it is.

[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:48.380]
Oh gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't sound like you.

[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:50.120]
Well, anyway, the best I can, you know.

[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:52.840]
I'll try to follow that other guy. Happy anniversary.

[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.600]
Fly your bag over, like I said.

[02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.980]
29 years, man. Can you believe it?

[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:00.420]
29 excruciating years in this

[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.800]
sum pump and his outdoor.

[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.820]
No, I don't. No, I don't believe it.

[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:05.440]
But anyway, somebody's got to do it.

[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.100]
Listen, yeah, real quick.

[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.480]
Because I got to keep delivering mail.

[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:12.420]
Speaking of the thing going on tomorrow, the elections.

[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:16.840]
Yes, I thought it was kind of weird because I heard something about the

[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:18.080]
Republican Party being

[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:22.780]
having differences with the governor in this issue.

[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:25.460]
And I kind of believe it now because since Saturday,

[02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:29.020]
including today and tomorrow, we're delivering thousands of

[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:33.280]
pieces down here in day county from the Republican Party

[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:36.120]
to vote yes on tomorrow's issue.

[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.400]
All right. Excellent.

[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:41.600]
So somebody down here is not in part with, you know,

[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:44.200]
the moron out there and how to have it.

[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:45.100]
So thank you.

[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:48.200]
I just like to let you guys know so you can pass on the

[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.160]
the information.

[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:50.340]
Always love those Republicans.

[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:54.660]
That's a virus, you know, I think it's the Christian movement that's in this pocket.

[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:56.020]
There you go. It was fundamentalist,

[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:58.580]
Boarding in Bible Thumpers man, say, say to help with them.

[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:00.180]
But anyway, how fun with it?

[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:01.520]
I'm glad, Pally. Okay.

[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:02.900]
I'm trying to have fun with the fuck.

[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:03.360]
I find it.

[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:04.680]
So there you go. How do you like that?

[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:06.320]
The Republicans are going to vote yes.

[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:07.480]
Everybody's going to vote yes.

[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:08.400]
Get out there and vote yes.

[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:09.220]
And let's cut the crap.

[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:11.460]
Let's cut the cord from the rest of the state.

[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.320]
Let's stop being prisoner held hostage by all the Bible thumping red

[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.940]
next in the rest of the state of Florida.

[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:18.700]
Okay, by those other 65 counties.

[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:21.880]
Well, let's leave out Palm Beach in Monroe, right?

[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:22.400]
The Knares.

[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:22.720]
Right.

[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:24.420]
There's other 63 counties, right?

[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:25.340]
I like it.

[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:27.160]
I think it passed pretty good in Palm Beach in November.

[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:27.940]
Positive.

[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:29.520]
What's not to like, huh?

[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:30.620]
What's not to like?

[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:31.500]
Martha Sturford.

[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:32.660]
Registra Stulman.

[02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:33.420]
I like Registra.

[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:33.760]
He's a...

[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:34.580]
I like him fun, nobody.

[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:35.380]
I don't like his show.

[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:36.500]
I agree his show is horrible.

[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:38.000]
And the minute air was horrible too,

[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:38.880]
it was a horrible show.

[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:42.960]
And because it was different and because it was

[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:45.680]
high tremendously, so they were able to like fake their way through that for a while.

[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:47.660]
And then when they started putting on 80 minutes of time,

[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:49.920]
people again, to realize what his show really sucks, you know?

[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:50.540]
Mm-hmm.

[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:51.780]
Celebrity Millionaire.

[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:54.520]
What he wants to see, some guy that's worth like 65 million already,

[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:55.940]
a win some million for charity.

[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:57.660]
That's no fun, that's not exciting.

[02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.860]
I'd be like watching Millionaire Jocks play some game.

[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:00.520]
Right.

[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:02.300]
I'd be like watching Josh

[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:03.500]
uh, uh,

[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.880]
Barrow and the beast.

[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.740]
Rubby Tethers Ball Spot, you know?

[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:08.580]
What he wants to see that?

[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:11.280]
641 votes on the pool.

[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:12.540]
I'm, I'm Chris Fallon, man.

[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.920]
It's this last, you know, we've been through a lot of ups and downs.

[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.420]
Mostly ups than goodness, but

[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:19.040]
this is like, and it's like a, like a, like a,

[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.500]
like a stand through the heart what they've done to this place.

[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.660]
And everybody else seems to be like, oh well, it must be waxy.

[02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.520]
Well, waxy didn't do crap, okay?

[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.100]
Waxy, they got waxy buildup, they suck.

[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.800]
They got Joe Rosen, they got 20 other hours of what's he on?

[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:32.560]
Three hours or four.

[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:33.280]
Some three?

[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:33.800]
Three.

[02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:36.980]
And 21 hours of dead air is basically what they got.

[02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:38.740]
I got your toast over here, okay?

[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:41.060]
Your toast and uh, crap.

[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:42.880]
641 votes.

[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:45.440]
So just fries my ass, the Medi Bell mentality,

[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:48.260]
and the Ray Perry mentality, oh, if we get more sports stations,

[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.640]
there's gonna be more people to sports.

[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.220]
There's only, thank God, a limited number of people

[02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:54.960]
who eat, breathe, and suck sports, and that's all they know, okay?

[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.480]
Lifeless morons.

[02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:58.920]
Even Josh Cornish resents that crowd,

[02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:01.040]
and he gets paid by the frickin' Marlins, okay?

[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:03.180]
That's why he puts up other, because he gets paid for it.

[02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:03.820]
Am I right?

[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:04.300]
Yes.

[02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:08.920]
Well, if I say it, there's not a problem there.

[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:10.720]
If you say it, they're, oh gee, we heard what you did,

[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.120]
and of course put that on top while you said about Rossi Bernstein.

[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.060]
Sound like Yoda.

[02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:16.560]
You got some real problems there, man,

[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.940]
and then plus what you said about Dave Ann,

[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:20.080]
boring sounds like Terry Shival in a bad day.

[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:21.480]
That was pretty weak.

[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.940]
Amal Coast is Florida's number one Asian Gore

[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:26.220]

stone crab claws, and a sushi bar with over 30.

[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:47.700]

[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:48.320]
Different items.

[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.160]
Make sure to leave room for dessert if you're amazing.

[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:51.860]
40-inch chocolate fondue fond,

[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:53.720]

[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:55.240]
marshmallows, and other decadent treats.

[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:57.280]
Don't forget the Amal Coast promote healthy living.

everything is cooked with only cholesterol free,

[02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:02.840]
canola or all two.

You're a sense of the evil Roger.

[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:22.680]
Yes, you're a sense of the evil Roger.

[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.280]
You're a sense of the evil Roger.

[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:25.620]
On 560-8AM.

[02:30:27.020 --> 02:30:28.160]
Break H.U.

[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.680]
Good bye, J. Feedler.

[02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:39.460]
Now I can't feed a little.

[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:41.940]
Guess that's what happens when a Jew

[02:30:41.940 --> 02:30:44.680]
wraps his hands around a fat pig's skin

[02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:47.240]
and a pill in round his jaw strap.

[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:47.620]

[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.240]
Yes, a few hundreds of them.

[02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:55.120]
I use the lightest poison.

[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:59.780]
I remember picking mainly steam beds at the gout resort

[02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:03.760]
where we used to change each other's lives.

[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:09.200]
It's all over now for my steam room

[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.040]
cow who flew to pole like a cow.

[02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:17.360]
And now I'm stuck in with that tight smoking

[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.100]
ginger inside your bed.

[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.540]
I want to set the record straight

[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:31.000]
that I ain't never said.

[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:32.380]
Set the door.

[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:33.500]
Set the door.

[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:34.820]
Set the door.

[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:39.360]
Oh man, when I dubbed that in there,

[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.900]
I just blurted right out loud.

[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:41.960]
It didn't have very often.

[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:44.900]
Yeah, it was just like that.

[02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:45.340]
Snort.

[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.000]
Yeah.

[02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:48.800]
566-705-60.

[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.820]
We apologize for the absolute

[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:54.140]
unacceptable behavior of our general manager

[02:31:54.140 --> 02:31:55.720]
of our whole management team over the last

[02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:57.140]
how many months now?

[02:31:57.380 --> 02:31:58.140]
530, man.

[02:31:58.320 --> 02:31:59.780]
I can't believe that we forgot my

[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:00.620]
Annabelle's register.

[02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:02.320]
I guess it's an odd number anyway.

[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:02.840]
29.

[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:03.380]
Right.

[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:03.980]
That's odd.

[02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:06.280]
Now somehow I survived till next March,

[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:07.920]
when we get to be 530,

[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:08.720]
mully, mully.

[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.900]
29 years on the urn South Florida baby,

[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:12.580]
WKAT even wine my sin.

[02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:13.560]
I would better, I can't wait.

[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:14.020]
Whatever he said.

[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:15.300]
I saw better than KAT.

[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:16.860]
My, my, my, look out.

[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:18.420]
We're going to come and get your blind,

[02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:19.860]
like when you least expect it.

[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:20.920]
Oh, we need the problem.

[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:23.100]
I'd be real careful next time I stare to that car.

[02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:25.200]
566-705-60.

[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:26.380]
Well, he's in South Florida, right?

[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:26.860]
Right.

[02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:28.560]
Not a problem, not an impediment.

[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:30.260]
Pound 560 under Verizon's

[02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:31.060]
singular wireless lines.

[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:32.900]
Do we have any of the steering people still listening?

[02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:33.120]
No.

[02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:34.140]
No, absolutely not.

[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:34.660]
Not one.

[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:35.820]
I bet you we don't have one.

[02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:36.820]
That's all you're fault.

[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:38.220]
Oh, no question about it.

[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.480]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:40.580]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:42.760]
I got something to say about Jim.

[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:43.440]
Yeah.

[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:46.340]
Yeah, it's funny how he's against the

[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:48.280]
flop and he says there is doesn't the reason,

[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:49.180]
but he only gives two.

[02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:50.000]
Yeah.

[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:51.200]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:52.260]
And they're both lies.

[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:53.480]
They both lies anyway.

[02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:54.140]
Hey, back.

[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:56.600]
He should just, you know, just, you know,

[02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:58.320]
stop eating or do something.

[02:32:58.820 --> 02:32:58.960]
Yes.

[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:00.220]
You know, stop wasting people's time.

[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:01.420]
OK, thanks.

[02:33:01.700 --> 02:33:03.720]
Yeah, stop wasting people's time with coming to South Florida

[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:06.200]
with all that crap at Waston Tammatory, Shive O's body, too.

[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:06.540]
OK?

[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:08.360]
Go help out in the cool way, do please.

[02:33:08.860 --> 02:33:10.300]
We'll help you, uh, coaxing our sister.

[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:11.020]
Look at that.

[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:11.720]
There is not one.

[02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:12.820]
Well, there is one far in the front,

[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:13.280]
a little up there.

[02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:14.760]
This is a pretty weak George.

[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:15.340]
Yeah.

[02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:16.800]
Was it this way all last week?

[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:19.380]
I guarantee your phones were so weak, man.

[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:20.140]
The fold word.

[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:22.420]
Why the fold word smoke?

[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:22.860]
Come on, Dr.

[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:23.640]
what was the story?

[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:24.340]
Were they on fire?

[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:25.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.180]
Somehow they didn't sound like a real

[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:32.620]
enthusiastic endorsement.

[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:33.000]
OK?

[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:35.020]
I'm going to leave out on the floor.

[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:35.580]
I really am.

[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:37.780]
We're just, I'm just, I'm going to take the microphone with you.

[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:38.840]
No, I can.

[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:41.420]
I can just kind of like a nice thing, you know.

[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:43.360]
70 Q.A.M.

[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:43.560]
Hello.

[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:45.740]
Hi Q.A.M.

[02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:46.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:49.400]
I was wondering if I can get out in a year.

[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:50.540]
I'd like to talk to the bird.

[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:52.420]
W Q.A.M.

[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:52.660]
Hello.

[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:55.840]
Yeah, well, if you want to give it or take it or receive it.

[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:56.660]
W Q.A.M.

[02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:56.880]
Hello.

[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.040]
Yeah, rather we see your death notice.

[02:33:59.320 --> 02:33:59.820]
W Q.A.M.

[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:00.060]
Hello.

[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:01.200]
You know, I worry today.

[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:01.760]
OK?

[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:05.060]
If our fat ass governor so concerned with crime,

[02:34:05.180 --> 02:34:07.180]
why doesn't he go clean up the area wherever his daughter

[02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:08.640]
kicked up a little crack having it?

[02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:09.380]
Excellent point.

[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:10.080]
Very good point.

[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:11.640]
I may be expecting a rest of the week on that.

[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:11.960]

[02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:12.760]
All right.

[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:13.120]
Take care.

[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:13.880]
Thank you.

[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:16.040]
Yeah, maybe you could clean up that parking lot

[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:17.840]
where his kid was banging his girlfriend out there

[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:19.940]
and brought daylight at that the Tennessee shopping

[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:20.540]
all that day.

[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:22.240]
You're so worried about everybody else.

[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.120]
I mean, for you to be talking about morality,

[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.180]
it's like Michael Jackson given a given a testimony

[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.020]
about child abuse, Jeb.

[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:29.640]
You idiot.

[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:32.440]
See, this is the thing with this whole dysfunctional bush

[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.800]
family, including the brother and the Gossamer

[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:35.300]
Schbacher.

[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:37.120]
They're all a bunch of, you know, born

[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:39.860]
again, phony, syphagrids with the abusing in this

[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:41.800]
or coaxing and all the other crap.

[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.480]
You got a dry drunk up there in Washington.

[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:44.540]
I'm not so sure how dry.

[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:46.300]
And you got the coaxing daughter.

[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:48.380]
And you got the one kid, George P,

[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:50.200]
that was doing wheelies in a parking lot.

[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.340]
They ran around the naked.

[02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:53.220]
And then the other kid that was doing his girlfriend

[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:54.640]
in a parking lot of the shopping mall.

[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.460]
And then you got the wife who's a smuggler.

[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:00.480]
But other than that, it's one fine family.

[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:02.100]
Yeah, one fine American family.

[02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:03.380]
And they're good Christians.

[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.260]
Of course, he's like I said, turned Catholic.

[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:05.920]
He found religion.

[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:07.020]
They were kind of rubbed off, you know?

[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:08.360]
He found religion in Mexico.

[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:09.720]
Well, they do that there at the Catholic church.

[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:11.400]
They rub off on you in Mexico.

[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:12.620]
He found it.

[02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:13.700]
W.A.M. Hello.

[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:14.420]
A meal.

[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:15.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:17.140]
Did you see this special last night on date line

[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:18.060]
for Benny Hinn?

[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:19.740]
No, I had a fax about it.

[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:20.380]
George saw it.

[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:23.280]
He does an $10 million house overlooking the ocean.

[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:23.960]
Yeah.

[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.480]
He stays in five to $10,000 all the way

[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:27.860]
night hotels when he travels.

[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:28.560]
Yeah.

[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:29.120]
Yeah.

[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:30.360]
And you know something?

[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:31.800]
If there are enough stupid people out there,

[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.720]
they want to subsidize him.

[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:34.480]
If the government wants to let him off tax-free,

[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.660]
then more power to him.

[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:35.920]
OK?

[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:37.880]
I'm all for scam artists, right?

[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:38.740]
No.

[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:39.680]
Why not?

[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:40.260]
I'm not.

[02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:42.100]
I say more power to him.

[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:43.040]
Let's give us a piece.

[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:44.500]
If he gave you a piece, you'd say, hey,

[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.140]
go go, Benny.

[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:46.120]
Depend on the piece.

[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:47.540]
Well, he'd give you a big piece.

[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:48.540]
Not his hair piece, I hope.

[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:50.320]
No, that's in his hands, Lee.

[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:51.000]
Say, baby.

[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:51.380]
He's got one.

[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:51.700]
Baby.

[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:52.320]
Baby.

[02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:55.160]
How is Dan and Paul Crotch, too, in my way lately?

[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:57.360]
We hear a lot of stuff going on with Paul's crotch.

[02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.920]
Not necessarily with women either, is what we're hearing.

[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.060]
All these silly old people out there,

[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:03.620]
all these desperate shut-ins, man.

[02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:05.900]
Right now, they're checks sending their money in.

[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:06.980]
You know, they're going to go to heaven.

[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.100]
They can buy some more makeup for Jan,

[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:13.220]
or maybe for Tammy Fei, all the silly queens out there.

[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:14.860]
They're going to obsessed with Tammy Fei now,

[02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:17.120]
like your boyfriend Carlos out there at the front desk.

[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.120]
Let me say it again.

[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:21.040]
I want to say this very, very firmly and very loud.

[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:21.360]

[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:21.860]
Wow.

[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:22.480]
Got it?

[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:25.440]
When you get off that elevator at WQAM,

[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:28.340]
and you walk into that very small lobby,

[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:31.560]
and sitting at the reception desk is one of the nastiest,

[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.320]
most ordinary screaming faggets.

[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:34.560]
I've ever encountered in my life,

[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:36.940]
with a disposition like the Witch from Hell,

[02:36:37.220 --> 02:36:38.900]
that should tell you everything you need to know

[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:42.100]
about the business, the ass-end business operation of QAM.

[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:43.220]
Hey, Bella!

[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:44.460]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:45.740]
Am I right?

[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:46.780]
Is there any doubt about it?

[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:48.300]
Sometimes they see Nozzlin, though.

[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:49.580]
Who's the sweetheart?

[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:50.360]
We like her a lot.

[02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:52.320]
But most of the time, you don't see her.

[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:53.520]
You'll know the difference.

[02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:55.380]
She's a better dresser.

[02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:57.820]
David, WQAM, hello.

[02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.880]
Wow, I guess you're with you, man.

[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:01.800]
It's been like, yeah, the whole day.

[02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:03.260]
Listen, you don't want that fat ass

[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:05.500]
but yeah, Bush doesn't want money for the schools.

[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:06.640]
Am I right, sir?

[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:08.700]
Because the biggest one, the schools go bankrupt

[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:09.680]
so they can stick in pictures

[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.120]
and teach them Italian design.

[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:12.760]
So they could keep voting for them, those idiots.

[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:14.320]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:15.880]
He doesn't want any money for public education.

[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:17.540]
He wants all parochial schools,

[02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:19.620]
he wants the brainwashed, all the children's out there.

[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:21.940]
So we can turn them all into a bunch of lemmings,

[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:23.520]
a bunch of sheep who will turn their money

[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:25.780]
right over to him and his old corrupt family,

[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:26.940]
and maybe even the Pope.

[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.420]
A lot of Pope's got it, and he's got to have a lot of money

[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:30.400]
for recovery, don't you think?

[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:31.960]
He brought oxygen.

[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:36.240]
pound 5, 60, how does that pull come?

[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.380]
We're going to make it to 700 votes

[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:39.480]
because if not, we're indeed trouble, man.

[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:40.300]
We'll do it.

[02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:40.960]
What do we got?

[02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:42.180]
I didn't even look to see what we got.

[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:42.420]
Close.

[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:45.200]
No chance, 6, 65, are you kidding me?

[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:46.520]
We only got 20 minutes.

[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:47.900]
You must be a Schmidt me, man.

[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:51.860]
665, a really weak, weak response

[02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:54.440]
to an incredibly important question.

[02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:55.720]
These people don't understand the magnitude

[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:57.300]
of these polls we take, do they?

[02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.260]
No, they don't.

[02:37:58.380 --> 02:37:59.940]
They don't understand that when we finish

[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:01.600]
with these poll numbers, we hand them over

[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:02.780]
to the committee there.

[02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:04.820]
And they penalize them, and they rehash them

[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:06.500]
and thrash them, pass them along the Joyce

[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.000]
and all the corporate brief shots of the leader

[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.980]
in Naples who are busy telling the shareholders

[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.760]
about the eight complaints against us

[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:14.080]
from the Howard Stern Show, and about the fact

[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:15.560]
that Pharrell is still hanging over our heads.

[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:17.960]
And we said, oh, I didn't even know we paid 55 grand

[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:18.940]
for Pharrell, did you know that?

[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:19.600]
I do know.

[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.640]
Yeah, just it was in the article, did you see it?

[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:22.520]
Yes, I did.

[02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:24.220]
Yeah, paid 55 grand for that.

[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:27.400]
And we finally escaped with our lives from that

[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:28.860]
without getting the license we knew.

[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:30.660]
And then we bring Howard Stern to put on here

[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:32.740]
that we have to chop up like a piece of Swiss cheese,

[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:35.120]
and now we've got eight more complaints from our you know who.

[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:36.400]
What a surprise.

[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:37.400]
Are they listening to me?

[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:37.760]
No.

[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:38.340]
Did I warn them?

[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.100]
I say, hey, you're making a bad mistake,

[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:41.640]
but now I know nothing, man.

[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:42.600]
I know nothing.

[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:43.720]
They're the experts.

[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.820]
They're intrigued by the possibility

[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:47.100]
of losing the license.

[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:47.860]
They're intrigued.

[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:50.520]
Man, he ought to be on MTV, you know,

[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.900]
if they bring back that show, Jackass, who's out there?

[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:55.980]
Your buddy, Greg, Oh, and Joyce, and Maddie,

[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.560]
and the Water Nazi, and Gary Surner.

[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:01.460]
19 till 2 at 5, 60 WQAM.

[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:03.740]
Even after all this time, some people still think

[02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:05.080]
it's strange to buy a bed over the phone.

[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.460]
When you call 1-800-MACRIS, the number for dialer-mACRIS,

[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:09.440]
you'll find out they've got the most liberal exchange

[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:10.700]
policy, so there's no risk.

[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:12.680]
This is one time when liberal can't be all bad.

[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:15.320]
Did you know that 1-800-MACRIS is more repeat customers

[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.520]
than anybody else in the industry?

[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:19.320]
So once you try it, you'll never go back wasting your time

[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:22.580]
and gas in effort in a showroom or departments store again.

[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.600]
You'll get no nonsense, no run-around,

[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:27.380]
no showroom shenanigans, just factory-direct presses

[02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:28.640]
on the best brands you know and trust.

[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.180]
When you call 1-800-MACRIS, you'll be calling the company

[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:33.220]
ranked numeral, uno, and customer satisfaction.

[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:36.020]
They carry Celi, Certa, Simmons, King Coral,

[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:37.820]
tempera-peedic, Stearns, and Foster, Hewitt,

[02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.320]
and now, dialer-mACRIS offers no payments

[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:40.800]

[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:49.920]

for years to come.

[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:02.380]
You are listening to new Rogers.

[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:04.040]
And the exclusive tape.

[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.240]
R-U-N-560-60-Q-A-M.

[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:10.700]
But then I got high.

[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.560]
Daddy got me in the Yale to pass.

[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:16.360]
But then I got high.

[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.640]
Now, every word I say is messed up and I know why.

[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:24.320]
Because I got high.

[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:25.780]
Because I got high.

[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:27.500]
Because I got high.

[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:30.340]
I had to go to Vietnam.

[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:32.680]
But then I got high.

[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:36.440]
I tried to hide out in Alabama.

[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:38.220]
But then I got high.

[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:41.560]
I was waiting to scare the fight.

[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:43.320]
So I had to lie.

[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:46.160]
Because I got high.

[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:47.640]
Because I got high.

[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:49.300]
Because I got high.

[02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:53.180]
After 9-1-1, I was keen.

[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:54.640]
But then I got high.

[02:40:56.180 --> 02:40:58.460]
I had to catch that osama dingalite.

[02:40:59.100 --> 02:40:59.960]
But then I got high.

[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.500]
Instead, I attacked a wreck.

[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:05.420]
And no one knew why.

[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:08.120]
Because I got high.

[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:09.540]
Because I got high.

[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.160]
Because I got high.

[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:11.880]
Absolutely.

[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:14.880]
Now, we've got a big deficit.

[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:17.040]
Because I got high.

[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:20.800]
Even Republicans are throwing a fit.

[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.660]
Because I got high.

[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:26.200]
Now, the whole country is messed up.

[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:28.160]
And we all know why.

[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:30.560]
Because I got high.

[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:31.980]
Because I got high.

[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:33.560]
Because I got high.

[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:34.380]
Any questions?

[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:35.440]
Yes, Mr. President.

[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:36.640]
What about health care?

[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:38.240]
I ran in Social Security.

[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:39.420]
What are you planning to do?

[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:40.260]
Hold on.

[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.500]
Let me think about it.

[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.920]
You know, I say we get them home-motion skin.

[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:49.960]
147.

[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:52.260]
And I'm sure that in some of the churches on Sunday,

[02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:53.820]
they were preaching about going out to them

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:55.280]
or voting against the evils of gambling.

[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:57.700]
It's okay if it's bingo for the church.

[02:41:58.160 --> 02:41:58.180]
Okay?

[02:41:58.420 --> 02:41:58.500]
Right.

[02:41:58.840 --> 02:41:59.340]
Then it's all right.

[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:01.720]
As long as they can stick it in their pockets like Benny Hindass,

[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.500]
and whatever his name is, Benny Hind, then that's okay.

[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:07.820]
But if somebody else might benefit from it,

[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:08.980]
if we're going to get some tax dollars,

[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:10.360]
and some people are going to get some great jobs,

[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:11.360]
or even decent jobs,

[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:12.180]
you know, that's bad.

[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:13.900]
Because they want it all for themselves.

[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:14.860]
There are a bunch of hazards.

[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:15.900]
There's the Russians say,

[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:16.560]
hazards.

[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:17.640]
You know what that means?

[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:18.480]
I do.

[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:20.700]
Here's a fact from Rocco who says,

[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.000]
you haven't seen him since you're in Toronto.

[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:22.620]
Look at you.

[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:23.120]
Amen.

[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:24.900]
By the way, it's 41 degrees here.

[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.100]
Oh my God.

[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.060]
I got to get out into it.

[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:29.120]
I got to just walk outside and feel it.

[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:29.540]
You know what I mean?

[02:42:30.220 --> 02:42:30.940]
41 degrees.

[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:32.100]
It's a freaking heat wave.

[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:34.060]
But the signs for the anti-slot's crowd

[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:34.940]
that are on the street say,

[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:36.480]
no slots, no details, no way.

[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:37.580]
But at the top of them.

[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.860]
And you know, here's the governor

[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:40.560]
if I can interrupt Rocco's facts for a moment.

[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:41.540]
Can I Rocco thank you?

[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:42.720]
He comes out and knows spots.

[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:45.020]
And he says, well, the legislature has to create

[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:45.600]
the legislation.

[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:46.660]
Well, of course they do.

[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:48.480]
So are you telling us that the legislature is going to

[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.700]
subvert the world of the public again?

[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:51.740]
And not going to do it the way it's supposed to, huh?

[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:52.640]
Is that what you tell us?

[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:54.720]
If the legislature led by you is incompetent,

[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:55.960]
you line sack a crap.

[02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:57.760]
Anyway, at the top of the billboards,

[02:42:57.760 --> 02:42:58.920]
it says, remember the lottery.

[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:00.540]
How we can say about that is,

[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:01.900]
if the lottery is no good,

[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000]
why aren't the governor and his minions getting rid of that?

[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:06.240]
They have to spend as much on lot of advertising

[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.080]
as on the payouts,

[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:08.000]
four words for us.

[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:09.200]
Statehood for South Florida,

[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:12.020]
and I score Rocco at a preaching effort like 20 some years.

[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:13.440]
We'd have casinos,

[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:16.060]
our own governor and state legislature within a four-hour drive.

[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:18.240]
And we wouldn't have to share our taxes with racist,

[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:20.820]
fascist, red-next-and-tampa, F-tampa.

[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:22.340]
Keep up the great work, says Rocco.

[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:23.640]
Nice call Rocco, you go, boy.

[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:24.440]
What do you say?

[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:26.720]
Statehood for South Florida, let's succeed.

[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:29.360]
If you're going to succeed, you have to succeed.

[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.740]
Wouldn't you say, all right, it's been done.

[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:32.040]
And then legalize weed.

[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:33.380]
And that's what I read.

[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:34.820]
Oh, I say, Greg Reed.

[02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:35.300]
Oh, look at that.

[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:36.280]
We're going to make 700 votes.

[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:37.720]
So I guess Josh keeps his job.

[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:39.760]
I really don't want to break the line with him.

[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:40.180]
What for?

[02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:42.360]
That he was going to lose his job both with the Marlins and our show

[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:44.000]
if we didn't get to 700 votes today.

[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:44.860]
Thank God.

[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:45.580]
One more day for what?

[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:47.500]
Josh keeps his job for one more day.

[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:48.280]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:49.800]
Are you doing this to him every day now?

[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:50.240]
Why not?

[02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:52.300]
A little bit of heavy duty stress.

[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:55.080]
That's his baddest in making him say Tom Brady's a hot-looking guy.

[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:57.040]
He made him do that man pole for like a month.

[02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:59.480]
I did not for like two weeks.

[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:01.220]
Are you crazy or what, huh?

[02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:02.560]
Man pole my ass.

[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:03.320]
Oops.

[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:06.520]
696 votes.

[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:07.480]
We still got four to go.

[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:08.900]
It's not in a sack yet, sweetheart.

[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:10.240]
Still got four to go.

[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:12.720]
And of course, you know how it gets because you got a scared America.

[02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:13.820]
You got boog steering.

[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:14.460]
You got a rush.

[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:17.880]
You know, once we get to the last part of the show, not that we're starting out so great anymore anyhow,

[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:19.440]
now that Greg has killed us.

[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:21.520]
But we get to the ass end of it, man.

[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:23.200]
And we're like kind of slowed down to a crawl.

[02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:25.580]
It could be really, really nip and tuck.

[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:26.160]
Sure.

[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:27.420]
This means it's a real Roger.

[02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:28.320]
It's scored.

[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:29.440]
So go go go go go.

[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:30.440]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:33.680]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:34.140]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:34.640]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:34.640]

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:34.640]

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:34.640]

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:34.640]

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:34.640]

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:35.820]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:38.060]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:39.080]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:40.640]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:43.660]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:45.740]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:47.500]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:49.260]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:49.280]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.980]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:53.680]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:54.300]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:55.980]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:56.880]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:57.660]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:57.660 --> 02:44:57.660]

[02:44:57.660 --> 02:44:58.460]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:58.460 --> 02:44:59.420]
I'm just a man.

[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:08.840]
I'm just a man.

[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:29.160]
I'm just a man.

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.160]

[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:29.280]
I'm just a man.

[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:29.300]
I'm just a man.

[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:29.300]

[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:29.300]

[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:29.400]
I'm just a man.

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:29.400]

[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:36.400]
It seems to me that just one of me alone in the world is almost one dead.

[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:39.500]
It won't be one dead.

[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:41.720]
We don't need to.

[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:44.780]
We don't need to.

[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:45.160]

[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:51.720]
And if you wait a few more years, you'll be drinking all your beers.

[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.380]
You might take your eye on your brand new bride, realizing your worst years.

[02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:03.000]
Because when you're only weak, you'll still be at its peak.

[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:08.680]
Grab your fight a day, cash in all your checks, pickin' you on to the end.

[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:12.420]
Swat and you have the same DNA.

[02:46:12.860 --> 02:46:20.440]
Be it all your fault, let's hope that science has presents to bring it all to a halt.

[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:22.420]
You're going fast away.

[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:27.380]
Give you DNA to come again.

[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:29.280]
I'm not truly.

[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:31.320]
Absolutely.

[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:33.420]
I'm not truly.

[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:35.720]
I'm not truly.

[02:46:36.780 --> 02:46:38.140]
750 votes you're safe.

[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:41.280]
So I guess they must have had that's why you were reminded of it.

[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:43.820]
They must have had big duens on March 1st from my anniversary.

[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:46.260]
Yeah, yeah, we had a big party.

[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.460]
I mean, I was last, what was March 1st last Tuesday?

[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:49.060]
Correct.

[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:54.320]
And it must have had like balloons and all kinds of party favors and say-

[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:55.500]
Forers and both papers, right?

[02:46:56.300 --> 02:46:56.680]
Oh yeah.

[02:46:57.020 --> 02:47:03.200]
Because I know that here I got like a telegram and flowers and phone calls and nothing.

[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:04.940]
Oh, I did get my check late.

[02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:09.220]
Got my check late, it was really great.

[02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:11.720]
And I just got again, Clarissa, all you other fakeers over there.

[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:14.040]
See, I know what they do when payday comes up on a Friday.

[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:16.140]
There's always some emergency that happens.

[02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:20.160]
So that way you can't get it until Monday afternoon, which gets stalls them over until Tuesday.

[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:23.940]
See, I used to think I was joking about that about this being a hand-to-mouth company.

[02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:24.760]
I don't think so.

[02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:29.440]
Because until your close friend Greg puts his little squiggle on the check, it means NG.

[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.080]
NG is an uh-uh.

[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:31.940]
Don't do it.

[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:33.960]
When it's out, don't give that baby out.

[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:35.880]
750 votes on the pool.

[02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:39.020]
And by the way, you noticed once and thanks to that guy that got a code into reminding me,

[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.820]
because I totally forgot about it, you know, about the big anniversary 29.

[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:45.000]
I mean, that's a pretty impressive year, 29.

[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.300]
Sure, absolutely.

[02:47:46.660 --> 02:47:47.460]
Like, um, 30.

[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:48.860]
So I'm pretty sure he is that.

[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:49.520]
Yeah.

[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.000]
And I noticed that after he called it, you see the way the phones just look.

[02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:53.760]
Happy anniversary.

[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:55.100]
There was one guy who said something.

[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:55.980]
The red is still there.

[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.080]
Nothing's going to change.

[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:58.680]
The station ain't going to change.

[02:47:58.840 --> 02:47:59.880]
The market isn't going to change.

[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:00.980]
The people aren't going to change.

[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:02.060]
It's still the same.

[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:08.160]
A heartless, a cold, insensitive, cruel, rude, angry, etc.

[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:11.240]
Be sure to go out and vote for us by the way, several times today and tomorrow.

[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:14.040]
And then of course, if you're against the thing on Wednesday, you can go vote no.

[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:20.640]
717 votes can WQM recover from Greg Reads latest blunder or are we doomed into it?

[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:23.720]
And believe me, he's got a list of blunders, uh, longer than your arm.

[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:24.560]
Don't care.

[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:27.420]
I only listened to the O375, 52.3%.

[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:30.480]
No, you just jerked the audience around too much, 103.

[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:32.540]
Yes, I loved the new L.A. 78.

[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.760]
The steering business was, uh, the N for Greg 59.

[02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:37.320]
Oh, how we only wish.

[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:39.800]
Waxy will destroy you guys 46.

[02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:41.640]
46 people say that.

[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:42.380]
Do they believe it?

[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:43.020]
No, he's stuck.

[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:44.580]
They got Joe and Yamama.

[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:48.500]
Greg is a genius 32, which means Mattie Bell voted multiple times here.

[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:49.360]
Can you see him in the water?

[02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:50.240]
Now see him in the WGRI.

[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.280]
Oh, yeah, let's get that emoted in for Greg.

[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:52.900]
He's a genius.

[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:55.840]
And the horseshoe and for these clover must have fallen out of Greg's dough.

[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.400]
Ask 24 said that.

[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.500]
Tomorrow, I'm sure we'll get tremendous amount of congratulations.

[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:01.060]
Do you think?

[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:03.840]
I'll tell the Rams, letters, flowers, hate mail.

[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:04.920]
Okay, Moe is next.

[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:05.820]
Man, dog, it's four.

[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:06.620]
Bye, bye, bye.
