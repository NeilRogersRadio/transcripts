[00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020]
Oh, that was good.

[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.740]
Oh, man.

[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.040]
Neil Rogers, week eight from 10 to 2 on 5, 6, 8, 8.

[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.580]
All right, my favorite time of the day. I get to leave.

[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.600]
How are you?

[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.840]
That's my favorite time, but 158.

[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.180]
Yeah. What's going with you?

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.120]
Do you know that on September 21st, 1970,

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.200]
would you probably know this?

[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.400]
The first Monday night football game,

[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.940]
the Jets lost to the Brown 31 to 21 in the same score.

[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600]
The same score they lost to the Patriots on the last one in football.

[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.380]
How do you like that?

[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.640]
Yeah.

[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.500]
Lightening striking twice in the same place.

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.420]
So this moment I didn't know that.

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.640]
And the Jets were on a losing side of both games.

[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.320]
That's what I just said.

[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.440]
That's what I just said.

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.840]
They lost 31 to 21 to the Browns and then to the Patriots.

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.400]
But then he ran.

[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.420]
So how was your luck with Alan Cohen yesterday?

[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.980]
Well, he spent the whole afternoon together doing what?

[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.700]
Fetting horses.

[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.320]
Well, what is that?

[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620]
We had lunche called her for what purpose?

[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.280]
He owns a stable.

[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.180]
I know that.

[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.540]
And he owns a big horse farm up in Ocala.

[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.100]
Yeah.

[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.540]
So you guys were just over the top.

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.220]
We had lunche played horses.

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.960]
Had a good day.

[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.860]
Want some money?

[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.660]
Not me.

[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.400]
He's a good handicapper, by the way.

[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.980]
He's he really?

[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.300]
Yes.

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.700]
And you know what?

[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.820]
He's a pretty good guy.

[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.440]
Huh.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.260]
I liked him.

[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480]
He's got you one over.

[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.160]
Yeah.

[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.480]
The horse player was a hockey team.

[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.460]
What could be worse than that?

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.680]
Pretty good game last night, too.

[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.320]
Like I said, the Panthers would beat the Bruins.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.840]
But you did.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.600]
They had a tough time.

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.800]
Yeah.

[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.440]
But I got home from Woodbiner.

[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.080]
I said, a highlight.

[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.820]
That was a phenomenal game.

[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.900]
There were actually some people there.

[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.660]
You would, yeah.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.400]
They sold out for Friday night.

[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.280]
Really?

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.700]
Yeah.

[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.240]
I mean, he gave me the straight information on attendance.

[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420]
And he said it's been gradually climbing.

[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.880]
Yeah, with the wins.

[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.740]
And you know, the other thing is.

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.880]
I just sold out for Friday because it's the frogs.

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.020]
Yeah, a lot of your old ones.

[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.280]

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.580]
It's four thousand frogs there.

[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.860]
Right.

[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.420]
Oh, brother.

[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.580]
But you know, they're going to make money this year.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.680]
Well, they're going to make money this year because they got a pretty low payroll.

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.240]
They're not anywhere near the salary count.

[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.880]
Well, they're getting at that profit-seering thing.

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.260]
He's looking to feed out of the trough.

[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.360]
Well, they've got to.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.680]
You know, coming back after the strike, the, you know, this collective bargaining agreement is going to work for both sides.

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.880]
It would not so well for the players.

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.020]
But it's going to work for the owners in a big way.

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.720]
Well, they're already saying that that the league is going to make money and the cap is going to go up next year to 45 or 46 million, something like that.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.880]
Yeah.

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.320]
And they're already.

[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.380]
And of course, that again is going to like tilt right back to where it was before in favor of the big market teams, like Philly and Toronto, etc.

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.820]
And we're saying the way things are right now that the league can be very competitive.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.280]
Yeah.

[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.260]
Well, of course, if you're looking at Alain, it's kicking ass in the division.

[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.600]
But they're happy.

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560]
They're playing better.

[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.420]
He said Horton, his, you know, stepped up, Gary Roberts is playing well.

[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.960]
Yoke and of course has been terrific.

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.280]
You're looking to go and like his healthy.

[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.200]
And so.

[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.900]
It was with hockey talk.

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.780]
Bye-bye everybody.

[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.760]
Nice to have nice to the new year.

[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.720]
So by the way, the coach will be on next Tuesday.

[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.020]
Jock Martin.

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.420]
Yes.

[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.740]
Oh, in other words, he is, what do you mean he'll be on next Tuesday?

[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.860]
Well, we have my keen in usually every other Tuesday.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.180]
Right.

[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.280]
But keen in is going to be in Vancouver.

[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.520]
So we will have the coach.

[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.340]
Yeah, that frog Jack Martin on.

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.860]
Well, that's good.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.240]
Ask him how he lost all those playoff games in Ottawa.

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.560]
It's such a superior team.

[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.060]
I say we have a question from Neil and Toronto.

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.800]
Yeah.

[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.700]
How come you choked in Ottawa every year, Jock?

[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.840]
I think I got a nice team.

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.060]
I said that at the beginning of the year.

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.260]
They didn't gel very well, but now they're even Martin Gelanah had a nice school last night.

[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.160]
They're playing pretty good.

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.000]
Jock did not, you know, did not panic when they were losing all those games.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.760]
Well, I got news for you may say that, but there was a lot of rumors when they were in the.

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.640]
Oh, yeah, when when with the ass end of that tailspin man, when they went on the road and.

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.200]
Right.

[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.360]
Keenan went on the trip.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.040]
That is correct.

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.000]
See, I'm keeping up with him.

[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.760]
Moving on to bigger and better things like QAM.

[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.700]
So I was seeing their losing at Woodbine.

[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.900]
I was trying to conjure up in my mind what this meeting was with Alan Cohn was all about.

[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.960]
I don't know you're going to the train.

[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.980]
It really wasn't a meeting.

[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.440]
It was so good.

[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.540]
I didn't want to get to go.

[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.660]
You made it sound like there was something sinister involved.

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.940]
No, nothing to mention.

[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.640]
So that's too bad.

[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.440]
Because I was thinking, well, maybe he's going to buy the radio station and then pay me off, you know.

[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.060]
You know what I thought would be a good idea.

[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.220]
I'm just for him to buy the station and pay me.

[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.480]
You warning I was thinking about.

[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.720]
No, not pay you off.

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.080]
Yes.

[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.860]
But that he buy the radio station.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.060]
And we clean house and get rid of the people we don't want around here anymore.

[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.360]
What was that for good business?

[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.160]
Saker is that just for out of spite?

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.040]
What's the difference?

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.820]
It's our age.

[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.660]
How do you care about the business?

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.500]
It's his money.

[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.860]
He couldn't squander at any worse than the previous administration.

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.400]
There you go.

[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.080]
Well, it's kind of hard though to sell a station when you don't have a license, isn't it?

[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.120]
Well, there is a little bit of a technicality.

[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.040]
What happens if you don't have a license, you get stopped.

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.900]
Like driving a car without a license?

[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.700]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.800]
It's kind of hard to sell something that you don't have.

[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.160]
Because when you sell a radio station, you're selling the broadcast like a song of license.

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.000]
Is your asset?

[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.500]
Our license is in limbo.

[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.800]
It's still doing the limbo rock.

[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.240]
And like anything else, you can't get a straight answer about anything.

[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.660]
So as each day goes by, before I go on the year, various and sundry people come in,

[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.740]
and the rumor is that everybody in the building is like walking on eggshells,

[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.640]
because nobody's got any clue what's going on, including Clarence, who's as clueless as ever.

[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.200]
And nobody has a clue.

[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.000]
Which is so clashless, man.

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.540]
It's so typical of this business, you know.

[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.840]
We're all just a bunch of peons.

[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.620]
Never mind, man.

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.780]
You know what?

[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.860]
I think this guy and I think that we can be friendly enough that I can coerce him into doing this.

[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.660]
Who do you want to get rid of?

[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.160]
In other words, you're going to get Alan Cohen to buy the radio station?

[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.560]

[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.640]
And we'll make a list.

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.220]
Now, tell me that that didn't come up in a conversation yesterday.

[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.600]
About him buying a radio station?

[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.920]
Yeah.

[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.240]
No.

[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.080]
Oh.

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.600]
We talked about you a little bit.

[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.640]
Oh, boy.

[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.020]
How about he's a big fan of mine?

[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.960]
You know what?

[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.180]
Not.

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.800]
Why?

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.780]
You know what?

[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.920]
He's got the right attitude.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.240]
Well, what is that?

[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.400]
It's a radio show.

[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.580]
I'm not a radio show.

[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.560]
Yeah, and...

[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.360]
Doesn't bother him.

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.340]
What doesn't bother him that I ripped him an ass?

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.080]
Because he thinks he knows something?

[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.200]
See, this year he finally left it up to the hockey people, and they brought in some good players.

[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.320]
Right.

[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.240]
And they got a good balance of veterans and young players.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.740]
And you know what?

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.140]
He acknowledges that he's been learning as he's gone along.

[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.560]
Yeah.

[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.780]
You would like this guy.

[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.760]
I'm not kidding you.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.260]
Okay.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.680]
Hey, if he's got a lot of money, I'd like to buy it.

[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.040]

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.120]
So what did he say about me?

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.720]
I'm curious now that you brought that up.

[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.500]
He heard you when you were ripping him.

[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.040]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.400]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.220]
You know what?

[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.240]
He's got the right approach to it.

[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.040]
It's like some people when you rip them, they go over the top.

[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.480]
You know what?

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.520]
When they start taking it out on other people.

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.320]
You mean like Wayne?

[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.920]
No.

[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.800]
No, no, no, no.

[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.220]
Yes.

[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.340]
And I see how long did that take.

[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.640]
He was the furthest thing for him.

[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.480]
He's not even on today.

[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.260]
Yes.

[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.600]
And you're hoping that that trend continues.

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.760]
So in other words, I don't know about this track.

[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.380]
What he's writing to say is let's get Alan Cohen to buy the station and say, first of all, most contract expires in March.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.880]
Now this is already the end of the year.

[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.420]
The year is over.

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.960]
This is my last show of the year today.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.700]
Are you on tomorrow?

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.160]
Oh well.

[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.120]
Happy New Year.

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.820]
I got the worst contract in the place.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.880]
But I'm off Monday.

[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.520]
I'm taking Monday.

[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.420]
I'm off Monday too.

[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.420]
So I'll see you two day.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.920]
But anyway, so it's my last show of the year.

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.000]
Happy New Year to you too.

[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.380]
Yeah.

[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.640]
And so other than Mo, who else would you like to blow out since we're mentioning names now?

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.220]
Well, sales sales how about the Curtis Raymond Burr?

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.620]
That would be long before I'd worry about Mo, I'd get his ass out.

[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.280]
We need a sales manager, man.

[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.360]
Curtis Raymond Burr, you mean old-iron size?

[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.300]
Stiffy, yeah.

[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.400]
That situation back there.

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.540]
You know what?

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.360]
Our Raymond Burr is iron head.

[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.980]
Let me give you an example.

[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.120]
Now I noticed I was listening on one morning and you had for Christmas, Vermont teddy bear.

[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.560]
Yes.

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.560]
Okay, you had a couple of spots for them.

[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.260]
How many years have I been doing that spot for Easter and Christmas and whatever?

[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.840]
Me too.

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.300]
They weren't ever on this show.

[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.040]
They weren't on your show?

[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.100]
I mean, I mean this last time before Christmas, they were never on this here.

[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.000]
I don't get that.

[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.160]
No, I don't either.

[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.580]
Everything is falling to the cracks because the left hand back there hasn't got any idea what the right hand is doing.

[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.720]
People keep leaving and flying out the door.

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.360]
Nobody's got it.

[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.100]
And everything just gets dropped.

[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.460]
Everything just falls through the cracks and they're running around back there talking crap like,

[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.180]
oh, well, our rates are too high and we don't get response for a client, all this other crap.

[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.260]
Well, anybody that's got added to that added to this belong in a building.

[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:37.800]
Right.

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.380]
And that's the kind of losers we're having off the street.

[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.080]
It's really sad.

[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.560]
There's a lot of new people back there.

[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.940]
Yeah.

[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.320]
Every time you turn around, every time I would come down to the river.

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.980]
Every time I would come down to do a few shows there.

[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.380]
They would march in at least one or two people.

[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.480]
Oh, I want you to meet Billy.

[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.120]
We want you to meet so and so.

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.840]
This one and that one.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.820]
And who the hell are these people?

[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.180]
What do they know about any of us?

[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.200]
So this radio station and the answer is Zilch.

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.880]
Absolutely Zilch.

[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.520]
Well, we have two minute breaks now.

[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.400]
Oh, I got all threes today, I think.

[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.080]
I got a lot of good.

[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.560]
Thank God for those tradeouts.

[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.940]
Well, you've got higher numbers.

[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.320]
You should have more than two minute break.

[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.940]
Yeah, sure.

[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.240]
I got higher tradeout numbers.

[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.000]
Somebody must have a lot of Rolex watches laying around.

[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.540]
I'll tell you that.

[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.220]
My God.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160]
That thing must run 45 times a show.

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.260]
Oh, you got the Rolex watches?

[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.180]
No, I don't have the watches.

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.140]
I just have the spots.

[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.500]
Oh.

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.500]
I actually have two, four minute breaks today.

[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.200]
Let's hear it.

[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.880]
All right.

[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.340]
For that fantastic sales.

[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.600]
And then Fat Boy refuses to get me copied.

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.340]
And then the other story there is something's going on with this family.

[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.160]
They're all exploding from fat or something like that.

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.080]
I don't know what's going on there.

[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.940]
So they've all got excuses.

[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.180]
But there's nobody around.

[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.000]
If I would have known this, that is just said, OK, after I come back from Amsterdam,

[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.280]
I'll just recuperate for a week and take the whole week off.

[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.260]
Yeah, this is for sure.

[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.420]
We're really not broadcasting this week.

[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.880]
We're just faking it.

[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.840]
We have an empty parking lot downstairs.

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.800]
That's what I heard.

[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.900]
Even Clarence said, he said, this place is a ghost town.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.120]
I would never have had to be for the whan if the parking lot was in the shape of it.

[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.800]
Yeah, she probably would still be there.

[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.140]
You know, something I don't want to like lay it on your fat shoulders, Mr. But, you know,

[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.760]
she would probably still be there if it wasn't for all the grief and angst that you caused.

[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.500]
It was lovely screw in at bitch.

[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.460]
I'm proud of it.

[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.500]
I mean, everything you said was true, but you could have said it nicely.

[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.540]
Bitch, you miserable slut, stuff like that.

[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.900]
In a very nice tone, you know.

[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.660]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.440]
Instead of flying off the handle and getting all emotional and getting your blood pressure up, not good for it.

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:32.760]
I know.

[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.020]
Yesterday I was in Alvin Turra trying to get out of trying to get off Alvin Turra Boulevard.

[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.360]
It was mid-two cops screwing it up there.

[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.520]
And I heard some guy yell, yeah, I had to win the open because it was cool.

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.840]
I heard some guy yell something and the cop yells back at him.

[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.000]
Cool, you're temper, you're going with me and I'm thinking, going where are you kids?

[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.540]
Gridlock, you can't get out of there.

[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.000]
Yeah.

[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.660]
I was tempted to say that to the cop, but I thought, you know, I don't want to get suspended again.

[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.980]
Being arrested.

[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.140]

[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.800]
On the outside.

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:03.520]

[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.480]
All right.

[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.120]
Well, well, well, Cohen is going to bike you away and let's start that moment going.

[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.620]
We're going to go find her, go all upset.

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.680]
He could afford it.

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.320]
I'll say that.

[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.120]
See, I can't see, I mean, this is just me guessing.

[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320]
You might as well conjecture.

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.900]
Nobody can criticize any of us for conjecturing because nobody's telling us anything.

[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.320]
So all we can do is sit around and guess what's going on.

[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.860]
But the fact that long time, you know, all established people like Ray Perry is out the door already

[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.360]
and certain other people are being like demoted and pushed one step toward the door,

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.560]
that's the tell you right there that the old regime is over with.

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.240]
So that whole business with Frank Sinatra and my way.

[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.120]
That was just a classless way of saying goodbye without these or any other decisions.

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.260]
These are corporate decisions.

[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.260]
Well, that's what I'm saying.

[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:46.860]
He's gone.

[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.020]
And that voluntarily either in spite of what it'll be like Don Schulug.

[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.680]
And there will be a memo that will come out that say, Greg Reed is a, we're very sorry to announce that Greg is leaving our company

[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.040]
and to pursue other interests.

[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.140]
And we thank Greg for all these years of, yeah, and that's what's going to happen.

[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.980]
There would be great to be able to find some fish who's got a big bank role

[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.020]
as you could bring in here and buy the place and then yeah.

[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.880]
And we'll leave it to us to take it over.

[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.740]
Based on the beastly's ineptitude and they're insane.

[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.140]
They're obsession with Greg and all the blunders he's made these last several years.

[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.260]
I can't see them being able to operate this place without him.

[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.300]
In other words, who are they going to bring in that they're going to have the same trust and confidence?

[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.040]
Yeah, I wouldn't see it.

[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.580]
Yeah, we'll run the joint.

[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:30.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.440]
Now, what kind of car is he, was he got a Cadillac?

[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.120]
Oh, yeah, that would be my first move.

[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.580]
Okay, well, I got my two corvettes. You can have the Cadillac.

[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.100]
I have an infinity. I'm happy with it.

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.680]
Who gets the Jaguar?

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.320]
You know what? Warren Henry has Jaguars too.

[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.440]
I can, well, there you go. Good.

[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.220]
Get one of those.

[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.120]
I can have one of these.

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.060]
Here's the deal, Clarence. It's not personal as business, but you're back to being sports flocking.

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.920]
Okay, we get hired like a real program director.

[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.140]
Yeah.

[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.140]
With all due respect.

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.140]
I mean, he's like drowning in a sea of incompetent.

[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.480]
I mean, he's just over his head.

[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.140]
I'll take care of Clarence.

[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.080]
I'll make sure he has a job.

[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.540]
Yeah, there, there you go.

[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.520]
Maybe I'll put him in sales or something.

[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.180]
Yeah.

[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.920]
I told him that yesterday I said, he's clear.

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.280]
You're going to be good in sales.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.340]
And then this morning to make him feel better, I said, oh, you're going to be a great GM.

[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.640]
Might as well.

[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.240]
He could do it on his general manager, just like Howard Primer was PD at KAT.

[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.180]
I told you that story.

[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.160]
That's the great story.

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.760]
Yeah.

[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.020]
Waiting in a hallway to get fired and the program director quits and he goes in there and says,

[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.120]
Hey, Howard, how would you like to be the program director?

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.000]
That's a true story.

[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.000]
That's a clip.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.480]
Wow.

[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.080]
What's the hell was your name?

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.200]
Well, I wish to have the senator from Nevada.

[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.520]
Yeah, I know who you're talking about.

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.380]
I've been trying to say it.

[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.420]
He will tell you next time you have a good student like this.

[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:45.800]

[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.480]
And then he told me and I forgot.

[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.500]
I should have written it down.

[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.480]
Yeah, he'll tell you that story in detail.

[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.380]
Of course, it was long after he departed, but it's most amusing.

[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.620]
Well, I hope you have a very happy new year.

[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.220]
Happy new year to Sid Levin.

[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:58.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.740]
Great people in the business.

[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.900]
I can't think of too many of them.

[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.420]
Gary Lawrence.

[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.320]
Happy new year, Gary.

[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.440]
Who else do we like in the business?

[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.300]
Anybody else we know?

[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.520]
Everybody else I knew is dead.

[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.680]
Big cashler.

[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.980]
Did you know that cashler?

[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.500]
I had cash very well.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.820]
Boy, Dick was great.

[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.360]
Now, there was a, see, that's a very unusual thing.

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.300]
A radio guy.

[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.140]
What a concept.

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.660]
I mean, yeah, he wasn't, his background wasn't sales, but he was into programming and he was sitting

[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.360]
and have lunch with him in brainstorm and make all kinds of moves.

[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.260]
He was a fascinating, well, he had a television background too.

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:28.980]
Oh, did he?

[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:35.280]
Yeah, he ran channel 13 and there was a New York station based in Newark.

[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.140]
He also had a circus background.

[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.180]
I don't know if you know that or not.

[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.280]
I didn't know that.

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:48.380]
But I ran into, I think it was, I think I ran into his widow not too long ago.

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:48.880]
Yeah.

[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.120]
Having breakfast someplace.

[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.140]
You know, his name was Richard Rose.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:53.700]
Yeah.

[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.760]
Was his real name.

[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.060]
See, I was an advertising when I first met the Casper and he was, I'll tell you something,

[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.740]
I had a lot of people calling me.

[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.120]
That guy was the best salesperson.

[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.060]
Yeah.

[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.400]
I've ever dealt with in any media type.

[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:06.960]
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.260]
He was an amazing guy.

[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.360]
That was a lot of fun, boy, building that station.

[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.060]
I was just, and he let us all be a part of it, you know, as opposed to this paranoid to keep everybody in the dark,

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.320]
everything's a big secret.

[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.700]
You know, that's what goes on at QIM and it's very unpleasant that now we got a whole staff of,

[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.000]
and mostly good people.

[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.300]
You know, we joke about this one and that one and, uh, the generally speaking, we got a lot of good people.

[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.220]
Yeah, that's no joke.

[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.400]
And, uh, they deserve better than to be like all left in limbo like, you know,

[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.700]
while somebody's got a big ego and what does that mean that Actie put on?

[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.760]
Yeah, it's not right.

[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.580]
It's just not right.

[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.140]
Especially holidays and everything else.

[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:42.960]
People have families.

[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.100]
All these things.

[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.920]
But nevertheless.

[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.700]
You know what?

[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.680]
It's, uh, I, it's interesting though, Neil, when somebody is let go before Christmas and everybody says,

[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.840]
ah, how can you let somebody go before Christmas?

[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.560]
So what's the difference if you wait two weeks?

[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.700]
Right, exactly.

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.300]
It's the idea that they're letting them go.

[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.240]
It's just like giving an extra stilch as the Chinese say, a little stab in the back, you know,

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:10.720]
and not only are we firing your ass, but we're doing it right before the holidays to destroy what ordinarily might be a pleasant time of the year.

[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.080]
Yeah.

[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.100]
Like a little extra stilch as the Hungarians say.

[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.540]
Okay.

[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.800]
On that note, yes.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.300]
I think we got, I think, yeah, listen, now that you're bonding with Alan Cohen, telling them that all is forgiven,

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.700]
the Panthers are playing great like I expected they would.

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.880]
This is the way I thought they would play.

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.900]
Although the Long Go play very well.

[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.260]
Hey, invite me to come out and watch a game in the suite.

[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.520]
I mean, what can you do better than that?

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.720]
Yeah, I'm not going out and watching any high-will-do that.

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.760]
I will do that.

[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.140]
What?

[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.140]
I'll take you with me when you're in town.

[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.540]
Yeah, sure you will.

[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:35.680]
Sure.

[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.780]
I will.

[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.840]
I don't need you to go see the hockey team.

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.860]
I understand that.

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.060]

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.100]
I understand that.

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.300]
You know, but I wouldn't mind spending an evening with you at a hockey game before.

[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.560]
I'd rather have you go to the track at Pompo-no Park.

[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.480]
Okay, we'll do that.

[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.440]
We'll do that in a much better time there.

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.100]
We'll do that instead.

[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:51.860]
Okay.

[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.640]
I'm going to go see my friend Derek there very soon as a matter of fact.

[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.220]
Just let Tom and you two up in.

[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.440]
I'm ready.

[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.060]
Our pair of mutual friend, Derek.

[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.560]
Okay.

[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.960]
Derek knows where the bodies are buried.

[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.440]
Believe me.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.340]
In fact, maybe I'll sit in the fat-rich memorial seat.

[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.020]
Okay.

[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.780]
No, I know seriously when you think about that, isn't that appropriate?

[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.360]
They shouldn't have a seat for him there.

[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.020]
Huh?

[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:10.820]
No, but seriously.

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.060]
I'm not joking with that in the press box.

[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.380]
If you would have ever asked him, and I'm not joking because I knew him for over 20 years

[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.580]
we went to the track together.

[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.300]
Oh, I know that.

[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.960]
If he had to choose a place to dial, I'm sure he would have not wanted to do it that way,

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.300]
but it would have been right there at the track.

[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.560]
I think he had the super or something like that.

[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.720]
He had the winning ticket in his pocket, and then, well, we all over on the table face first, and that was it.

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.680]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.360]
I would prefer a champagne room.

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.380]
Of course, I've had a lot of my horses croak in the stress, but that's another story.

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.180]
And anyway, have a great new year.

[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:44.700]

[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.300]
It's been fun this year, Neil.

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.620]
And we're still here.

[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.340]
How do you like that?

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.420]
I got to run another one.

[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.840]
But fat old Jews, they're still here at QAM.

[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.020]
The other guys who got there, cheer across the street, talking a lot of crap.

[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.120]
We're still a kickin' ass.

[00:17:59.520 --> 00:17:59.880]
All right.

[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.920]
See you Tuesday.

[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.620]
Best of you.

[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.300]
Bye.

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.580]
All right, sports fans.

[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.240]
Hey, boy, howdy, dude.

[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.300]
With this week's installment of...

[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.180]
Now, see here.

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.640]
I'll see here.

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.100]
Pants are essential to a man's attire.

[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.860]
Now, I got all kinds of things with my pants.

[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.380]
And my shins and a dingo berries and...

[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.720]
Who knows what I'll find in there next?

[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.740]
You know, many things have been said about my pants.

[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.440]
I may not be wearing any now, but I've only caused an euphoria of excitement.

[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.100]
I sold them.

[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.680]
Who did more for pants?

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.840]
Fred Moetz, James Coco.

[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.700]
Kamaan, and another thing.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.620]
Who did more for hygiene?

[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.160]
Some are his eve?

[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.280]
Or Mr. Whipple.

[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.500]
And I think you know the answer to that one.

[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.140]
And while I'm on the subject of sports.

[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.320]
Who did more for the Dalton's offense?

[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.440]
Flow-mo rose into all of it.

[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.660]
Well, Mr. Kitzel.

[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.140]
Let me...

[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.860]
No, stop fucking your pink pipe for a smoke.

[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.160]
Who did more for Gleib-Mist-Bethroom's spray?

[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.720]
Who, hey, back at the door and run, register?

[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.620]
Or a brand new thing?

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.420]
Ah!

[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.020]
Kamaan.

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.060]
You know where you can insult the underfixier.

[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.440]
If Joyce will only die.

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.720]
Wait.

[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.100]
Wait, there's your gold.

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.600]
You can't go nowhere.

[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.760]
I'm not the...

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.360]
F***ing...

[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.160]
Oh, that's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:32.920]
That's good.

[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.200]
So I guess parents' expectations to play a lot of bits today.

[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.080]
So I guess we'll do that.

[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.520]
So keep your finger on that yellow button.

[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.540]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.720]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.300]

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.300]

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.120]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.200]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:10.420]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:10.820]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.020]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.500]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.660]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.620]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.100]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.920]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.380]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.160]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.300]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.300]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.480]
He's in this nation.

[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.880]
And receive a free box of Qtips.

[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.880]
Maybe they got Waxie buildup.

[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.960]
1032 at 560.

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.640]
Oh, look at that.

[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.100]
We got some dead people over there in the Middle East again.

[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:39.800]
What a surprise.

[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.200]
What a surprise.

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.480]
What a surprise.

[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.180]
Just in time for the holidays.

[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.000]
Most companies interviewed about the government back 9-11 loans they received

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.640]
have told investigators they weren't hurt by the suicide attacks.

[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.800]
I didn't know they were getting terrorism assistance.

[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.680]
Billions in loans went to businesses that weren't hurt by the attacks.

[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.020]
As the government once again,

[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.140]
piece away your money like it's water coming out of a faucet.

[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.120]
These small business administrations and specter general also reported yesterday

[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.860]
that lenders who build out billions of dollars in such loans failed 85% of the time

[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.960]
to document that recipients were actually hurt by the terror attacks

[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.600]
and therefore eligible for the federal aid.

[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.760]
Oh, here you want some money?

[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.440]
Here you go.

[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.700]
The IG, the agency's internal watchdog,

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.740]
concluded only nine loan recipients in the 59 cases sample

[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.620]
appear to be qualified for the special disaster loans.

[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.680]
The reports at SBA official told lenders they wouldn't be questioned

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.660]
how they gave out money.

[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.720]
We believe these communication were intended to and did send a message.

[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.520]
Like said in a message to Joey Zaza,

[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.000]
send a message to lenders that the agency wouldn't question lender

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.260]
or eligibility of termination inspected general said.

[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.300]
The investigative reports substantiates key findings of an AP story in September

[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.520]
that found similar problems with SBA supplementary terrorist activity

[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.700]
relief program, STAR.

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.880]
STAR.

[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.420]
The AP found that terrorism recovery loans went to businesses including

[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.840]
a South Dakota radio station.

[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.980]
Oh yeah.

[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.820]
A Virgin Islands perfume shop, a Utah dog boutique,

[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.700]
and more than 100 Dunkin' Donuts and Subway Sandwich shops in various locations.

[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.780]
How do you like that?

[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.360]
Well, you're probably happy about the Dunkin' Donuts.

[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.120]
Yeah.

[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.880]
Meanwhile, small businesses near ground zero in the year couldn't get assistance

[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.000]
that they desperately saw.

[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.620]
SBA administrator Hector Burrito put the best face on the finding,

[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.820]
saying the audit didn't find that the loan recipients were unqualified for the program

[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.760]
although we didn't note that lending documentation could have been better.

[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.200]
His statement, high effort, was calculated by Senator Olympia Snow of Maine,

[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.320]
chairwoman of the Senate Committee that oversees the SBA.

[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.300]
These initial findings are troubling and the committee will continue

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.600]
with its own investigation of STAR program to get it to truth and inform Congress,

[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.780]
for the future, etc.

[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.040]
The IGE report found that only two of 42 borrowers interviewed were where they had obtained a STAR loan.

[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.060]
In cases where eligibility couldn't be established, 25 out of 34 borrowers interviewed,

[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.100]
said they weren't adversely affected by the terror attacks.

[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.880]
And 36 out of 42 borrowers questioned, said they weren't asked or couldn't recall

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.540]
if they were asked about the impact of the attacks under Binis.

[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.540]
The reports that IGE investigators were told by lenders that their participation originally was low

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.020]
because of unclear requirements.

[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.140]
SBA officials then embarked on a vigorous marketing campaign

[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.260]
and lenders interpreted their remarks to mean that every small business could claim

[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.040]
it was somehow impacted by the attacks and therefore eligible to receive a STAR loan.

[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.100]
You're a money being flushed down the plate while the public is worried about

[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.260]
American Idol and CREMP like that and survivor Ruggiana and oldest garbage.

[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.060]
Wow.

[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.740]
Really?

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.080]
Yeah.

[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.860]
And we're going to do something about it on some stupid ass radio show.

[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.760]
I don't think so.

[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.400]
Is Eric in the chat room or not? Is he awake? Is he alive?

[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.420]
Yeah, he's in the chat room.

[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.040]
Because I don't see...

[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.160]
I told him to do, you know, to post it on the poll switch.

[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.820]
He said he was having connection problems.

[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.960]
Connection problems with what?

[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.640]
With life?

[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.220]
Computer.

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.260]
He's having connection problems with a computer?

[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.540]
Oh, no. He's already got it up there.

[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.480]
So you just as I said that every time I try...

[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.840]
Every time you try to make him look bad, he shows you up.

[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:53.260]
Well, what is...

[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.840]
What? It's not me.

[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.940]
I love Eric.

[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.060]
Eric does a phenomenal job.

[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.600]
Even though he can be very irritating and annoying, but he's great.

[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.440]
And you...

[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.620]
I think it's the computer thing.

[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.000]
I think there's this rivalry between computer nerds.

[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.820]
That's what it is.

[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.980]
That must be it.

[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.580]
5, 6, 7. Come on.

[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.680]
Let's take a whole bunch of calls.

[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.740]
It's the last show of the year for me, man.

[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.480]
We got George tomorrow and Monday.

[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.240]
Well, we got out with...

[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.720]
You know, who was saying that was it you?

[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.620]
I think you said it the other day and you're right.

[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.240]
It's been...

[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.140]
It's been more months than we can count since you actually went a whole week on this station.

[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.480]
We're like the pristine regular lineup on here every day.

[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.000]
It's just...

[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.440]
What's going on here?

[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:28.840]
Yeah.

[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.080]
I said...

[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.740]
I said actually I don't think you can go an entire five days with...

[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:34.880]
Yeah.

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.940]
I mean, this week not even close.

[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.840]
This week we don't even have one day because Mad Dog's off till the rest of the year until the new year.

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.500]
This is like a...

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.160]
Your patchwork radio station, okay?

[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.940]
Tune in and see who's going to be on today.

[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.120]
But then again, when you've got everybody leaving and all sorts of people being demoted and shoved to the door

[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.780]
and don't let the door hit you in the ass and away,

[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.880]
and just a general nightmare going on around you, then what would you expect?

[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.960]
They out of case to rather than anybody shows up.

[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.380]
Just like you heard me asking parents about the Bokeh Brian bits and oh, well, what?

[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.360]
He's clueless.

[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.860]
I guess that we can listen to those now.

[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:10.560]
Huh?

[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.340]
We'll just play him.

[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.580]
I am playing him.

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.620]
We already heard two of them.

[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.340]
I am just playing him.

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.300]
But that's another part of his...

[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:22.540]
You see, instead of just making up stupid schedules and worried about ball games and doing UM basketball on that crap,

[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.120]
now he's going to have to actually do the little programming.

[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.500]
A little bit.

[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.620]
Whatever he's capable of, which isn't much.

[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:30.580]
56670560.

[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.680]
It's not personal parents.

[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.360]
We like you a lot.

[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.680]
And the Jaguar really looks good on you, but boy, you are way out of your league, sweetheart.

[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]
56670560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560560

[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.380]
the

[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.720]
market

[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.660]
market

[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560]

[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.140]

[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.140]

[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.340]
LOVE

[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.960]
market

[00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:58.940]

[00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.580]
That was my habit.

[00:35:59.820 --> 00:35:59.960]
That was good.

[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.900]
They're like to our troops.

[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.660]
I'm going to tell you about the new poll for tomorrow on the weekend.

[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.580]
Well, I mean, Georgia will probably put one up for the weekend.

[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:06.600]
Okay.

[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.520]
When you think, I would think, like, Georgia put up a poll, it goes, which of these dot, dot,

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.880]
dot, and then that's it, you know.

[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.880]
But he likes doing that stuff.

[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.120]
It's easier than doing a real poll.

[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.100]
Don't be knocking George now behind his back.

[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.780]
I'll squeal.

[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.540]
Okay, you want to find a result on this?

[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.020]
I do.

[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.000]
No, you know, what event of 2005 was the most significant to you?

[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.520]
Hurricane Wilma 460.

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.080]
Gas going over three bucks a gallon, 243.

[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.820]
Republican scandals and indictments, and there are so many, 210.

[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.920]
Hurricane Katrina 181.

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.940]
I had no sex life, 141.

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.660]
I got laid a lot, only 46.

[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.220]
That's why there's so many unhappy people in Florida.

[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.680]
Terry and her.

[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.140]
Shoo!

[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.580]
25.

[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.680]
Slots get OK'd and Broward 19.

[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.740]
That's not too big of a deal to these people, I guess.

[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.760]
Pope John Paul II thighs with a nice little slippers on 18.

[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.040]
John Roberts, a punitive Supreme Court in between doing CBS even he news 13.

[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.640]
And a recollections, Solomon T. Sinko, Chinkway 5 out of 13, 163.

[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.100]
Now, he magically, thanks Eric.

[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.420]
Now you can just go back to bed or do make some money.

[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.340]
Do something useful Eric.

[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.040]
See, he's probably happy that we got that out of the way.

[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.300]
Now we just need to, we got no, because you're going to have to add one on there right away.

[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.060]
Okay.

[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.300]
What's your number one wish for 2006?

[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.520]
The one we need to add is QAM gets sold and you'll get paid off.

[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.760]
So I can vote.

[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.780]
Okay.

[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.260]
That's my number one wish for 2006.

[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.200]
That the beesleys finally decide, well, we don't know anything about radio and especially, yeah, we were clueless.

[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.540]
So they're going to sell to a bunch of, to a bunch of farbicina Christians, man, and the last person they'd won on the European me.

[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.840]
So they'll just pay me off of human for the last three years and bye-bye. See ya!

[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.220]
But not too nice.

[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.620]
And of course, you would, George, you could like make a lot of money out there in the street corner.

[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.140]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:54.760]
Yeah.

[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.160]
This is 5.62.

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.960]
I do believe that stuff is.

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.460]
Why do I drink so much?

[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:09.860]
Why?

[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.600]
Well, I drink so much, huh?

[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.820]
Every new year's in your care resistance.

[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.840]
When the ball comes down, I'll be on the ground, hug him a toilet.

[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.480]
I can't believe my liver's not the Z's and I can't spell AA.

[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.860]
Don't like sobriety.

[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.460]
End up a year means a vendor.

[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.440]
Find out bartender.

[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.380]
Freeze in a vendor.

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.660]
Who knew your son, end up?

[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.320]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:29.680]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.120]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.600]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.680]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:35.900]
I'll blow chunks.

[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:36.720]

[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.520]
I'm pretty sure that I'll be puked.

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.380]
In other words, New Year's coming.

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.980]
Look at that please trying to say, 1044 a Cuey and Happy New Year.

[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.260]
Or not as a case may be.

[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.160]
Some people are like, I'll be happy when the whole thing is over.

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.500]
You know, I just like to say, I'll be happy when the whole thing is over.

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:08.500]

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:08.500]

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:08.500]

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.060]
I'm so tired of this time of the year.

[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.980]
I don't want to sound like the Grinch or Scrooge or like that.

[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.520]
I just, it's just a pain in the ass.

[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.500]
29 votes on the new pool.

[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.580]
That's not too exciting.

[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.340]
What's your number one wish for 2006?

[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.440]
Here's what we have so far.

[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.580]
We can add lots more to it depending on what you wish for.

[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.640]
In Peach George W. Bush 10.

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.720]
What a surprise that's leading, isn't it?

[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:28.860]
Yeah.

[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.280]
Win the lotto, seven.

[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.720]
To have lots of sex, five.

[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.540]
QM gets old and he'll get paid off, two.

[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.460]
Oh yeah.

[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.980]
Thank you so much whoever else voted for that.

[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.460]
Good health too.

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.160]
Of course, whoever else voted for that probably wants me off the air.

[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.660]
But that's okay.

[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.400]
Thank you anyway.

[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.460]
A Democrat sweep elections too.

[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.640]
Peace out earth one.

[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.480]
Get a divorce.

[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.480]
Get a better job.

[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.880]
All our troops come home.

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.260]
None.

[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.420]
None for all our troops come home.

[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.160]
Wow.

[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.480]
That is pathetic.

[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.800]
You know, that's tragic.

[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.260]
Zero for all our troops come home.

[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.580]
Well, we don't know who any of Mars,

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.680]
so let him die.

[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.460]
They enlisted anyway.

[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.960]
Like that bitch they called a couple days ago.

[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.200]
She was really special.

[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:09.400]
Yeah.

[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:09.980]
Oh, wasn't she?

[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.100]
I got a special place in hell for that slut.

[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.100]
That old bitch.

[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.680]
Well, you know, Cindy Shan, she's making a baby of her son and a less dead.

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:18.940]
Yeah.

[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.460]
Therefore, he deserved to be sent over there to be a human fodder for your fodder.

[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.580]
To be a human sacrifice.

[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.480]
Speaking of that, speaking of dead people to those who are very close,

[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.880]
Dick Clark, who suffered a stroke last December,

[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.040]
he's suffered two actually, but they're trying to keep the second one a secret, a massive one.

[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:43.260]
Last December, won't be in a wheelchair when he appears on ABC's New Year's rock and heaves his co-host Ryan Seacrest.

[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.960]
It'll be 76-year-old Clark's first TV appearances as Stroke, which forced him to bow out of last year's show.

[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.180]
I'm not a doctor and I'm not his wife, so I don't see him on a daily basis, but he will not be in a wheelchair on the telecast.

[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.400]
Seacrest told AP Ray DeWen a recent interview.

[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.860]
Seacrest will make his debut as a co-host of New Year's Eve Special said Clark has gotten better and better each day.

[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.380]
I don't think he's 100%.

[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.440]
Maybe he's...

[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.300]
But third, man!

[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.380]
But I think he's better than he was last week and better than he was six months ago.

[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.940]
As for Clark's voice, Seacrest said, it's not exactly as it probably sounded when he was as healthy as to be for the stroke,

[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.520]
but it definitely sounds like Dick.

[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.300]
And I think that he's been working on his speech and making sure that his as good as it can be on that night.

[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.980]
I know that he's one of the most driven and focused individuals on the planet, the 31-year-old Seacrest said,

[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.180]
and so when he puts his mind to something, he's going to be doing it.

[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:38.020]
Seacrest and Clark will appear from New York, where the ball will drop and the co-host Hillary Duff will anchor and perform a The Hollywood disegment of the show.

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.920]
Aren't you excited about that?

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.720]
Hillary Duff is going to be out there in LA watching the ball's drop.

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.140]
And it probably won't be the first time.

[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.460]
That is really something.

[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.220]
What's your number one wish for 2006?

[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.060]
Got a whole bunch of things we can probably put on there.

[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.240]
Maybe we'll actually get a couple.

[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.120]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.400]
Hello.

[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.260]
Hi.

[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.360]
How are you doing?

[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.100]
Pretty good.

[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.180]
Excellent. I've got two things for the ball.

[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.560]
One is obviously a long and healthy life for you.

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.140]
And number two, you get Rick and Suds back on the air. How about that?

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:11.940]
Okay.

[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:12.900]
All right.

[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.040]
Thank you so much.

[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.740]
Don't hold your breath.

[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.000]
I'll put it on there. Thank you.

[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.900]
Okay, thank you.

[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.440]
Rick and Suds back on the air.

[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.480]
You got it?

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.280]
Got it.

[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.800]
Or is that Suds and Rick?

[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.000]
Do we want to put Suds and Rick?

[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.640]
Put whatever you want on there.

[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:25.860]
Okay.

[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.800]
You know, December 29th, last show of the year.

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.720]
Put whatever you want.

[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.780]
We like Suds a lot on the show. Rick, you know.

[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.740]
5, 6, 7, by the way, how's that?

[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.220]
How are the stock futures doing? Rick, how's the fair value today?

[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.440]
0.560, the liberalized and singular wireless line.

[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.300]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.160]
QYM.

[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]
Yeah, I'd like to talk to you now.

[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.260]
Speaking.

[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.880]
Yeah, like the last call that you said, I wish you a long and healthy life.

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.380]
And my wish for the 2006 is for Pink Floyd to reunite and make a world tour.

[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.180]
Okay.

[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.280]
Have a good one.

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.060]
Now you too.

[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.900]
For Pink Floyd to reunite, there's a guy that's really got his priorities in the right pecking order,

[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.360]
when you think?

[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.520]
Sounds like it's going to be a nice and goes on a world tour.

[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.840]
How are if you want to phrase it?

[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.160]
I'll leave it in your delicate hands.

[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.580]
Don't forget Curtis for the moment to this afternoon.

[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.900]
There's a nice change of pace for you.

[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.340]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.660]
Okay, Nick, how are you?

[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:28.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.200]
How about for a six, first of all, healthy and happy New Year's union?

[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.120]
Same to you.

[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.360]
And let's try how about in teaching a bush in 06?

[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.620]
It's leading the pull. That's number one with a bullet.

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.840]
All right, let's go for that, all right?

[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.700]
Okay, thank you.

[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.640]
I just, on second thought, I just dumped myself.

[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.880]
I probably wasn't a good response.

[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.680]
Like I said, it's number one in the pull already.

[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.640]
You have to be real, very nervous about things like that.

[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.260]
Is that right?

[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.200]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.840]
Unless you want some visitors at your door there,

[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.420]
which I don't think you're really interested in.

[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.580]
20 for MP's George W. Bush.

[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.560]
Win the lotto of 15.

[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.880]
A lotto was some schmuck here, almost 16 million cash last night.

[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.440]
It wasn't me.

[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.580]
It wasn't me.

[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.100]
I'm going to be here right now.

[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.660]
It's only that I won 10 bucks, it's all.

[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.780]
Going for 16 million, I got like 10 bucks.

[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.200]
Not too good.

[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.160]
But one of these days, when you least expect it,

[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.360]
see that's when it is, when you're expecting to win something big,

[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:23.940]
it doesn't happen.

[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.700]
Like that old bag that won a 3.2 million casino Niagara two days ago.

[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.220]
For tickets.

[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.020]
Well, what do you mean it's ridiculous?

[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.360]
You won 3.2 million.

[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.360]
On one pull.

[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.640]
On a slot machine.

[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.480]
On a slot machine.

[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.940]
It's a progressive jackpot, baby.

[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.780]
It's the mega bucks.

[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.120]
Why do you think they call it mega bucks?

[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.100]
The big bucks, baby.

[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.420]
3.2 million.

[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.360]
And that's cash.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:44.940]
No tax.

[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:45.800]
No annuity.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.420]
No BS.

[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.560]
When you win something here, they just hand you a check.

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.060]
And that's it.

[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:49.600]
The full amount.

[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.180]
Tax-free.

[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.200]
As opposed to the Florida lottery, which is the most stupid,

[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.340]
I'd like to show you what a hypocrite your fat ass government

[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.240]
will legislate your art.

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.220]
They're running the biggest scam in the history of the human race,

[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:01.740]
the lotto.

[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.400]
Well, if you win, you can either take it in one lump sum,

[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.040]
which is much less than the announced prize,

[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.300]
or in annuity, 20 years, you know.

[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.520]
Well, I guess depending on the amount down here,

[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.720]
not everything is taxed, because when my buddy won that 10 grand,

[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.960]
they just wrote him a check for 10 grand, and they gave him a room.

[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.060]
I hate to break the news to you, but he's got to declare that.

[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.060]
Any gambling winnings on your income tax, I mean, you know,

[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.440]
you just don't give your buddies name on here, but I won't.

[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.800]
You have to declare that.

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.260]
Well, you know, I'm very happy.

[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.800]
He's supposed to pay tax on that.

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.000]
But here, when you win something like that, whatever it is,

[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.360]
they just write your check, and there's no tax on it.

[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.060]
And that's the way it should be.

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.800]
Why don't you...

[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.840]
I mean, life is so short, and you're very rarely ever win anything

[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.640]
of any significance, and you win something big,

[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.640]
and you've got to like, pay taxes on it, so they can flush it down to toilet,

[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.240]
and pay all kinds of 9-11 relief to businesses that were affected by it,

[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.320]
like in South Dakota radio stations, and subway,

[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.980]
and what was the other piece of induncan doughnuts?

[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.740]
Come on, man.

[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.140]
There's a lot of coffee there.

[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.980]
Taking all of our money, just squeezing the blood out of us,

[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.220]
so we're like, a human sponge, to just squeeze the damn life blood out of us,

[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.640]
so they could pee away our money right down the old toilet.

[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.240]
And I'm talking about, it's not a political thing.

[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.060]
It's both parties. They're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.360]
They're all having a big party, at your expense.

[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.480]
Although there's people in New Orleans now, if you just wait,

[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.640]
just hang on. Help is a coming.

[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.120]
Any of the wealth is coming?

[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.740]
Remember that song?

[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.020]
Hmm, Boats is a coming.

[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.400]
Let's have word that goes before Boats.

[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.020]
See?

[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.840]
Boats is a coming. That's it.

[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.080]
See, I finally gave you a chance, because the Raymond doesn't advertise in the shrimp

[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.740]
and the animal co-spot for a while now, so.

[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.760]
You've got to keep that word, keep it polished up.

[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.280]
Yeah.

[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.660]
Pala shop your CM.

[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:39.740]
5670560.

[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.620]
Town 560 Verizon, Singular Riders, Signs,

[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.440]
you're number one wish for 2006. WQAN, hello.

[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.420]
Hey Neal, how you doing? Happy New Year.

[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.760]
I'll only get to you about that money getting stuff down the Dunkin' Donuts.

[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.380]
Dunkin' Donuts is owned by the terrorists.

[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.940]
Don't you get it? Wish me to the terrorists.

[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.400]
So they make more bombs like a bomb is again.

[00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.060]
Okay, great.

[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.760]
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Signs, you know.

[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:06.740]
What?

[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.600]
Now I didn't know, and neither was anybody else because I hit the button.

[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.900]
Oh, I'm just not putting that kind of crap on you know.

[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.900]
We just know, not just the last day of the year,

[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.500]
do we need any grief, any fallout from that?

[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.180]
Because you know what we, oh, did you hear what they said about the,

[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.180]
oh, whoever, you know.

[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.300]
Anybody who's doing business anywhere.

[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.760]
We love everybody who's in business.

[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.340]
Retail, wholesale, whatever.

[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.880]
Does anybody QAM, hello?

[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.060]
QAM?

[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:32.640]
Yes.

[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.360]
Is this me?

[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.380]
This is me.

[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.840]
Is this me?

[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.560]
Happy New Year.

[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.460]
Same to you.

[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.900]
I can't believe no one has ever brought the troops home,

[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.860]
but both are winning the lottery.

[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:47.560]
Yeah.

[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.460]
I vote for bring the troops home.

[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:51.720]
Okay.

[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.040]
And, you know, I guess it's a lot of selfish people out there.

[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.740]
No kidding, man.

[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.600]
You just discovered that?

[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:00.460]
Yes.

[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.720]
I guess so.

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.600]
And guess what?

[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.220]
President Likens got a bad headache too.

[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.900]
Listen, happy New Year, Pallied, all the best.

[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.160]
How about getting a raise for 2006?

[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.260]
Getting a raise is good.

[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:10.940]
Put that on there.

[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.800]
Getting a nice raise.

[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.000]
Would be excellent.

[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:13.520]
It's my vote.

[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:14.740]
Okay.

[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.400]
Getting a raise.

[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.440]
There's the Josh's vote.

[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.020]
I got another one.

[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.740]
Getting a, how do we phrase it?

[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.040]
Getting a great general manager at QAM.

[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.400]
Okay.

[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.040]
What do you laugh at about?

[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:27.640]
No.

[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.200]
Do you like that?

[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.280]
We would like that.

[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.520]
Getting somebody who would set aside their big fat ego

[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.140]
in their pomposity and sports nudiness and just, you know,

[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.040]
you just want getting a good general manager?

[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.080]
Getting a good GM at QAM.

[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.860]
Kind of has a little ring to it.

[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.400]
Good GM at QAM.

[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:43.840]
A.

[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.820]
98 votes.

[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.360]
What's your number one wish for the year?

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.320]
Impete George W. W. Bush has got.

[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.120]
Look at how many votes.

[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.180]
Stop turning, man.

[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.480]
I think it's a Dunkin' Donuts thing.

[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.040]
When the lotto 19, all our troops come home.

[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.880]
I embarrass people devoting for that even though they don't

[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.260]
really give a crap about our troops, which is very, very sad.

[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:00.960]
14.

[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.420]
To have lots of sex, 12.

[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.700]
Good health, 9.

[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.640]
Democrats with the election 7.

[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.820]
Get a better job, 3.

[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.060]
QAM gets sold and Neil gets paid off.

[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:10.600]
2.

[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.280]
Correct the vote.

[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.520]
You did the worst one.

[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.420]
Peace out earth one.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.080]
Pink Floyd, we even didn't have any and put suds and brick back

[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:18.960]
on the years got none.

[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.780]
Out of the first, I bet you we got 100 votes.

[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.460]
We take a puke at it.

[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.080]
Now that it re-105.

[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.980]
See, we didn't do this pool before we wanted to why?

[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:30.460]
Why?

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.000]
Because it was never going to be 2006 before.

[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.500]
What was that, why?

[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.800]
Well, I mean, it's probably a pretty good reason.

[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.560]
5670560, pound 562, the Verizon Singular wireless lines.

[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.520]
Any big games coming up?

[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.780]
We got the Montreal Canadian's, the frogs in town.

[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.060]
What is this?

[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.580]
How about that Chick-fil-A peach bowl?

[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.980]
You know, I don't want to pick on coach co-head, but that's just that is so embarrassing to me.

[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.300]
Why does he have to say that?

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.600]
Talk about being the ultimate chill.

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.220]
I mean, couldn't you just say the peach bowl?

[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.380]
We know that all these bowl games now have these sponsors and everybody.

[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.180]
All about like that.

[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:05.460]
Yeah.

[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.840]
Throw in the plug.

[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]
But cheesy, you know, you just being, you just threw like a little promo here to where.

[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.040]
The Chick-fil-A peach bowl, get out.

[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.880]
It sounds so tacky, doesn't it?

[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:14.720]
So cheesy.

[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.820]
Chick-fil-A, my ass.

[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.380]
Anyway, we got the Montreal Canadians tomorrow night at the, oh, and look at that.

[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.960]
Now that, oh, and that's right, you're right.

[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.280]
Tomorrow's the night for the Chick-fil-A peach bowl.

[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:26.660]
Yes, tomorrow.

[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.160]
The Hurricanes and the LSU Tigers and the Chick-fil-A peach bowl.

[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.320]
Wow.

[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.540]
So that's on QAM and the Panther game is on 1360 on KD.

[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.280]
Oh, that is scandalous.

[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.120]
That is outrageous.

[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.720]
The way the Panthers are playing right now.

[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.040]
Playing really hot.

[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.260]
We're trying to generate some interest now.

[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.980]
And Cone is thinking about finding a radio station and sucking up heavy duty at the track with Hank.

[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.420]
That is really bad.

[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.520]
Hey, we love you, Alan.

[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.560]
You make it all the right moves.

[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.580]
The Panthers are great.

[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.900]
We love everything they're doing.

[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.660]
They had 25,000 people at the game last night.

[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.060]
For Asians is Neil Rogers.

[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.240]
This is 560 QAM.

[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.460]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240]
This is your brain.

[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.220]
Any questions?

[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.760]
Would you like to become a sports color commentator on prime time television?

[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.280]
Why not enroll in the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting?

[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.360]
Okay, please.

[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.720]
Let's start at square one.

[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.380]
It's not a fall, it's a pink skin.

[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:24.820]
Okay?

[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.140]
It's not a playground.

[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.220]
It's a gridiron.

[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:33.100]
I never ever called them a crowd when you can refer to them as a teaming multi-dinner of kinetic enthusiasm.

[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.820]
Okay?

[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:41.880]
At the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting, learn how to fill time between plays with spontaneous down-to-earth batter to which the working neck can easily relate.

[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.840]
Okay, class.

[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.100]
Repeat after me.

[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.660]
Here we go.

[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.280]
I haven't seen blacking like that since the cavalry sequence in breath of a nation.

[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.520]
I haven't seen blacking like that since...

[00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:00.020]
At the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting, Dennis Miller himself will teach you how to construct the entire sentences using nothing but made upwards.

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.140]
Oh man, Al.

[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:05.440]
What an ostentatious malaprism of unpillinated, nine-and-sake.

[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:14.780]
So if you were a fan of such legendary sportscasters at John Matten, Terry Bradshaw and John Meredith, then you should attend the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting and become nothing like them.

[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.940]
I folks on Dennis Miller reminding you that classes would start this week.

[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:25.180]
Well, I view on the air making references to the House of Plans, passionate and just six weeks.

[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.960]
The Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting.

[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.980]
It will today be for Dennis' unceremoniously fired at the end of the season.

[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.180]
Oh yeah, well, guess what.

[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.440]
Actually, last the whole season, I don't remember.

[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.560]
Yeah, I remember one.

[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.640]
That's how memorable it was. That was a real great experiment.

[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.040]
That's another reason that ABC Monday Night Football has gone.

[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.200]
Between them and the ESPN with Rush and with Dennis Miller, some really brilliant moves there.

[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.800]
And I scroll at ABC and by the way, we'll say a prayer for you at the end of the newscaster every night.

[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.060]
Maybe we'll just engage in some of that good Christian wrestling, sounds good.

[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:54.480]
Yeah, let me know.

[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.500]
I wish you would have seen that segment.

[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.760]
You would have just shaken your head and wondered...

[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.200]
What is this? What are you really made that up on?

[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.620]
Now, what is wrestling, we have to do with the religion.

[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.260]
Although, of course, a lot of lifeless people...

[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:09.900]
I have no right.

[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.840]
It is a religion.

[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:16.280]
You know, the WWE and the WWE F and the WWE, WWE, and all these other WWE's.

[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.940]
Of course, there's only one WWE that this audience is obsessed with and that is we want him out right now.

[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.760]
Bye-bye, WWE.

[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.600]
I see impeach his ass now before the New Year. It would be good.

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.300]
That's leading so far in Peach George's W. Bush 36.

[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.800]
You know, Baba had a little hummler situation going on there and like that,

[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.540]
all he lied about is sex life and a right.

[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.160]
His nose was rolling like Pinocchio.

[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:44.340]
And the main time, here's a guy that's sacrificing over 2,000 American lives and thousands and thousands of Iraqis.

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:49.000]
They estimate it's like maybe up to 50 or 60,000 dead civilians over there, men and women and little kids.

[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.520]
Not to mention all the people who are missing body parts, minor things like that.

[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.160]
Based on a pack of lies, based on a whole neocon plot and plan.

[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.540]
That was a good article by Marine Duggesta that I read about Dick Cheney.

[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.680]
I mean, she put her thumb right on it as usual.

[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.400]
Cheney and Rumsfeld, it goes back to Ford and Bush 1 and this is just, this is part of the whole

[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.380]
and Wolfowitz and Bill Crystal and all these other Nazis, man.

[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.400]
These people, what you had is a bloodless coup in America,

[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:21.780]
a bunch of right-wing elunatics, and taken over control of the government with two fixed elections in a row.

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:27.640]
And it's like the media is oblivious to it and the public is worried about the, is Dick Clark really going to be on New Year's Eve?

[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.500]
You know, we'll put in hell as Ryan Seacrest.

[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.680]
So it's just amazing the kind of crap that they keep people obsessed with, you know?

[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.180]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.460]
You're not eating now, are you? That would be bad.

[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.200]
Yeah. How can you be eating food today on this week?

[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.640]
I'm actually going nuts today.

[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:51.120]
You know, I really haven't ordered anything this whole week and so I went to town today with, I got my how-is on.

[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.060]
Yeah. But I just ordered all of this food from bread.

[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.000]
No, that's going, yeah.

[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.460]
Just the good people at how-is, hooked it up.

[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.560]
Or just from how-is. Thanks to how-is for putting up with us, okay, and feeding everybody.

[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.020]
And quick feeding the Hank, okay, we'd like to have him alive for the New Year. God.

[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.020]
Dominic, QYM, hello.

[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.320]
Hey, I'm Camille, how you doing?

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.220]
Pretty good. Happy New Year.

[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.100]
And back to you.

[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:20.140]
My wish for the New Year is that the Neil Rogers show gets indicated nationwide.

[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.580]
Yeah.

[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:23.980]
Or is that-

[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.880]
You must have started drinking early for New Year's, I'll tell you.

[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.560]
Oh, God. No, no, nothing like that.

[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.660]
Just, you know, it sounds like a good idea.

[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.840]
Yeah. Oh, I think it's a great idea, but then again, when you got an agent like I got, you know, who's a silly-

[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.240]
You're fair.

[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.900]
Yeah, maybe it's time to see Kyra ground.

[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.260]
No, I'm just- I'm just phasing out, you know, I'm just counting down the days.

[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.320]
Well, I love you, you know, Kat, your days, then, you know, to everybody on the planet here,

[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.340]
because everybody needs to hear the truth.

[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.440]
Yeah, well, they can't handle the truth.

[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.580]
Have a great New Year's, we don't-

[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.140]
Oh, can I make a shame with the question, I'm going at it.

[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.500]
You can deliver like-

[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.080]
Motel 666.

[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.060]
Now, is that got anything like-

[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.100]
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.340]
Totally clean.

[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.460]
That's as clean as it gets.

[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.320]
Okay, I have a happy-

[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:08.260]
You too.

[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.000]
Bye-bye.

[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.300]
Hi, I'm Tom B. L's Bubb from Motel 666.

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.320]
Here to tell you about our Halloween special.

[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:24.220]
If you're a Satan worshipper on a budget, why not stay at Motel 666 over Halloween night and take advantage of our special rates package?

[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:32.100]
It includes a cold and uncomfortable room, plenty of floor space for Richell Danson, plus a TV set that gets the Registin-Cathy Lee show.

[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.280]
There's even a hellhole behind the bed.

[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:41.000]
And to top it off, the manager will come by with complimentary drinks, just specify type A, type O, B, or AB.

[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.040]
So bring the entire family to Motel 666 on Halloween and we'll leave a burn and go down for you.

[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:47.440]
All right.

[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.680]
Neil gets indicated.

[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.600]
Get that on there too.

[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.840]
Okay, not going to get any votes, but put that on there anyway.

[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.520]
Make her happy.

[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:52.880]
Sure.

[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:58.560]
And she asks you, and I mean, how many other people in the audience would know that bit by name when you come right down to it?

[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.760]
It's a little on the obscure side.

[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:01.320]
She's a real student of this show.

[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.560]
Maybe she stayed there before.

[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.660]
Could be.

[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.140]
Maybe she was hanging out with Tom Bode.

[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.540]
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.700]
Oh, there's your line nine.

[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.600]
It's Josh's line.

[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.380]
Hello, QAM.

[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.180]
Yeah, there he is.

[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.400]
How many QAM, hello?

[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.400]
Yeah, but afternoon, Anthony.

[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.180]
Good afternoon.

[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:19.780]
Good evening.

[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:27.820]
But today is for, I'm just wondering, for next year, my wish was that one of the local teams go undefeated, maybe the dolphins.

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:28.860]
Yeah.

[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:37.080]
And I was trying to get you the other day for the other poll because David Spade, I think, could give Paris spirits an a run.

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.240]
David Spade.

[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:39.880]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:40.580]
Okay.

[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.220]
What's in your wallet?

[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.520]
I don't think David Spade is on what's in your wallet?

[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.800]
He's on his spot.

[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:47.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:47.800]
What was?

[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.240]
Yeah.

[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.240]
Why didn't we know that it was David Spade?

[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.400]
Which one is David Spade?

[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.400]
The one who's not funny.

[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:53.460]
Yeah.

[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:53.800]

[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.140]
That's right.

[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:56.980]
Yeah.

[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:57.700]
I can't say I'm not valid.

[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.920]
I should share this for great.

[00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.440]
Yes.

[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.420]
You remember the whole more bitter with Aronde.

[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.680]
No, we can't play that good.

[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.380]
We're good luck to pal.

[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.120]
You know, no chance.

[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:11.580]
Yeah.

[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.100]
No chance.

[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.780]
Joyce would have a, she'd have a nervous breakdown.

[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.340]
She'd have a stroke right on the spot.

[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.320]
In fact, maybe that's why we ought to play it.

[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.180]
So that's David Spade?

[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.240]
I never made the connection.

[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.180]
I love those spots.

[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.080]
It's kind of like his old Chris Farley movies.

[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.520]
Those spots are really funny, but it's not because of him.

[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.180]
Yeah.

[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.740]
Those are one of the best-to-end campaigns I've ever seen in my life.

[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.680]
In fact, I enjoy when the, I enjoy it.

[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.100]
I enjoy when the commercial break comes on during a show.

[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:38.880]
I totally agree.

[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.440]
What's in your wallet?

[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.480]
Yeah, there's a new one now where the guy is on like a sled.

[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.120]
Christmas sled and he goes flying with a reindeer through.

[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.600]
Or just a beautiful thing.

[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:48.920]
Yes.

[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.480]
5.670560.

[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.520]
Well, let's put David Spade on yesterday's pool.

[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:53.900]
What do you say?

[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.400]
Oh, too late.

[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:54.780]
Sorry.

[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.800]
Or we just put him on some future pool.

[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.940]
Whatever pool George does tomorrow, Tom put David Spade on it.

[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.240]
Okay.

[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.360]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:08.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.820]
I'm trying to reach Neil.

[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.240]
You're speaking to him.

[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.280]
No way.

[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.340]
No way?

[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:13.980]
Well, okay.

[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.480]
I made this with somebody else.

[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.080]
This is personal.

[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.540]
Ah, it's great.

[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.040]
It is great.

[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.240]
Look, and I just wanted to thank you for all the years of enjoying your show.

[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.660]
And I wanted to add something to the pool as possible.

[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.240]
You bet.

[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.620]
I'd like to see in the two plus and six very far-row and Pat Robertson caught David's team

[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.340]
in a, and smoking crab.

[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.020]
Yeah, a little transvestite prostitute in New Orleans.

[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:37.820]
All right.

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:38.340]
Okay.

[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:38.800]
Thanks, pal.

[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.640]
All right.

[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.360]
We'll work on it.

[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.620]
Maybe Jim Baker can hook him up.

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:42.640]
Okay.

[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.140]
I don't think there's a way for us to put that on there.

[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.900]
But, you know, we get the drift.

[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.360]
5.670.

[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:49.800]
And let's see.

[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.300]
How about the, for the other guy that called me for, how about a South Florida championship,

[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.180]
a South Florida sports championship?

[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:56.840]
Okay.

[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.280]
Does that work for us?

[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.460]
Boy, you're sure picking out, man.

[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.160]
What do you got there?

[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:00.560]
Oh, man.

[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.580]
I went nuts today.

[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.560]
I got a, why is that?

[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.000]
Because, I don't know.

[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.740]
I just felt like it.

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.520]
I had a nice wood by day yesterday.

[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]
It was an expensive diet.

[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.700]
I mean, I lost a few bucks.

[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.240]
I've not made, not a major disaster, but not too good.

[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.260]
I got to eat it up to keep me, keep me full till Bernie Kosegar stay calved tonight.

[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.100]
Because I'm going to tell you, oh, you get to go to that?

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.420]
Well, they asked me to today.

[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:18.960]
So I said, yeah.

[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.840]
And so you get to, you get a free meal over there.

[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.820]
Now, maybe what's his name?

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.040]
Maybe there, maybe a bread from the Orchard be there, hogging up some free food, too.

[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:25.840]
How can you guys?

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.480]
How can this and that and does?

[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.220]
What a, what a, what a, shh.

[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:30.600]
Mucky.

[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.400]
Goes in there and he starts throwing his weight around.

[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:38.480]
I want the steak and I want all the, uh, coupraments and I want this and that, uh, what,

[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.120]
he's anything new in the account.

[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.500]
I'm going to go in there and suck up a bunch of freebies because he thinks he's a big shot.

[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.900]
Because he's on our sales staff.

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.100]
Oh, my God.

[01:00:48.060 --> 01:01:00.200]
There, there are, there are more, um, by far, there are more prestigious people at

[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:00.840]
the same time.

[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.720]
I, I, you know, it's going to be really interesting.

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.100]
I know I keep belly aching about it.

[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.620]
It's not about business because I'm not there anyway, but it just, uh, grinds my fat, old,

[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.060]
grizzled ass that there's just nothing going on in there.

[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.340]
It's like, uh, the whole place is doing the limbo rock.

[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.720]
And we have gotten, we got no idea who the manager is, who the operations manager is.

[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.900]
If there is one, we got no idea who the sports liaison guy is.

[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.780]
If there's going to be one, we got the clearest.

[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.300]
He's got no idea which side is up.

[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.460]
But he does like his Jaguar.

[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.400]
Even though he says that screw and let the distinct, uh, aroma in it.

[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.640]
I don't know what he meant by that.

[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.920]
He said it's an aroma that could put you in a coma.

[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.340]
I'm not sure what he was talking about, but I think I got some idea.

[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.760]
I'm getting the drift.

[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.200]
But that, that, it's just, uh, there's nothing, people think we're, and Hank, you know, saying the same thing.

[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.240]
We're not just making this up.

[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.340]
Nobody's got any clue what the hell of a new year holds at QAIM.

[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.500]
Because there were like, uh, orphans now, like step chillin's.

[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.100]
Nothing worth it being a step chillin.

[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.640]
Nope.

[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.040]
Somebody QAIM, hello.

[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.040]
QAIM, hello.

[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.680]
Raise your paper, call it on the air.

[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.180]
Not you. QAIM, hello.

[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.620]
Happy New Year, Neil.

[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.380]
Back to you.

[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.740]
I have one for the fall.

[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:08.500]
Yeah.

[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.900]
Getting rid of Joyce and getting a real attorney for your station.

[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]
No, okay, that sounds good.

[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.280]
Joyce gets fired.

[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.400]
That sounds good to me.

[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.140]
Joyce gets canned at Beasley.

[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:18.340]
Got it?

[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.380]
Bye-bye, Joyce.

[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.420]
Don't let the adorage in the ass on the way out.

[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.080]
Oh, we better speak nice about Joyce because she's a corporate legal, you know?

[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.340]
You bitch, you slut, you whore.

[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.120]
Yeah, totally.

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.560]
I put her in the same category with clearance, although personally we like clearance, see?

[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.820]
So I put her in the same category professionally.

[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.740]
Way overhead, no experience, no background.

[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.500]
She's drowning in a sea of incompetence.

[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.900]
Can't play the fart sounds.

[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:41.780]
Can't say this.

[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.380]
Can't, and we reach the point where we finally stop asking our, um, middle level management types to ask her

[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.680]
because no matter what though we would ask her, how can we do it?

[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.160]
No, no, can we say that?

[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:51.380]
No.

[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.220]
No, whatever it is.

[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.280]
How about hello and goodbye?

[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.020]
What do you think?

[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:54.340]
No.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.620]
No, it's all offensive.

[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.020]
Everything is offensive to that bitch, okay?

[01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.860]
And, she probably hangs out with Donna Shalaley.

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.500]
She probably had her fine finger in that hole deal with at the billboard campaign.

[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.300]
We got balls.

[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.760]
Oh, well, the university of Miami doesn't want to be associated.

[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:11.060]
Yeah, the up at the university of Miami would all its long history of slime balls and criminal

[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.580]
holes, man.

[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.640]
Oh, give me a break.

[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.040]
What a joke.

[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.320]
You can drive all over this town and the fan has got all these billboards everywhere.

[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.140]
We got balls, the fan, whatever the hell their frequency is.

[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.760]
It's just, you know, every sports station in America has got that.

[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.560]
But not QAM, not what they, uh, we had, actually I'll give credit to Greg for that.

[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.440]
There was one thing we did.

[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.660]
We kept the billboards up.

[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:38.420]
We just took the hurricane logo off of it because Donna Shalaley was so offended.

[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.380]
Hey, Donna, you're pathetic on it.

[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.760]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.760]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.960]
It's a bitch.

[01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:01.780]
This is the ZBS ZP-News with Dan Ruther reporting from CBS News headquarters in New York.

[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.960]
Greening this is Dan Ruther reporting.

[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:10.560]
In fucking news today, this report has just confirmed that President George W. Bush is

[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.660]
a raging pirate.

[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.820]
A gun just looking river man's stormer.

[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.460]
No, really, we didn't make it this time.

[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.240]
According to recently or at least eight recordings made several years ago,

[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:27.220]
President Bush is clearly indicating that he and me have cried marijuana at some time in the past.

[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.780]
This startling revelation makes me explain his word speech,

[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.620]
questionable intelligence, and this appearance from National Guard duty during the Vietnam era.

[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.960]
No, I just can't let that one go, sorry.

[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.500]
Not wanting to say I told you so, this reporter will take the high road and say only.

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.240]
And that's part of our world.

[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.340]
The satisfying, vindictive, I hope you're having a huge stupid red state bastard spark.

[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.480]
I'm a land rather important for CBS News.

[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.160]
Get ready for the Zorias CD you've never heard.

[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.440]
Dan Ruther, sorry to us.

[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.960]
I'm sorry.

[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.340]
So sorry.

[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.560]
Not only does Dan sing a sorry to wet with Brenda Lee,

[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.660]
he sounds even sorry with Chicago.

[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.120]
It's time to be the stage.

[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:19.840]
I'm sorry.

[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:20.540]
What?

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.700]
Dan Ruther, sorry to us.

[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.880]
Features this, sorry sing along with Ruby study.

[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.540]
It's like a Mr. Shad, it's like a drop the ball.

[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.200]
I'm sorry.

[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.160]
Order now.

[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.340]
And if you're not completely satisfied,

[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:39.020]
Dan Ruther will personally say, I'm sorry.

[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.100]
I may be the only one, but I sure as much as Dan Ruther and CBS News,

[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.320]
I'm going to say that right now.

[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.200]
I realize they're rating sucked and all the other crap.

[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:52.360]
But I watched that for years, CBS, whether it was Walter Cronkite or Danny Boy or whatever.

[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:58.200]
And I got old funny daddy Bob Schiefer, which I watched once and wouldn't be called deadwatching the game.

[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.740]
And I'm stuck with Martian looking Brian Williams on NBC.

[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.300]
And then even got to shoved over there a couple of times,

[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.780]
they'd be seeing to get that religion, that religious sermon there,

[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.340]
that little sermon at the end of the show every night about the Christian videos and the Christian wrestling,

[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.620]
and the Christian news, and the Christian ball movements, and the Christian chakis,

[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.740]
and the Christian everything.

[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.160]
Oh man, like I said, go ahead and go on wild.

[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.860]
That's the motto for 2005.

[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.760]
It's a miracle the rest of us are still alive.

[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.980]
They hit us with five shots.

[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.440]
And we're still alive.

[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.080]
How do you like that?

[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.640]
I just love the way he says that in the movie.

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:34.320]
Yes.

[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.180]
We hit him with five shots and he's still alive.

[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:37.920]
He was good.

[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:38.520]
So let's go.

[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.360]
Good with the knife, but only in matters of business.

[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.380]
217 votes on the pool.

[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.860]
Why is this one of those things?

[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.940]
At least Josh has seen it, Godfather.

[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.160]
I bet your parts won't end too.

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.160]
I have, yeah.

[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.280]
Not three though.

[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.140]
No, not three.

[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.980]
I would see it.

[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.160]
So it's got to bad acting.

[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:55.920]
I would see it though.

[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.860]
Your life isn't complete until you see the third part.

[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.640]
I'll tell you right now, I'm going to see Magnolia.

[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.540]
Maybe sometime this weekend.

[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.300]
Really?

[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.300]
If I can get it from here.

[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.000]
This weekend you're going to watch it?

[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.360]
Well, I didn't expect that kind of quick response.

[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.480]
I'll try to watch it over sometime during the week or before you get back on Tuesday.

[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.040]
Yeah.

[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.640]
Just to force me to watch CD of God, which I don't want to.

[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:20.500]
Right, well.

[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.680]
Well, there's always one.

[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.100]
One is so lonely.

[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.660]
It's no longer that you ever do.

[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.860]
See, you know what?

[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.540]
This reminds me of it's like flavors of ice cream.

[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.840]
Nobody needs to tell me that heavenly hash or rocky road or fish food.

[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.540]
These are phenomenal sensational flavors of ice cream.

[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.500]
So if you like vanilla better, that's fine.

[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.540]
But don't try to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about.

[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.240]
I know my crap.

[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:47.840]
Okay.

[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.440]
It's the same thing with movies.

[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.860]
Magnolia is one of the, I would say if it isn't that everybody's top 25 list,

[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.440]
then you haven't seen it.

[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.060]
A wall time.

[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.400]
And maybe top 10.

[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.040]
It's just a fabulous movie.

[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.460]
I mean, granted, it doesn't make a lot of sense in it, but then again it's a movie, you know?

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.180]
Okay.

[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]
And post make a lot of sense.

[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.100]
Including when the frogs start falling out of the sky.

[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.620]
Or I shouldn't have said that, but you already know that.

[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.600]
No, actually, I'm pretty sure I know absolutely nothing about this movie.

[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.060]
Oh.

[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.380]
Well, like I said, there's no frogs.

[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.580]
The frogs will only be at the hockey game tomorrow night.

[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.660]
That's what I was talking about.

[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.660]
56070560, pound 560, and they've arrived in Singular, wireless line.

[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.260]
Now, yes, I played like little segments there.

[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.780]
We had a two or three of Danny, rather, bits there in a row.

[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.760]
Maybe we were like, do segments.

[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.120]
Okay.

[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.360]
And it's now where we have a, of mobits would be good.

[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.000]
Yeah, just play it all.

[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:36.880]
See how long it is.

[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.520]
Oh, that's fun.

[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.580]
No, come on.

[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:39.860]
Don't start.

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.160]
And it's more out of the way.

[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:41.880]
Okay, good.

[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.340]
Yeah, okay.

[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.620]
Well, maybe we will play them all.

[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.740]
All the ones that we can still play.

[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.720]
Okay, we can't play that Aronde.

[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:47.880]
And who was it?

[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.860]
That was Chris and Aronde and Aronde.

[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.060]
Who ever the hell of the other one was?

[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.960]
Can't do that one no more.

[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:54.680]
Believe you may.

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.300]
But we certainly got enough to make a nice segment.

[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.100]
56070560, pound 560, you're wondering how come he keeps giving the number out so much today?

[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.400]
Well, it's the last show of the year and it kills a lot of good time.

[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.740]
You're just anxious to talk to all those who call her.

[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:07.180]
No, I'm not.

[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.400]
WQYM, hello.

[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:09.340]
Hey, Neil.

[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.300]
I got one for you.

[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.820]
What's the difference between the Neal and Roger's shit on a toilet?

[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.480]
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:18.900]
WQYM, hello.

[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.280]
Yes, good morning, Neil.

[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.460]
I thank you for taking my call.

[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.560]
Well, good morning and thanks for making your call.

[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.620]
Yeah, I'd like to add this to your poll, if I may.

[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.140]
Yes.

[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:34.420]
I'd like to start off, Florida, turn into a first class gambling mecca for 2006.

[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:35.240]
Yeah.

[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:43.000]
And I think one good way is going to be in about the next five days, the opening of Gulf Stream Park.

[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.160]
Is going to turn it into a gambling mecca.

[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.360]
Well, that's correct, sir.

[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.840]
They're going to have the Vegas style slot machines.

[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:50.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.080]
And then soon to follow, of course, the Indians will then want to have the next tier,

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.800]
which would be Relette and Blackjack.

[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:57.380]
Right.

[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.980]
Of course, a year after that, then the stable realize they're losing so much revenue.

[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:02.860]
Right, yeah.

[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:03.860]
No problem.

[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.020]
They're going to legalize casino gambling all over the city.

[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.840]
I'd say to whatever you're smoking, pass the peat, pass the pipe, okay?

[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:09.940]
Woo!

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:10.780]
Heavy duty.

[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.660]
Yeah, we'll be Vegas in no time.

[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:15.900]
And enjoy yourself, by the way, at Gulf Stream, with all those old facts over there.

[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.460]
5667.0560.

[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:19.460]
£560, and they've arrived.

[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.580]
I only wish the best for the folks at Gulf Stream be good, but if they just keep bringing back Gary Puckett,

[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.840]
the union gap, not a good idea, and Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge.

[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.620]
I mean, some of the sale acts that they bring back.

[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.000]
I think I got like a little bacon bit stuck in my throat.

[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.320]
Man, I had a lot of bacon myself.

[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.240]
Did you really?

[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.200]
Eh, hell, be careful now.

[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:41.980]
Eat too much of that how he's bacon.

[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.240]
It's really great, but they always said over like 15,000 slabs of it.

[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:45.620]
Slams.

[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.380]
I love it.

[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.060]
And at one time I ate so much of it, and it was just sliding out, man.

[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.540]
I just I had sliders for like, oh boy.

[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.660]
Speaking of turl it, I was busy.

[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.000]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.820]
That's our best call so far.

[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.600]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.960]
Yeah, you know it's a nail?

[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:03.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.860]
Yeah, I was just wondering.

[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:11.620]
I don't know if you had listening to Howard the other day, the no-meister there.

[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.300]
He was here.

[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.460]
He had made a comment and he was calling you, Neil.

[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.080]
I guess you know who cares?

[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.940]
Grow up already.

[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.000]
Where did you please get a life?

[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:19.880]
Get a freaking life.

[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.380]
I'm not interested in talking overgrown children, okay?

[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.700]
Mao said this.

[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.100]
Did you know I didn't listen to Howard?

[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.200]
I'd listen to anybody else's.

[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240]
I don't listen to this radio station or any other one either.

[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:28.820]
How do you like that?

[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.280]
I actually have a life.

[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.340]
Did you hear what this one said about you?

[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.080]
Did you hear what Joey Reynolds said?

[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.800]
Did you hear what Dickie Parkle said?

[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.480]
See, this is one reason that the call sucked, okay?

[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.900]
It's because most of the people out there, like, first of all, you got all the talk show groupies like this guy.

[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.920]
Did you hear what So-It-So said about the mad dog?

[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.860]
And you hear what the Hank said about Mao?

[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.380]
Did you hear what Neil said about Randy?

[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.160]
Get a life.

[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.400]
Get a freaking life.

[01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.160]
I have no idea.

[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.020]
Get a search party.

[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.700]
That should be, you know, something?

[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:02.820]
That's for the pool.

[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.480]
That's a good one.

[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.480]
You're number one wish for 2006.

[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.820]
I find a life.

[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.840]
Oh, God, that should zoom to the top.

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.360]
I find a life.

[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.940]
Because I would say about at least 50% of the people we talk to, their motto is...

[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:17.580]
I have no life.

[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.300]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.760]
Speak to Neil Rogers.

[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:21.520]
Speaking.

[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.860]
What do you think about how he is, you man?

[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:24.960]
Cowboy?

[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.700]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.740]
Hey, you seem broke bad mountain yet.

[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.620]
No, I have not.

[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.340]
Have you seen it?

[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.340]
Yeah, real story about real cowboy love.

[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.220]
Okay, right, I'm cowboy.

[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.220]
Bear back mountain.

[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.220]
Haven't seen that one yet, no.

[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.640]
And I bet you he has seen it in the movie too.

[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.080]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.000]
You know.

[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:51.100]

[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:51.140]

[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:52.860]
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil.

[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:53.520]
Speaking.

[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.100]
Hi, Neil.

[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:55.860]
How are you?

[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:56.820]
Good.

[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:09.580]
I'm calling wishing that for 2006 president Bush takes this avian bird pandemic seriously.

[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.080]
Because I don't know if you read Markle the other day that they had a drill at the White House.

[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.220]
Everybody took part in it and he had to go right in the fight.

[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:22.280]
And I think that's what I think.

[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:23.340]
Uh-huh.

[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.180]
And also I was wondering if I could make a same with request.

[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.380]
Sure, but I hope it's better than the other part.

[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:32.620]
Yeah.

[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:42.620]
That you play one of the eyes and events that you played yesterday like both friends daughters in town and the hysterical.

[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.260]
We, I'm begging you play.

[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.100]
I want to female listeners that listen every day.

[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.120]
One of the ten we go.

[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:49.600]
Okay, thanks.

[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.620]
We have a great new year.

[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.200]
Thanks.

[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.140]
Bye.

[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.980]
Okay, 26 past 11.

[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.840]
It's a little bad phone connection there, but never less, right?

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:13:59.440]
A little bit.

[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.220]
Just work our way through all of these things, all these glitches.

[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.460]
Because glitches can be bitches when you're trying to do a radio show, but never less.

[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.540]
It is the QMF in Wayne.

[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.920]
We are broadcasting an HD.

[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.360]
Is there anybody out there that has a HD here receiver?

[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:12.660]
No.

[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.840]
But boy, it would sound phenomenal.

[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.280]
I would sound just like Westbrook Van Voorhees, Watercront Heiden, Edward Armero, all rolled into one.

[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.420]
If you just only had a nice HD set.

[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.800]
This is Neil Rudd.

[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.640]
Anybody believe me?

[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.000]
No.

[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.120]
This is 5.62 AM.

[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.840]
Don't it.

[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.420]
I told you.

[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.000]
Don't bother me while I'm in here.

[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:35.560]
I, sir.

[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:36.900]
Hello?

[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.380]
It's Mickey Mouse.

[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.140]
Oh, Mr. Mouse.

[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:40.800]
Good morning.

[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.540]
How are you?

[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.440]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.200]
Nothing, sir.

[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.920]
You're freaking killing me.

[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:48.640]
No, not.

[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.260]
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes.

[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.660]
Why did we move the practice?

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.640]
Sir, you told me to move the practice.

[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.860]
I didn't tell you anything.

[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.280]
You must have misunderstood me.

[01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.380]
No, sir.

[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.460]
You said move the practice to Monday.

[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.100]
Hey, hey.

[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.280]
Listen, butt wipe.

[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.420]
I'm the boss.

[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:05.680]
I make the decisions.

[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.960]
You take the heat.

[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:07.340]
Right.

[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.060]
You all move the practice.

[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:09.780]
Okay.

[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.420]
How are we going with it anyway?

[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.440]
I am mad.

[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:13.800]
Hold on.

[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.740]
I'm going to be...

[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.420]
Remus.

[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:16.900]
Yeah, boss.

[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.200]
Shut the hell up.

[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.040]
I'm on the phone, Remus.

[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:21.780]
Hi, sir.

[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:22.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.660]
What was your question?

[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:24.820]
I'm telling you.

[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.700]
I'm going crazy over here.

[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.000]
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes.

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.100]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.

[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:34.980]
Hold on.

[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.240]
Remus.

[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.040]
Get him off.

[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.260]
Stop it, Remus.

[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.800]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.

[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:43.780]
Hold on.

[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:44.920]
Remus!

[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.380]
It's like this in my hand, Remus.

[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.780]
That's your penis, boss.

[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.420]
My other hand, Remus.

[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.580]
That's a phone, boss.

[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:52.960]
Right.

[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.280]
I can't hear anything, Remus.

[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.720]
Stop sawing the floor.

[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:57.380]
Sorry.

[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.560]
I said, sir.

[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.020]
Sir, the moves are working out very well.

[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.340]
The practice is four minutes times one.

[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:03.660]

[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:03.800]
And what?

[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.120]

[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:04.280]
And what?

[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:04.520]
And what?

[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:04.660]
And what?

[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:05.520]
What?

[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:06.780]
And what?

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:06.900]
And what?

[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.080]
And what?

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.340]
And what?

[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:27.300]
I, trow, trow.

[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.780]
And the picture seni was covered with teeth.

[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.600]
Then everything was integral.

[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:35.620]
Now gloves and gnoc.

[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:35.620]

[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.100]
Thank you, Luc.

[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:36.400]

[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.000]
Let the photography go.

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000]

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.380]
You see me what I'm doing here?

[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.280]
Sir, you're on the phone.

[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.340]
I know I'm on the phone.

[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.500]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.380]
You hear imagination for crying out loud.

[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.320]
I'm moving my hands up and down, slide aside.

[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.560]
I'm the puppet master.

[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:53.960]
I say it.

[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:54.860]
You do it.

[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.960]
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff

[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.140]
that you cut out of a Michael Jackson interview.

[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.520]
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff

[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.080]
to make him look like a...

[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.500]
Puppet master, me.

[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.000]
Idiot!

[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.280]
Oh!

[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:11.660]
Oh!

[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.180]
Green!

[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.780]
Yes, you have a sauce on hell you doing now!

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.240]
It's in the floor, boss.

[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.140]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus.

[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.280]
What's this in my ear?

[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.940]
That's your penis, boss.

[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.580]
My other ear, Remus.

[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.500]
That's the phone, boss.

[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.720]
That's the phone, Remus.

[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:29.200]
Get out.

[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.400]
Get over the word.

[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.120]
Get out.

[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.260]
I, sir.

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:32.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.420]
Get on me.

[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.020]
Get on me.

[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.140]
I'm sorry, sir.

[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.160]
Get on me.

[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:37.940]
Sorry.

[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.320]
Get on me, softly.

[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.660]
I, sir.

[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.000]
Mr. Mouse.

[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.780]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.780]
What do you mean, sir?

[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.460]
Why am I reading in the paper?

[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.000]
You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.220]
Well, sir, we're just scouting locations.

[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.760]
Jesus, I'm scouting CEOs.

[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.300]
You are killing me.

[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.520]
But sir, what we've done with New York City Times Square.

[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.560]
We're not in street.

[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.320]
And on.

[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:04.840]
Remus.

[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:06.720]
Remus!

[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.360]
We're all the vacuum cleaner, Remus.

[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.240]
Get that blue bird out of here.

[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.100]
Oh, hey, boss.

[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:14.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.660]
Look what we've done with Midtown Manhattan.

[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.560]
40 Second Street is incredible.

[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.020]
I don't know what publicly I supported that.

[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.440]
But you took all the porn away.

[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.180]
You're killing me.

[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.060]
I'm going through a gabboscon like kids.

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.240]
We're just scouting areas calm down.

[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400]
Listen to me, but much.

[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.780]
Don't tell me to calm down.

[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.540]
We got lucky with Lee Loan's stage.

[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.680]
$128 million.

[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.660]
Now, you're trying to ruin the whole network.

[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.800]
What kind of programming are you running?

[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.600]
Hang on a minute.

[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.260]
Three, two, go.

[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.880]
Remus, you've got blue bird crap all over your shoulder.

[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:50.000]
Bring yourself up or heaven's sake.

[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.200]
And head off the module, cleaner.

[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.280]
Okay, boss.

[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.740]
Good God.

[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.060]
Sir, the network is fine.

[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.900]
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:00.720]
Good God.

[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.840]
You're still running James Bond movie.

[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.720]
There's 60 years old.

[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.920]
Why don't you just put steamboat really on and be done with it?

[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:08.540]
Please sign.

[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.380]
Make a couple of damn dollars.

[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.060]
Well, the movie division's fine.

[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.560]
You mentioned Lee Loan's vision.

[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.900]
Now we have the new M. Night Shumelon movie coming out later this summer.

[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.700]
Ah, it has signs.

[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.100]
What the hell does that mean?

[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.660]
Stop sign, yield sign.

[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.800]
You've got to start swinging some of these titles past me.

[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:25.740]
Please.

[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.000]
Remus.

[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.300]
Remus.

[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.020]
I know you can't hear me.

[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:35.920]
Remus.

[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.100]
You're still running the vacuum cleaner.

[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.200]
You're done.

[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.820]
I'm not running the vacuum cleaner.

[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.100]
Get on here, Remus.

[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.820]
And take that blue bird with you.

[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.560]
All right.

[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:46.440]
Hi, sir.

[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.260]
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car.

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:50.900]
Why were you?

[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.380]
What do you mean, sir?

[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.100]
I'm not done with you.

[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:53.460]
What?

[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.320]
Bad done.

[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.880]
I'm a perennial storm in your job.

[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:57.840]
But sir, I'm here.

[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.840]
I'm not a perennial storm.

[01:19:59.540 --> 01:19:59.540]

[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.140]
Maybe I put limits in there.

[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.740]
I don't like to be president of Disney Remus.

[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.160]
Oh, my.

[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.960]
What a wonderful day.

[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.840]
Can I hear you, nutbag?

[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.060]
Hey, there's a little bonus for you, too, for the price of one.

[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:12.760]
How do you like that?

[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:19.160]
According to the new report from Bridge Ratings, whatever the hell that is, I think that's one

[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.020]
of those rating systems when you see the numbers you want to go to nearest Bridge and Jump.

[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.020]
Nearly 60% of the serious satellite radio sunnifts in the last shopping days before Christmas

[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.200]
can be credited to a listed desire to hear former syndicated morning host Howard Stearns.

[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.020]
I'm coming show on serious which debuts January 9th.

[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:38.320]
Bridge Ratings interviews said by radio consumers at retail outlets during the fourth quarter

[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.060]
or to determine what impact marketing campaigns and Stern in particular were having on

[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.340]
subscriber counts during the important shopping period.

[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:49.500]
The company says that in October, 22% of serious sunnifts could be credited to a desired

[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:54.640]
to hear Stern, but the number is growing steadily by the week of December 19, a full 58%

[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.460]
of serious sunnifts would do the Stern's imminent move to subscription radio.

[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.120]
I don't like that. The power of Howard. See that? The power of...

[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.900]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.080]
Not that Howard. Wow.

[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.380]
Are you excited? No.

[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.260]
Oh, you're not signed up. No, not.

[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.620]
Of course you didn't listen to Howard when he was on for free, so why would you pay for it?

[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.100]
Oh, I did. Well, I wasn't like, I didn't listen to it.

[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.280]
Oh, I'm talking about when he was on our station.

[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.140]
Oh, no, no. I'm not talking about the old Howard Stearns show when it was funny, and you know,

[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.860]
you would actually go out of your way to listen to it. I'm not talking about those days.

[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.640]
No, I didn't. Listen to it.

[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.120]
I've been on the car for over the past seven years. Nope.

[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.460]
Lieutenant Joe Schillaki.

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:31.940]
Schillachi. See, there's a harness driver, Sam Schillachi, who drives the Northfield Park in Cleveland.

[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.640]
So I think that's how this guy pronounces his name.

[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:37.380]
Lieutenant Joe Schillachi pulls his unmarked car behind the dumpster and hunkers down,

[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.640]
using binoculars to watch a car that a murder suspect is supposed to get into.

[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:44.440]
And gagal teenage girls ambles by. It doesn't take long before he is made.

[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.840]
The term undercover cop uses for somebody recognizing a police officer.

[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.200]
One of the girls calls out, hey, I know you were on the first 48.

[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.220]
It happens all the time to Schillachi, who on this night in his uniform,

[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.640]
trying to be inconspicuous, but not bothering with trying to be invisible.

[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:02.760]
He just can't do it no more. No more over the past three years.

[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.800]
Schillachi's become the breakout star of an A&E TV reality show.

[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.700]
The first 48 about homicide detectives attracted detectives for the first 48 hours after murder.

[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.940]
Washington trying to find a killer.

[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.660]
Schillachi attracted a following with viewers gushing over each episode on A&E's online bulletin boards.

[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.900]
His run on the first 48 and this past fall when he was promoted to Lieutenant Transfer back to his old unit,

[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.140]
jumped out as the undercover squad is informally known in Miami.

[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.340]
But Schillachi took the cameras with him.

[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.680]
He's filming a pilot about running the undercover unit.

[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.600]
Maybe he's like a candle coffee and never met a camera.

[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.060]
He didn't like.

[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.940]
Candle coffee was on CNN again this morning talking crap.

[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.880]
Case anybody missed it.

[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:42.860]
Undercover working TV started a wouldn't seem a perfect fit for Schillachi.

[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.820]
His company key and make it work as a supervisor.

[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.980]
Schillachi won't be called on to do undercover often.

[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.240]
When he does, he sure he can pull it off to have probably need to elaborate disguises.

[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.540]
He spent five years undercover before moving to homicide and drug holes.

[01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:00.260]
He's often recognized as ponytail because of the one he grew to dirty up his clean cut appearance.

[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.120]
Ponytail.

[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.520]
He sure haven't heard that a long time.

[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.240]
That was quite a story that who was it?

[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.000]
Miguel told me that.

[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.020]
That was something.

[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.000]
Bye bye Jeff.

[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:12.580]
Bye showing.

[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:13.280]
Bye bye.

[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:13.860]
It's love.

[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.120]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.720]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.180]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:30.740]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:32.180]

[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.240]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.960]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.380]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:02.660]
It's love is in his pony tail.

[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:03.960]
It's love the beautiful little beautiful pony tail.

[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.900]
Ladies with a wiggle wiggle, any walk,

[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.500]
Ladies with a wiggle, any walk,

[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.840]
Ladies with a wiggle, with a wiggle,

[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.360]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.900]
This is 516-2-A-L.

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.860]
Two years later and say it took me a little while,

[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.280]
a little slow learner,

[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.880]
but Neil, I apologize.

[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.620]
It's radio.

[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.380]
You are the truth.

[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.140]
You're just not having a baby today.

[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.420]
We're going to have a little union here.

[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.640]
You and I have a little problem with the studying show feed today.

[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:48.260]
I think that this satellite fell down as something.

[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.920]
Yeah, like a butt.

[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:54.260]
Why I'll have you know my perfects are the lightfully fine.

[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.320]
Thank you very much.

[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:56.980]
Now if they don't mind,

[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.280]
let's return to the sanctity of sports.

[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.380]
How about a little touchy feely?

[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.360]
How see here?

[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:02.960]
Beware.

[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:03.600]
Over here.

[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.920]
Now see here.

[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:05.840]
What is he in?

[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.320]
What a sucker.

[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.000]
Yeah, it's so stupid.

[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.720]
I am so stupid like they say.

[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.640]
I'm the official voice of the pants.

[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:15.540]
Damn!

[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:16.560]
Damn.

[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.320]
Why I'll have you know I made my bones when you were in embryo.

[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.300]
How do you know?

[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:23.680]
Really?

[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.700]
There's something I never told you.

[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.100]
Yeah.

[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:26.860]
Really?

[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.340]
I have your father.

[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.380]
Daddy!

[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:35.080]
I'm in embryo.

[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.740]
I just thought I'm out of there.

[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.600]
That was the fastest round.

[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:43.520]
That was a nice table.

[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.160]
Wait, let's go.

[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.060]
Let's go.

[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:47.220]
Let's go.

[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.280]
Let's go.

[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.520]
Let's go.

[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:49.900]
Let's go.

[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:50.440]

[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:50.640]

[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:51.200]
Let's go.

[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:51.920]
Let's go.

[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.680]
Let's go.

[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:54.960]
Let's go.

[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.560]
Let's go.

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.080]

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.080]

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.080]

[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.240]
Let's go.

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.440]
Whoa.

[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:02.440]
Whoa.

[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.080]
Let's go.

[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.900]
Let's go.

[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.700]
Good work.

[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:17.660]
Good work.

[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.220]
Let's go.

[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.940]
Come on, man.

I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.040]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.380]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.280]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.460]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.880]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.000]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.300]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.640]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.660]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.780]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.560]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.240]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:21.420]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:23.740]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.920]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:25.740]
I'm going to do really really really really really well.

[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.040]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.260]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:34.200]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:39.360]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.120]
I'm going to have to have to worry where what is all that I want to do.

[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.520]
I'm going to have to haunt the house where I'm going.

[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.880]
I'm going to have to have to have something to do.

[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.320]
I'm going to have to get anywhere.

[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.160]
I'm going to have to play and play and playing.

[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:51.260]
I'm going to play and play and play, and I'm going to play with it right now.

[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:51.260]

[01:28:52.220 --> 01:29:19.720]
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No

[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:49.700]

Go! Go! Go! If the comments here are coming, your world comes. It's all singing! Good day! Let's pump up to a better end. Let's pump up! Again! Let's pump up! Again! Let's pump up to a better end. Hurry! Go! Let's pump up to wonderful fun tears that we

[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.140]
I can take from that P.E. Hoi-Henry.

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.780]
If that type smokestix one little pinky toe in the studio again!

[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.120]
Why y'all punch em in the nose?

[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:57.720]
See?

[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.020]
I'll knock out his teeth, I say.

[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.440]
I'm gonna marbleize him.

[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.920]
Why y'all twist him into a pretzel?

[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.060]
Why y'all tear him lid from lid?

[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.620]
The hell's slice his belly open like a grouper?

[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.940]
Y'all make that poop-a-look cry.

[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.920]
The next tiny attempt to assassinate my good character?

[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.380]
I'm gonna call my attorney.

[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.140]
I'm calling the National Guard!

[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.980]
No matter where they are,

[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.560]
then I'm calling my rabbi and I'll call Mabel.

[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.180]
Like Label.

[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.760]
And then I'm gonna pull a freight train.

[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:26.840]
You're the only my dentist.

[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:28.400]
Like all American boy even,

[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.720]
Lance Armstrong give me.

[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.160]
Why if I ever get my hidden?

[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.200]
What is that?

[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.780]
There's a monkey in my jacket pants.

[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:35.320]
Ow!

[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.840]
Who's doing this?

[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.780]
Who's doing this?

[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.580]
Why is he moving?

[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.560]
And out of my jacket.

[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:42.780]
Who's doing this?

[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.140]
Who's doing this?

[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.540]
Who's doing this?

[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.660]
I'm not there, not there.

[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.720]
Who's doing this?

[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.380]
Who's doing this?

[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.220]
I'll write a write-up date.

[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.500]
Oh, what did you get?

[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500]
I got a call here.

[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.540]
It's a number one rating.

[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.100]
I'm going to have it in his own.

[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.320]
At least I could in my ass for reasons.

[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.020]
Stay away from me.

[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.560]
I don't even know how you have children.

[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:19.700]
Miramar, hello.

[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.500]
Yes, I want your cake on J. Bieber.

[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.900]
Oh, J. Bieber is a great quarterback and a good joke.

[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.620]
I like J. Bieber.

[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.320]
Well, not to mention he's got to explore the never-least smooth detoxes.

[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.100]
Oh, yeah!

[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.720]
It's gonna be different what you say here.

[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:38.340]
Oh, keep the, thank you more.

[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.440]
No, no, wait a minute.

[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:39.880]
Don't go.

[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:42.120]
I have nothing else to say.

[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.480]
How about this?

[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.340]
I was going down there in Miramar.

[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.180]
I'm going down the street from you.

[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.780]
I have to go.

[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.160]
Oh, I know.

[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.000]
Wait, by the way, something.

[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.320]
No, no, I have to go.

[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.220]
Look, I tell you what.

[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.600]
I'll hold you over the break.

[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.100]
How's that?

[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.680]
I'll give you one of my old 10 features.

[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.240]
How's that?

[01:31:59.300 --> 01:31:59.860]
No, wait!

[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.160]
That was the only caller we had.

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.680]
The things I know is growing again.

[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.360]
I know, I know, I know.

[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.280]
I know, I know, I know.

[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.900]

[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.220]
I know, I know.

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.220]

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:26.400]
I know, I know.

[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:26.660]
I know, I know.

[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:28.200]
I know, I know.

[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.220]
I know, I know.

[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:29.280]
I know, I know.

[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.960]
I know, I know.

[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.780]
I know, I know.

[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.020]
I know, I know.

[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:33.080]
I know, I know.

[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.340]
I know, I know.

[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:34.340]

[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:34.560]
I know, I know.

[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.500]
I know, I know.

[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.580]
I know, I know.

[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:36.580]

[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:38.180]
I know, I know.

[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:38.180]

[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:38.540]
I know.

[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.880]
I know.

[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.020]
That was real...

[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.240]
I know, it was real.

[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:45.240]

[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:45.240]

[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:45.300]

[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:45.580]
I know.

[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.880]
It was truly, really different.

[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:51.420]
It was more just perfect than WE had like,

[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.500]
SUCCIBLE Yeon!

[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:11.860]
We will have a meal,

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:11.860]

[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.940]
I'm going to fly back to our home city

[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.480]
And say it's kind of just memory

[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.820]
I don't have a reason

[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:25.260]
I'm going to fly back

[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.360]
The bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb

[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.780]
The bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb

[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:32.020]
Hey, we'll be right out of second

[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.260]
I'm going to fly back

[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:37.640]
I'm going to fly

[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.720]
Oh, what can you get, Liz?

[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.560]
I can get a little piece in quite

[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:40.560]

[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.460]
Why are you going here, Ronald?

[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:47.320]
When I wait in here, I pull my open

[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.160]
That's something like honey, even

[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.300]
That's for you

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.260]
Failure, you're forcing me to do this

[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.580]
Can't think, I've got a nice Hawaiian touch

[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.340]
Sure

[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:24.900]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:50.480]
oh aor t

[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:50.540]
oh aor

[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.380]
oh aor

[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:52.680]
oh aor

[01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:01.370]
And keep him with the high standards of raw casturnals.

[01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:04.050]
In the tradition of Edward Omero, see it now.

[01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:09.590]
560 WQAM presents now, see here, with Mo Howard David.

[01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:10.590]
I just move on with a David.

[01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:11.950]
I'll see here.

[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:13.530]
Got a new gig here.

[01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:19.350]
And if I had so choose to stay, I will change the face of whatever that is told.

[01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:22.310]
Now see here, who did more for radio.

[01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:24.870]
New Rogers or Hoi Baskar Anderson.

[01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.490]
Huh?

[01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:28.430]
Hello again.

[01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:31.590]
Here's my best view.

[01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.870]
Are you guys all right?

[01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:37.130]
I'm all right.

[01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:38.690]
Hoi Baskar Anderson.

[01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:39.830]
That's who.

[01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:43.490]
A one thing, he was the mayor of boarding radion.

[01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:45.590]
And at Pitchmokka, he ain't no mayor.

[01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:48.270]
Why Hoi Baskar Anderson sang nice song.

[01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:52.170]
Oh, he had a beautiful voice.

[01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:55.790]
Are you guys all right?

[01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:56.650]
That ain't no radio.

[01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:58.350]
Don't sing those songs on the nutted in me.

[01:35:58.630 --> 01:35:59.730]
Wait, don't annoy me.

[01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:00.530]
Why sure?

[01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:05.370]
That's a Neil singing in the destroy reaching songs about the go to the noir.

[01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.170]
And then in the back of the one who he writes in it, and he'll sing them.

[01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:09.610]
Now you know he's queer.

[01:36:10.150 --> 01:36:11.370]
But real men don't sing.

[01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:15.810]
And another thing, Hoi Baskar Anderson.

[01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:17.850]
It was a lot better than the old too.

[01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.730]
That there's what they did best.

[01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:23.630]
And the next installment of Housey Here.

[01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.250]
Who made a better cup of coffee?

[01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:28.230]
Mrs. Olson or Jackie Robinson?

[01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:29.310]
Gammal.

[01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:32.930]
Now see me here next time for a moment, Dignitz.

[01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:34.390]
And now see here.

[01:36:34.650 --> 01:36:35.770]
Not there over here.

[01:36:36.150 --> 01:36:36.630]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

[01:36:40.230 --> 01:36:42.470]
I see here a penis, my stucco.

[01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:45.290]
I'm going to get a 3FDT.

[01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:46.370]
You're right, I hate you.

[01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:48.430]
I hate you up on the face.

[01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:50.350]
I'm going to get a 1D1.

[01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:53.190]
No one's going to get a 1D1.

[01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:53.690]
2D1!

[01:36:54.130 --> 01:36:56.270]
One, two, one, you're going to get a 1D1.

[01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:56.790]
2D1!

[01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:58.470]
I'm going to get a 1D1.

[01:36:59.570 --> 01:37:00.070]
2D1!

[01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:02.470]
I just want my own signature.

[01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.570]
2D1!

[01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:06.030]
5, 4, 3, 4!

[01:37:06.150 --> 01:37:06.650]
2D1!

[01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:09.230]
5, 4, 3, 4!

[01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:09.810]
3D1!

[01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:11.570]
4D1!

[01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:15.370]
I hate it, the trend is away from out there.

[01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:19.870]
You will not get my time slut for a door.

[01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:21.290]
You know it.

[01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:23.750]
Besides, you make money.

[01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:27.950]
Yeah, and then I want something I don't have tonight.

[01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.890]
I like one.

[01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:31.330]
We just want to get a 3D1.

[01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:32.210]
Yeah, so that's all you want.

[01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:33.090]
3D1!

[01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:34.270]
And a 1D1.

[01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:35.190]
I want a 1D1.

[01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:37.670]
I hate you, no, and we went down.

[01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:40.390]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:42.410]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:43.950]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.490]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:48.930]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:52.350]
I want my own signature.

[01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:57.690]
Okay, let me put these seven.

[01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:59.130]
That's your kill some good time.

[01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:00.730]
And it was extremely enjoyable for me.

[01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:01.690]
That was great.

[01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:03.630]
And you're still eating now.

[01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:04.430]
It's not even like that.

[01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:09.850]
Josh Corners is going to explode like Jeff Hyde, like Fat Boy is going to like bursting out all over.

[01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:11.110]
Not good.

[01:38:11.770 --> 01:38:14.190]
I told you you're going to like balloon up like a cow pretty soon.

[01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.630]
You'll see.

[01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:15.690]
I showed after today.

[01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:16.430]
Yeah.

[01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:23.930]
How do we police are investigating a rape allegation against an FSU football player who was there while practicing for the team's orange bull game against Penn State Penn?

[01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:29.470]
The incident reportedly happened around three o'clock this morning at the Western Divilment Resort in Spawn, Hollywood.

[01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:32.510]
Hollywood police wouldn't identify the player who was facing the accusations.

[01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:35.170]
FSU escaped into play state, Penn on T-Dead.

[01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:35.830]
How do you like that?

[01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.410]
Another slime ball alleged anyway at FSU.

[01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:40.150]
Must be a mistake.

[01:38:41.050 --> 01:38:41.350]
I'm sure.

[01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:42.150]
How's that pool coming?

[01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:47.470]
What's your number one wish for 2006, 350 votes in Peach George W. Bush 95?

[01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:55.450]
When the lotto, 64, have lots of sex, 44, Democrats, three, elections, 33, all our troops come home 27.

[01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:57.170]
That should be way ahead of everything else.

[01:38:57.490 --> 01:38:59.850]
But then again, most of you don't care about anything except yourselves.

[01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:01.070]
Good health 26.

[01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:03.070]
Put your suds and rift back on year 11.

[01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:04.250]
Get a better job 10.

[01:39:04.570 --> 01:39:05.310]
Peace on earth 9.

[01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:07.030]
Neil Rogers show gets indicated 8.

[01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:08.230]
Getting a raise 6.

[01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:10.030]
I find a life 4.

[01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:10.470]
Good luck.

[01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:12.950]
QM gets sold and Neil gets paid off 4.

[01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:13.770]
Oh yeah.

[01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.890]
Get a divorce 4.

[01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:16.030]
Pink Floyd, Beumden, 3.

[01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:17.670]
Joyce gets fired at it too.

[01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:21.270]
And getting a good GM at the, I guess we've got as many votes as we got a chance.

[01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:23.010]
The big, just like across the street.

[01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:25.570]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:27.910]
This is 5.

[01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:29.010]
62 AF.

[01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:36.310]
Oh, how many days have you heard of that?

[01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:37.930]
I am here.

[01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:39.950]
And you are.

[01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.550]
I can't say anything more than that for me.

[01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:46.510]
Thanks for no small pause for that good midday show guy.

[01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:47.810]
Oh, Boca.

[01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:49.550]
Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.

[01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:50.190]
Who have it?

[01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:51.570]
You're not here.

[01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:52.190]
I did it.

[01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:53.030]
Yeah.

[01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:54.270]
Out in the hallway.

[01:39:54.370 --> 01:39:55.290]
I don't know who out of the way.

[01:39:55.690 --> 01:39:56.830]
Let's take some calls.

[01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:57.850]
And shall we?

[01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:59.990]
Prestige is a Bud Polly city.

[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:01.830]
Yeah, hi, Maul.

[01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:02.910]
Yeah, yeah, well, you know what he said.

[01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:04.970]
When are people going to realize this?

[01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:08.450]
This is a sports show in nothing else.

[01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.910]
Absolutely.

[01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:12.550]
Nothing exists outside the gay world of sports.

[01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:13.510]
Yeah, might of way some.

[01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:15.750]
They paid me to oggle and admit.

[01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:18.270]
This here is a show for men.

[01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:20.590]
A belt man like this.

[01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:22.490]
Milly bears and chaps.

[01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:24.210]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.670]
Huh?

[01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.770]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:27.850]
I did not take no pizza.

[01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:29.050]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.950]
I don't be ridiculous.

[01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.710]
You mean it?

[01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:32.930]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:33.190 --> 01:40:34.090]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:35.750]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.750]
I didn't steal the pizza.

[01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:38.890]
I didn't steal the pizza.

[01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.410]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.490]
No.

[01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:40.930]
I did not steal the pizza.

[01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:43.070]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:44.650]
Now see here.

[01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:46.190]
I ain't no pie, Bergler.

[01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:47.730]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:49.510]
I did not steal the pizza.

[01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.250]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:52.070]
You stole the pizza?

[01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:53.230]
You only had one slice.

[01:40:53.730 --> 01:40:54.290]
They're okay.

[01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:55.630]
So was the whole pie.

[01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:56.730]
Who cares?

[01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:58.030]
Those buns had no power.

[01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:59.170]
I was hungry.

[01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:01.090]
I sacrificed a lot too, you know.

[01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:02.810]
There was no Dr. Browns.

[01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:05.110]
Just don't face the same without the Dr. Browns.

[01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:06.210]
That's rudist.

[01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:07.570]
And that's my own standard.

[01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:08.450]
Good night.

[01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.890]
And kiss my ass.

[01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:13.650]

[01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:34.550]
Oh, then wait, Mo.

[01:41:34.730 --> 01:41:36.670]
And fully advanced down and healthy with the show.

[01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:39.210]
Okay, say, that was about that Ricky William.

[01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:40.210]
My you.

[01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:40.910]
No.

[01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:43.070]
I see here you moron.

[01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.390]
We ain't talking about no fish on mine, show see.

[01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:46.630]
Always what I like.

[01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:47.930]
Now come here, you muttonhead.

[01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:48.530]
Oh.

[01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:51.690]
Say, get a load of that theme over there.

[01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:52.390]
What's your name?

[01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:53.410]
Oh, that's Carolyn.

[01:41:53.730 --> 01:41:55.090]
Say, you think I watch that.

[01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:56.130]
Don't do it, Mo.

[01:41:56.490 --> 01:41:57.770]
It's a family show.

[01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.730]
Out of my way.

[01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.130]
Hey, baby.

[01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.770]
Come here.

I'm a big star, you know.

[01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:04.390]
Grandma, I'm only cake.

[01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.050]
I just want to touch your head.

[01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:07.290]
Come on, baby.

[01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:09.570]

[01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:00.970]
That's my pizza.

[01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:01.490]

[01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:01.530]
That's my pizza.

[01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:02.010]
That's my pizza.

[01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:06.490]
I get dirty little.

[01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:11.270]
I don't care if it was your start to death, it's no good sign of it.

[01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:16.530]
I'll have you know it's more important for me to survive.

[01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:22.010]
You've read me by so number-a-cheeing in title, it's a design.

[01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:28.390]
I only had a little bit of a shmit in a sliver of my sliver of the pizza.

[01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:33.910]
I'd watch your pizza.

[01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:39.310]
I'll take that pizza.

[01:43:39.310 --> 01:44:09.270]
I'll take that pizza.

[01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:16.090]
I don't promote the prestigious Kakafoni or the Mojave de Jor.

[01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:18.110]
That's what I mean by where's the love?

[01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:19.450]
Another chestnut.

[01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:21.910]
My baggy pants would fill style of you man.

[01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:23.890]
I can't know like that.

[01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:26.030]
Where is the love?

[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:28.930]
No, no, no, no.

[01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:30.290]
Wait, wait, wait.

[01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:32.890]
Here we go.

[01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:36.270]
You know what this reminds me of the time I bought an SRS?

[01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:38.290]
And all the time I thought I was buying this sports car.

[01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:41.050]
I'm here, what do you know what you say, Dr. Dudley?

[01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.850]
John, it's you again.

[01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:45.470]
I hear you specialize in SRS.

[01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:46.390]
What is that?

[01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:47.430]
It's a narrow area.

[01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:48.230]
How many horsepower?

[01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:49.910]
Time of faith, you don't understand.

[01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:51.030]
It's a sex change.

[01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:53.290]
Well, since I'm already here.

[01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:54.510]
What is your problem?

[01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:55.390]
No, Dr. Dudley.

[01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:57.070]
I've always been a lesbian.

[01:44:57.790 --> 01:45:02.050]
And when you were with the white coat and a quick board and all this talk about Harriet Myers of this...

[01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:03.710]
So, you don't want an SRS?

[01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:04.290]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:06.290]
Before the recon mirror dice in an 8-track.

[01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:07.430]
Okay, here.

[01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:08.790]
Let me check your ears.

[01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:09.170]
Sure.

[01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:11.930]
Second of the grade matter, huh?

[01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:14.630]
I don't think Idaho has seen this many potatoes.

[01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:15.850]
I'll see you in bed.

[01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:17.370]
You can keep your pants on.

[01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:18.310]
Now, pin wide.

[01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:19.090]
Woof!

[01:45:19.090 --> 01:45:19.870]
Go away.

[01:45:20.370 --> 01:45:22.150]
Go to the door, go to the door.

[01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:24.050]
Go away.

[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:25.610]
Go away.

[01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.530]
Go away.

[01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:28.090]
Go to the door, go to the door.

[01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:28.990]

[01:45:29.210 --> 01:45:29.970]
Go away.

[01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:33.030]
And I take it over wood that you你 said the day is here.

[01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:35.630]
You should have let it all in to talk about me, Rahul Ayskis.

[01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:38.910]
I don't give a crack with that fairy has to say it.

[01:45:39.150 --> 01:45:42.490]
If he wants, of course, he should ask them what I have to do to him.

[01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:45.370]
I all have you know, I know what I'm talking about.

[01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:48.210]
Every morning at the condo, I could see elevated down.

[01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:52.850]
And on my way to the hall when I told my folder's message out, I gave a free condo paper.

[01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:55.650]
The boys are back in town.

[01:45:55.930 --> 01:45:57.210]
The boys are back in town.

[01:45:59.590 --> 01:46:01.750]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:02.350]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:04.530]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:04.630]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:08.610]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:11.310]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:16.210]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:23.750]
The boys are back in town.

[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.750]

[01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.950]

[01:46:24.330 --> 01:46:25.250]
Why you lose?

[01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:29.430]
Ah, my God, I want you, Spore-Hole Boots.

[01:46:29.970 --> 01:46:31.930]
I know everything that's going on in the news.

[01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:35.110]
Why I even know all the new Marjan rules.

[01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:37.590]
I've hit to the drive, got the old rules.

[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.690]
You better go and talk tonight.

[01:46:41.290 --> 01:46:43.730]
It's a better show when I take your place.

[01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:46.450]
I know I ain't no way of playing me.

[01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:48.970]
But when they drop my boys, look, yay!

[01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:50.590]
You little smoothies, the boys.

[01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:52.050]
The boys.

[01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.350]

[01:46:52.690 --> 01:46:53.490]
The boys.

[01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:55.010]
The boys.

[01:46:55.130 --> 01:46:57.950]
The boys.

[01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:06.730]
I've said that there's no limit to it.

[01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:08.310]
We could have like 40 hours of it, you know?

[01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:10.650]
Yeah, I thought I'd like to hear them all today.

[01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:12.530]
I'll bet you would several times.

[01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:13.890]
I wouldn't sound like you're eating anymore.

[01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:15.010]
I must have finished it all up.

[01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.710]
I did, finally.

[01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:17.670]
So, I was good at playing Bits now,

[01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:19.230]
because otherwise you might have another one

[01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:21.290]
as the emergency runs, so to speak.

[01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:23.610]
Well, what's your faxes here?

[01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:25.670]
I understand that you must have just gone in there

[01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:26.550]
and seen the pile, huh?

[01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:27.330]
Yeah, I must have.

[01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:28.370]
So, here they are.

[01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:30.850]
Hector, which is a phony name, obviously, on this one.

[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:33.130]
Nio, you talked about people being fired during the holidays.

[01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:34.090]
You are off phony.

[01:47:34.410 --> 01:47:36.170]
You fired the bird during the holiday of time.

[01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.890]
What a nice guy.

[01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.970]
You are a question, Mark.

[01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:39.490]
Who said I was a nice guy?

[01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:41.630]
Well, in personal, it was business.

[01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:43.810]
He was destroying the show, but nevertheless.

[01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:47.030]
And he's dead anyway, so what differences does it make now, Hector?

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:48.470]
What's your real name, Hector?

[01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:49.210]
Vector?

[01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.450]
Lector?

[01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.850]
Schmendrick?

[01:47:52.530 --> 01:47:56.850]
Pracy and Kendall says, I'd like to add no more Mo on the year for the 2006 subhole.

[01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:58.410]
No more Mo, Mo.

[01:47:58.730 --> 01:47:59.990]
You put it on there, however you like.

[01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:04.410]
He says, I'd hope for impeached Bush, but that would mean that Dick Cheney would be in charge,

[01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:05.410]
so I can't fathom that.

[01:48:05.530 --> 01:48:06.370]
Well, he already is, Tracy.

[01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:07.810]
Happy new year to you, Tracy.

[01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:09.470]
Kendall, one of our regular factors.

[01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.970]
Now this is kind of interesting because here's like a two-parter.

[01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:17.710]
It says, is it possible to put the Marine Dowd off their article from yesterday on the storyboard

[01:48:17.710 --> 01:48:19.210]
that what about Dick Rass, Futon, Cheney?

[01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.870]
I'd love to send that to a few folks, and then a little bit later on, oops.

[01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:23.430]
Never mind about the Marine Dowd.

[01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:24.330]
Article found it on the list.

[01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:25.610]
Thank you very much.

[01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:26.230]
Yeah, that's good.

[01:48:27.370 --> 01:48:29.910]
If you look on there, you'll see that we got the good crap on our website.

[01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.970]
We need a lot more people reading those stories, or Josh is just going to say the hell with it.

[01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:34.770]
Right?

[01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:37.130]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:40.790]
Well, I mean, you know, we need a lot to, you know, they're going to...

[01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:42.690]
I'm not saying that they can't find those stories.

[01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:46.150]
If they want to do their homework and go to about 20 or 30 other websites, you can do it.

[01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:49.230]
But we try to make it easy for you and convenient, and you pick and choose,

[01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:53.610]
whichever one's sound interesting to you, or titillating, or fascinating, or whatever.

[01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:55.370]
It's still some good time, too.

[01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:59.130]
Matt and Volka, a long time listener, happy new year, Matt.

[01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:03.430]
He says, my wish for 2006 is that you get a radio show on one of those uncensored satellite radio shows,

[01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:06.350]
so you can make all the fart jokes and use all the obscenities you want.

[01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:07.070]
Amen, Matt.

[01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:08.690]
F&A.

[01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:12.990]
I got serious satellite radio as a gift for Christmas because I'm Goiim.

[01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:15.110]
Now, that's plural, unless you're two people, Matt.

[01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:15.770]
I'm a Goi.

[01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:17.310]
But we'll still be listening to you every day.

[01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:18.450]
Well, thank the Lord for that.

[01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:19.190]
Thank God.

[01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:20.010]
Thank God.

[01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:23.710]
Justice Sonora, I was driving down from Jacksonville the other day, and I could hear your broadcast.

[01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:24.610]
Clear visibility.

[01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:26.850]
Revard Indian River County line.

[01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:27.590]
I don't have one of them.

[01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.670]
Sooped up antennas either.

[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:29.370]
How do you like that?

[01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:31.450]
All you people in Revard County, happy new year.

[01:49:31.450 --> 01:49:34.110]
I think we've heard Indian River County line.

[01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:36.210]
What's that like, Melbourne?

[01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.930]
No.

[01:49:38.710 --> 01:49:39.090]
Pomme?

[01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:41.730]
Melbourne's way before Jacksonville.

[01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:44.990]
Well, no, Jacksonville is Duval County.

[01:49:46.410 --> 01:49:47.590]
Well, what's Indian River County?

[01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:50.830]
You don't know your Florida geography, Mr.

[01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:53.170]
and I thought you were in Jacksonville not that long ago, weren't you?

[01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:54.370]
I was, and, no, but...

[01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:56.110]
Well, that's Duval County.

[01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:58.130]
I wasn't arguing that.

[01:49:58.210 --> 01:49:58.930]
I thought he was saying,

[01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:00.990]
I heard your broadcast.

[01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:05.690]
Clear is a bell, as he was driving down from Jacksonville, at the Revard Indian River County line.

[01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:06.430]
Ah, I see.

[01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:07.470]
Well, what is that?

[01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:09.870]
I know Revard County is Melbourne and Stewart, right?

[01:50:11.150 --> 01:50:12.030]
What's Indian River County?

[01:50:12.150 --> 01:50:12.610]
What's in that?

[01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:16.750]
There's a little Google during one of these breaks when you're not stuffing your face.

[01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.890]
And take a look at it.

[01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:19.030]
I mean, not that it's all that important.

[01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:20.170]
I just don't know my Florida.

[01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:21.290]
I know where two egg is.

[01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:22.230]
I've driven through two egg.

[01:50:22.230 --> 01:50:23.150]
There's a stoplight there.

[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.230]
And I've driven through Temple Terrace.

[01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:28.530]
And Lutz.

[01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:32.090]
And all those wonderful places on the West Coast.

[01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:34.890]
And Venice, Venice here.

[01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:38.550]
Here's a facet from Murray Levine.

[01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:39.090]
How's it going?

[01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.350]
Murray, happy new year, baby.

[01:50:40.530 --> 01:50:41.170]
I'm so excited.

[01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.870]
Murray's still alive.

[01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:43.090]
Here's one of the good guys in the business.

[01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:44.470]
I think I'll do the break, then.

[01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:45.530]
I'll finish these as a facet.

[01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:46.650]
Here's one of them as fairly long.

[01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:48.910]
Murray Levine.

[01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.910]
Good man.

[01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:54.310]
And of course, the good people in this business always get screwed over big time, baby.

[01:50:54.570 --> 01:50:56.490]
They get screwed in tattooed.

[01:50:56.490 --> 01:50:57.690]
That's in veerow.

[01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:59.170]
That's like veerow beach, by the way.

[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:00.150]
Oh, in Fort Pierce.

[01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.750]
Yeah.

[01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:02.130]
Well, wow.

[01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:05.430]
Hello to all you Yahoo's up there in Fort Pierce and veerow beach.

[01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:07.170]
All you Yahoo red necks out.

[01:51:08.430 --> 01:51:10.350]
Get your finger out of it and your nose too.

[01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:12.910]
What I did is some kind of a place.

[01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.490]
You ever been there?

[01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.630]
Veerow?

[01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:15.330]
Yeah.

[01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:15.710]
Yeah.

[01:51:16.290 --> 01:51:16.990]
Oh, man.

[01:51:17.850 --> 01:51:18.910]
That part of the state.

[01:51:19.110 --> 01:51:20.590]
Well, most of the state when you come right down to it.

[01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:20.810]
Yes.

[01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:22.910]
Just don't cotton to that whole crowd.

[01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:23.750]
They don't cotton to me.

[01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:24.450]
And that's just fine.

[01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:25.530]
Them cotton pickers.

[01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:29.670]

[01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:32.210]

[01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:36.990]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:45.130]
In a desert not far far away, one soldier stood eyeballs above the rest.

[01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:46.150]
Jar Jar.

[01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:47.790]
They shot the captain.

[01:52:48.190 --> 01:52:49.250]
Who's in charge now?

[01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:51.310]
Lisa, Samson, Samson, Vince!

[01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:53.590]
Lisa, Samson, Father, we're now.

[01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:54.510]
Orton, A.

[01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:56.250]
War is hell.

[01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:59.850]
And so is the very voice of Jar Jar Head.

[01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:02.810]
Lisa, shoot when Lisa says so.

[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.490]
Orton, A.

[01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.850]
Lisa, Rosa, Rosa.

[01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:07.810]
That does it! Shoot this large!

[01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.650]
Oh!

[01:53:09.210 --> 01:53:10.390]
Lisa, heard, Samson!

[01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:11.530]
Jar Jar Head.

[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:14.910]
In theaters Friday, available for rent on Saturday.

[01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:16.390]
How old?

[01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:20.850]
From 1965 to 1960, so anyway, here's this really nice facts from Marie Levine.

[01:53:21.150 --> 01:53:21.910]
And you're saying, who?

[01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:23.610]
Well, he's happens to be a good guy.

[01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:24.070]
Okay.

[01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:25.050]
Take it where it's for.

[01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:28.290]
He was. He was the salesman when I was at WINZ.

[01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:30.730]
And he got screwed over once they sold at the Paxon.

[01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:33.950]
And that Rano Fink Wolf and PD Bulls were in that crowd over there.

[01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:36.010]
They screwed him over big time after the guy had a stroke.

[01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:38.050]
Always get to a guy when he's down, you know?

[01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:40.550]
Anyway, here's the fact that it says, I'm still alive.

[01:53:41.290 --> 01:53:43.870]
They hit him with five shots and he's still alive.

[01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:47.430]
My buddy Stu Smith told me that you and Hank were saying nice things about me the other day.

[01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:51.410]
Yes, I was sales manager at WINZ under Stanley Cohen, a horrible boss.

[01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:52.970]
And let me tell you right now, Marie.

[01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:53.870]
Absolutely correct.

[01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:56.090]
Oh, is he pathetic or what?

[01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:58.150]
Why are you always smitting on the salespeople, Neil?

[01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:59.370]
Why are you always smitting that right?

[01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:01.230]
That was his number one line.

[01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.870]
What a jerk.

[01:54:02.410 --> 01:54:04.710]
But he did drive that big yellow severely, that pimple wheel.

[01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:06.150]
Very classy, Stanley.

[01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:08.030]
Anyway, Stanley J. Cohen, a loser.

[01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:10.750]
I was worried from Margate in those days.

[01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.210]
This is Marie.

[01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:14.690]
During my tenure, I hired Rhonda Wolf, made a name think.

[01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:17.170]
Oh, you see, God was punishing you for having that bitch, Marie.

[01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:20.530]
I left the sellout, sellout, other station.

[01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:23.770]
It was hired back a few years later by Rhonda, who rose to vice president of Paxon.

[01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:29.410]
After my stroke, Rhonda Todd Winnick and Roger Croft decided I was not capable anymore and retired me.

[01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:31.130]
Even though I could still do the job.

[01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:33.150]
I'm still retired and I've been pretty healthy.

[01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:34.170]
Thank goodness for that, Marie.

[01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:38.330]
I missed the radio business and people like you and Hank, regards Marie.

[01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:40.290]
Best of for the new year, Marie.

[01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:42.730]
Happy Chinduka and stay healthy.

[01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:44.170]
And stay out of the business.

[01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:48.670]
He says he misses the business, but quite frankly, it puts people in the box very prematurely.

[01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:49.770]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:53.330]
Andy and Miami Beach says, which is really bogus.

[01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:55.530]
This is sad.

[01:54:56.590 --> 01:54:57.710]
But I'm going to read the whole facts.

[01:54:57.930 --> 01:54:59.010]
It's very, very sad to me.

[01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:01.930]
In fact, I just exchanged emails with Bob Lanciter.

[01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:07.830]
Bob had opened up his blog a few days ago to take messages from people out there in radio land.

[01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:08.870]
And I read them all.

[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:13.870]
And then several were people who listened to this show also and heard me and Bob on the phone whenever it was a couple weeks ago.

[01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:17.290]
And they were, they were, they seemed to be mostly nice.

[01:55:17.490 --> 01:55:20.310]
But it's just, oh, I don't know.

[01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.570]
I'm with you, Blavo.

[01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:22.530]
I agree with you.

[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:28.570]
Anyway, the fact says you complain about the Panthers games on KAT, but their signal is better than QM here in Miami Beach.

[01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:31.590]
Well, maybe that's because the tower is on Miami Beach, Andy.

[01:55:31.930 --> 01:55:34.490]
The only problem is that most people don't live on Miami Beach.

[01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:36.470]
The tower is right over there.

[01:55:36.690 --> 01:55:37.670]
I've released the used to be.

[01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:38.610]
I don't know if it's still there.

[01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:40.930]
I'm gay, a bay road.

[01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:43.670]
Therefore, Matt is similar to WIWD.

[01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:46.590]
Conservative talk in your buddy Art Riley is doing the news there in the morning.

[01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:48.210]
I listen to Michael Savage on that station.

[01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:52.810]
I don't agree with the word he says, but he shows entertaining like what they say about you with talk show host you love to hate.

[01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:55.450]
Michael Savage on I've certifiable Nazi.

[01:55:56.390 --> 01:56:03.310]
I regard Savage as nothing more than entertainers as Andy, a phony whose motivation is monetary within ideological, similar to Russian and Bob Dylan Riley.

[01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:04.590]
Michael Moore, Matt Roger, etc.

[01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:06.690]
Oh, yeah, throw Michael Moore in there for that, right?

[01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:12.990]
I've also been listening to XM since I have a free subscription, and it's true that most of the callers to open Anthony are truckers.

[01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:16.010]
You can tell that they're not used to having so few listeners in callers.

[01:56:16.210 --> 01:56:20.350]
The run and fascia that follows is absolutely terrible, very difficult to listen to.

[01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:20.890]
Absolutely.

[01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:23.390]
Is there any chance you do your show from down here again?

[01:56:23.450 --> 01:56:23.590]
No.

[01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:24.350]
Let me say it again.

[01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.890]
Absolutely.

[01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:25.310]
No.

[01:56:26.250 --> 01:56:28.690]
There's a new hotel here in South Beach called the Sittai.

[01:56:28.690 --> 01:56:31.430]
It's ultra luxurious, blows away the rich, carton down the block.

[01:56:31.810 --> 01:56:33.850]
If you did your show there, I guarantee you never want to leave.

[01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:35.130]
You wouldn't even need a car.

[01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:37.850]
Everything is in walking distance since Andy and I may be.

[01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:41.090]
There are two chances that I will ever do any show from South Road again.

[01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:43.990]
None and much, much, much, much, much, much, much less than none.

[01:56:44.170 --> 01:56:47.790]
Zero, zip any due to, as in, oh, no chance.

[01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:49.550]
Oh, there's more faxes?

[01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:52.850]
There's a pilot in here to that.

[01:56:52.890 --> 01:56:55.230]
This one here, I'm not going to waste my time with this.

[01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:57.430]
Thanks for all you and your board of friends.

[01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:58.090]
Good luck to you.

[01:56:58.170 --> 01:56:58.930]
Okay, I hope you're low.

[01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:01.930]
Hope you both get in a wicked car crash.

[01:57:01.930 --> 01:57:05.810]
I wish you're evil on very few people, only two that I was thinking before, but I got two more.

[01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:11.350]
Here's one that says Melbourne and Palm Bay and Titusville is a barvard.

[01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:12.310]
We hear you loud and clear.

[01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.830]
How do you like that?

[01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:14.110]
A fact from somebody in Melbourne.

[01:57:15.370 --> 01:57:16.090]
Melbourne Beach.

[01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:17.670]
Mike in Melbourne.

[01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:19.930]
Hey, soft one, eggs out.

[01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:20.570]
Nice going, Mike.

[01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:21.510]
Congratulations again.

[01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:36.430]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:37.510]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:37.730]

[01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:37.730]

[01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:38.070]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.070]

[01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.070]

[01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.130]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.130]

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.130]

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.130]

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.130]

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.130]

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.150]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:38.230]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:38.830]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:39.090]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:43.270]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:45.170]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:46.890]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:50.150]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.490]
I'm going to get in there.

[01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:52.170]
It's coming.

[01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.890]
Oh my god.

[01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:54.610]
Alan's right there.

[01:57:55.130 --> 01:57:56.530]
Alan Cohen is behind the stage.

[01:57:56.710 --> 01:57:57.710]
He's got a pay me off to go away.

[01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:00.950]
So I don't say those terrible things about him and the Panthers and Gildey's broadcast.

[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:05.410]
Dave Straider is doing a really nice job if they just shut up in the spot fan.

[01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:06.830]
I hate to keep dwelling on it.

[01:58:07.190 --> 01:58:08.530]
Shut that frog up already.

[01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:09.970]
We can put a sock on his mouth.

[01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:12.190]
Sam Old Craft.

[01:58:13.190 --> 01:58:17.190]
Anyway, here we go from the Indian River County, Viral Beach, Brevard County, Melbourne Palm Bay.

[01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:19.650]
Coco, Titusville Kennedy Space Center.

[01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:23.390]
Happy New Year from the Chronicin Cocoa, where QM comes in just fine.

[01:58:23.490 --> 01:58:24.390]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.910]
I do like that.

[01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:27.570]
The Chronicin Cocoa is one of the most chronic factors in it.

[01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:28.910]
But what a good, good listen.

[01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:30.870]
We should get a little cranky every now and then.

[01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:32.430]
But if that's the one I'm thinking about.

[01:58:33.370 --> 01:58:37.410]
Don't you love that from people I'd like to get cranky on the facts machine.

[01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:39.010]
I'm thinking about that.

[01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:40.330]
That's only a Hector.

[01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:47.270]
Hector must be the one who used to call on IOD and go, did you say to the bird, hey, Hector, get back on your banana boat, okay?

[01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:50.250]
And just kind of drift away with clearance carded.

[01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:52.050]
There's a slip away.

[01:58:52.130 --> 01:58:52.850]
Well, what happened to hell what?

[01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:55.910]
5, 6, 7, or I'm tempted to take a couple of calls.

[01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:58.110]
I must be losing my mind now.

[01:58:58.430 --> 01:59:00.170]
All the facts has got me all whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:03.150]
See, I'm much rather, I think these facts are much more enjoyable.

[01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:04.170]
Is that right?

[01:59:05.210 --> 01:59:05.830]
You don't think so?

[01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:06.890]
No, I gotta go call.

[01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:07.170]
No, I don't call.

[01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:09.730]
Because you can pick and choose.

[01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:11.550]
You'll get a good one after every hundred.

[01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:12.630]
What, the calls?

[01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.990]
Yeah.

[01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:20.190]
Well, yeah, of course it's the 99 bad ones that are really what adds the pizzazz, the spice, the salt and pepper to the whole deal.

[01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:21.730]
That's what they like is a bunch of lunatics.

[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:25.430]
And that's what most people want to hear is people showing their ass on the radio.

[01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:27.530]
Just look at your speaker and you'll see two big fat cheeks.

[01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:28.830]
Right, that's our audience.

[01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:30.750]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[01:59:31.290 --> 01:59:32.290]
Yeah, sir.

[01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:38.690]
Hey, you mentioned about a month ago that, especially on the New Orleans, I know people mentioned New Orleans earlier about the animals and stuff.

[01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:41.110]
I watched part of it.

[01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:42.130]
I couldn't watch any more of it.

[01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:43.610]
Just put it down.

[01:59:43.770 --> 01:59:44.490]
Just pathetic.

[01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:49.730]
And also there was another thing about part of that about what happened there in New Orleans.

[01:59:50.290 --> 01:59:55.350]
They had an engineer saying that they would have spent $2 billion in preventative maintenance and upgrade.

[01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:59.250]
They wouldn't have to be spending $100 billion to rebuild that city.

[01:59:59.810 --> 02:00:01.850]
It's really ridiculous or anything about it.

[02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:06.850]
So short term greed costs this country, you know, billions of dollars.

[02:00:06.850 --> 02:00:13.030]
You know, right in the middle of Hanukkah, we should really reflect if they would have just taken care of the levies things that would have been a hell of a lot better.

[02:00:13.530 --> 02:00:15.470]
One more thing to be on your website.

[02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:18.490]
Ed Naha, he is so funny.

[02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:19.510]
I know you.

[02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:20.410]
He is great.

[02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:22.990]
I read many of his columns on here.

[02:00:23.170 --> 02:00:24.410]
He is saying, plus his name is good.

[02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:26.230]
It's just so funny.

[02:00:26.450 --> 02:00:27.010]
That's our capacity.

[02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:27.710]
Where he is great.

[02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:30.450]
But the thing is that Thompson from Capitol Hill Blue, man.

[02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:31.170]
He's my favorite.

[02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:32.490]
There's just one more little thing.

[02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:36.870]
The thing about impeachment is that the Democrats take over in 2006.

[02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:44.430]
You get rid of Cheney Ambers, and then whoever is the police, would be the new president.

[02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:48.230]
I mean, if we hit the impeachment board.

[02:00:48.230 --> 02:00:48.970]
Get rid of the president.

[02:00:49.590 --> 02:00:51.210]
I read that on one of the stories.

[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:52.010]
That's a great idea.

[02:00:52.530 --> 02:00:53.610]
When does Thompson out?

[02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:56.310]
And then we'll have a cry to hear for the last two years.

[02:00:56.630 --> 02:00:58.510]
Okay. Maybe Greg Reed could be in the cabinet too.

[02:00:58.770 --> 02:00:59.670]
I have a great speaker, pal.

[02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:01.870]
I made it to Kitchen cabinet.

[02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:03.150]
Be a good place to shove his ass.

[02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:04.210]
Nice haircut, by the way.

[02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:05.990]
Greg and our very fancy Brooks Brothers suit.

[02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:07.870]
1227 at QAM.

[02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:10.430]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:14.610]
This is 560 QAF.

[02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:17.510]
Hey, chill.

[02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:19.950]
Absolutely.

[02:01:25.890 --> 02:01:27.650]
Some people don't.

[02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:32.590]
They don't have a clue.

[02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:42.250]
They walk around with their head off their roofs.

[02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:46.690]
It's always the same.

[02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:51.390]
They're just looking for fame.

[02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:56.370]
And they're still the abuse.

[02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:01.390]
Like the chronic thones.

[02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:05.790]
All the chronic thones.

[02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:11.030]
It's the first time the line.

[02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:15.990]
It's because it's a classic dance fish.

[02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:20.490]
With half of its mind.

[02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:26.730]
And then we'll have a look at the whole thing.

[02:02:27.610 --> 02:02:28.990]
We'll be waiting for you here.

[02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:30.830]
Now just come on up with your green Corvette.

[02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:34.010]
We, you and what army of Lil' Yahu is here?

[02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:36.010]
We, all your friends from Carole Boy,

[02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:37.790]
all your friends from Carpet Springs.

[02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:39.730]
Why don't you stand up like on your own?

[02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:41.090]
It's always we, we.

[02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:42.270]
Like you've got all your buddies.

[02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:44.190]
How come you don't like stand on your own thing, man?

[02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:45.450]
We do stand on our own.

[02:02:45.450 --> 02:02:47.210]
No, we, we're, is that we again, man?

[02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:48.750]
Are you speaking French or English?

[02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:52.150]
But you're being in a weed, we, we, I, we are, I, we are.

[02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:53.430]
We are, there we go, we are.

[02:02:53.590 --> 02:02:55.310]
You sound like Dan Klaillow, sir.

[02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:56.530]
You can't even spell us.

[02:02:57.130 --> 02:02:59.250]
You don't want to ask these kids on the radio.

[02:02:59.630 --> 02:02:59.770]
Right.

[02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:01.830]
And you know you don't have to.

[02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:03.050]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:05.350]
You sound like Dan Baby now.

[02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:06.830]
Are you in Lutcher?

[02:03:06.930 --> 02:03:07.790]
Are you an Aintry, sir?

[02:03:07.890 --> 02:03:09.030]
I think you've been up in Aintry, sir.

[02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:11.470]
You want admittedly now, wait till tomorrow.

[02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:13.630]
Some people don't.

[02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:18.350]
They don't have a clue.

[02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:28.190]
They won't go around with their head up their roots.

[02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:32.750]
It's always the same.

[02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:37.350]
They're just looking for fame.

[02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:42.230]
And there's only abuse.

[02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:47.210]
Like the chronic sound moves.

[02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:51.930]
These are chronic sound moves.

[02:03:51.930 --> 02:03:52.250]
You can't even sing.

[02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.250]

[02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:55.590]
You can't even sing.

[02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:58.890]
You can't even sing.

[02:03:58.910 --> 02:04:03.910]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:11.330]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:16.930 --> 02:04:19.930]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:39.590]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:39.590]

[02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:39.590]

[02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:39.590]

[02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:42.890]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:42.890 --> 02:04:43.710]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:44.930]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:50.210]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:56.890]
You can't even sing.

[02:04:56.890 --> 02:04:57.650]
Do they get us bored?

[02:04:57.930 --> 02:04:58.610]
They've got us out there.

[02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:05.710]
Why don't you know why don't you know what Christians superpowers do?

[02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:07.230]
Do they hollage of the fish?

[02:05:07.810 --> 02:05:09.270]
I'm looking at a big truck.

[02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:14.070]
Why don't you know why don't you know what Christians superpowers?

[02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:19.170]
To the seven yeet and sit back down again in you

[02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:23.070]
And watch it all down with the twelve-hundred-fruits

[02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:27.750]
In the life of boredom of the heaven you go

[02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:30.930]
I only smile upon the morning

[02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:32.070]
What word did you say?

[02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:39.270]
I love to know what to know what to know

[02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:40.150]
I love to know what to know

[02:05:40.150 --> 02:05:43.930]
I love to know what to know what to know

[02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:58.570]
Some of those bits are much fun

[02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:02.450]
I love to know what to know what to know

[02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:03.370]
I love to know what to know what to know

[02:06:03.370 --> 02:06:05.270]
I love to know what to know what to know

[02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:07.870]
I love to know what to know

[02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:28.550]
I love to know what to know

[02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:31.090]
We're not getting married or anything

[02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:32.450]
But I mean why do you keep saying I do?

[02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:33.630]
You do know who that is?

[02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:35.550]
Yeah, you learn a little like personally

[02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:36.490]
Is he a boy or no?

[02:06:36.490 --> 02:06:37.110]
I don't know, personally

[02:06:37.110 --> 02:06:38.270]
I just know who that is

[02:06:39.010 --> 02:06:42.270]
A.J. Nicholson has not been charged and is cooperating with Hollywood police

[02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:43.430]
While investigation continues

[02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:45.670]
He said Detective Carlos Negoron

[02:06:45.670 --> 02:06:47.890]
Around three o'clock this morning a woman called a police

[02:06:47.890 --> 02:06:49.790]
And reported Nicholson had just raped it at her

[02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:52.490]
At the west of the Nipple that resort in Spawn Hollywood Beach

[02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:54.550]
The only thing we have is an allegation

[02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:56.290]
Nicholson came here and gave a statement

[02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:58.670]
As to what happened, Negoron said the victim is also cooperating

[02:06:58.670 --> 02:07:02.130]
She was taken to the sexual assault treatment center for Lauderdale for testing

[02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:05.310]
Nicholson is the leading tachyra for FSU

[02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:08.430]
Which is in town preparing for next week's orange bullet contest against state pen

[02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:13.130]
FSU coach Bobby Bowden said he sent Nicholson home for an unspecified rule violation

[02:07:13.130 --> 02:07:14.190]
He sent him home

[02:07:14.710 --> 02:07:17.110]
Nicholson walked in voluntarily met with Hollywood detectives

[02:07:17.110 --> 02:07:19.810]
Without having an attorney present as he answered questions, Negoron said

[02:07:19.810 --> 02:07:21.570]
We talked to Mr. Nicholson and let him go

[02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:23.870]
We have no problem causing this time to make an arrest

[02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:27.530]
Investigators are still talking to witnesses and gathering evidence including DNA

[02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:29.950]
Which is typically a lengthy process

[02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:32.310]
Nicholson is a senior and a starter for FSU

[02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:35.730]
Which went eight and a four while winning the Atlantic Coast Conference championship this season

[02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:38.730]
And didn't they beat the hurricanes in the opening game in the season seems to me

[02:07:38.730 --> 02:07:41.070]
Even though FSU is marginal at best, yeah they did

[02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:44.890]
How do you like that? That's kind of embarrassing what seemed to me if I was a hurricane fan

[02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:48.870]
And then of course they lost a Georgia Tech which is really direct, you know

[02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:51.590]
And I'm telling you there's another fact you just sat

[02:07:54.490 --> 02:07:56.570]
Oh I don't think I want to talk about that

[02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:58.570]
Do you? No

[02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:01.290]
Well they might be running spots on this thing

[02:08:01.290 --> 02:08:05.690]
You know I understand that this is somebody's upset but it's like somebody that's in business

[02:08:05.690 --> 02:08:08.130]
We don't care who it is even if there's a bigger strikers in the world

[02:08:08.130 --> 02:08:09.370]
The new attitude of beesleases

[02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:11.070]
If they're in business so we love them

[02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:13.670]
We lucky lucky like we love McDonald's

[02:08:13.670 --> 02:08:15.490]
We love don't even love Brandsmart

[02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:16.090]
We love everybody

[02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:17.770]
Right? Yeah

[02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:18.810]
Oh yeah

[02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:22.350]
If they're in business we love you, we love you, we love you

[02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:25.150]
Just like Barbara Stuttley and the Jewish people

[02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:27.090]
I love my love, my love, oh boy

[02:08:27.090 --> 02:08:31.590]
When I write my book I'm gonna have a big chapter about that that whole stunt on WS News years ago

[02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:35.690]
They were priming that bitch to run for Congress

[02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:40.290]
She was gonna run for political office and she was just the whole routine was on the other

[02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:43.110]
This right wing nasty, nasty, hateful, foamy bitch

[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:47.190]
Suck it up to the Jews with Israel this and the Jewish people

[02:08:47.190 --> 02:08:49.410]
I love my love and then I started making fun of her

[02:08:49.410 --> 02:08:52.010]
And Luke Krohn just about had a fart attack right in his orifice

[02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:54.410]
Man, what a joke

[02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:56.770]
The kind of crap that goes on

[02:08:56.770 --> 02:08:58.850]
Just remember one thing on you kids out there

[02:08:58.850 --> 02:09:00.390]
What you see is not what you get

[02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:01.770]
What you hear is not what you get

[02:09:01.770 --> 02:09:03.870]
Most of it 90% of it is BS

[02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:06.350]
Okay, bull crap, BS is in Barbara Stuttley

[02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:08.170]
That's she put the BS in BS

[02:09:09.090 --> 02:09:10.810]
Of course nobody knows who that is no more

[02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:12.510]
Well that's a long time ago baby

[02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:14.050]
What would ever happen to her?

[02:09:14.690 --> 02:09:17.770]
I wonder if she's still hanging out around Senator Hill from a high a Leah

[02:09:17.770 --> 02:09:18.650]
Senator Hill?

[02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:21.230]
Well I could tell you some real juicy stories baby

[02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:24.310]
So could Jerry Williams if he was still alive but nevertheless

[02:09:25.670 --> 02:09:27.130]
All those right wingers man

[02:09:27.130 --> 02:09:29.430]
All those goody two shoes and fetus huggers

[02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:31.090]
And they're holier than all the rest of us

[02:09:31.090 --> 02:09:32.370]
Liberal perverts and young

[02:09:32.370 --> 02:09:34.810]
And they're all the biggest bunch of phonies man

[02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:35.950]
They're all doing everybody

[02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:37.910]
They're doing like fire hydrants and trees

[02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:41.250]
And little puppies anything that moves or is like can't get away

[02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:42.750]
Wow

[02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:44.410]
Tree stumps

[02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:48.250]
Sure stumps the heart of me

[02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:49.970]
Why some of these people ever put on the air

[02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:52.390]
I love the Jewish people I love my love

[02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:54.050]
And talk about phony and transparada

[02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:56.150]
And all the old Jews they were crawling from her

[02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:58.110]
Oh she's so wonderful, she loves Israel

[02:09:58.110 --> 02:09:58.670]
Yeah

[02:09:59.370 --> 02:10:01.110]
She puts your ass in the oven faster

[02:10:01.110 --> 02:10:02.770]
And then you can say where's my early bird

[02:10:03.230 --> 02:10:04.610]
Anyway we already got on the pole

[02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:07.390]
Where's my teeth and my early bird

[02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:11.370]
Well in fact that's a drop and I haven't played in a long time

[02:10:13.190 --> 02:10:13.950]
There it is

[02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:16.270]
I have no tamarice I have no teeth

[02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:17.530]
Not that it was worth a big deal

[02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:20.830]
What's your number one wish for the next for the new year 2006

[02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:22.350]
And by the way happy new year to all

[02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:25.870]
Even those people we hate like poison and who ate me like amorous

[02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:27.730]

They have lots of 6 63 all of our troops come home only 39

[02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:37.210]
That should have a zero average and be 3090

[02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:38.210]
Wouldn't you agree?

[02:10:38.670 --> 02:10:38.770]
Yes

[02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:42.930]

They sent him to a priest retreat where the genupt led them prey.

[02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:20.830]
If it was you or it was me, they blocked us up and threw the keys away.

[02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:23.490]
Father O too, amen.

[02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:35.790]

[02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:53.150]
either one of those, they're like, I don't even, I'm not even reading it, I'm tearing it up.

[02:13:53.210 --> 02:13:59.470]
It's really sad and then one thing about this business is people like you despise, people who are extremely annoying, they just won't go away.

[02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:03.570]
Go away, have a bad car crash, don't get her too bad or maybe the opposite.

[02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:07.670]
In the 50s, Robert Young made people laugh and Father knows best.

[02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:15.590]
Now, this great series is back, starring a few Catholic priests who like it young in the return of Father knows best.

[02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:17.450]
Step into the confessional Billy.

[02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:21.430]
I don't know, Father, this makes the 47th time I've been in there this week.

[02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:23.690]
Oh, Billy, I want to be a good Catholic, don't you?

[02:14:23.950 --> 02:14:25.810]
Yeah, but does everybody get a spanking?

[02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:28.570]
Father knows best.

[02:14:28.570 --> 02:14:33.190]
It's the Vatican's best kept secret and you've got a private see for all the fun.

[02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:35.350]
Just enter the rectory from the rear.

[02:14:35.590 --> 02:14:38.310]
Alright, Billy boy, it's time for your flute lesson.

[02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:41.770]
But Father, your flute has only one role and it doesn't make any noise.

[02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:43.730]
Oh, it will, Billy, it will!

[02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:51.010]
Father knows best. Once you've seen this new sitcom, you'll wonder why you've never heard about it.

[02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:52.690]
Let me introduce you to Saint Peter.

[02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:56.010]
Father knows best.

[02:14:56.250 --> 02:15:01.090]
Going to church may not seem very entertaining, but there really is something funny going on here.

[02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:04.730]
Tired of the same boring old communion wafers at holiday mass?

[02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:08.070]
Open wide and prepare to receive thy savior.

[02:15:08.230 --> 02:15:10.890]
Oh, Jesus, Father, O Mali, wafers again!

[02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:13.010]
Now, Billy, this isn't just any wafers.

[02:15:13.090 --> 02:15:13.550]
It's not?

[02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:20.590]
No, through the divine miracle of transubstantiation, I've turned this ordinary wafers into the divine blessed body of Christ.

[02:15:20.590 --> 02:15:23.650]
Well, why does a body of Christ have to taste so yucky?

[02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:26.850]
Spice up your next communion with new Christ Aroni.

[02:15:27.250 --> 02:15:33.950]
Christ Aroni is a special blend of rice, spices and seasonings, plus a bit of the body of Christ in every fluffy forkful.

[02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:37.650]
And Christ Aroni cooks up perfect every time, as he should.

[02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:40.130]
Hmm, can I have some more Christ's Father?

[02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:41.610]
That's Christ Aroni, Billy.

[02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:42.770]
Amen to that!

[02:15:43.090 --> 02:15:45.630]
Christ Aroni, the transubstantiation tree.

[02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:49.510]
Hail God!

[02:15:53.630 --> 02:15:57.690]
There he was just a walkin' on the sea sand.

[02:15:58.130 --> 02:16:00.970]
You I did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:16:01.630 --> 02:16:05.370]
He's a man from the land of the valley sand.

[02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:08.810]
You I did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:16:08.810 --> 02:16:14.950]
He's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good.

[02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:16.650]
He's his water, and you're one.

[02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:21.010]
The next thing I knew we had a layman on his feet sand.

[02:16:21.490 --> 02:16:24.530]
You I did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:28.910]
The fine not gonna see, and the dumb are gonna speak sand.

[02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:32.410]
You I did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:16:32.490 --> 02:16:38.350]
He walked on, walked on, to my dark, my dark, walked on, to my dark.

[02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:40.870]
He cared a lot for source.

[02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:47.710]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, some say he's the son of God.

[02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:55.250]
Yes, they do, but there's other people to give.

[02:16:55.510 --> 02:17:00.310]
So I, now he's the reason that we have any today sing.

[02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:03.850]
And do I, did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:08.310]
And he's the reason that all the Christians pray sing.

[02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:11.710]
And do I, did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:15.630]
They praise him, praise him, heal down, heal down.

[02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:19.570]
Praise him, and heal down the man who wore a thorny crown.

[02:17:20.430 --> 02:17:23.530]
You I did it, did it, done, did it, do.

[02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:26.950]
Do I, did it, did it, done, do.

[02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:30.430]
Do I, did it, did it, done.

[02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:32.010]
He's the is your heart.

[02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:34.790]
Do I, did it,, done, did it do.

[02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:35.310]
He's the Jew.

[02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:38.630]
Do I, did it, did it, done, dheterg you.

[02:17:38.630 --> 02:17:39.290]
He's the W Villager.

[02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:44.210]
He's the chosen Man.

[02:17:44.210 --> 02:17:46.350]
Do, do, do, do.

[02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:49.250]
Do, do, do, do.

[02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:53.750]
Do, do, do, do.

[02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:56.110]
He endlessी r caped.

[02:17:57.590 --> 02:17:59.790]
Jesus is back in the old days.

[02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:04.570]
Oh yeah, Jesus is in the old days.

[02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:06.990]
Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:07.170]

[02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:07.170]

[02:18:10.170 --> 02:18:13.790]
No one has been spreading heart.

[02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:15.950]
No one has been spreading heart.

[02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:16.350]
No one has been spreading heart.

[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:16.630]
No one has been spreading heart.

[02:18:17.730 --> 02:18:20.750]
No one has been spreading heart.

[02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:23.290]
Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:27.070]
Oh yeah, Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:31.530]
Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:32.330]
Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:35.510]
Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:35.510 --> 02:18:43.330]
Oh yeah, Jesus is doing alright.

[02:18:45.210 --> 02:18:46.310]
Oh, right!

[02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:49.750]
No one is what the created say.

[02:18:50.290 --> 02:18:53.330]
No one is what the created say.

[02:18:54.050 --> 02:18:57.270]
Jesus has had a big baby baby.

[02:18:57.770 --> 02:19:00.570]
Jesus, you're in all that fire.

[02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:05.510]
We're words on our sin.

[02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:09.070]
The opposite is like to God in San Francisco, for goodness.

[02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:12.450]
You, the passion of the mold.

[02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:15.930]
Oh, Lord, easy with that whip.

[02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:18.690]
Oh, Lord, that way you're more on.

[02:19:19.510 --> 02:19:23.210]
I do well. I'll get you quite a white cow dragging this cross around.

[02:19:23.530 --> 02:19:25.270]
I'll have a toned body at no time.

[02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:27.250]
And then I'm gonna marvel at you.

[02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:30.950]
Oh, Lord, when you're so angry about anyway, I'm throwing this for you.

[02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.810]
Too big to do.

[02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:33.470]
Oh, Lord, Lord.

[02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:35.470]
Boy, this is some finish pie.

[02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:37.370]
Hey, buddy, public side, this is something.

[02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:37.610]
Yeah.

[02:19:37.810 --> 02:19:39.450]
I'll just shut up and get you something to drink.

[02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:40.850]
Okay, here.

[02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:44.450]
What is that?

[02:19:44.730 --> 02:19:45.910]
That's how I run a beer.

[02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:47.070]
Get away from me.

[02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.830]
I'd rather get wet.

[02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:49.330]
Oh, boy.

[02:19:49.930 --> 02:19:51.710]
That looks like a nice place to put a rubber.

[02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:53.310]
Yeah, you got a nice view.

[02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:54.990]
Lord, I'll get the hammer in the nails.

[02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:55.590]
Who?

[02:19:56.010 --> 02:19:56.970]
You guys know what you're doing.

[02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:58.010]
Pulling them all?

[02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:59.590]
Just put your hands out like this.

[02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:01.270]
No, no, no.

[02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.810]
Pulling them all.

[02:20:01.930 --> 02:20:02.890]
Between the bones.

[02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:04.230]
Between the bones.

[02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:06.430]
Get it in the meat, boy, yeah.

[02:20:06.430 --> 02:20:08.690]
Here, I got his feet with them again.

[02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:09.210]
Like this.

[02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:11.290]
Lord, Lord.

[02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:12.930]
Lord, Lord, Lord.

[02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:14.110]
Now see here.

[02:20:14.390 --> 02:20:15.630]
Ain't you got no stick matter?

[02:20:16.050 --> 02:20:16.970]
Only if I got it.

[02:20:17.310 --> 02:20:18.430]
But I really don't want it.

[02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:19.770]
Because you got a half stick matter.

[02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:21.010]
Yes, you really got it, buddy.

[02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:22.230]
You got a half stick matter.

[02:20:22.530 --> 02:20:23.470]
You really got a father.

[02:20:23.650 --> 02:20:24.690]
You got a father.

[02:20:25.090 --> 02:20:26.070]
You really got a father.

[02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.150]
You really got a father.

[02:20:26.170 --> 02:20:26.170]

[02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:27.410]
You really got a father.

[02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:29.610]
All right, yeah, knuckleheads.

[02:20:29.770 --> 02:20:30.950]
Now put me like a hanna caboo.

[02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:34.650]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:36.250]
I said, do I care, though?

[02:20:36.570 --> 02:20:39.050]
Well, you can see the back of the Chinese restaurant

[02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:40.990]
in the Fasmayas deli.

[02:20:41.170 --> 02:20:42.410]
When you arrive in the year.

[02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:44.770]
Well, according to my weekly schedule,

[02:20:45.010 --> 02:20:47.150]
I've got three days to judge more on his life.

[02:20:47.410 --> 02:20:49.870]
You end there then in 2000 years or so.

[02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:52.610]
From now on, I'm coming back again as an all-iterate retard.

[02:20:53.010 --> 02:20:54.130]
We'll eat the free wolf.

[02:20:54.730 --> 02:20:55.110]
I did.

[02:20:55.350 --> 02:20:56.310]
Not a fourth anymore.

[02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:58.810]
Step back and mutton heads them rising right now.

[02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:04.730]
From the makers of the passion of the Christ comes.

[02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:08.750]
Passion of the Christ on ice.

[02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:13.270]
All the violence of the movie you loved,

[02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:14.810]
but with a triple-axle crucifixion.

[02:21:16.470 --> 02:21:19.610]
See, Collins of graceful Roman soldiers

[02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:23.230]
whipping and weaving around a magnificent messiah.

[02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:25.090]
New York Times reports,

[02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:27.870]
these skaters really nailed this one.

[02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:30.190]
And USA Today says,

[02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:34.470]
jumping Jesus Christ on ice is cold-blooded fun.

[02:21:34.530 --> 02:21:38.830]
Bring the kids to witness and savior each moment they cross.

[02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:40.610]
The grace, the glory,

[02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:44.390]
and the suffering of Christ on ice.

[02:21:45.010 --> 02:21:46.870]
All the ice members make for it.

[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:48.670]
It's nausea, dizziness, death, or resurrection.

[02:21:48.930 --> 02:21:49.550]
Oh, yeah.

[02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.650]
I'm going to go.

[02:21:54.450 --> 02:21:57.530]
Take people out across the country.

[02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:01.630]
Find out the female gift of Santa's land.

[02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:03.870]
And as I'm on tour to Egypt,

[02:22:04.170 --> 02:22:05.050]
they will tell us,

[02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:06.610]
please, I keep them telling them,

[02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:08.290]
all the fun they've sent.

[02:22:09.430 --> 02:22:12.170]
And no business will want to do the trick.

[02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:16.190]
Not one has to be changed.

[02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:20.130]
No girls will win the league.

[02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:24.150]
No big brothers or specials are fed.

[02:22:24.490 --> 02:22:27.070]
But people born into their lonely sweats.

[02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:31.230]
The breaking dark stops is records.

[02:22:32.390 --> 02:22:34.550]
So I'll across the USA.

[02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:39.990]
In Texas, no need for the hits and that is no implications.

[02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:41.730]
No need for what I'm going.

[02:22:42.890 --> 02:22:46.390]
Not one has to be changed.

[02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:50.050]
No girls will win the league.

[02:22:51.290 --> 02:22:54.210]
No big brothers or specials are fed.

[02:22:54.490 --> 02:22:57.010]
But people born into their lonely sweats.

[02:22:57.450 --> 02:22:58.350]
It's still moving.

[02:22:58.730 --> 02:23:01.950]
Everyone is talking about the controversial story.

[02:23:02.110 --> 02:23:04.090]
At the final days of Donald Trump,

[02:23:04.310 --> 02:23:05.510]
at his 12th of a predecessor,

[02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:08.010]
the passion of the Donald.

[02:23:09.310 --> 02:23:12.050]
People, tonight somebody is going to betray you.

[02:23:12.210 --> 02:23:16.430]
The passion of the Donald triumphantly chronicles the last forward maybe.

[02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:21.250]
Olmerosa, you mean to tell me that you betrayed me for 30 pieces of silver.

[02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:24.370]
You could have easily gotten three times that much.

[02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:26.550]
Olmerosa, you're fired.

[02:23:26.770 --> 02:23:27.850]
The passion of the Donald.

[02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:30.550]
He may be whipped, but he's never defeated.

[02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:33.190]
I've always fantasized about you whipping me.

[02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:34.870]
But if you're going to work for me,

[02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:37.450]
you will have to hit a lot harder than that.

[02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:39.490]
Katrina, you're fired.

[02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:42.970]
Don't miss the awe-inspiring conclusion out.

[02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:45.070]
The passion of the Donald.

[02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:49.490]
When one lesser of a premise finally nails down the job.

[02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:54.390]
Bill Kwame, it's time to decide who goes up to the heavenly suite

[02:23:54.390 --> 02:23:56.130]
and who goes down to the street.

[02:23:56.550 --> 02:24:01.590]
But to find out, you'll have to endure something far more painful than crucifixion.

[02:24:02.050 --> 02:24:03.430]
A two-hour life finale.

[02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:04.910]
The passion of the Donald.

[02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:06.790]
If you don't see it.

[02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:07.490]
You're fired.

[02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:09.310]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[02:24:09.310 --> 02:24:11.330]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:15.310]
This is 5.62.8.

[02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:19.670]
I owe my favorite Republican.

[02:24:19.970 --> 02:24:20.790]
This is Matt Rodge.

[02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:24.350]
And it's time for the most cute bear plowing.

[02:24:24.890 --> 02:24:27.590]
It's time once again for the Neil Rogers.

[02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:28.230]
One to two.

[02:24:28.290 --> 02:24:28.610]
Power.

[02:24:30.890 --> 02:24:33.170]
Tonight on Celebrity Pover.

[02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:37.530]
This will be the importance of the gypsies in the pod.

[02:24:37.930 --> 02:24:38.610]
Now, Dragon.

[02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.930]
Joe.

[02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:40.970]
Al Pacino.

[02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.830]
You're famous.

[02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.850]
Justin Loveson.

[02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:45.610]
And the famous Melah Arthur Bulls.

[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:46.310]
Alright, right.

[02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:47.490]
Let's take a look.

[02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.230]

[02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:51.150]
What are you betting, Alan?

[02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:52.110]
Six thousand dollars.

[02:24:52.430 --> 02:24:57.370]
I call you Alan because I am Al.

[02:24:57.810 --> 02:24:59.530]
I don't care who you are.

[02:24:59.910 --> 02:25:00.510]
You're famous.

[02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:02.190]
Now, how much?

[02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:03.830]
Six thousand dollars.

[02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:05.010]
It's an awful lot of money.

[02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:06.210]
What are you going to do about it?

[02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:06.930]
You fairy.

[02:25:07.390 --> 02:25:09.130]
Tell me what you got, Jason.

[02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:11.570]
You're...

[02:25:12.350 --> 02:25:15.510]
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.

[02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:17.630]
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.

[02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:18.730]
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.

[02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:23.490]
All this spends an excitement you can expect from low-budget, dumb-down-televensions.

[02:25:23.730 --> 02:25:24.830]
Like this viewer here.

[02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.250]
That was funny.

[02:25:27.250 --> 02:25:31.190]
Oh God, I want to die.

[02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:37.470]
Become freshy jello in a chair with celebrity poker on ESPU.

[02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:57.290]
The white house knows that truth is coming near.

[02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:01.410]
So they'll make up some brand new terror scare.

[02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:06.010]
It is wish-tru that maybe work alone on this smear.

[02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:10.170]
Wonder why you're keeping all the more here and there.

[02:26:10.410 --> 02:26:14.270]
Really, what you're stealing, cause I need to know.

[02:26:15.290 --> 02:26:18.290]
Prosecutor, what kind of curb will you throw?

[02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:19.510]
I need to know.

[02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:21.730]
I need to know.

[02:26:22.930 --> 02:26:26.670]
Tell me, have this girl come, I need to know.

[02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:27.890]
I need to know.

[02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:29.930]
Who's next to go?

[02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:34.990]
This sounds worse than with Clinton at last just a fool.

[02:26:44.310 --> 02:26:50.850]
And sometimes they see that we're lacking in the form.

[02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:58.110]
They probably had my side, we'll be you by the throne.

[02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:03.850]
You say, you say.

[02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:13.150]
Is the one who gets now they have only one.

[02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:20.350]
They say to them, don't worry about soon gone.

[02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:26.430]
We got it, I'll be your puppy and say, you got it.

[02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:30.390]
We know the tech is the most you got it.

[02:27:30.390 --> 02:27:32.790]
Where is my king?

[02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:41.450]
Mission 911 is what they got you to believe.

[02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:49.670]
Can't get anybody but a home party called to believe.

[02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:59.370]
You do this, what they say, like a girl, like a Christmas horse.

[02:27:59.370 --> 02:28:09.190]
A fool has a human has a nation, a sterile state, so they're full with truth.

[02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:13.530]
I'll be your legend, though, we got it.

[02:28:14.430 --> 02:28:17.670]
Don't you see that it's a game with you got it?

[02:28:18.650 --> 02:28:21.790]
Get down on your knees, you got it.

[02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:44.830]
We know the clan deproves in the south.

[02:28:45.130 --> 02:28:48.150]
We've died on deep brides, spotted out.

[02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:52.690]
We love to flee the dirt and end the campaign.

[02:28:55.150 --> 02:29:00.850]
We pray a lot in church, about who to next best merge.

[02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:05.970]
And remember only you this half is free.

[02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:19.550]
Just the hell is on attack, he hates the night sky, cuz it's black and all the Joneses are new poster days.

[02:29:21.010 --> 02:29:32.930]
We saw the hell above, saw the seven hundred clubs, and I think that that you can't even watch his name.

[02:29:33.930 --> 02:29:39.090]
We leave way right, and need a chance.

[02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:46.450]
We find a portion of the planet, and then we leave like a door.

[02:29:47.310 --> 02:29:52.290]
We're mostly white, and sperm retention.

[02:29:53.850 --> 02:29:58.830]
Here's our big bag, a dead elf, cause we leave way right.

[02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:15.670]
And we all look and rest the same, and hate the gaze, and she's the same, and fear the things that we don't understand.

[02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:29.250]
Rectonics then was like us, while his face could stop the bus, so I think we all should give her a dick a hand.

[02:30:31.090 --> 02:30:37.650]
And 96 will be in swing, and be for them like a Rodney King.

[02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:42.130]
We'll dump the red and blue, just keep the white.

[02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:50.010]
A black limbo, spread a string, just don't let death near your plate.

[02:30:50.850 --> 02:30:55.510]
And hope there's no more books for him to write.

[02:30:56.510 --> 02:31:01.730]
We leave way right, and need a chance.

[02:31:02.810 --> 02:31:09.170]
We find a portion of the planet, and then we leave like a door.

[02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:14.910]
We're mostly white, and sperm retention.

[02:31:16.470 --> 02:31:21.530]
Here's our big bag, a dead elf, cause we leave way right.

[02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:29.290]
We're starting out there, they say they'll keep up all their injuries.

[02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:37.950]
Until they expose all the secrecy, till they're not hearing what they want to hear.

[02:31:38.930 --> 02:31:44.590]
There's no one top while under open air, is it truly FBI?

[02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:50.510]
I knew about the press, the CIA made judgments that they now regret.

[02:31:51.110 --> 02:32:00.130]
Both the anti-terrorism policies, we just need more answers from the men who's keeping me to know.

[02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:07.270]
We need to know what Bush knew of our 911 we need to know.

[02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:10.570]
We need to know what we need to know.

[02:32:10.650 --> 02:32:15.950]
Who got red foot, Bush knew of our 911 we need to know.

[02:32:25.390 --> 02:32:31.950]
We need again, if we don't find a way,

[02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:37.270]
From the Bush court till then left us all the way.

[02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:38.930]
I'm starting out here.

[02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:46.910]
We fall, bring to blinds to cold, and ones are to be.

[02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:51.970]
There's a bomb struck from the stars from far away.

[02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:58.470]
Maybe we should have paid attention, a little bit more,

[02:32:58.950 --> 02:33:01.430]
To the facts we chose to ignore.

[02:33:02.450 --> 02:33:09.010]
Surprise the gaffer's seek long, but I'm afraid there's a lot more fear than we want.

[02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:19.850]
We need again, with our hope that by then, civil rights will be restored.

[02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:31.710]
We need again, if we don't find a way,

[02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:36.990]
From the Bush court till then left us all the way.

[02:33:38.930 --> 02:33:48.750]
We need again, with our hope that by then, civil rights will be restored.

[02:33:49.410 --> 02:33:49.830]
We need again, with our hope that by then, civil rights will be restored.

[02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:00.410]
All right.

When the lot of 97 have a lot of sex, 76, lots, Democrats, sweep elections, 73, all the troops come home, 47, good health, 46, get a better job, 19, peace, honor, at 17, the erudges show get syndicated, 15, put, put, put, and rick back on your 14.

[02:37:09.150 --> 02:37:14.930]
Pink Floyd, union, 8, Joyce gets fired, it ended, 7, oh, halloween, I'd have a party in my pants.

[02:37:14.930 --> 02:37:29.370]
Getting a raise, 7, QAim gets sold and the ill gets paid off, 6, get a divorce by no more a mole, only one, and getting a good GM at QAim, I guess they realize it's hopeless, it's useless, Gournish, Kelfin, none.

[02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:32.130]
This is the Bay of the Evil Rogers.

[02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:35.910]
This is 516 QA.

[02:37:36.850 --> 02:37:51.050]
If anybody has a opinion, dissenting from our way, will face your name and do the same stuff, I've been a me of the stage.

[02:37:52.050 --> 02:38:05.790]
Don't even bother to question, just follow Undo's faith, everybody's standing by this, lashes you assay.

[02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:21.550]
In the act of patriotism, you're watching all of you, everyone does a speech and so far what do you do?

[02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:36.130]
This is this formation, undol you rightly lose, in push for the landation, that's as you assay.

[02:38:36.130 --> 02:38:51.010]
You gotta hate those two, and clint and zip our rose to, believe everything we've had in you, undestate run you.

[02:38:52.990 --> 02:39:06.210]
Bloodwater for cornbread, fill up your escalade, a roof and chainy bush venue, that's as you assay.

[02:39:07.690 --> 02:39:21.990]
We don't mind you see our jobs grow, a wider economy's grow, we're fascinated by jail, no reason to stupid food.

[02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:36.510]
All the water is free of being, the facts of hydrogen waste, and everybody's earning taxes, like us you assay.

[02:39:44.370 --> 02:39:51.270]
Back in the day when someone was wrong, we didn't take their crap.

[02:39:51.770 --> 02:40:04.830]
In Pearl Harbor, when the jobs dropped their bonds, we found them bad, and now the Saudis made it aside, and on our cards our little flags weighed.

[02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:11.930]
As that Saudi love and retard voice of bombers, the wrong way.

[02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:29.930]
And our embarrassed to be in America, where they found logo like cheese, the United States of arrogance, and by bush and its fantasy, breathing at this country.

[02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:43.890]
Embarrassed to the orchestras and our history, I don't want to be a taxamerican, in the USA.

[02:40:48.730 --> 02:40:55.310]
What's a few thousand innocent lives, stop living in the past.

[02:40:56.110 --> 02:41:02.170]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.

[02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:06.570]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:17.150]
They train us to believe, and anyone who says that obviously, enter for to be.

[02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:26.650]
And our embarrassed to be in America, where we take three hours in please.

[02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:34.210]
We the flag in one hand, with our head in the sand, and finally follow the powers that we have ascetic.

[02:41:35.210 --> 02:41:44.210]
Watching state produce on a 65 in screens, scratcher, find everything's okay.

[02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:50.410]
In England, USA, or will find.

[02:41:54.990 --> 02:42:01.270]
The Middle Eastern world will be its noted, subdominant people killed.

[02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:12.110]
With the gas that we sold him, first time agressoration, and the only one that's going, now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[02:42:12.570 --> 02:42:17.170]
Forget about Korea and the noose they're totalling at us.

[02:42:17.170 --> 02:42:23.650]
Right wing is drilling it over and over into our head.

[02:42:24.130 --> 02:42:29.950]
That iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:43.150]
3000 people killed.

[02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:46.710]
I now forgot, let's exploit them instead.

[02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:49.390]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in.

[02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:51.410]
Going after satan too.

[02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:53.170]
Plankado's Sama.

[02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:57.330]
There's no longer mention of the name in London.

[02:42:57.330 --> 02:42:59.750]
But no one seems concerned all.

[02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:05.470]
Come be in complacence, believe in every word of this cartel administration.

[02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:16.830]
I control this by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our head.

[02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:23.170]
That iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:38.130]
The loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying.

[02:43:38.490 --> 02:43:42.130]
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.

[02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:44.070]
I have nothing to hide.

[02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:46.330]
Cable talkers all are saying.

[02:43:46.830 --> 02:43:50.230]
I know media and cattle don't have any reservations.

[02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:52.490]
South of the Gopus family.

[02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:54.830]
World of Nilelicians.

[02:43:55.050 --> 02:43:56.470]
Old regimes must fall.

[02:43:56.690 --> 02:44:00.630]
Then have a merchant installed with no objection at all.

[02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:10.890]
Then the craft don't have the ball and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our brainwash pants.

[02:44:10.890 --> 02:44:16.210]
I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.590]
Absolutely.

[02:44:18.510 --> 02:44:24.410]
Only I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:27.690]
I'm dying over here.

[02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:35.330]
You know, some of these things needed to be, that's the only reason we really needed to be syndicated just to play the bits.

[02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:36.910]
I agree.

[02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:37.710]
Like that one.

[02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:39.250]
It's criminal.

[02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:42.010]
Absolutely criminal.

[02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:43.490]
Here we sit playing the same stuff.

[02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:45.190]
I'm not, you know, thank goodness for the audience.

[02:44:45.390 --> 02:44:47.790]
But the same people here in the same stuff over and over again.

[02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:51.490]
And there are millions of people out there who just be, they be scratching their ass.

[02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:54.810]
They be scratching each other's privates here in this stuff.

[02:44:55.710 --> 02:44:59.950]
Because more, just like this jackass that sends me the facts about all the great right wing or stuff,

[02:45:00.130 --> 02:45:01.070]
he didn't even know he disagrees.

[02:45:01.330 --> 02:45:01.930]
I'm K.T.

[02:45:02.390 --> 02:45:03.190]
Yamama, okay.

[02:45:03.370 --> 02:45:03.770]
You idiot.

[02:45:04.090 --> 02:45:04.730]
You quizzling.

[02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.630]
You ferr.

[02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.890]
Yeah.

[02:45:07.250 --> 02:45:09.050]
All the good Nazis all the time.

[02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:11.250]
And of course it's Stushstick and an year right.

[02:45:12.430 --> 02:45:14.430]
Like that jackass that called a couple weeks ago.

[02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:16.690]
And Merry Christmas remember the guy was using this as a weapon.

[02:45:16.970 --> 02:45:17.470]
Like a catcher.

[02:45:17.650 --> 02:45:18.510]
I said, I guess what?

[02:45:18.690 --> 02:45:20.470]
Happy Hanukkah and Happy New Year.

[02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:20.910]
Gotcha.

[02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:25.470]
Before they could reach for the dialogue, got him.

[02:45:25.690 --> 02:45:26.710]
And happy Kwanza.

[02:45:26.770 --> 02:45:27.390]
How do you like that?

[02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:29.250]
And there's these in Pesach.

[02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:32.630]
And happy Tushibov and Simhastor and all the other bummysies.

[02:45:33.310 --> 02:45:34.370]
How do you like them apples, huh?

[02:45:34.890 --> 02:45:37.070]
I'm so glad that Marie Levina is still alive and well.

[02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:38.410]
They did your favor, Marie.

[02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:39.550]
They got your ass out of there.

[02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:41.030]
A bunch of grave robbers.

[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:44.470]
Rhino Fink, rat Fink Wolf and PD Bolder man, the assassin.

[02:45:44.970 --> 02:45:46.950]
Biggest bunch of losers that Paxton crowd.

[02:45:47.130 --> 02:45:47.750]
Oh my god.

[02:45:48.010 --> 02:45:49.190]
Talk about Paxton America.

[02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:51.830]
Now what he said in the song something about Paxton America.

[02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.550]
Something like that.

[02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:53.270]
Close to it.

[02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:56.090]
Anyway, maybe we got to think a couple of calls.

[02:45:56.210 --> 02:45:57.150]
The last calls of the year.

[02:45:57.250 --> 02:45:58.350]
This is the last 30-5 minutes.

[02:45:58.350 --> 02:45:59.070]
Who might be exciting?

[02:45:59.330 --> 02:46:00.190]
Warner Who Those Two Are.

[02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:01.870]
Ha ha ha.

[02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:02.610]
What do you think?

[02:46:03.870 --> 02:46:05.010]
I'm going to go with Dominique.

[02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:06.470]
Dominique Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:08.090]
Hi, Neil. How are you?

[02:46:08.450 --> 02:46:09.110]
Pretty good, a lady.

[02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:11.130]
See, here's Josh thinking it's going to be some chronic.

[02:46:11.130 --> 02:46:12.650]
And it's a nice lady, I think.

[02:46:13.330 --> 02:46:14.290]
Well, that's what I see here.

[02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:15.090]
It's actually me.

[02:46:15.870 --> 02:46:19.890]
I call I used to call it, but we were the couple that moved to Egypt to go teach.

[02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.670]
And I remember.

[02:46:21.730 --> 02:46:22.070]
Oh, hey.

[02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:23.070]
Wow.

[02:46:23.490 --> 02:46:26.330]
But we're back from our just like the winter holiday.

[02:46:26.650 --> 02:46:26.950]
But I want to call it a day.

[02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:28.890]
Did you do some kind of a pyramid scam over there?

[02:46:29.410 --> 02:46:30.990]
Yeah, there's lots of pyramid scams.

[02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:33.430]
But we actually like it a lot.

[02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:34.930]
But I wanted to call and say happy New Year.

[02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:37.290]
And I want to know, where are you living now?

[02:46:37.550 --> 02:46:39.010]
Like, in Toronto, where are you?

[02:46:39.330 --> 02:46:40.970]
Right now, this moment I'm in Toronto.

[02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:44.010]
And my nice little apartment in Toronto with my nice beautiful studio

[02:46:44.010 --> 02:46:45.850]
on the touch by other human hands.

[02:46:46.810 --> 02:46:48.290]
When were you in Brussels?

[02:46:49.330 --> 02:46:50.590]
I wasn't. I just made that up.

[02:46:50.970 --> 02:46:51.650]
Oh, okay.

[02:46:51.730 --> 02:46:54.410]
Because we were going to ask you if you've ever been to Bruges

[02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:56.270]
because we've just been traveling in Europe this summer.

[02:46:56.470 --> 02:46:57.410]
I've had a Bruges here, too.

[02:46:57.490 --> 02:46:58.850]
And I was just in Amsterdam last week.

[02:46:58.850 --> 02:46:59.730]
And I will ever go back.

[02:46:59.730 --> 02:47:01.150]
It's just too much moody for me.

[02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:02.450]
I just know more.

[02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.270]
Okay.

[02:47:03.610 --> 02:47:03.790]
All right.

[02:47:03.970 --> 02:47:06.890]
Well, I just say happy New Year and tell you that we miss less

[02:47:06.890 --> 02:47:08.890]
and it's you I've been able to stream it a few times

[02:47:08.890 --> 02:47:09.790]
and try calling.

[02:47:10.030 --> 02:47:12.210]
But with the times, it's a little bit difficult.

[02:47:12.450 --> 02:47:14.370]
We'll say hi to Samson and Delilah for us.

[02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:15.250]
We shall.

[02:47:15.490 --> 02:47:16.110]
And you take care.

[02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.430]
Okay.

[02:47:16.490 --> 02:47:17.010]
Okay. You too.

[02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:17.350]
Have a happy.

[02:47:17.890 --> 02:47:18.070]
Bye-bye.

[02:47:18.310 --> 02:47:18.770]
I don't know.

[02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:19.790]
I see that was great.

[02:47:20.010 --> 02:47:21.410]
There's somebody there living in Egypt now.

[02:47:21.490 --> 02:47:22.670]
Talk about getting out of town.

[02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:23.850]
How all the way to them.

[02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:25.210]
Yeah, Tokyo is going to be nice, lady.

[02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:26.510]
You did not.

[02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:27.210]
You saw it yet.

[02:47:27.210 --> 02:47:29.090]
Nah, if that was going to be Pro-Zach Rahn.

[02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:30.670]
Please, please, please, please.

[02:47:30.730 --> 02:47:31.430]
I've never come back.

[02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:32.090]
That was that one.

[02:47:32.310 --> 02:47:32.910]
I guess we'll run.

[02:47:33.010 --> 02:47:33.750]
Here's some for the holidays.

[02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.730]
You like your charge.

[02:47:35.530 --> 02:47:37.390]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:41.230]
This is Pro-Zach Rahn.

[02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:44.530]
Excuse me, but I do believe that's the best.

[02:47:47.250 --> 02:47:47.690]
Absolutely.

[02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:54.870]
Let's abuse some more prisoners.

[02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:56.890]
Make them scream.

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.190]

[02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:59.190]
Oh!

[02:48:43.770 --> 02:48:44.250]
Oh!

[02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.990]
Oh!

[02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.350]
Oh!

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.050 --> 02:48:55.050]

[02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.070]

[02:48:55.090 --> 02:48:55.090]

[02:48:55.090 --> 02:48:55.090]

[02:48:55.170 --> 02:48:55.610]
Oh!

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:55.650 --> 02:48:55.650]

[02:48:56.530 --> 02:48:56.530]

[02:48:56.530 --> 02:48:56.690]
Oh!

[02:48:56.770 --> 02:48:56.770]

[02:48:56.770 --> 02:48:56.770]

[02:48:57.010 --> 02:48:57.030]
Oh!

[02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.030]

[02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:59.030]
Oh!

[02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:48.390]
Oh!

[02:49:50.970 --> 02:49:50.970]

[02:50:21.330 --> 02:50:23.130]
That's a movie.

[02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:29.030]
Oh!

[02:51:06.730 --> 02:51:07.770]
Oh!

[02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:08.130]
Oh!

[02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:09.210]
Oh!

[02:51:09.210 --> 02:51:09.210]

[02:51:09.430 --> 02:51:10.110]
Oh!

[02:51:10.310 --> 02:51:10.590]
Oh!

[02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:11.410]
Oh!

[02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:15.030]
Oh!

[02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:17.630]
Oh!

[02:51:18.750 --> 02:51:19.790]
Oh!

[02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.690]

[02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.690]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:20.930]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:20.930]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:20.930]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:20.930]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:20.930]

[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:21.610]
Oh!

[02:51:22.050 --> 02:51:22.050]

[02:51:22.050 --> 02:51:22.050]

[02:58:07.290 --> 02:58:10.210]

If there were no way things you would make me

[02:58:29.570 --> 02:58:33.790]
fucker head to the side of the earth, I am my ringer.

[02:58:33.950 --> 02:58:36.590]
Think of your copy of the best of Canadians, singing other Canadians.

[02:58:36.890 --> 02:58:38.770]
The Great White North has never been so great.

[02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:40.750]
Over that matter, so white.

[02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:50.290]
So, Canada, our own and needed land.

[02:58:50.290 --> 02:58:59.750]

The great white North has never been so great.

[02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:52.610]
Ladies and gentlemen, we were told you now to

[02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:57.910]
SIRT search and your hosts are Cimio Hall.

[02:59:58.810 --> 03:00:00.410]
When I...

[03:00:00.410 --> 03:00:04.390]
Hey, everybody, I'm our Cimio Hall and welcome back to SIRT search.

[03:00:04.390 --> 03:00:07.190]
You already found first contestant all the way.

[03:00:07.470 --> 03:00:08.570]
Come home, Carl.

[03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:13.390]
Give it up for comedian Kim Nung Bae.

[03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:15.910]
Okay, okay, how you doing?

[03:00:16.490 --> 03:00:19.630]
First talk, do a gentleman walk him through bar?

[03:00:20.190 --> 03:00:21.110]
First one's sake.

[03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:32.790]
Which I'm here together for him, but I'm bad, everybody.

[03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:36.710]
Oh man, I heard a dine on stage that was just playing old wack.

[03:00:37.310 --> 03:00:40.110]
All right, let's hear from my judges, Amit Zappa.

[03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:42.150]
What do you think of him, Nung Bae?

[03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:45.110]
I loved him. He was great by stars.

[03:00:45.510 --> 03:00:47.230]
Oh, man, did you think everybody would find a star?

[03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:52.250]
Next up, my whole boy, the one the only pinstain.

[03:00:52.970 --> 03:00:57.630]
His brand of comedy is infectious, three stars.

[03:00:58.230 --> 03:00:58.950]
All right, it is.

[03:00:58.950 --> 03:01:04.970]
And finally, our last SIRT search judge, the lovely and talented Naomi Judd.

[03:01:05.090 --> 03:01:06.410]
What do you think of him, Nung Bae?

[03:01:06.670 --> 03:01:14.590]
Naomi, what up girl?

[03:01:15.270 --> 03:01:17.230]
Oh no, she ain't breathing.

[03:01:17.710 --> 03:01:19.130]
I better give him my time now.

[03:01:19.350 --> 03:01:20.410]
Come on, baby, breathe.

[03:01:23.930 --> 03:01:25.330]
Maybe I wasn't such a good idea.

[03:01:27.210 --> 03:01:28.090]
Oh, damn.

[03:01:28.090 --> 03:01:29.770]
What I go and do that?

[03:01:30.810 --> 03:01:32.130]
We gotta take a quick break.

[03:01:32.930 --> 03:01:34.110]
And we'll be right back.

[03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.970]
SIRT for more.

[03:01:36.470 --> 03:01:37.530]
SIRT search.

[03:01:39.470 --> 03:01:40.230]
Maybe not.

[03:01:52.690 --> 03:01:55.730]
Because of the size, I don't go out at all.

[03:01:55.730 --> 03:02:00.910]
I spend all day indoors, because I don't want to die from stars.

[03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:06.890]
Because of stars, I bought a surgical mask.

[03:02:07.290 --> 03:02:12.070]
I look like Michael Jackson, but it's better than tagging stars.

[03:02:14.970 --> 03:02:19.930]
Because of stars, every time I know's run, I call my doctor.

[03:02:20.430 --> 03:02:23.270]
And he tells me I don't have stars.

[03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:31.290]
Because of stars, I cry all the time, and my throat kinda raw.

[03:02:31.630 --> 03:02:34.450]
Oh my god does that mean I have stars.

[03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:35.910]
I'm dying on the earth.

[03:02:41.350 --> 03:02:47.850]
You're both automatically, after you made it by the computer that the KEOP

[03:03:02.090 --> 03:03:08.230]
is going to be a little bit more.
