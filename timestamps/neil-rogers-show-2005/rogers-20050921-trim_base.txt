[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.840]
See where Barry Gibbs and Barbara Streisand made an album down here.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.600]
Really?

[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.460]
They come back for Barry Gibbs.

[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.280]
Yeah, I doubt that.

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.520]
Maybe they both live on Star Island, you think so?

[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.200]
Maybe they moved into Anita Brinsel.

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.720]
Well, the VG's always live on Star Island.

[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.900]
The Barbara Streisand lives in California.

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.140]
In the Inemsville, you know.

[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.940]
But in California, I thought she lived in New York.

[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.500]
Barbara Streisand is in California.

[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.320]
They don't have the house in California anymore.

[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.500]
I think he has two houses.

[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680]
Yeah, she's probably got plenty.

[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.880]
We're at the VG's lived.

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.220]
Didn't think they lived in New Orleans.

[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.400]
I think they lived over in off-altern road.

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.500]
Now that was in Russell.

[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.780]
Next time we have lunch with Sid Levin, ask him about Lynn Russell.

[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.540]
Okay.

[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.660]
Just mentioned the name.

[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.960]
I remember her.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.480]
Yeah.

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.160]
She was on CNN Headline News for about a hundred years, right?

[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.420]
Yeah.

[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.040]
Whatever.

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.540]
She worked with you guys, right?

[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.460]
She sure did.

[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.420]
She became our program directorist.

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.500]
Not that she was qualified, but she evidently...

[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.340]
I liked her.

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.020]
She's a good person.

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.400]
She's nice.

[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.200]
It fact, she wrote me a nice note once at one of my 80s stations along the way.

[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.000]
She wrote me a nice note.

[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.760]
Well, it's pretty unusual, isn't it?

[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.560]
No, we had an easy time of it yesterday, actually.

[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.400]
Well, I'm just looking at this story now.

[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620]
Overreaction to Storm Irk's, where are you locals?

[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.380]
You know, on all this business about all of you.

[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.220]
You call that a hurricane.

[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.360]
Listen, wouldn't you think after Katrina, people...

[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.100]
And also not just Katrina and the Gulf, but what happened in Dave County from Katrina,

[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040]
wouldn't you think people would rather be a little bit more safe than sorry?

[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.160]
The only thing that bothered me was watching the cover just today.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.860]
And there was a reporter down.

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.660]
I think she was a channel 10.

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.980]
She was down in Ila Marada.

[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.260]
And she was telling a story about a woman who was tearful because her sailboat sunk.

[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.900]
Yeah.

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.000]
And I'm thinking about all these people who are wandering around the country now.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.840]
I don't have to leave Houston to go someplace else.

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.420]
And some women's crying because her sailboat sunk.

[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.400]
Well, let me have a question.

[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.960]
What do you say?

[00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.560]
Yeah, right.

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.520]
You have a special benefit.

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.900]
I mean, that was so over the top.

[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.920]
Well, I guarantee you one thing, the people in Texas are going to be well taken care of

[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.160]
because that's your president's home, you know, his state.

[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.240]
So he's going to take good care of them.

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.760]
Too bad he doesn't live on a water.

[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.060]
Over there in Galveston.

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.900]
Careful now.

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.320]
I can smell.

[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.780]
If you pursue this line of commentary, I can smell suspension number 87.

[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.060]
He val again.

[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.360]
Oh, guess who's doing a show from New York today?

[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.140]
I'll give you one clue.

[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.800]
I thought he was on jury duty.

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.740]
That was Monday.

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.400]
His daughter is evidently either springing fourths either today, did or is or in the process

[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.280]
of having a kid.

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.160]
So he's up there in New York to lend a helping hand, I guess.

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.920]
I don't know what he's doing.

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.760]
Another mo.

[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.980]
Do it, do it, do it.

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.660]
Yeah, baby mo.

[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.080]
And that's something.

[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.220]
I thought it'd be no mo.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.040]
You were hoping.

[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.780]
But, you know, you talk about that line of conversation and you look at right now where

[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.420]
Bush ranks in terms of what the, you know, Paul's saying about him.

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.660]
Yeah.

[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.280]
It's never been lower.

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.020]
And it's not never been lower.

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.080]
Nixon was like a 30.

[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.340]
No, no, he's never been lower.

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.100]
He's never been lower.

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.340]
And it depends on who they're talking to.

[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.520]
But, well, no, it doesn't matter who they're talking to anymore.

[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.560]
They're talking to me.

[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.620]
He couldn't go any lower.

[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.020]
Even a Republican's or he's got numbers like somebody we all know with a minus and

[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.120]
front in my book.

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.780]
Oh, you talk about mo.

[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.080]
No, I didn't.

[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.960]
Don't start.

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.000]
Say you're the instigator.

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.180]
You said it first.

[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.360]
Don't forget.

[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.920]
Like somebody we all know, I'm thinking like of that other station over like your buddies

[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.180]
to gods, for example.

[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.020]
And then a LeBasterd and Jimmy Cifilis.

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.960]
See, I don't think about those people.

[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.640]
I don't either.

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.220]
And just like I said, several times, I'll say it again.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.620]
And you know, it's true when the fan was on there, that station was like about 1950 on

[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.880]
the dial off the right end of most of the radio, though, with their 16 watts of power.

[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.580]
The only people who were listening to that were the Q&A people.

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.340]
There's the only people listening to people working our station because somebody gets

[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.940]
them all whipped up and obsessed, oh, they're going to come after us.

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.700]
And we're going to sue them.

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.140]
All this other crap that goes on.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.720]
Nobody cares about them.

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.840]
Nobody thinks about them.

[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.420]
They're just like a pimple on our ass.

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.980]
They are to suing what I am to suspensions.

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.660]
Yeah, that's exactly correct.

[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.620]
Oops.

[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.240]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.220]
Number 88.

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.840]
He's not even trying and he's getting more days.

[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.660]
God almighty.

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.500]
Just don't fall off the haus.

[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.580]
When's your horse running again?

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.540]
I don't know.

[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.260]
I have to call the trainer and find out.

[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.600]
I'm hoping that you'll run next week when I'm in New York.

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.820]
Oh, now here's the, I'm so glad I'm looking at CNN right now.

[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.820]
This Lieutenant General Russell honor a.

[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.180]
This guy, he's like a creature from the Louisiana lagoon.

[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.620]
Never see that movie Southern comfort.

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.740]
No, oh, you got to see that sometime.

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.280]
You love it.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.640]
It's about the trashy nature of the people and they will buy you in the car.

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.060]
Yeah, it's he shouldn't really knock on every when it's down, but I will anyway because

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.320]
I'm not going to suck up and say New Orleans is a great place.

[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.700]
It's not the average IQ.

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.140]
There is got a minus in front of it.

[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.000]
But anyway, this guy, you know, this honor, right guy with this old T got that he wears.

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.940]
They had a press conference yesterday.

[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.620]
Now when he's been interviewed on television every time they ask him a question, he'll,

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.600]
well, I think it's over.

[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.380]
Over.

[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.740]
He gets the end of his comment over like he's doing now, you know, military or shortwave

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.920]
or CB radio over.

[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160]
So he's doing a press conference yesterday where he was bitching out all the media because

[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.620]
he didn't like their questions and he finished his sentence and he's over and he's standing

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.640]
right there in front of these people over.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.060]
This man is dumber than a box of rocks, man.

[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.620]
It's just a pathetic, but he's what that whole buy you areas all about.

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.900]
He's the he's the postage child for New Orleans.

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.080]
When you say a movie about that, there's been a lot of movies.

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.320]
No, it doesn't come for it to really go to be a little bit better.

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.480]
I'm telling you, I recommended highly.

[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.900]
Okay.

[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.940]
Also, I said yesterday that we ought to get you a computer, but you probably won't use

[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.120]
it.

[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.020]
I have a computer.

[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.920]
See, I get bad information.

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.660]
I know it.

[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.260]
I thought I heard you say a long time ago that you find the guy on the computer.

[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.460]
I've had a computer for years.

[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.400]
You're on the internet?

[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.000]
I can be if I know, but you're not.

[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.600]
Yeah, I'm, yeah, I would.

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.500]
Why would you have a computer?

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.140]
What would you do with it if you're not on the internet?

[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.580]
Oh, for a while, I was, you know, I was getting and sending emails and I forget about

[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.060]
email.

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.220]
Well, there's a couple of things.

[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.020]
One, I worked for a network and out of Connecticut where I have to send them copy or they send

[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.860]
me stuff, you know, that kind of thing.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.480]
Yeah, but you don't need the internet for that.

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.240]
Well, I get, you know, travel things, you know, all my travel information.

[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.080]
I want to upgrade.

[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.560]
We're going to like, we're going to get Josh Cortis or somebody over there and upgrade

[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.980]
your system and get you with a 21st century.

[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.200]
My system is fine.

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.120]
I just don't use it.

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.820]
Well, why not?

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.480]
Because I don't like it.

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.300]
I don't like that.

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.800]
Man, it doesn't either.

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.360]
What?

[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.780]
Man, it doesn't have all my gut.

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.500]
I think those people at the other station are right.

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.360]
We're a bunch of old funny days on this station.

[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.380]
Man, I don't think there are any of these computers.

[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.140]
I think that I'm like technically oriented.

[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.100]
You know that I have repaired more different things, not that we have technical problems,

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.360]
but like different like when the phone they sent me a new modem here.

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.840]
I've done more technical stuff in here than the whole engineering department's done under

[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.780]
in the last eight years.

[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.900]
I can't knock the engineering department, fix it, went out and had to get parts to fix the

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.740]
commodes here.

[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.660]
Yeah, because the building didn't do it.

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.940]
Exactly right up his alley.

[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.960]
You went out, got it.

[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.160]
I always said he knew his crap.

[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.360]
Well, he got it done.

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.220]
Old fix it.

[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.200]
In fact, when I look at him, I'm picking holy crap.

[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.280]
He is the poster child for silly person.

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.900]
A lot of poster children run around.

[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.320]
There's a general honor rate.

[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.340]
What do you mean, sir?

[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.760]
What?

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.440]
There's a storm out here.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.820]
Wow, he just sends me right to the bulls, speaking of that.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.700]
So fix it, fix the commodes, that's nice.

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.560]
It's nice to know we work at a radio station where they care enough to fix the toilets.

[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.800]
Well, he went out and did it on his own.

[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.720]
Yeah, he probably, you know, nature was calling.

[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.420]
I didn't know that.

[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.320]
Maybe Fat Boy was in there again, you know?

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.980]
I blew the whole place up.

[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000]
I don't want to go into it today.

[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.340]
I heard a story about him one time.

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.100]
It was just so grotesque.

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.540]
He'd lose meals from 20 years ago.

[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.640]
Well, say how do my buddy sit-al-of-in?

[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.380]
I would, and you know, something I'm having lunch with said next week.

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.080]
I told you, see, that's my second.

[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.720]
You were unbelievable.

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.460]
I am.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.900]
I get together with Sid every two or three with that Mickey Dane the Shane.

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.640]
I get together with Sid every two or three months.

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.520]
He's a wonderful man.

[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.180]
He really is.

[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.640]
He's great.

[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.280]
And he gave me my start in this market.

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.600]
I can blame him for all of this stuff.

[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.120]
And we had the Jim Alton was on here in the morning.

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.360]
And with Lynn Russell, he's dead now, Jim Alton.

[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.740]
Yeah.

[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.660]
All right.

[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.000]
Maybe tomorrow morning we'll reminisce about all the dead people

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.140]
that we worked with in the business since it's, you know,

[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.280]
it's all great or somebody wish we're dead.

[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:19.860]
Yeah.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.240]
All right, here he goes again.

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.720]
Yeah, yeah, all the grief.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.420]
And you keep instigating, instigating.

[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.440]
You didn't have to mention anything.

[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.560]
I didn't say him.

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.760]
You could have said something nice.

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.560]
Like, congratulations to my friend Howard.

[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.460]
I was a grand new grandchild.

[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.260]
You could have said something.

[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.120]
I wouldn't say that, but you might.

[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.520]
I wouldn't say that.

[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.080]
Somebody told me yesterday, because that was my memory

[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.180]
as faulty when he gets to be old and seen now like us.

[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.440]
But you hated him before he came into the building

[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.140]
is what I'm told.

[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.360]
Well, I didn't like what he said before he came

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.860]
in the building.

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.700]
Oh, is that what it is?

[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.120]
I thought it was like some personal, like you ran across

[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.660]
and somewhere.

[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.700]
I run across him over the years, but he was not hiding

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:54.860]
enough.

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.140]
Obviously, doing it.

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.160]
It wasn't with a truck.

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.080]
But anyway, he was doing, you know, money

[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.760]
and I football when I used to see him around.

[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.020]
Right.

[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.420]
But he remember the first interview he gave before he came

[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.220]
here, he told the board stock is boring.

[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.780]
Yeah, and he was going to change it.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.520]
And he's going to make it really interesting.

[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.080]
And I didn't think that was a good way to come in

[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.580]
with sports.

[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.540]
And then he also said that he was going to put the mad dog

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.100]
in his place.

[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.920]
Remember, he was going to sit here and he was going to like

[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.560]
explain to him who was boss and who he thought it'd be

[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.300]
the star in the broadcast.

[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.120]
That comment said everything there is to say.

[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.160]
Yeah, that's the told you about that big pompous.

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.720]
So he had a different approach.

[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.020]
I mean, it's not a lot of people who speak in a dead

[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.920]
people put gopages wife on the air or cases stingles

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.540]
daughter in law.

[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.080]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.080]
Well, you have a good saying daughter.

[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.720]
I'm not saying anymore.

[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.620]
No, that's good.

[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.560]
OK, because I'm smelling number 89 is going to be on

[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.420]
the calendar pretty soon.

[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.660]
Well, you got to tell the end of the year when Greg

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.000]
leaves.

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.880]
Now, just one final note.

[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.380]
No, the beast evidently, because the asteroid

[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.220]
yesterday, how is it that he came across that

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.200]
industry inside radio?

[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.720]
I wish he wouldn't have done a beast because I

[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.680]
subscribed to that thing.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.840]
And I just had to email them to stop faxing me.

[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.960]
It's every day that inside radio.

[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.240]
And they start faxing at five o'clock in the morning

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.280]
and it wakes me up on a hurl page after page.

[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.520]
And I just faxed email them and said, stop faxing the crap.

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.240]
Send it by email.

[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.680]
You idiots, you quizzlings.

[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.500]
But somebody in the sales department,

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.720]
ever done the giving my heads up on that thing

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.500]
being under a couple of days ago about Greg leaving.

[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.180]
I don't know.

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.520]
I walked in the other morning and he showed it to me.

[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:26.980]

[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.720]
I mean, you said that yesterday again.

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.360]
It's not good.

[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.300]
Don't keep saying that.

[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.300]
That's always.

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.840]
Especially the beast and engaged man.

[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.280]
We don't want to hear that he showed it to you.

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.560]
I'm trying to encourage him to gamble so that he can

[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.360]
supplement his income.

[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.940]
There you go.

[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.000]
Well, he's a big slot guy.

[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.520]
You know, he was stuck up to me that time.

[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.660]
He was trying to get George's job.

[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.960]
Well, he loves wheel of fortune.

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:46.800]
He's a big slot.

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.320]
Well, you know that because you were doing the show

[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.120]
in the Bahamas that time.

[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.760]
It was puns in his gut stuff.

[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.020]

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:51.920]
OK.

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.180]
I was he playing quarter slots or?

[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:54.760]
Yeah.

[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:55.820]
Go quarter slots.

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.600]
Well, he knows the limitations.

[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.880]
Family that's got the cash that his family's got.

[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.300]
Hey, he better learn from Stu God's man when your family's

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.360]
gots it and grab it.

[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.260]
Yeah, have a great day.

[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.740]
You too.

[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.140]
Too much.

[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.400]
Please.

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:05.780]
All right.

[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.180]
Wednesday.

[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.820]
See you tomorrow.

[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.360]
Now I'm up here.

[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.580]
And you yet to down there in the paradise.

[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.580]
We're broadcasting from the plushly and printed

[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.020]
abandoned studios at WMCA, New York.

[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.460]
For the home and a good guys.

[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.040]
Yeah, it's good to be back in New York.

[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.660]
A town so great they had the name it twice.

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.220]
Yeah.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.100]
Yeah.

[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.400]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:43.560]

[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.040]

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.060]
Yeah.

[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.180]

[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.180]

[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.180]

[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:46.960]

[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:48.720]
Yeah.

[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:48.820]
Yeah.

[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.480]
Yeah.

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:49.540]

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:49.540]

[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.000]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:11:59.580]

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:11:59.660]

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:24.180]
conditions rupck

[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.860]
Get that hair! We just want to drop the air.

[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.720]
I'm gonna fight a fight for high school.

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.680]
Ah, ha, ha, I'll fuck it in here.

[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.360]
Since it was closed.

[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.200]
I'll never fight me in here.

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:37.520]
What?

[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.440]
To the right.

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.020]
What?

[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.880]
To the right.

[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.180]

[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.400]
To the right.

[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:41.780]
What?

[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:42.540]
To the right.

[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:42.780]
To the right.

[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:42.900]
What?

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.780]
To the right.

[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.160]
What?

[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:44.640]
To the right.

[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.280]
To the right.

[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.100]
To the right.

[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.040]
To the right.

That was shocking.

[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.160]
Wow.

[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.540]
First to show you that you can pick like

[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.780]
almost any letter to the alphabet.

[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.360]
any word it's ever been invented we got some crap in the computer there showed up

[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.640]
well I could just show another thing too and it is if you're on the air for about a hundred years

[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.680]
you get the whole collection of real crap it's 10 20 if you are I'm speaking of crap there's

[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.440]
that Chad Vetsie Everett and the whole thing about the hurricane you people that are all

[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.860]
PO'd about well everybody got us all whipped up and much into about nothing and a lot of inconvenience

[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.260]
you know I understand because many a time especially local politicians it's like the boy who

[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.300]
cried wolf and they get everybody all whipped up you know up into a frenzy the boy who cried the

[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:18.260]
wolf looks great and then nothing happens right and a lot of times different oh good reason

[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.880]
like when a mere teeny peony that time got everybody all whipped and the thing was already north of us

[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.200]
and it was uh up to Palm Beach County wasn't going to have any effect at all on data broward

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.200]
and oh how dare you people but an else sunshine went out there waving his ham hocks member at that

[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.560]
restaurant I think it was the Floridian or one of those yes it was a Norma hangs out was it oh it's

[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.260]
that kind of place no well yeah but anyway one of those kind of places and then he was chewing him out

[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.180]
how dare you open up and shame on you and the mayor to it first of all a mayor peony winnie wasn't

[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.340]
a mayor of last time I checked for a lot of day or anything to do with broward county that's number one

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.200]
and number two there was nothing going on it was already passed Al sunshine is he still on the

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.740]
year I guess yeah waving his ham hocks man what a disgrace what a joke speaking of disgrace

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.300]
roadside bombs explode near three us convoy's in and around Baghdad they wounding two soldiers

[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:12.940]
the attacks came a day after the death uh toll for us forces rose to 1903 1903 since the Iraq attack

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.340]
just every day we start with a little bit of Iraq news because things are going swimmingly well

[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:23.100]
oh we're fine we want to pass along the good news because freedom's on a march 1572 votes

[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.180]
on the pool yesterday what one thing you want to know most before you die I thought that was

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.260]
got an interesting pool I don't think I've ever done that one before ever that's starting today

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.120]
though we're going to be doing a lot of repeat the polls because if you think that what did I tell

[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.160]
you about this coming back to do in five days a week again I have no problem with that other than

[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.660]
this pool business and of course it's like Frankenstein and a monster we created it and now we

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.840]
have to like continue feeding it right yeah because the audience out there in case you have

[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.460]
noticed the audience is very hungry they want to continue being spoon fed and you got to

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.460]
swoop down about the hurricane nothing happened and then of course the last time was just the

[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.220]
opposite when Katrina came through broward and day the before winter the guffal went crazy and

[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.020]
all gee he didn't give us enough warning and we really created a lot of them well how do I

[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.680]
suppose to know how to how does uh ed rap report suppose to know or max mayfield or Curtis may

[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.260]
field how do we suppose to know bottom line if there's a cloud out there in the

[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.140]
way with the cloud in the sky fall into the water can expect the power to go off several times

[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.240]
although thank you FPL for getting just about everybody's power back on real quick

[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.520]
say close to show you when you least expected 1572 votes what one thing you want to know most

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.420]
before you die before they put your sorry ass into a box is their life after death 364 people

[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:40.120]
want to know that uh no don't forget man created gods in his own images and that's the way it goes

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.440]
man creates gods in his own images I think that's uh the way it goes yeah it's a bunch of crap okay

[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.020]
and his wrath shall wax hot course god is perfect so we couldn't possibly have any wrath that's

[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.060]
why all of these gods they have all these human uh failings and the frailties and characteristics

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.900]
because man invented gods so therefore when you expect that yes right in his own image

[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:04.040]
where his wrath shall wax hot unless you do is kill all those goyem uh get working on it

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:11.320]
is there life at other planets 242 who killed JFK 201 life 50% of America so dumb 158

[00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.170]
you're not something that work

[00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.570]
to let go okay

[00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.590]
take one their

[00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:55.990]
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I

[00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:25.690]
actually Josh Kordes need to be happy about that bit. He doesn't get it. Oh, he doesn't get what? What? You didn't get the bit. Roxy. Of course I did. No, just pretend you didn't get it. Then you won't have to say anything. How about those marlins, baby? Oh, man, lots of girls. Team last night. That was bad. Well, Houston won last night. So, doesn't that put them three games behind these strobes now? Yeah, three back. Of course, strobes. And Detroit, we used to call that Tiger P. Strow's beer. But anyway, there were three games back with 11 to go or something like that.

[00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:55.670]
And that's looking to good. Especially on the night when the Phillies lost to Atlanta, they could have made a little hay there, but nevertheless, who cares? We got the Marling games tonight. We got Mo from New York at two, mad dog four to six thirty five. I'm realizing now that mad dog, they're wasting him badly because he's on most of the baseball season, which is a huge part of the year. He's only on for like two and a half hours. Am I right about that? And I know we're paying him. Thanks to Joel Feinberg. We're paying him like Zillions of dollars and big bucks. The Zervily Show mad dog don't get me wrong. But to do a two and a half hour show.

[00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:25.650]
I'm sure he's okay with that. I'm sure he is. So I'm thinking like him two to five and then maybe Mo five to seven. Marlins on deck six thirty five. And of course, the Marlins, they made the same mistake on here they did yesterday. Six thirty five to seven, ten Marlins on deck. Then we sign off for technical repair for 20 minutes. Seven thirty. The Marling game followed by the Ed Kaplan gambling show. I don't get that. But then again, it's clear. And she's had a lot of pressure now that the Beast got the hits to his getting hits. Got engaged. I guess the Clarence is going to have to look for a different company at night. Former Peirce.

[00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:55.630]
The president Jimmy Carter yesterday accused the Bush administration of failing to maintain the standards at the agency he created in 1979, a figure that Democrats said led to the disaster that he fell to Orleans after was struck by Hurricane Katrina. You haven't seen it on air. Speaking of idiots. They should call on general honor. It should be general ornery. There's Mickey. We're working very closely with the government. I worked this you idiot you quizzling Carter who served as a president from 77 81. City made three promises when he created FEMA at the request of the nation's governors who had asked

[00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:25.610]
him to put under one umbrella the 16 agencies that were custom dealing with after disasters. The promises were that the agencies leaders would always be highly qualified. The agency would always be an independent agencies and would always be adequately financed. Carter said the hiring of a brownie brown to head FEMA was a disgrace. His word disgrace all three of those promises have been violated the 80 year old former governor of Georgia total pack all of his presidential library in Atlanta. Not too far from planes. I really don't know where planes is. Do you know where planes are?

[00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:55.430]
I think that the people who live in planes if the president of brothers any indication and Rosalind and what was the daughter's name Amy Amy Carter very good. Now she looks like definite kind of that kid up with a banjo in the tree like one of the beastlies. You know she's definitely part of that clan poor girl. Yeah. In fact, you ever see her and Chelsea Clinton together. What is that about at least one thing you can say for the Bush family? Okay is the daughters relatively speaking are smoldering. They're smoking compared to some of these other presidential daughters in recent years.

[00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:25.410]
Right. It's just one of those things. That would be a good pull question someday. Yeah. Presidential offspring. I mean we could put you know we could like to do an asterisk and put most grand the kid on there too when we find out what it is. And I do emphasize what it is. Okay. Here's our poll today and yes it is time for some repeats. The good part about the repeats which is going to be a extraordinarily frustrating to the audiences that when I can go back and thanks a lot Eric by the way you are doing it man. Some days. But I can go back into history here and find all the polls we've ever taken on this show. And then I can

[00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:55.310]
click on it and it gives the result with all the names that were on there. So like the one today for example the worst TV actor actress ever which we did about a year ago is or was and then we're getting a lot of votes on there we're doing okay but uh so we already start with a long list. So these people are want to use their opportunity calling rather than to say something profound and prophetic and prophetic. Just to give me a name I got one for the poll that's going to like this will hasten the demise of that whole deal. I'm sure they'll have some to add on here. They'll call anyway. And then when they call and say Freddie Prince I'll have to look up six

[00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:09.230]
to hunt and then we find out some are already anyway we got three of the eight nine votes and at this rate we got a shot in a thousand a Josh. So forget about that Marlon's last last night that small potatoes who cares about such crap right baseball just a game least beat Boston last night five

[00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:24.710]
not an exhibition game anybody care about that at the cops Coliseum in Hamilton anybody know where that is no all the cops know. And I want to get noticing in the exhibition this game is that they're they're having a shootout at the end of the game whether this no matter what the score is in other words even if it's not tied there's no overtime they

[00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:33.250]
have a shoot out just to give the players practice shooting out. I'm sure that the judges are excited about that but what five six seven oh five six yeah I guess I'm going to give the

[00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:40.950]
result of a poll read this list the names then it'll be like one thirty almost time to go home by the time I got this we got three hundred E nine votes well there's so much crap on TV and of course

[00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:48.470]
jikas spends all this time writing about all these TV shows and the practice that 95% and below even worse than the hurricane Rita and Katrina combined they

[00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:56.730]
blow Tom worst of all time actor actors Donald Trump 41 Chuck Norris 39 and I think tomorrow when I give you the result then we'll

[00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:03.070]
compare with the original poll from a year ago and you'll say oh yeah uh Tony Danza 35 and deservedly so he really gives me

[00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:37.330]

Yeah, Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien is very good. He I would say he's an actor, but he's a TV person

[00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:10.090]
We got other people in there that aren't well. We're gonna pretending to be not he said Donald Trump's not an actor

[00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:15.490]

[00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.630]

I do think some of these homeless people have got a franchise. I told you that story a couple years ago about the woman that they followed

[00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.010]
She sat on the same corner every day, you know with a cup and a whole thing a homeless with a sign and

[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:53.630]
Every day she would leave at a certain time so they won't they followed her the media and she got into a nice new automobile

[00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.470]

[00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:59.350]
Sensor it in the name of the Lord conservative Christians read in Hollywood blockbusters. This is this long. Oh, it's too long to read now

[00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:03.370]
But it is it's pretty good indication of what's going on in America these days

[00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:09.370]
And then I have an article about the quotes Howard Beal. I've seen the face of God. I got some good stuff here actually

[00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.510]
I got a really fine pile today. We got only three hours to kill. Oh come on. What?

[00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.730]
Take some more of these calls. I am gonna take a lot of calls today

[00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.150]
I'm gonna take a lot of calls from now on now we don't have a worry about well

[00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:25.130]
I got one for the fall. Yeah, I sure you do we got 7,000 names on there already see we really played a little game with

[00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.910]
Their minds today because I got this one in addition to which it helps for getting a lot of early votes on there because you know

[00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:36.270]
I changed the pool by eight o'clock and a morning right 444 were two thirds of the way to the anti-Christ man the six six six we got

[00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.050]
444 it's not even 11 o'clock yet. I'm saying a thousand votes to Anna pole Josh

[00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:46.050]
I'm saying it. I'll bet you made it Bell and fat boys life on it and we'll throw in the Friedman too. How's that okay?

[00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:53.270]
452 they're coming in in chunks the worst TV actor actress ever is or was B and who's leading so far

[00:37:53.270 --> 00:38:00.130]
That's kind of interesting Donald Trump 50 Chuck Norris 47 and Tony Danza 39 and tomorrow give it well compare

[00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.970]
We'll put him side by each with that be fascinating. It's something to look forward to for me

[00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:10.310]
We're just gonna repeat any how many polls we've done since the beginning about the 1600 and some odd so figure it out

[00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.630]
How many now how many days of work a year do I work?

[00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:19.930]
About 30 years a year so I got like 50 years worth of shows covered with polls. It's not bad. We'll take it WQ

[00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:25.910]
I am. Hello. Yeah, right just to call my sister. Yes, sir. Yeah, I bet it was a storm hits bushes ran

Does anybody really care the government want to help really want to help you? Oh, yeah

[00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.470]
They're gonna be bushes ranches little inland it would seem to me though and Crawford

[00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.910]
I don't think it's gonna all though. You know something maybe the Lord and we're working in mysterious ways

[00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.270]
Maybe that thing is gonna like zigzag right through a Texas and fine crop. You got a good point

[00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.570]
Let's say a paraport pali

[00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:49.230]
Okay, go rub your muzzles and say a prayer for it. Are you a lot? I think you're a lot of rub your muzzles in a moment

[00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.370]
Oh, don't think about it and certainly don't be able to know dead chickens

[00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:57.450]
Don't be a choking at the dead chicken on your door because that's also against the law

[00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:02.050]
I got a story here a little later about the new crackdown by the FBI and pornography

[00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:07.250]
Where is sarcastic story from the New York Times as if this is and that's just sarcastic from their standpoint

[00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:12.690]
But from the people who were like in the in the agency like this is what we're working on now with everything that's going on

[00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:18.190]
Supposedly all these terrorists out there lurking in the wings and all these new videotapes from all is why here

[00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.770]
And we got out yet Al is a why here in al al-Kaita and al

Yeah, Al is Olsen we were talking about him the other day. We just can't find out. We know where Moe is Moe is in

[00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:34.610]
New York don't forget Moe from the rotten apple between two and four. That would be really something

[00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.630]

[00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.670]
George is definitely the worst. Okay. Good WQ I am hello

[00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:47.330]
There Q I M Ola see this and we we turn the corner today make no mistake about it over Q I M

[00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.930]
Hello, yeah, sir. Yeah, good morning sir. Fine. It's great. I guess I thought all I

[00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:59.190]
The question is I what is the question the question is did you find the resembles between your good friend

[00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.590]
Moe on your website the picture of him when you spanking the manky which is I really enjoy it

[00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.090]
I sure said a few records in over 400 miles 400

[00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.130]
I think you might be the a record holder you might be the winner

[00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:19.150]
Yeah, it was like a special sound but the question is did you see the resembles between his picture

[00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:26.070]
Aided picture on this thanking monkey and the other guy who is deciding right now in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.730]
Which is the name of how it comes on I

[00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.930]
Carissa guys never seen the two of them together

[00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.430]
In fact, it will surprise me if Moe is doing a show from

[00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.150]
Kabul today, huh? He's doing a show from some other rubble in Kabul

[00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.910]
This is me

[00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.490]
This is five sixteen

[00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.430]
Oop. Oh there went the audio vault now

[00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:54.490]
You know something I think this this sounds to me like a great class action lawsuit

[00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.650]
We think it was against this company because I'm no about you but not every time we go to a break

[00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.570]
I'm like on pins and needles wondering if the sponsor to play all the way through this is tremendous stress

[00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:08.590]
You are we can't like go to the bathroom or anything right stress kills because this so when it doubt it keeps crap

[00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:14.230]
And out over especially lately it's been a really what's the story with this on of course Hank is the second up

[00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:18.550]
At the engineering department you can't because they're fixing the toilets. Okay. Well, I think that's about their speed

[00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.810]
Okay, I think most of the talent is in the toilet engineering. So what do we do now? I mean I got

[00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.870]
I'm waiting hold on. I'm gonna give it a shot bang it smack it

[00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.150]
Oh, how about one more time?

[00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.370]
TV guy is calling invasion uh

[00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:33.270]
The TV

[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.650]
In a world

[00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.110]
The computers don't work

[00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:46.190]
I even like those old cars we used to play the ones that were like off speed and everything and the ones that were real mushy that you can understand

[00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.830]
But we can still build a client for so what do we do? How it came back again? It just keep okay. Well keep fighting

[00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:59.050]
Now do a little swim into the war list down. Let's run to the left to the right. Here we go. Slay a little muddop. There was no

[00:41:59.050 --> 00:41:59.850]
Oh

[00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:00.570]
people

[00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.870]
It's mismanners versus no manners

[00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.150]
That was disgusting

[00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:25.110]
Hey my new shoes my wife was a bitch, but at least she's not a heinous blow-pick season for me

[00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.210]
I love you

[00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.930]
Only on

[00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:40.790]
It's 11.02 at 5.60 WVQ and welcome to a place where well we're like on a periphery of radio

[00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:45.150]
That's why I had a laugh about the business rig. Greg is gonna get out of radio perhaps at the end of the year

[00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.730]
I didn't know he was in it maybe once upon a time but surely not now and don't call him surely

[00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.030]
Doug Thompson you're very favorite. I got a lot of stuff here and I'm gonna I'm doing it

[00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.690]
Okay, there we go and we'll dig into these calls and you know give these people an outlet for their

[00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:02.990]
Like that which is fine good to more and more of that all the time because people are a little other you know

[00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.010]
They don't want to be over

[00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:10.310]
Burden with crap right now they gone through these hurricanes and all awardings and the threats and the rain and the

[00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.670]
gas lines and

[00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.590]
Gas prices thanks again Mr

[00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:21.070]
President by the way for the bargain basement gas man you're a gas but nevertheless it's so they're they're the entire of that crap

[00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.450]
They don't want to be overwhelmed by it

[00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.630]
So a little bit of lightheartedness and pervality and just a little chuckle

[00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.370]
That's enough every now and then not too much now

[00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.110]
Did you see the models chat ever at best? You ever at Myers is on us

[00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:35.030]
CNN they're just a minute ago and they showed a whole bunch of different models about 75 of them and

[00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.130]
Some of them for this and now category four, which I think it's gonna become a five not that I know anything

[00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.730]
But I just I like that thinking thinking feeling there's a very good chance it will

[00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:49.730]
And then the some of the models are actually got it back up toward a Louisiana again right after he was telling us just a little while ago about Brownsville and

[00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:53.170]
Brownie and Brownie Hound and all that other stuff and the Mexico

[00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.130]
See I think he was talking about Browns and Mexico just because it make like an epic thing

[00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.750]
You know next thing you know, he's gonna be taking shots at Taco Bell

[00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:05.710]
Well, they probably advertise on CNN dog Thompson and the capital hill blue calm rice ignoring the real obscenities

[00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:11.450]
And this has to do tonight's any about the porn squad yeah, which I'll I got that a little bit later on and recruits

[00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:16.390]
Sock for the porn squad the FBI is during the Bush administration's war on porn and we'll get to that later

[00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.510]
But anyway, this is in conjunction with that

[00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.030]
Had lunch last week Doug says with an old friend a career agent with the FBI

[00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.930]
He's considering early retirement because he just can't handle what's happening to his agency

[00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.410]
They federal enforcement apparatus in the country. I didn't sign on for this

[00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.290]
He said the bureau has gone to hell in a hand basket

[00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.130]
He tells you the sterving story of an agency ripped apart internally by turf battles

[00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:40.730]
Emasculated by an attorney general who believes constitutional rights get in the way of a poorly-managed war on terror and administration

[00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:45.690]
His focus is marginal at best our number one priority in law enforcement is supposed to be fighting terrorism

[00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.470]
He says so what's the latest initiative by justice and the bureau?

[00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.990]
We've declared war on pornography

[00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.290]
That's right at a time when the focus of every federal law enforcement

[00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:59.470]
Aden is supposed to be keeping this country safe from terrorists attorney general al-Bertel Gonzalez is diverting time agents and resources

[00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.430]
Into a war on dirty books and movies

[00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:08.690]
Not child pornography mind you but the kind of titillation aimed at consenting adults who last time we check are supposed to be free to do what they want in the privacy of their homes

[00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:13.730]
According to a job posting that went up at the FBI's national headquarters in all 56 field or offices

[00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:20.250]
The bureau plans to assign eight field agents plus a supervisor in all necessary resources to a porn war that the posting calls

[00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:24.490]
One of the top priorities of attorney general Gonzalez and FBI director Robert Mueller

[00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:29.610]
agents joke about the posting and make comments like already gave it home or we've met the enemy and he is us

[00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.910]
But the gallows humor does little amass a growing morale problem within the bureau

[00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:38.690]
My friend shook his head were supposed to be taken down people to one destroy this country and al-Bertel wants to turn this into a titty squad

[00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:45.730]
The TNA squad is its known among agents god it started under former attorney general's on a escrop a Bible thumping anti-pornography zealot

[00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:49.370]
Who tried to prosecute a Missouri couple for selling a sex education video for adults

[00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:55.070]
Ascrops case was so laughable it took a jury of mostly middle-aged women less than 45 minutes to equip the couple

[00:45:55.070 --> 00:46:00.010]
The judge lectured the justice department for wasting the legal systems time with such a frivolous case

[00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:06.570]
But Gonzalez armed with a mandate from the rabid right wingers who control congress and the White House plans to push forward and quest to rid the world of dirty

[00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.970]
Moves another sexy stuff

[00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:14.090]
Ironically such a move could target some of the GOP's major supporters big business and conservative ideologues like rupert murdoch

[00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:19.890]
honor the conservative pseudo journalistic fox news network murdoch and general modus for example our part owners of direct tv

[00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:26.210]
The satellite broadcasting network that delivers explicit sexual programming to customers direct tv offers three channels of

[00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:31.290]
Triple-x rated movies from spice networks owned by playboy enterprises along with playboys own channel

[00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:36.730]
Which recently began offering hardcore sexual programming in fact hardcore programming is such big business that time

[00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.350]
Warner owns a piece and hotel chains like Hilton Sheraton Hyatt and even Mormon based Marriott

[00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:45.870]
Offers the sex and material to guess is a valued added service the FBI's recruiting them

[00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.290]
Most as the bureau is going after manufacturers and purveyors of pornography

[00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:54.950]
Does this mean they plan to arrest rupert murdoch and the CEO of general modus will jw bill marriott junior chairman

[00:46:54.950 --> 00:47:01.010]
The CEO of mirror international get tossed into the slamer somehow i doubt it general modus executives in their political action committee

[00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.530]
More than two and a half million dollars to the republican party causes last year

[00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:09.210]
Marriott's a major player in GOP circles when fat cat donors put that kind of money

[00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:14.550]
Politicians are more than willing to hand out the k y july drop their pants grab their ankles close their eyes and say

[00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:20.270]
Please sir may i have some more this is the real obscenity in today's america right starts comes and he's about the best

[00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:43.730]

[00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:50.530]
over again this is the song to hear over and over and over and over again how many times can

[00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:58.790]
nellie and tim agross sing over and over again five third man see there's always a good reason to

[00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:02.910]
play that I love it right anyway did I say 12 past a lot and I think I did it five sixty w two

[00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.810]
for all you time watchers out there for public baby only in Miami

[00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:16.910]
gotta have the city of new Orleans

[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.630]
big eats he got here pretty hard

[00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.370]
and

[00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:26.690]
goes

[00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.930]
All countries got to move together

[00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:36.790]
Everyone must must do our part

[00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.950]
Along the coast of Mississippi

[00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.350]
All the poor folks in the boxes

[00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:49.510]
The devastation even reached no real

[00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.810]
We want you here for your fellow land

[00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.510]
Time and land are helping hands

[00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:01.510]
Together we can make a different disaster stream

[00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.130]
On behalf of the hands

[00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:08.510]
Come on America, we need you

[00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.490]
Sit down, you know

[00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:15.330]
The moment is in hand

[00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:21.630]
We have got the hell to stay on the going

[00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:25.810]
It's bad at time like this

[00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.330]
United we must stay in

[00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.770]
So the death toll from Katrina on the Gulf

[00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.770]
801 in Louisiana and a total of 1035

[00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.150]
What happened to those 25,000 body bags

[00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.110]
In the 10,000 dead just in Nullingham?

[00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.230]
It gives you the feeling they haven't got a clue

[00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.990]
What they're talking about

[00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.670]
Especially that mayor, Nagan

[00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.430]
Man, he is just, I feel almost sorry for him

[00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.230]
Because he's drowning in a sea of incompetence

[00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.510]
He's in way over his head

[00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:53.950]
And he's under all this tremendous pressure

[00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.070]
By the business people and the bar owners

[00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.630]
And this ethnic group and the metath group

[00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.030]
And he don't know what a screamer appeal of banana

[00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.030]
Everybody come on back, come on back

[00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:04.650]
Turn around and get out

[00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:05.570]
Turn around and get out

[00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.870]
And now it's like well, they don't go to the clue

[00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.450]
They don't go to Houston whatever you do

[00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:12.390]
In fact Houston just ordered the low-lying areas to evacuate

[00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.070]
And Galveston never will ever get to that

[00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:14.890]
Or maybe not

[00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:17.230]
I got a big pile here, although the most important story

[00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.770]
Even the Sun centralized you got on this

[00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:19.970]
Although I had it first

[00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:23.030]
A rubber company in China has begun marketing condoms

[00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:24.710]
Under the brand name Clinton and Lewinsky

[00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:25.770]
Condoms

[00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.810]
Apparently seeking to exploit the White House affair

[00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:30.170]
The led to the impeachment of America's 42nd president

[00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.610]
Because he was doing all those nasty things

[00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:33.870]
Unlike this current president

[00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.690]
The only said well senator

[00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.790]
The administration's policy was as I atticulate

[00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.730]
It was my job to articulate the administration's policy

[00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.210]
That's no answer at all

[00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:44.930]
Let him have a tent, stick it to him baby

[00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:47.630]
In fact maybe Ted can drive John Roberts home after the hearing

[00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:49.750]
He said after the promotion ends

[00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.730]
The Clinton condoms will go on sale in southern China for 29.81

[00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.650]
That's $3.72 for a box of 12

[00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:56.950]
Well let's see a box of 12

[00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.270]
That's about how many cents a piece?

[00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.250]
About 3rd man

[00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.730]
While the Lewinsky model will be priced at 18.81

[00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:03.990]
That's $2.35 for his end quality

[00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:05.670]
The Clinton condom will be our top at line

[00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.990]
He said the Lewinsky condom is not quite so good

[00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.910]
It's got maybe three or four holes in it

[00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.910]
The Lewinsky said the company had chosen to use the Clinton name

[00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.850]
Because consumers viewed the former president as a responsible person

[00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.530]
Who would want to stress safe sex

[00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.910]
Is an effective way to prevent the spread of the HIV virus

[00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:21.310]
The names we chose are symbols of people who are responsible

[00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.970]
And dedicated to their jobs he said

[00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.870]
I believe Bill Clinton cannot be unhappy about this

[00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.490]
Because he's a very generous man

[00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.750]
The Lewinsky name is Constituent

[00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.310]
A violation of copyright or other laws

[00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.490]
We have received full approval from the local industrial and commercial bureau

[00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.790]
To start production he said

[00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.390]
Clinton's campaign aggressively for high-dates in China

[00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.790]
Where the disease is spreading rapidly like wildfire

[00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.490]
At 7.00 am

[00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.270]
There you go, bubble sees all over the place

[00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.490]
Just take a peek in there man

[00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.990]
Bubbles in there too, he's all over

[00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:49.110]
He's in your crotch

[00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:51.670]
555 votes you see

[00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.370]
That I just peeked out of the corner my eye

[00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.630]
I just knew there was a momentous number on that pool

[00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.890]
Five, six to the way we're like over 80% of the way

[00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:59.910]
That are like 666

[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.730]
And well on the way to our 15,000 votes on the pool today

[00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.390]
As we start record breaking numbers

[00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.370]
I bet you we did an 80 share in this book

[00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.510]
You know what? That's probably because you were on most of the summer

[00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.290]
Yeah right

[00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.950]
It all was intellectual people

[00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:11.750]
Yeah

[00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:16.370]
Max Bear senior the old boxer was Max Bear junior

[00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:18.230]
Jettro Bodai's father you see

[00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.270]
Bodini

[00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.370]
Don't you like this?

[00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:21.790]
Don't do that have to comment

[00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:23.730]
Vincent Dottorfeo was Pyle

[00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.890]
I wonder if he was kind to Gomer's Piles

[00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.670]
The fat kid who shot the sergeant

[00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.150]
And kill himself in full metal jacket

[00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:31.070]
Every man in black and detective on law order

[00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.230]
Criminal intent Vincent and offriol

[00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.870]
He's a very good guy

[00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:34.410]
He's a very good guy

[00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:35.310]
Wow

[00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:40.690]
Wow

[00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:42.690]
I get goosebumps when I hear this

[00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.870]
And then I think the best daughter of a world buddy

[00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:45.530]
It's a man

[00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:47.390]
It's a good show

[00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.190]
Actually good guy

[00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:51.250]
Really good really good show

[00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.650]
Good actors and good script

[00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:53.610]
And out you have a diamond

[00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.030]
Oh one of the talking heads

[00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.590]
At the yesterday she called

[00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.190]
And our fat ass governor on her

[00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.070]
She says governor Jed Bush

[00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.270]
Oh my god I thought is that like Jed a diamond?

[00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:11.110]
In fact the way his family is behaving again lately here

[00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.130]
Wouldn't you think the Jed a diamond be a good name for that claim?

[00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:14.590]
All right

[00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.630]
Oh

[00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.630]

[00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.630]

[00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:20.450]
Oh

[00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:21.350]
Oh

[00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:31.210]
Here comes a big part of a big plan actually

[00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:40.770]
Wow powerful stuff man

[00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.690]
And then a crappy show I close the show TV

[00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.370]
They always give me the big you know the big build up and then they let you down

[00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.730]
Yeah, probably know some women like that a lot

[00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.070]
Sensor the name of the Lord conservative Christians read in Hollywood blockbusters

[00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:55.510]
Do I have time to do this because this is to I just have so many of these near long today

[00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.970]
You know what that means I'm going to be doing a lot of reading which is not good

[00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.030]
Miguel will not be listening to the show today. Thank God

[00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.030]
I just I'm tired of him you know I'm just tired of his crap

[00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.610]
Not that I should take it personal anyway because who the hell cares what he thinks

[00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.330]
But it's just I don't know he's just annoying

[00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:11.150]
He's he's always Mr. Contrary you know he's Mr. Contrary in kind of a nice way

[00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:12.030]
He's opposed to some people

[00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:19.990]
He doesn't a nice way but it's still the same effect you know like hey what you're doing sucks you know well get lost

[00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:25.430]
Take take I go over listen to how do you mom be that's more of your alley Sally get back any your inner

[00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.970]
Chew

[00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:31.430]
Little way baby maybe he can bring back alienito and then we'll have something to talk about in fact if I look back at

[00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:37.410]
Some of those early polls maybe amazed how many of them have to do with poor little alienito and the abuelas and the all of this stuff all like crap

[00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:44.830]
And guess what that was a private family matter what seems to me as your governor would say your fat ass governor it was a custody hearing just like Terry and her

[00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:50.250]
She's a private family matter but he sure had no problem talking about that and opening up a big fat ass mouth

[00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:53.790]
But when it comes to his own dysfunctional family and his kid getting busted for a

[00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.510]
Broken episode again. It's a private family matter and no well. That's a private family matter

[00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.950]
Yeah, Joe Connison writes in New York observer Bush White House a Haven for hacks. See I'm gonna do this one because it's short

[00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:09.710]
It's not real short hurry back when Republicans still behave like Republicans and conservatives actually believe in conservatism

[00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:17.350]
These those are worth these aspire to bring us with a consider to be good government among other things that might appointing officials qualified to execute their positions maintaining fiscal

[00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:21.870]
Responsibility and insisting on public integrity this reality frequently fail to fulfill those aspirations

[00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:27.910]
Of course, but at least they tried now we live under a distorted assembly of Republican conservatism with an attitude to a government that seems

[00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:35.490]
Incidental and fundamentally nihilistic or is that nihilistic as in deal good this approach was summed up years ago by the right wing commander in White House

[00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:43.750]
Advisor Grover Norquist when he explained his movements long term objective my goal is to cut government in half in 25 years to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub

[00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:52.250]
Before drowning it however, he and his comrades will pick its pockets led by George W. Boy today's conservators have elevated political patronage from a universal and tolerable

[00:59:52.250 --> 01:00:00.110]
Techadillo to a public menace so intent are they and providing lucrative comfortable federal jobs to the members of their own gang that they have come to resemble the old clubhouse Democrats of

[01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:08.110]
Tamini Hall the difference is that Tamini for all its corruption provided employment and benefits to the poor while the Bush White House reserves its patronage for the well fed and well healed

[01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.130]
The result is incompetence looked over with arrogance and inexperienced guided by ideology

[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:17.350]
Sharing the outlook of Mr. Norquist the president is scarcely tried to find capable managers for the federal bureaucracy

[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:25.070]
He shares the right wing radical right wing objective of dismantling government institutions rather than managing them properly and effectively at every level he appoints loyal

[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:29.370]
Hacks who possess no relevant qualifications so long as they share his anti-government ideology

[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:37.050]
This is like putting termites in charge of repairing the house the latest example is David Saviefian who suddenly resigned last week his top procurement official at the White House

[01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:46.330]
OMB on September 19th it was arrested by FBI agents for lying about his involvement with lobbyist Jack Abramoff whom he helped to obtain control over federal properties in the district of clumbia and Maryland

[01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:51.530]
He's a former lobbyist whose partners in the private sector included both Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Norquist

[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.410]
No doubt the intended Mr. Saviefian is like his friends a true believer in drowning government

[01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:59.090]
He had a little or no administrative experience but he had the right friends in the right wing ideology

[01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:03.630]
And like Tamini's immortal George Washington plunkett he saw his opportunities and took him

[01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:07.790]
I wonder if he was kind of who is the quarterback the Indian guy plunkett Jim plunkett

[01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:12.130]
Before your time Josh Jim plunkett you know Jim plunkett I've heard I'm so embarrassed

[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:19.550]
Where's that wanton or is that wonton paper it becomes terribly perilous as we've recently learned is in making appointments to agencies that are supposed to protect the nation

[01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:30.350]
Everybody knows about the strange rise and fall of Michael D Brownie Brown and FEMA but what if Michael shirt off the Secretary of Homeland Security who may well be as much to blame as Mr. Brown for the fumble federal response to Katrina

[01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:36.470]
Reporting by a nightrider news service or the Mr. shirt off froze when the auto of mobilized government during the crucial hours leading up to the disaster

[01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.750]
Among the reasons for his failure is that he too lacked qualification for the job

[01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:44.570]
He's a highly capable lawyer which may have caused him to dither over legalistic questions of state and federal authority

[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.750]
But he has few credentials to write an enormous and critically important bureaucracy

[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:54.510]
From the perspective of the Bush White House the outstanding item on Mr. Cheroff's resume is his partisan hazard work on the Senate white water committee

[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:59.550]
The Homeland Security Chief certainly isn't the only member of the White Water Alumni Club to find gainful employment under Mr. Bush

[01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:08.690]
From James Rogan the former impeachment manager appointed to run the patent office after losing his house seat to Brett Kavanaugh, the former so-heal independent council with services staff secretary to the president

[01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:16.810]
Many who joined the GOP G-HOT against the buttons have since suckled on the federal teeth only days ago the president named Julie Myers a 36-year-old Republican attorney

[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:19.550]
The head of the immigration and customs enforcement agency within Homeland Security

[01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.890]
She used to be Mr. Cheroff's chief of staff and she also used to work for Kenny Star

[01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:30.090]
But she has no discernible background that would enable her to oversee a law enforcement agency with 20,000 employees and a $4 billion budget

[01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:37.030]
I will seek to work with those who are more knowledgeable in this area who know more than I do she said when asked how she expected to do her new job at confirmed by the Senate

[01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:45.130]
Surely she meant to sound reassuring but an age of terror why wouldn't the president appoint someone more knowledgeable and more experienced over-ciaro borders and ports over

[01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.750]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.730]
This is 5.6.2.8

[01:02:53.890 --> 01:03:02.890]
Trump is singing the green acres theme of the Emmys and now he's expanding his musical empire with a new CD, Trump's TV themes

[01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:15.070]
Here's the story of a man named Brady who made an absolute killing by adopting three more tax deductible children and by the way, Alice, you fight it

[01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.010]
Lead your replacement, Juanita

[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:21.970]
From the Brady bunch to the Beverly Hill Millies, the Donald saved them all

[01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.610]
Coming this is a story about a man named Jim

[01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:32.810]
The guy moves into a mansion in Beverly Hills, the town is crawling with beautiful women and he can't hook up what gives

[01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:36.830]
The TV tycoon even tackles the theme to Gilligan's Island

[01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:45.170]
Just sit like back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of some morons who sailed in bad weather on a boat that smaller than my dinghy

[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:48.170]
Trump's TV themes is available at Trump Tower Records

[01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:52.330]
And if it does well, I'll make Martha Stewart do her own version

[01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.390]
599 vote, man, it's just 1134

[01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:58.710]
I like that, oh that was my imitation of Tom Jic on here

[01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:03.430]
Because I got a fan from Chris here says Monday Tom Jic was sucking Steve Payne's butt for half an hour

[01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:06.410]
Most of the conversation was about you and your obsession with Steve

[01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:09.570]
Oh yeah, I'm obsessed with Steve. Talk about the popcorn and kettle pink

[01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:10.650]
Steve, who?

[01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:13.490]
See this is what Tommy and he's relegated to now

[01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:16.450]
You know what's in a great while filling in for Eddie Kay on a gambling show late at night

[01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:20.570]
And now being a guest on the Mr. Ego show which you could put the whole audience in a phone booth

[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.510]
See this is how you find out, Sherry Woods, see that was a friend

[01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:25.390]
Linda Thornton, that was a friend

[01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:30.610]
Even Pat Curry, even though she was obnoxious, she was more friendly than this guy

[01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:31.350]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:37.010]
But this guy has a time you're not fooling anybody, you're sure not fooling me anymore, you're a turncoat, you're a backstabber, you're a phony

[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:40.550]
So now it's not just business, it's personal too, your mama, small potatoes

[01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:43.750]
And quite frankly don't write about radio because you know anything about it anyway

[01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.070]
What's happening in radio is passed him by so far going, he just doesn't understand it

[01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.790]
He don't even get this show, and that's good

[01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:55.230]
By Tom, here's a fact from Frank in St. Petersburg who says, please add David Schwimmer

[01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.670]
Absolutely the more a worst actor ever, David Schwimmer

[01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.970]
Okay, you got him, we got him

[01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:02.830]
But there's so what's in many?

[01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.130]
Bill Schneider, sounds like Schwimmer

[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:08.730]
This is Phil but really I mean the president at the end of the day won the election

[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.790]
Part of the job is he gets a name who you want

[01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:13.270]
There she goes, there's Mrs. Limbaugh

[01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.870]
Uh huh, he used to be liberal Mrs. Limbaugh, Darren Limbaugh, Kagan, you bitch

[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.750]
How do you like that?

[01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.790]
Yeah, he's got that kind of cock-eyed sour look on her face

[01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:23.730]
And Bill Schneider has been pretty good lately, he's a Yamada, that's what he said

[01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:30.070]
The Whisperers began as soon as Renee Zellwood decided fraud as the reasons he wanted to brief marriage to the country star Kenny Chesney and Ald

[01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:33.670]
Was Chesney gay this Thursday, this is the Boston hero was Chesney gay

[01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:40.550]
His publish is quickly denied the rumor saying the man behind hits like she thinks my tractor is sexy is unequipically not gay

[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:44.250]
But such speculation begs the question, could an openly gay

[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:50.990]
May a singer make it in Nashville in 2005 and could an openly already popular star come out as Zell and John did without losing his audience

[01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:56.670]
The answer is Greg Alden, co-editor of the all country magazine, no depression is no and no

[01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:02.130]
He believes coming out after hitting the top of the charts would absolutely be a career killer

[01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.010]
Somebody thanks this, thank you so much

[01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:10.790]
One of the formal constructs in country music is authenticity, Alden said, and when you break that illusion you've destroyed your career

[01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:15.950]
Mike Brophy, not the hockey guy, but program director of local country music station WKLB

[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:23.110]
Is more optimistic about musicians coming out and saying popular but he says the caveat in there is that I think it might be geographically specific

[01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:26.490]
I think in terms of where we are in the Northeast, absolutely, is what he says

[01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:27.010]
Absolutely

[01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:30.130]
But he believes the quality of music wins out over politically touchy issues

[01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:32.950]
The bottom line is a good song, is a good song, is a good song, Brophy said

[01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:36.230]
And if someone has a great song out there, we're going to play it, it's going to be widely accepted

[01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:40.310]
But that's in Boston, keep in mind, all those pink ol' liberal fags up there

[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:40.830]
Right

[01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.930]
I think for some of those established and has a lot of great music behind them is probably an easier road

[01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:49.170]
But if they're brand new and they have to be familiarized with the audience, then maybe it's going to be more difficult road

[01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:52.370]
But in this day and age I'd love to believe that it's not an issue at all, right?

[01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:57.070]
This is no-one-to-economy music, it's you virtually no successful musician in any genre

[01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.150]
Jazz, blues, rock, metal, rapper, pop has started out openly gay

[01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.310]
But there's a long list of marquee names who would happily center for gay pride now

[01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:09.910]
Elton, John, George, Michael, Melissa, Osathridge, the integral girls, Michael, Stype of R.E.M. and Rob Halford of Duda's priest

[01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:13.910]
As much as that sexual orientation is someone accepted in the society says Alden

[01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:18.250]
When you start thinking about places where it's still unacceptable, that's just telling you's anything

[01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.570]
That's America's T-Murphynephan Way, baby

[01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:26.890]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you will stick in a couple of calls in here because I don't want to read too many stories than Tom Zick will get really upset

[01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.330]
Isn't this something the way he turned, man, to talk about turning on a dime?

[01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:33.490]
First he can cocks that phony letter, which now I know for sure is phony

[01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.530]
He's just looking for some publicity, I guess

[01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:40.590]
Your old news, Tom, ancient history, anybody that would go on that show? Of course he used to go on with Sandy too

[01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.430]
Oh, lovely lady, oh Sandy

[01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:51.350]
608 votes on the pool, I'm excited, the worst TV actor actress ever was is Donald Trump 65, Chuck Nora 65, a flatfooted dead even Thai

[01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:58.890]
How do you like that? We got a race baby Tony Danza 47, Terry Spelling 44, I'll just read a few, Bob Sagitt 34, Mr. T-28

[01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:04.130]
And that's enough, should we take a call or two? Because I got a heavy upile here, somebody QAM hello

[01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.350]
Oh, Neil? Yes, sir

[01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:10.630]
In the Sun Central today they had a great story and mice with spinal cord injuries warped because of the stem cell injection

[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.930]
This stuff really works, the Republican said it wouldn't work

[01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:13.350]
Yeah

[01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:15.530]
And uh, baby killer

[01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:20.770]
Yeah, but if they think it does work and eventually in 10 years people will be able to walk but they don't care

[01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:24.130]
One more thing on the daily show last week, they did a whole thing on evolution

[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:27.190]
And Christians on tape saying dinosaurs were walking with Adam and Eve

[01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:30.170]
They did a great show, they destroyed the story of Adam and Eve, it was just great

[01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.330]
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Adam and Eve, I thought that was Adam and Steve

[01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:36.070]
God created Adam and Eve, God Adam and Steve

[01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:40.230]
You know something that religious people are 100 times, 100,000 times crazier than I ever said on this show

[01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:40.650]
Yeah

[01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:46.490]
That's what we need, in fact every day that's all you need to do here and say is religion is bullcrap, man invented God and stop with a balloony

[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.730]
Okay?

[01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:51.290]
There's no life after death, there's no God sitting up there with all these horrendous game plans

[01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:57.030]
There's no Jesus on the cross, it's all a bunch of somebody once told me a very wise man many years ago, bubble miceies

[01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:58.750]
Fairy tales, fairy tales

[01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.330]
That's it, fairy tales

[01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:04.670]
There in Kagan, she's off my list right now, you see I told her it would rub off her and rush

[01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.510]
Yeah, what did she do?

[01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:09.750]
She was always supposed to be so liberal and the other, and I'm here sitting there, sucking up

[01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:13.570]
Well, listen to you have the right to name any, yeah, how about Mickey Mouse, he could be director of Fima Honey

[01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:18.070]
How about you, there at least you get you off the damn tube for crying out loud, get her a push off our...

[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.590]
CUBE

[01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:25.230]
This is Neil Roger, this is 5'16 QAV

[01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.310]
Get more, harder, I'm a young person, get it harder

[01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.970]
Oh my god, your breasts are beautiful

[01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:33.570]
Congratulations, get alive

[01:09:55.230 --> 01:10:00.010]
The store I go to station, I got a ride me on the face

[01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:05.170]
Takes a lot of zest presentties, or just a few of us at chains

[01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:10.370]
Take a look, get engaged, and he points in to eat

[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:15.170]
But I feel love, don't you worry baby, we'll get a 40-E

[01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:19.470]
We'll move it all up, we'll go on up, we'll drive you to high

[01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:28.330]
We'll move it all up, we'll drive you to high

[01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:31.510]
We'll move it all up, we'll drive you to high

[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.690]
We'll take all these things out

[01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:40.210]
Thanks again, I'll present to you for those bargain-basement gas prices

[01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.810]
14-Gallonic, and more from New York at 2

[01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:47.110]
Can't wait to miss that, 619 votes on here, if we get to 650 by the top of the hour

[01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:50.490]
I think we got a shot, don't you think that's the dividing line, the barometer, the gauge?

[01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:54.590]
623, like I said, we got to be able to do that, get to 650 by noon

[01:10:55.110 --> 01:11:01.310]
You can do it, Ryan Perry, a US correspondent in New York for the UK mirror rights, up in flames

[01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:04.930]
Tons of British aid donated to help Hurricane Katrina victims to be burned by Americans

[01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:10.170]
Hundreds of tons of British food, a chip to America for starving Hurricane Katrina survivors is to be burned

[01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:13.590]
Because US red tape is stopping it from reaching hungry evacuaries

[01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:21.690]
Instead, tons of the badly needed NATO ration packs, the same as those eaten by British troops in Iraq, have been condemned as unfit for human consumption

[01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:24.390]
Or maybe they have some of that spotted in it, you think?

[01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.370]
And unless the bureaucratic message cleared up soon, it could be sent for incineration

[01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:33.870]
One British aid worker last night called the most sickening senselessness and said furious colleagues were spitting blood

[01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:35.590]
When we, that's why they don't want the food

[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:41.010]
The food which cost British taxpayers millions of sitting inside of a huge warehouse idol

[01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:45.510]
After the FDA, we called it when already had been left to be distributed

[01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.530]
Scores of lorries, what is that? What are lorries? That's some British crap

[01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:50.890]
Truck trucks

[01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.890]
Hended back to a warehouse in Little Rock, Arkansas, in up in an FDA incineration plant

[01:11:54.890 --> 01:12:00.370]
The Ministry of Defense in London said last night that 400,000 operational ration packs have been shipped to the US

[01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:06.270]
But officials blame the US Department of Agriculture, which impounded the ship and under regulations, relating to the important export of meat

[01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:12.510]
The aid worker who would not be named said this is the most appalling act of sickening senselessness white people while people starve

[01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:16.910]
The FDA is recalled aid from Britain because it's been condemned as unfit for human consumption

[01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:22.650]
Despite the fact that these are native approved ration of exactly the same type that the British soldiers are eating in Iraq

[01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.950]
Under NATO American soldiers are also entitled to eat such ration

[01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:30.610]
Yet the starving of the American South will see them grow up and smoke because of FDA red tape madness

[01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:36.830]
The worker added, and I'll have to edit this, there will be a cloud of smoke above Little Rock soon, a verne food of anger and of shame

[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:43.270]
That the world's richest nation couldn't organize a pee-up in a brewery and let's American starve while they arrogantly observe petty regulations

[01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:46.070]
Doesn't say pee, but we don't want to get joist right

[01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:51.770]
Everyone is be voted by the chaotic shambles the US is making of this crisis guys from UNICEF are walking around spitting blood

[01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:53.970]
A lot of people spitting blood everywhere

[01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.150]
This is utter madness he said people who work their socks off to get food in the region

[01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:05.470]
It's perfectly good NATO approved food the type British servicemen have yet the FDA are saying that because there's a meat content it's come from Britain it must be destroyed

[01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:13.070]
If they're trying to argue that there's a BSE reason and it's ludicrously out of date there's more BSE in the states than there ever was in Britain and UK meats been saved for years

[01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:14.170]
That's mad cow

[01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:19.490]
The Ministry of Defense said we understand there was a glitch and these packs have been impounded by the US Department of Agriculture under regulations

[01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:28.490]
really into the important export of meat that British meat fat the situation is changing all the time and our last meeting on Friday we were told progress was being made in relation to the release of these packs

[01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:33.910]
He said the Americans certainly haven't indicated it was there are any more problems and they haven't asked us to take them back they're just in limbo

[01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:41.070]
They're doing the old rush limbo rock food from Spain and Italy is also being held because it fails to meet US standards has been judged on fit for human consumption

[01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.770]
You know I can't understand how those damn Europeans are still alive can you? It's amazing

[01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:50.870]
It's a miracle every time I go but actually all these living healthy people and aren't nearly as fat as the most of us Americans they and Canadians

[01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:57.090]
And as really relief agencies are furious that thousands of gallons of paradeuse are to be destroyed because it's been judged on fit

[01:13:57.670 --> 01:13:58.110]
Paradeuse

[01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.230]
Mad cow disease, mad paradeuse

[01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:02.990]
Boy oh boy, mad cow pair, mad parade disease

[01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:05.690]
The FDA said we didn't really got to watch out for every pair

[01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:09.030]
We didn't expect some meals ready to be done September 13th

[01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:13.470]
They said they are the only MREs we looked at there were 70 huge pallets of vegetarian MREs

[01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:17.670]
They were from a foreign nation we inspected them and released them for distribution because they didn't have any meat in it

[01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:20.050]
But that European meat oh god don't touch it

[01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:28.310]
It's a uncircum spec and in line with that the federal government is diverting hundreds of truckloads of bag dice cubes from the Gulf Coast hurricane relief

[01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:30.290]
Effort to cold storage in Portland, Maine, other cities

[01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:31.630]
They can use them there

[01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:36.890]
FEMA says it has more ice than it can use in the hurricane zone wants to keep it in storage for use in a future emergency

[01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:43.650]
Maine ought to be really good but critics including some truck drivers who've been paying 800 bucks a day while hauling the same loads for a week or more say

[01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:46.050]
The process seems like a waste of taxpayers money

[01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:50.710]
The $9,000 that paying the meat to move this load should have gone to some family down there said Lauren Reeves

[01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:54.310]
Who hauled his load of ice from New York state to Alabama before being set to Maine

[01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.310]
There's definitely millions being wasted that could go to people who needed

[01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:03.230]
Reeves truck was one of several lined up at AmeriCold logistics refrigerated storage facility on Reed Street in Portland

[01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:06.130]
Unloading pallets deck with 25 pound bags

[01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:07.130]
How do you like that?

[01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:08.050]
I don't know

[01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:15.990]
Yeah, most people in Texas are going to be really pleased to know that in fact it says in the article that the stuff has been shipped to not just in Maine

[01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:20.630]
Also Tennessee and Pennsylvania for hurricane relief is very imminent at that moment

[01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:22.230]
They can almost take about it right?

[01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:23.410]
No, really

[01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:27.470]
637 on the pool the question today is we're bringing back some of these old pools in manna

[01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:29.790]
I think this solved a whole bunch of problems for me

[01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:30.190]
Yeah

[01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:32.370]
I hope for you too when you're to fill in

[01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:32.690]
Right?

[01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:37.410]
Go back to that history there and as a matter of fact I can tell you the first pool we ever took

[01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.530]
At least according to the first one that's on this list

[01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:42.650]
When Neil goes on another one of his frequent vacations what do you want to hear?

[01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:43.370]
We asked

[01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:47.030]
That's back I guess when we're still finding those best updates that Greg likes so much better than you

[01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.490]
Right

[01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:51.590]
That nobody wanted to hear and that I hated like poison because they were like chopped up in a bunch of crevino

[01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.570]
And all dated you know, alien in the Pope

[01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.290]
Let's talk about alien in the Pope

[01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:56.870]
He would have liked anything better than me

[01:15:56.870 --> 01:16:02.950]
Well of course has waned under the game what do you think about the macarena and of course it's undergoing 75 name changes since that pool

[01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.110]
But that's just a good idea

[01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:07.150]
Who has hassled you more in your life and hassled his spelled with a T

[01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:08.850]
How do you like the castle?

[01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:11.690]
Who gets more ass?

[01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:15.990]
Now when you click on that it was only a that was one of those picky polls that we do before the show

[01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:19.830]
You know one of those preliminary four plate and it was the gators of the seminals

[01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:22.210]
And the it was tied 31 apiece

[01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:26.070]
I guess we should have put the heurichains in there too don't you think because asses their middle name

[01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:28.090]
Especially after that game against Clemson

[01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:29.970]
Oh my god triple overtime

[01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:34.730]
And they really they should have lost that game that kid was so wide open you could have like driven a mac truck through there

[01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:35.630]
Am I right Josh?

[01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:36.550]
Yes you are

[01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:41.130]
They should have lost that game by all count once again they got off the hook for all time say

[01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:46.890]
Because it was too embarrassing and too debilitating for the people of South Florida for the heurichains to start out with a

[01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:52.250]
And too record that would have been really bad embarrassing aren't we cursed down here they'd been caught up the mad dog saying

[01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:58.130]
Do you know why we cursed down here we got that downtown Ronnie Brown who looks like a flash in the old frying pan

[01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:04.310]
And he got Gus whatever his name is a zerniel for rot we don't like a lot pretty embarrassing

[01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:07.890]
But after that one half of a ball man who were pretty worked up to a frenzy weren't they?

[01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.050]
Let's start with the panthers come on they're gonna be good

[01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:11.990]
I'm telling you I'm smelling you right now

[01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.850]
Where's my panther tickets by the way?

[01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:15.090]
Because Josh wants some

[01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:18.770]
Well you really I tell you you really are getting pretty brazen in your old age

[01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:19.570]
Oh yeah

[01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:25.690]
I just mentioned a panther tickets here saying here's a guy who's not really a hockey fan name me three players on the panthers

[01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:27.770]
Roberto L'Owango

[01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.990]
Right only Yokinan

[01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:31.730]
Right you can do it

[01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.350]
That's too I think you might I think that's all I know

[01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:39.510]
But you see that's a good plug is now if you go to the games you could become a fan

[01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:42.750]
I feel like I know the name of the rookie I just can't think of it

[01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:47.790]
The rookie or you mean like the jane bolster the second I know that I know a point how about Horton

[01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:56.250]
There you go that's what I don't know it huh I knew there and what about Gary Roberts and Joe Newen Deic former make believe okay huh what about those guys Chris

[01:17:56.250 --> 01:18:01.930]
Gratton huh what about that frog that they got what tells his name Marta Angelina nothing could be

[01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:05.890]
Finder than to get out of Carolina that's what he said he's been around now they got a good team this year

[01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:12.890]
I'm telling you all enjoy going to some of those games and I'm sure George can arrange he'll arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families right five six seven

[01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:20.030]
Oh five 60 pound five 60 how's that pull coming are we gonna make our thousand today that that's our goal we don't care about anything else nothing else counts

[01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:27.450]
We don't give a crap about Tom jica mystery go Burton jacks pepper corn sauce on your parmesan cheese we don't care about any of that swill okay

[01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:32.870]
All these wannabes man the whole thing in this market is there so many wannabes so many little

[01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:37.330]
New years and they're in the right town for that that's why this show is like heads and show and voters above

[01:18:37.330 --> 01:18:39.970]
Because we probably could have made it big like even in like Lakeland

[01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:46.710]
Ooh you think well we're in Key West back when the tower was underground I was thinking about that yesterday with a big blow was coming from Rita and I was thinking boy

[01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:50.970]
I think it just knocked the tower that station again maybe they'll sign all castes again people wouldn't believe that

[01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:57.090]
Josh probably doesn't know that story but we're an IOD that to show you the great job of networking my show has been done over the years

[01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:02.670]
They sign all castes I don't remember how long it was for about two weeks on a station in Key West that it had the tower knockout

[01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:08.270]
The tower was laying in a horizontal prone position on the ground in the water if yeah it was laying into water on the ground

[01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:13.910]
That's the way to get you out there. Yeah, so we made a tremendous impact in Key West even read in there couldn't come close to this show

[01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:19.650]
649 which means we're going over 650 by noon so we got a shot the worst TV actor actress

[01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:25.550]
Ever was or is and there's just too many to run down them all about to take us to one Chuck Norris 70 down from 68

[01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:28.830]
We've got a real battle going on between the two. What is the thing with Chuck Norris?

[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:35.390]
I don't you know, I mean he is awful, but yeah, but not not nowhere near as bad as as it looks on this Donald Trump

[01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:40.550]
Tony Danza 40 Danza there you go. He's he's nauseating. He in fact

[01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:44.650]
I think I think that throwing up gotty and Tony Danza like right in the day and what about her?

[01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:45.870]
What about her?

[01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.770]
Victoria's that her name Victoria gotty. I guess she qualified

[01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:54.410]
He's on a full-for-line out like a racer on air man. She makes me nauseous

[01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:58.450]
What are a lot of people make you nauseous? Yeah, that's true a lot of make me just want to caca

[01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.470]
I just threw the log away. Am I doing this spot here?

[01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:04.050]

[01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:08.050]
George Armstrong number 10 the old Elise captain the chief

[01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:44.810]

I mean if this happened once it would be one thing to say well, you know crap happens good happen anywhere

[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:54.510]
Even at a real radio station which we are not but this is so embarrassing and humiliating and degrading and it just goes on

[01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:58.670]
Remind me to rip Hank and ask when we do the crossover tomorrow about that thing at engineering

[01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:00.990]
He's a no so they can fix the toilet big deal

We get a pummer to fix the toilet. How about fixing the equipment that's like on the hero would be good fix it try again

[01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:11.450]
Look at it. It's the 12 to war now. We're yeah at least for today

[01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:19.250]
Coming to Alza Zira TV this fall survivor is law make law each week sixteen female contestants will try to survive

[01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:25.150]
Horses law make law as they compete in luxury reward challenges just outside the holy city of Mecca

[01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:31.450]
This will be the top of a survivor ever see women try to steal bread from a local baker without getting their hand chopped off

[01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:39.170]
One lucky contestant can win immunity if she can get behind the wheel of a car without getting bayonet in the head

[01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:47.890]
And how about saying nice things about Jews in front of a Muslim clinic without getting shot on sight

[01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:54.150]
So to any of the Alza Zira TV this fall for the premiere of survivor is love it's TV

[01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:58.230]
Bravo three six hundred and seventy seven votes

[01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:03.270]
evacuating in Galveston and Glenn Campbell's all excited about it are they glad way to thank

[01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:09.470]
Well, no, I mean they got like they had yesterday to start working and now all day today all day tomorrow all day on Friday

[01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:13.590]
Really most of the day Friday because it's posted like on Saturday maybe eight o'clock at night

[01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:16.590]
Okay, so they got plenty of time there in Texas no more excuses

[01:24:17.150 --> 01:24:21.710]
No excuses now. Let's see who wrote this Andrew Gumball in the independent. How come all the good stuff is in those

[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:23.210]
Brit papers huh?

[01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:29.570]
Quasit it it says what are these in mind the US Christian conservatives to do if they want to watch a film without of sitting their sensibilities now

[01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:33.550]
They can watch their favorite blockbusters trip to many sex and violence thanks to two new companies

[01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:39.170]
He says a few years ago it's on American food manufacturers that there was in intriguing hole in the market to feel

[01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:44.310]
Vegetarians who wanted to eat hamburger as well remaining vegetarian or vegans without a craving for eggs salad

[01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:49.810]
Today the supermarkets are filled with bean curd-based meatless burgers and eggless eggs salads and they're hot sellers

[01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:53.070]
Vegan cafes or that veg and I say vegan you say veg and vegan

[01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:58.190]
I notice vegan cafes both menus filled with bacon steak all manner of other forbidden items that have been made

[01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:01.330]
Safe for the meat of verse as with food so it is with films

[01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:05.490]
What are decent-minded middle American Christian conservatives to do if they have horse sex bad language

[01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:07.410]
It lists its rug use and guts-building violence

[01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:13.190]
But still haven't urged to see save it price saving part a private Ryan or Ryan's privates or good fellas or the emity fell horror

[01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:20.550]
The beginnings of an answer came a few years ago with the advent of clean flicks a kitchen-sized Utah company that decided to offer videos and DVD for rental

[01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:25.190]
After they've been edited to remove all kind headlight likely to be offensive to local Mormon population

[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:26.990]
Kind of sounds like slackbuster to me

[01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:33.610]
Today that kitchen-sized enterprises joined into a veritable industry spanning numerous states and attracting the attention to both lawyers and

[01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:39.890]
politicians all the way to Washington clean flicks is going from strength to strength offering its services on a monthly subscription basis

[01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:46.750]
Much like the wildly successful mainstream company Netflix and a second even more sophisticated company called clear play also based in Utah

[01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:51.290]
Has sprung up clear play doesn't edit the films the search for rather offers a series of filters

[01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:55.070]
So individual consumers can decide how much sex or violence they want to tolerate

[01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:59.090]
Fancy seeing a mighty win the general Christopher guest satiris booping folk music

[01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:01.310]
But without the revealing clothing no problem

[01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:05.350]
Want to see a gritty urban drama like the recently released crash which examines racism in LA

[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:09.570]
But without the implied premarital sex just press the appropriate button on your DVD menu

[01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:13.430]
And you can relax in the knowledge that all suggestions of illicit and look you've been purged ahead of time

[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:16.690]
The service is not only proof popular in conservative states like Utah

[01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:21.510]
There's some evidence that appeals to a much broader range of movie consumers especially families concerned about the content

[01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:25.590]
That Hollywood is throwing at their children even at a tender age the sanitizing companies

[01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:28.430]
Even have even set to work on Shrek and Shrek too

[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:34.450]
Finding the animated smash hits replete with squirm inducing sexual innuendo and language that may not be cursing as such

[01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:39.790]
But still too salty for their puritanical tastes the film industry is might be expected hasn't reacted well

[01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:43.270]
Starting three years ago when clean flick started making its first serious commercial in roads

[01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:48.030]
The director's building writers guilt had been railing in what they see a straightforward infringement of intellectual property

[01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:51.390]
For while the work is modified and edited all the time for broadcaster

[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:58.370]
On television or commercial plane flight for example the difference is that those modifications are done with their permission through formal licensing agreements

[01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:00.930]
Clean flicks and clearplay no ask for permission from anyone

[01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:04.570]
Arguing instead that there are adjustments and amendments fall into the category of fair use

[01:27:04.570 --> 01:27:09.110]
The two sides quickly fell into a predictable legal dispute which dragged on until earlier this year

[01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:13.110]
When the Bush administration itself decided to get involved in past the family movie act

[01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:19.770]
Which sanctioned what the sanitizers were doing and was signed it all explicitly to make the legal challenge from the Hollywood bigwigs among them

[01:27:19.770 --> 01:27:20.790]
Steven Spielsberg

[01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:27.550]
Spiegelberg Martin Scorsese and host of other first rank directors vanishing the judicial ether as far as the White House was concerned

[01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:32.810]
The law was an easy way of appealing to the Republican Party's fundamentalist Christian base and bashing one of its favorite targets

[01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:38.050]
Hollywood's free speech liberals those liberal spin-meisters quite a few Democrats jumped on board as well

[01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:42.010]
Probably because of a perceived need to defer to the conservative family value as agenda

[01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:48.270]
And partly because the bill also embraced a handful of anti-piracy provisions that the film industry was seeing a keen to see entered in the law

[01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:54.750]
From a cultural point of view though the debate has left several questions unanswered one if people really don't like watching films where characters behave badly

[01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:58.970]
Great alcohol have sex or slice each other with carving knives. Why don't they simply avoid them altogether

[01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:05.050]
Two aren't they complaining to very different issues of protecting children from Hollywood and Namity and modeling the work of genuine film artists

[01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:12.690]
So I have a specific vision to express and a specific way to express it and three if Christian fundamentalists are really so sensitive about entertainment products featuring distinctly

[01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:17.170]
Non-Christian behavior how come the Bible belt watches television shows like desperate housewives

[01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:22.130]
About a group of bored that drug-addled adulterous suburban women more avidly than any other region in the country

[01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:26.890]
The hypocrisies of excessive puritanism have been an irresistible spectator sport for centuries

[01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:30.890]
Not in just the US and the advent of the DVD profanity police is no exception

[01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:36.510]
Part of the fun of visiting the clearplay website over and about the intriguing categories available for censorship censorship

[01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:42.870]
What one wonders qualifies as a non-graphic injury-slash wound is seeing where the content police were forced to give up

[01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:47.270]
The sight listing for crash for example includes this line filter settings not available

[01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:53.290]
Ethnic and social slurs in a film preoccupied at the point of obsession with racist attitudes and behavior one would think not

[01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:57.010]
But surely someone somewhere will take offense still the clean flick site

[01:28:57.010 --> 01:29:01.830]
It's about choice streams the banner headline is even funnier when it tells them the technical minutia of censorship

[01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:08.310]
The list of profanities the company says it's systematically exorcism include the B words the H word when I refer into the place

[01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:14.350]
The D word the S word the F word etc. It also includes references to deity the G word and JC words etc

[01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:20.410]
Only when these words are used in a non religious context one could spend an afternoon figure out exactly what all these forbidden terms are

[01:29:20.410 --> 01:29:24.750]
Or else marvel at how conversant those easily offended clearly are with the objects of their offense

[01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:29.730]
The criteria for violence are intriguing not least because the period technical right wing in the US is clearly

[01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:33.410]
Had much less of a problem over the years with blood and guts than it has to be with teenage kissing

[01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:36.510]
Pain being a much less problematic category for them and pleasure

[01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:41.350]
Sure enough clean flicks tells us it doesn't edit all violence only the graphic depictions of the

[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:45.170]
Capitation implements this member been excessive blood gourd etc

[01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:50.790]
Especially Al Gore the founder of clean flicks Ray Lines first had the idea for his business in late 1990s

[01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:54.490]
When he prepared a sanitized version of the Titanic for his Mormon neighbors

[01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:57.250]
Minus the relatively brief moments of nudity and sex

[01:29:57.250 --> 01:30:01.450]
Soon he was taken it upon himself to decide all kinds of sensitive cultural questions

[01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:04.910]
He once told the New York Times about shinlers list the Oscar winning Holocaust drama

[01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:07.070]
Every teenager in America should see that film

[01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:10.490]
But I'm taking my daughter should see naked old men running around in circles. He said

[01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:17.090]
So that's the way you get to their foreskin in this supposed to be Jewish clear play me and while is the brain child of Lee and Matt

[01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:24.610]
Jarman two brothers from the heavily Mormon town of Oram which is right next to goyam who developed the software that enables end-of-place filters on commercial DVDs

[01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:28.210]
Copyright lawyers and entertainment executives tend to have fewer problems with their operation

[01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:33.630]
Because the DVD arrives in the consumer hands is intact and it's up to each individual viewer how to edit the content

[01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:37.390]
Much as they might on their own albeit more crudely with the fat forward button on their remote

[01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:40.530]
Clean flicks on the other hand not only modifies the films without permission

[01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:44.570]
But that makes money on the basis of those modifications without the family movie act

[01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:48.910]
It seems like the company would have fallen foul of the law and lost its legal battle with the directors guild

[01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:53.530]
Despite the passing of the act a federal judge who had been hearing the case indicated is this pleasure of the

[01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:58.050]
Video companies behavior by ordering them to meet their own cost even as he threw out the case against them

[01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:01.410]
The companies had been looking for a complete vindication in fact back in 2002

[01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:06.590]
Clean flicks had preemptively sued the directors guild precisely this incadecoration that what it was doing was legal

[01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:11.130]
But judge Richard match previously known for presiding over the trial of Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh

[01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:15.010]
Refused to grant what they were looking for and that's got a list of some of the movies that they've

[01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:19.270]
They've altered it was so slightly like Troy Brad Pitt and some of the killers enemy

[01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:22.390]
He raises this sword run towards him and then not much clean

[01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:28.110]
Another clean place cuts away to another shot the plug we'd make here is that you still see the guy die

[01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:31.950]
You still see that Brad Pitt killed him and so you don't really take away from the story of what's going on?

[01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:33.370]
It's a place company found her real lines

[01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:38.410]
Schauschford Park the refined world portrayed in Robert Almond Alman's film is even more buttoned up after clear

[01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:44.250]
Play is that it's work on Julian fellow screenplay when one valet described as master says he thinks he's got all mighty

[01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:50.250]
They all do the first sentence is cut out leaving just they all do the result a rather cryptic comment which makes no sense whatsoever

[01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:54.710]
Braveheart foul languages muted rather than skip in the stirring tale of Scottish nationalism

[01:31:54.710 --> 01:32:00.550]
About close-ups of bodily contact and battle runes are kept in but the famous moaning scene involving Mel Gibson's bottom

[01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:05.890]
Brackham and English Army has skipped all together and the most of the battles eliminated William Wallace would be turning in his grave

[01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:12.150]
Saving private Ryan the notorious 20 format and opening scene involving D. Day death and grow on this norm on the Normandy beaches

[01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:17.050]
Is made far more palatable as is the generally brutal depiction of battle throughout this fight director

[01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:22.330]
Steven Spielberg's insistence that these images are critical in showing the sacrifice of troops in the true nature of warfare

[01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:29.210]
Clean fire flicks finds them way too much to take the matrix revolution for an action flick the added diversion of the matrix

[01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:34.670]
Revolution doesn't contain much action viewers expecting foul mouth threats and a cutthroat fight between good and evil are more

[01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:40.490]
Like to be entertained by such naturally warnings as the only way you're getting through the stores over my big dead you did word

[01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:47.350]
And the godfather oh man in a sanitized version of the godfather

[01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:51.630]
The son of Krolli only played by James con does not die in a hail of bullets pounding relentlessly into his car

[01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:57.450]
He's just well he's sort of there one minute and gotten the next and the notoriously gory horses had bid 18 seconds

[01:32:57.450 --> 01:33:00.070]
This kept from one of the most famous scenes in recent cinema history

[01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:06.950]
How do you like that? Thank God that all those great goi can be us kept safe from all this filth and this oh look at

[01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:17.330]
He says we've got to be ready for the worst and I'm looking at him and thinking we already got it all

[01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:23.710]
Gonna help meet the immediate needs of those whose lives returned upside down upside down when you stole the elections over

[01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:25.690]
This is my

[01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:29.830]
Everybody on the empty ass. See these five sixteen hold on

[01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:33.390]
Oh, presidents

Goodbye George you gotta go me oh my oh

You gotta go home quick

[01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:45.770]
Why stop that all the bio

[01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:51.730]
We use your flu quick when it came to six cherry shallow

[01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:57.770]
Son of a bush is a foot in your tush now say goodbye oh

[01:33:57.770 --> 01:34:03.130]
I thought you're just wild people drown you played around a relaxing golf

[01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:09.410]
He was on vacation priorities and on your cup of tea that's ever been done

[01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:15.090]
And no one can't to even prepare for the worst scenario

[01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:21.330]
You're the one busy having fun and that's no no

[01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:26.330]
You'll investigate and elated gates that's real bullshit

Tell me your situation ones that don't you get locked up so it don't continue

But no one will get flamed like with agent flamed no hands will roll

[01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:45.450]
And as for this to be a slap on the wrist and no charges file what a surprise

[01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:53.010]
You're a liar no one gets fired with each new mess oh nobody a new death toll

[01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:55.910]
Slip in the polls that's no problem oh

[01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:35.230]

[01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:42.250]
Helped an African-American couple displaced by the storm tracked down their daughter in Maryland. Oh, there you go

[01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:46.590]

[01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.510]
Well, that's because I'm read all these long ponderous things and like Tommy says man

[01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:31.630]
This is a guy who too shallow to articulate his own ideas in the positions

[01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:37.190]
I mean, you know, I mean that more mean doubt she and O'Neal Rogers although I do have a column from today right here message

[01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:51.030]
I'm sorry, who can I speak to George grow up pali? Okay, can I speak to George? It sounded like one of your people

[01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:57.610]
567 I just tested the waters now to see if there's anybody out there with something else say another we see we've got their tongue

[01:36:57.970 --> 01:37:02.110]
Twisted with this new pole deal. We might be do this all for like the next the three years plus

[01:37:02.490 --> 01:37:06.670]
Pools that we've been doing before and then of course we already got the pre-made list now there are all

[01:37:06.670 --> 01:37:11.430]
I always try to lie into it. There must be 50,000 bad actors and actresses out there that you have a name yet

[01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:15.410]
But we just make it a hell of a lot tougher for you. Oh, I got one for the pool. How about something like

[01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:16.990]
How about having something to say?

[01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.250]
All right, when was the last year that happened 18?

[01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:22.110]
WQ a.m. Hello

[01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:33.850]
I've done better than that. Hey, how you doing?

[01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:36.510]
I know you guys are usually on top of everything but

[01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:43.210]
What do we have heard you talk about the federal government's suspension of the day was taken a wage

[01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:50.270]
Requirements for all federal projects out there in Louisiana and hurricane affected areas. Yeah, and you guys haven't

[01:37:51.190 --> 01:37:56.670]
Haven't seen you know George Bush. Hey, I'm want to help all the people out there in Louisiana with economic

[01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.050]
Assisted all that but we don't want to pay him the wage required

[01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:07.290]
Correct by the act I mentioned that in passing no few days ago. That's that's something brand new get with it Pellie

[01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:11.750]
Why are we supposed to be surprised about that? Okay, just like the way he's treating the military and the veterans

[01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:15.690]
I mean is there any surprise about any of these things? Oh those aren't rich people. Oh to understand

[01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:22.430]
They're not his base that not his constituency even the military does generally tend to vote Republican because they don't know any better

[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:25.410]
Because that's the macho thing. It's kind of like here are people the same thing

[01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:27.970]
It's macho. We don't want to vote for those pansy

[01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:33.710]
Ciccified Democrats which quite frankly justified these days. I think is the word anyway marine downrights message

[01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:36.530]
I can't see and again, let me try to explain it because

[01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:39.550]
Not that I really should care but it's just it pains me that's like it

[01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:44.290]
Somebody has been around that long who's so stupid as little Tommy jica the reason I read these articles like I said

[01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:49.170]
The other day by people like marine doubt and Frank rich and fagrige is because I'm not I'm not in their league

[01:38:49.170 --> 01:38:53.490]
I'm not I'm not a brilliant writer. I'm not there's not I'm not capable of expressing and

[01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:58.530]
Expounding the things the way that they do and the overwhelming majority of people out there don't read newspapers

[01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:03.550]
Don't read the stories on our website. Don't read anything. Okay. Maybe once in a while. Take a look at the cartoons

[01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:09.630]
That's it. Okay, so I consider and take 80 million stupid ass calls or talk about sports all day

[01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:14.890]
You think that Ronnie Brown's gonna get more than 30 yards this week nail stuff like that or I could just do this

[01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:17.670]
And quite frankly do we have a problem so far in the show?

[01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:20.350]
I mean we have some problems on his radio station with some numbers

[01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:23.950]
The other story not between 10 and 2 and that's all I can do

[01:39:24.730 --> 01:39:28.310]
Anyway, see one one that's fascinating. I mean before I think that was just this

[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:32.890]
You know said it was sent to get me going it did that's right. Why should I pay attention though?

[01:39:33.130 --> 01:39:36.190]
Hey time go on every show in town and rip me and ask to be sure

[01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:41.570]
You know spelled the name right on the year marine does says the president won't be happy until he don's a yellow slicker

[01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:46.890]
And actually takes the place of Anderson Cooper violently blown about by Rita as he talks into a camera lens lens

[01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:50.750]
Lashed with water hanging onto a mailbox. He's hit by a flying pig in a squall

[01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:53.950]
sucked up by a water spot in the eye of the storm over the dry tour togas

[01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:58.470]
Then maybe he'll go back to the White House and do his job instead of running down to the Gulf Coast for silly disaster

[01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:03.570]
Offs every other day. There's nothing more pathetic and watching someone who's out of touch feign being in touch

[01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:07.730]
On his filth sod and pilgrimage of pettinance to the devastation took so long to comprehend

[01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:09.730]
W. Desperately tried to show concern

[01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:15.350]
He said he had spent some quality time at a Sherborn plant in Pascagula and mattered about trash removal

[01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:18.010]
Infrastructure assessment teams and the can do spirit

[01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:20.770]
We look forward to hearing your vision so we can more better do our job

[01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:25.610]
He said in briefing the Gulf for Mississippi urging local officials to think bold while they still need to think mold

[01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:29.370]
Mr. Bush had stopped posing in shirts leaves and back to the Oval Office

[01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:33.930]
He has more hats and cronies. He's trying to put into important jobs and he needs to ride hurt on that

[01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:38.750]
The announcement that a veterinarian Norris Alderson who has no experience on women's health issues

[01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:43.870]
Would have the FDA's office of women's health ran into so much flak from appalled women that the FDA may have already

[01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:47.750]
Renegged on it no morning after pill thanks to the anti-deluvian administration

[01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.170]
But there may be hope for a morning after horse pill

[01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:56.750]
A veterinarian on women's health mr. Bush made a frowny over brownie but didn't learn much

[01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:00.950]
He's once more tried to appoint a nothing burger to a position of real consequence in homeland security

[01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:07.030]
The choice of Julie Myers a 36-year-old lawyer with virtually no immigration's customs or law enforcement experience

[01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:13.270]
To head to royaling immigration and customs enforcement agency with four billion dollar budget and 22,000 staffers has caused some alarm

[01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:18.650]
According to the Washington Post his Myers main credentials seem to be that she worked briefly for some semi-disgraced

[01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:22.110]
Homeland Security director Michael Churdoff when he was at the Justice Department

[01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:28.750]
She just married mr. Churdoff's chief of staff John Wood and she's an effigy an east of general Richard Myers chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff

[01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:36.250]
As a former associate for Kenny star the young woman does have impeachment experience in case the forensic war on terrorism requires the analysis of stains on dresses

[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:38.550]
Julie makes brownie look like Julie Annie

[01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:41.010]
I'll sleep better than I knowing that when she gets back from her honeymoon

[01:41:41.010 --> 01:41:45.130]
Julie will be patrolling the frontier as if the veterinarian and the niece weren't bad enough

[01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:46.250]
There was also the accused

[01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:51.110]
David Safavian the White House procurement official involved in Katrina relief efforts was arrested Monday

[01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:57.070]
accused of the FBI by lying of lying and obstructing criminal investigation into the sceney case at casino jack abermoth

[01:41:57.070 --> 01:42:00.290]
The Republican operative has broken new ground to giving lobbying a bad name

[01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:05.870]
Democrats say the fact that mr. Safavian's wife is a top lawyer for the Republican congressman who's leading the white wash

[01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:10.930]
The White House bloodied on Katrina does not give them confidence just as he is still involved other inquiries mr

[01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:14.770]
Bush is trying to paper over his Katrina mistakes by pointing his homeland security advisor

[01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:17.790]
Francis Townsend to investigate how the feds fumble the response

[01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:24.810]
Mr. Bush is who's your daddy bravera bravera blowing off the work on global warming and the allies on the Iraq invasion

Has been slapped back by mother nature which refuses to be fooled by spin when dollar rumsfield came up yesterday

[01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:35.430]
To castigate the gloom and dumors and talk about the inroads that American forces have made against terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq

[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:38.310]
He couldn't so easily be cast reality in Afghanistan

[01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:45.750]
He was his hand-picked puppet president is still battling war laws and he revertified Taliban and the export of poppies for the heroin trade is once more thriving

[01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:51.610]
Iraq is worse with more than 1900 American troops killed five more died yesterday as well as for security men connected to the

[01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:56.210]
US Embassy office in Mosul all the fashion a teocratic leaning regime aligned with Iran in

[01:42:56.210 --> 01:43:01.870]
Bosnia two journalists who've done work for the times have been killed in the last two months the more the president echoes his dad's message

[01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:05.030]
I care the more the world here is message I can't

[01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:11.290]
That's going Marine. I mean I can't know any of Rogers, but now we're gonna tell you who is exactly

[01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:16.250]
What do we got on the pull the worst TV act director's of all time ever is we got seven or 38

[01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:19.630]
That's not so great, you know, we need about eight fifty by one o'clock

[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:21.750]
I think when they're starting to slack off on us now, you know

[01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:24.350]
Those slipper and this is why I've been trying to teach you a giant

[01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:27.490]
Have to keep whipping them and whipping them and beating them in the top. Yeah

[01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:30.950]
Or they just like you know, they they lose their interest

[01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:34.670]
Just like when I read those long pondrist stories like the one I just read by Marina

[01:43:34.670 --> 01:43:37.570]
They lose their interest. It's that they have a short attention span

[01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:43.050]
740 I'm seeing on there right now and we got to have like well over 800 by one o'clock even have a chance a

I'm sorry

[01:44:08.110 --> 01:44:14.070]
Your new director of FEMA now look if you send your hard earned dollars to me

[01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:19.470]
Yeah, I can assure you that yet every last penny will go towards the relief effort

[01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:25.530]
It'll be such a relief to me to find a new tailored suit to match my ox blood shoes

[01:44:25.530 --> 01:44:30.950]
G, you know, it's hard to believe I'm director of FEMA isn't it? Well, you know

[01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:33.830]
I I think it had something to do with my

[01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:41.390]
$50,000 contribution to the r&c while I'll never forget the day. I delivered the jack-of-pen now

[01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:58.470]
I stand up and no, not at all

[01:44:59.030 --> 01:45:01.810]
Uh, you uh, you're not wearing any pants

[01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.650]
Oh

[01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:30.750]
Well, at least now we know where he's going anyway 26 to 1 a Q a m

[01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:34.910]
The host of a new Dutch talk show plans to take heroin and other illegal drugs on air

[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:38.750]
On the air in a program intended to reach young audiences on top of his that helps their lives

[01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:41.850]
Producers say today what you've been doing that for a long time. It's just today

[01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:46.590]
The show scheduled to appear on late night TV. I told her tent is called spoytin and slickin

[01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.450]
I think it may be a bad translation here

[01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:55.090]
It says or the shoot up and swallow show is that shoot up or above even in the liberal Netherlands where marijuana is sold and used openly

[01:45:55.090 --> 01:46:00.650]
They proposed action by presenter filamon wesselink is illegal and the idea was met with this made by ruling center by Christian

[01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:01.350]
Democratic party

[01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:05.250]
This is dangerous and sets of bad example said party spokesman Peter Hermann

[01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:09.830]
We're going to ask the justice minister if her is view on what the law says about this and his view on dangers and risks involved

[01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:14.790]
Just this ministry spokesman evil homies said it wasn't clearly whether wesselink would be prosecuted

[01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:17.410]
Permission of any matter a possession of any amount of heroin is illegal

[01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:21.570]
But in practice police usually don't have resources to chase after people with less than half a gram

[01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:24.270]
The actual taking of drugs is a health problem not a criminal act

[01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:26.870]
Although it's obviously hard to take drugs without possessing them first

[01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:31.210]
Am I said in any case? It's not something we endorse and doing it on television is undesirable

[01:46:31.210 --> 01:46:36.850]
He shoot up and swallow shows main hostages will interview guest about drug use and abuse while wesselink another presenter

[01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:39.350]

Wesselink 26 plans to ingest heroin in the form of a pill said

[01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.590]
Ingrid Timmer spoke for women for the shows producer bnn

[01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:50.030]
It's not our intention to create an outcry. We just want to talk about subjects that are part of young people's lives

[01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:54.550]
She be saying another segment on the show where sling plans to go on a drinking vigen in the series of pubs

[01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:57.790]
Also will try lsd on his couch out of the supervision of his mother

[01:46:58.390 --> 01:47:03.110]
What's just a sugar cube so he'll be safe the needle ends is also known of course for its marijuana policy

[01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:06.610]
Where the sale news had drugs and small quantities are not prosecuted even though technically illegal

[01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:11.010]
Other drugs including lsd cocaine ecstasy and heroin outlawed and dealers are prosecuted

[01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:13.310]
Legal age for consumption of booze into back was 16

[01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:14.570]

[01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:27.870]
755 we got on it. We had a long way to go to make that thousand. I think we're gonna do it

[01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:30.690]
I thought we were a piece of cake in like flin man

[01:47:30.690 --> 01:47:34.730]
And just when you take it for granted and you start getting down a business and you don't start like

[01:47:35.230 --> 01:47:38.810]
Bang and then clang and then reading and you know reading all the results of that thing

[01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:40.930]
Learn my gonna tell you Donald Trump and Chuck Norris

[01:47:40.930 --> 01:47:45.430]
79 to 78 and that's another reason they ought to be hopping on it. Pulse. We got a good battle going on there

[01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:51.430]
Right just like a firmman alley darn knows to know his neck to neck is Chuck. What was hell was his name?

[01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:57.630]
Nor he's dead. Look at the race caller. Oh my god. I can't believe I forgot his name. What a great race

[01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:04.510]
But he was the guy that before they'd Johnson. Oh, he was like shaving one day in a motel and he like croaked like Don drives

[01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:11.370]
Yeah, he just croaked chick Anderson. Oh, not check her and check Anderson. Here is a story of a little a lovely lady

[01:48:11.370 --> 01:48:16.010]
Now this marked rollette now you wonder who the hell is that see a lot of people I've said if I don't tell you who that

[01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:21.750]
It is he's a political satirist commentator. Listen Sacramento. Is that enough now? Let me give you a clue what this is unrelated

[01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:32.570]
It starts out. I have seen the face of God now you get an idea where this is going. I do know this is not George W. Bush's daily affirmation

[01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:34.410]
If I'm looking in the mirror each morning after coming to

[01:48:35.230 --> 01:48:40.870]
Transmortifying a getting up although it could be I guess but rather the rapturous exclamation from Howard Beal Peter Finceny

[01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:46.430]
Chillingly predicted 1976 movie network based on the brilliant screenplay by the late great petty Transky

[01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:52.210]
Beal is a newscaster turned primetime ranting head deemed the mad prophet of the airwaves who is on air anti-establishment

[01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:56.330]
Truth-laden diatrives in order to huge audience not just his ratings go sky high

[01:48:56.330 --> 01:49:00.750]
However, when he successfully urges viewers to help kill and unsavvy multi-bid and dollar deal is there any other kind

[01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:03.130]
Involving the Arabs and his net worst parent company

[01:49:03.130 --> 01:49:08.350]
Community cases corporation of America CCA he also exponentially increases the IRR of Arthur Jensen

[01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:14.090]
Ned Vady the corporate corporations president board chairman Beal's epiphany comes after Jensen calls him into CCA's

[01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:19.650]
Cathedral-like boardroom and rowing retells him out the world operates really you have meddled with a primal forces of nature

[01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:23.390]
Mr. Beal and I won't have it is that clear you think you've merely stopped the business deal

[01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:27.810]
That is not the case the Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country and now they must put it back

[01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:30.710]
It's ebb and flow title of gravity. It's ecological balance

[01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:34.050]
You're an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples there are no nations

[01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:37.510]
There are no peoples there are no Russians there are no Arabs there are no third world

[01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:43.970]
There is no west there is only one holistic system of systems one vast and in Maine interwoven interacting multi-variates

[01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:50.330]
Multinational the minion of dollars petro dollars electro dollars multi dollars rock marks rubles pounds checkles

[01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:54.070]
It's the international system of currency that determines the totality of life on this planet

[01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:59.010]
That is the natural order of things today. That's the atomic subatomic and galactic structure of things today

[01:49:59.010 --> 01:50:05.850]
And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature and you will atone you get up on your little 21 in screen and how about American democracy

[01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:14.590]
There is no America there is no democracy. There's only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont, Dow union carbide and next on those are the nations of the world today

[01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:17.530]
What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state Karl Marx?

[01:50:17.970 --> 01:50:23.690]
They pull out their linear programming charts statistical decision theories and minimax solutions and compute the price cost probabilities of their

[01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:28.370]
transactions and investments just like we do we no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies mr.

[01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:34.550]
Beale the world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business the world is a business

[01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:40.090]
Mr. Beale having previously written about this scene. I feel like I'm starting to repeat myself having previously written about this

[01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:43.370]
scene. I feel like I'm starting to repeat myself. I want to use that one for while he says

[01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:48.870]
I can't help it though as I have horrified me watch the Bushies grease the skids in every way imaginable for their corporate

[01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:54.470]
Cronies while simultaneously making it painfully planned that human lives including Americans are worthless in their bottom

[01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:58.230]
Little line little minds. I've mentally replayed this model of many many times

[01:50:58.230 --> 01:51:02.510]
It's messages to her today. They won't shavsky first pendant nearly three days the decades back

[01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:09.050]
There are no nations there is no democracy. There is no America. There's only business which leads me to ask to one of my really being loyal now

[01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:13.330]
If I say I'm a patriotic American I think I'd like to do the break now because this is a very very long

[01:51:13.330 --> 01:51:15.590]
Okay, another one of those long stories is it good?

[01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:19.190]
Well not only that but we know I'll sit on the edge of the seat and see if the when

[01:51:19.190 --> 01:51:23.190]
uh charge pushes the button is this is meal Roger

[01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:33.750]
Real American A-holes

[01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:41.950]
We salute you Mr. Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

[01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:51.850]
We learned one thing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. It's not to count on FEMA director Michael Brown

[01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:58.530]
Apparently nothing and that's what's left of the Gulf Coast

[01:51:58.530 --> 01:51:59.390]
Nothing

[01:52:01.170 --> 01:52:04.730]
52 billion dollars has been allocated by the US government

[01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:09.530]
But you created so much red tape the victims won't receive it till money

[01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:11.810]
So

[01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:16.130]
When all is said and done you will lose your job faster than you can say

[01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:16.850]
E-colors

[01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:22.610]
And if there's any justice in this world you'll be calling that Houston Astridone home too

[01:52:24.490 --> 01:52:28.890]
We salute you Mr. Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

[01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:37.390]
Your clipboard your stupid Navy Blue Females shirt and your comb over you our real American A-hole

[01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:40.350]
Absolutely don't forget most from New York at two

[01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:44.510]
777 votes on the pool we got a halibut a long way to go to get to thousand

[01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:51.530]
777 I mean I like the sound of that you know it's like right in the way six sixty six seven seven seven seven next come to eight eighty eight

[01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:56.290]
But I don't think it's going to be all that great we got a 223 to go in like an hour and 14 minutes

[01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:58.070]
You think we can do that? I don't know

[01:52:58.070 --> 01:53:03.030]
Well, it's you an hour and 14 minutes is what is 74 minutes? Okay, and when I say two twenty three

[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:04.470]
That's like that's about like about three

[01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:08.010]
I mean, we could sure do that if we had anybody listening out there if they weren't tired of my sitting here

[01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:11.110]
We know these old boring stories anyway. I like the one I'm reading right now by Mark Thorell

[01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:12.950]
Who is what is he who is he again?

[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:17.450]
I forgot he's a political satirist commentator listen Sacramento at least does now, but he ain't gonna be there long

[01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:20.850]
Anyway, he says a few years ago. I visited the D-Day beaches and Normandy France

[01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:26.270]
I stood on bloody Omaha and looked back at the hugging bluffs and remnants of the ubiquitous German fortifications overlooking the arena

[01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:30.250]
And I wondered how anyone could have ever survived the unrelenting withering fire that poured down from them

[01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:35.130]
I've always marveled at the sacrifice made by those who willingly waited in that maelstrom to yes help save the world

[01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:38.210]
I also spent time with the American cemetery of Abba Omaha with its

[01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:44.670]
987 graves marked by white marble crosses and stars have David laid out and row upon silent row filled with bodies of soldiers

[01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:50.090]
Many of whom were only 18 19 20 years old who died in fighting a war that many including me considered a noble cause

[01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:54.110]
I think all war is lunacy, but since one never knows when the next apocalyptic

[01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:58.550]
Madman with a powerful army will show up to terminus squals as many human rights as lives as possible

[01:53:58.550 --> 01:54:02.350]
I also believe in providing for the common defense as the linear the Constitution

[01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:08.310]
Ah, yes, the Constitution the document that went combined with its spiritual twin the Declaration of Independence forms a venerated

[01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:13.810]
Tendon that embodies the serenely beautiful ideals comprising the true essence of our beloved America really is a release and

[01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:19.590]
Spirantly strives to be or did that as until W came along twice got a self-appointed president and like a cackling

[01:54:19.590 --> 01:54:25.490]
Drunken and drunken adolescent in other words a typical bush peed all over the whole deal see there's that peeword again

[01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:33.830]
Oh no W are very own insane very little man who's affinity for dressing up a military garb started taking flight only decades after he's been a year avoiding the same

[01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:38.890]
The neo-Napole and was test-numping the authorize torture in order of a hundred thousand innocence while taking his own

[01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:45.030]
Volusional stab at global conquest a soulless nutcase of a silver spoon twit who simply considers as he considers everything

[01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:49.190]
The aforementioned two manuscripts nothing more than dated freight papers full of so many words

[01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:55.010]
And we all know how trying he finds those pesky things what were there being stuff to the brim with tricky letters and syllables and all

[01:54:55.010 --> 01:55:01.430]
Liberties writes justice quality and most of all the rule of law all viewed as merely net like annoying impediments by the bushy and thugs

[01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:05.410]
As they go step their way toward their sole goal and in that can be summed up in three words

[01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:08.790]
Well four if you count the one in parentheses more power and profits

[01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:14.990]
Whereas the imperialistic imbicils is the project for the new american century crow american interest in principles business interest

[01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:20.790]
Business principles and oxie moron if there ever was one bush a moron if there ever was one cheap. I know but too tempting

[01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:25.570]
I'm gonna swear field he to that you remember when we were taught about 1930s Germany and Hitler's ascension

[01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.850]
We'd all think wow. Why did the German people rise up?

[01:55:28.050 --> 01:55:31.390]
How could they let that happen in their country just take a look at America under voice

[01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:36.050]
We documented death destruction and decimation of democracy in just a few short years is truly breathtaking

[01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:40.770]
Yet still he is supported by tens of millions of adult-brained adamantine americans

[01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:44.630]
Hitler couldn't have gotten as far as he did without good Germans either remember that in the end of the movie in that work

[01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:49.270]
He said he wanted they wanted a fire Howard vio right and mr. Jensen was adamantine

[01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:55.830]
First time ever heard that word him or couldn't have gotten as far as he did without his good Germans either for those who gasped and say why you're comparing bush to Hitler

[01:55:55.830 --> 01:56:01.090]
Let me stop you right there figuratively look you straight in your liver are literally be the little I'm assure you your damn straight

[01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:05.230]
I am loss and see wounds I'm a blick namon soul and veer you take a look shall we

[01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:08.770]
Let us like it. No, that's not what it means. Let us take a look shall we?

[01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:12.870]
Hitler had no respect for human life bush has no respect for human life Hitler spoke in a foreign tongue

[01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:16.010]
Bush speaks in a foreign tongue Hitler was insane Bush is insane

[01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:22.610]
Hitler had a fascist regime Bush had the fascist regime Hitler had a funny little mustache if Bush grew when he'd have one too

[01:56:22.610 --> 01:56:25.750]
Hitler tried to take over the world Bush is trying to take over the world

[01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:28.770]
Hitler though completely shot through with evil was a mesmerizing order

[01:56:28.770 --> 01:56:31.850]
Bush though completely shot though with evil is well okay

[01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:33.090]
So the comparison isn't perfect

[01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:38.230]
But it's close and justice and horses and grenades and ongoing planetary annihilation closest close enough

[01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:41.670]
So Bush hasn't sent six million undesirables off the gas chambers yet

[01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:45.170]
Remember though it took even Hitler a while to get those babies up and running in the meantime

[01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:48.950]
Bush can just let America as useless either is down and drown in their own homes

[01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:52.090]
If only those folks in the worldians had been better Americans by being less poor

[01:56:52.090 --> 01:56:54.210]
Consuming more and possessing lighter pigmentation

[01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:56.350]
Well, then maybe help would have arrived a little bit quicker

[01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:59.690]
The world is a business Mr. Beale not to mention a touch racist

[01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:06.430]
Whether the nature of the questionable industry and question is pharmaceuticals financial oil energy agriculture telecommunications reconstruction

[01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:11.730]
Chemical insurance security food processing mining or increasing the water the dark record is clear

[01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:16.010]
The people who operate such enterprises prosper big time while everyone else suffers immensely

[01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:20.930]
It's not that businesses inherently bad that would be like saying an alcohol and inner substance is bad

[01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:26.270]
But booze used badly is incredibly destructive and so it is with business only on a tremendously grander scale

[01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:31.690]
Of course the Moab mother of all businesses is the military industrial complex the one the president white the Eisenhower

[01:57:31.690 --> 01:57:34.250]
A man who knew a thing about a war a thing or two about it

[01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:40.250]
Presently warned us over 40 years ago. We along with all the other poor bastards on its to-do list are now firmly in its death grip

[01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:44.770]
The Bush's business overallist mentality and pathological the property are hardly news to me

[01:57:44.770 --> 01:57:50.950]
But ever since the completely affordable deaths of hundreds if not thousands of Americans directly attributed to Bush and his fellow fascists

[01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:54.490]
Katrina related criminal indifference and incompetence conspiracy take your pick

[01:57:54.490 --> 01:57:58.710]
I've noticed with me a new feeling a new thought presses and not so subtle and very real shift

[01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:01.550]
I no longer feel any allegiance to America not this one

[01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:06.530]
The America I grew up in was in love with and was in love with felt part of was proud to be from got all misty

[01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:09.530]
I'd for felt a bone deep obligation to is dead dead dead

[01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:15.390]
And because of the ruling cannibals voriciously consuming her corpse will never relinquish power barring and exceeding unlikely armed revolt

[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:18.910]
Has left forever than now found and foundation was building this America?

[01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:24.130]
I would no more left no more left to finger try to defend the rotten government that controls this bin I did place

[01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:27.990]
Then I would lend a helping hand to someone who disembowels babies or burns animals alive

[01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:33.110]
Because if I did the former I'd also be doing the latter that's not to say I wouldn't pick up a gun if we were actually invaded by another

[01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:36.130]
Characteristically were my monitoring nation like say canada

[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:39.370]
But it would be hell of a tough time deciding who to put forth in the crosshairs

[01:58:39.370 --> 01:58:44.010]
No doubt you hear the refrain if you hate it so much here then why don't you just leave way ahead of your amigo

[01:58:44.010 --> 01:58:47.930]
I make plans as I write this to move to a particular unnamed central American country

[01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:52.070]
Well, it actually does have a name, but I'm really sure how particular it is some countries are more picky than others

[01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:55.770]
You know it lies between Nicaragua and Panama and Spanish name means rich coast

[01:58:55.770 --> 01:58:58.810]
But I don't want to divulge too much much less. I give it away in about a year

[01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:03.250]
I hope to be living in Costa Rica where I hate it when I do that is this throwing into towel

[01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:08.870]
Yeah, I still find myself out there in this recorder with my anti-bush sign during our regular 7-9 demo here in Sacramento

[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:11.710]
And I keep writing away into another activist duty says a sign

[01:59:11.710 --> 01:59:16.010]
But at the same time I wonder how much good any of it does my guess not much if any no doubt out here

[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:21.150]
This refrain too if you just pick up your sign and go to your new home what good is that to this is a legitimate question

[01:59:21.150 --> 01:59:25.710]
And when I'm sure every person who kind of plates fleeing his or her native land for political reasons repeatedly pond is

[01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:28.750]
I think it comes down to we all got to do what we all got to do

[01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:33.330]
I don't mean that to be flippant the sighting department will leave the U.S. is not the easiest decision I make

[01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:35.330]
Although I fully appreciate being forced enough to

[01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:39.830]
To so choose for I've always naturally deeply loved where America stood for and meant

[01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:42.350]
But I can no longer stand what it has become

[01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:44.710]
How do you like that?

[01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:46.870]
Costa Rica

[01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:51.730]
I heard about that place maybe you'll pack him a taco in a way out they have tacos there

[01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.030]

Don't put the blame on me

[02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:53.070]
As I come from my vacation for a photo opportunity

[02:02:53.890 --> 02:02:57.690]
Swing your partner round and round now do a little swim into the war with

Will young

[02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:47.290]
tortured

[02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:07.610]
She will be Bobby Brown with smoking has been called and it's crack black white with me.

[02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:14.650]
And I bet she feels crappy got more folks than Cammy or is it TV history.

[02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:24.930]
On the road there's the one we all despise.

[02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:32.910]
Well she's misprimmed and proper and no one can stop her from telling her lies.

[02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:40.390]
The one strong fire the wind, all she did was constantly pitch.

[02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:46.950]
She's the one scary and the one in charge.

[02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.110]
By far.

[02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:54.510]
102 at 560 WM happy Wednesday too.

[02:04:54.630 --> 02:04:57.330]
That's story by the way to Mark Drewet's story that I read very poorly.

[02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:58.650]
It'll be on tomorrow.

[02:04:59.030 --> 02:05:01.250]
Or you can go to smurkingchimp.com and it's on today.

[02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:02.390]
Got it Eric Josh.

[02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:04.090]
Or you can wait till tomorrow.

[02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:05.270]
Look at that on our website.

[02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:10.470]
That's his way of saying he's not going to put it on today.

[02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:11.490]
Which is okay.

[02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:13.230]
We got more than enough on here today.

[02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:14.770]
We got more than you can handle.

[02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:17.650]
How's the votes coming on I pull we're going to get our thousand this hour.

[02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:19.330]
This is the real test now.

[02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:20.370]
No excuses.

[02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:22.470]
No more hurricane today for Florida.

[02:05:23.050 --> 02:05:23.630]
We're in a clear.

[02:05:24.010 --> 02:05:25.390]
It's probably the sun is shining somewhere.

[02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.710]
854.

[02:05:27.130 --> 02:05:28.290]
We need 146.

[02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:29.330]
What can we do it?

[02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:30.170]
That's the obvious question.

[02:05:30.450 --> 02:05:31.210]
Can we do it?

[02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.590]
Huh?

[02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:35.650]
146 in 57 minutes is what?

[02:05:35.850 --> 02:05:38.390]
That's like not even three a minute.

[02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:40.030]
You could do that with your eyes closed.

[02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:42.610]
Maybe Hank is there working in an asset to house you think?

[02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:43.090]
No.

[02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:44.550]
That was depressing.

[02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:47.830]
Some people are just resistant to change.

[02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:52.910]
Some of us when we get old we're like funny, dirty and we just don't want to be bothered with that.

[02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:56.430]
But I can't even imagine and I think you probably would agree.

[02:05:56.590 --> 02:05:58.350]
I know Josh does because it's part of his livelihood.

[02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:59.690]
All the big bucks he's making.

[02:06:00.150 --> 02:06:02.030]
But can you even imagine your life without the internet?

[02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:03.050]
No, not anymore.

[02:06:03.190 --> 02:06:06.190]
Thank you Al Gore and thank you Mr. President for those little gas prices too.

[02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:08.850]
I'd have to pick up a newspaper to find out when a movie is playing.

[02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:10.310]
And I don't need that.

[02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:12.950]
But doing a show without the internet?

[02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:13.290]

[02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:18.190]
I mean you know what's upon a time I know that things change in broadcasting as somebody famous once said.

[02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:18.770]
Right.

[02:06:19.230 --> 02:06:25.370]
But you know some people don't understand it and that's why they don't write about radio because they've long since lost touch with what's happening in it.

[02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:26.030]
Things change.

[02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:27.910]
Here's a go who don't need a computer to show.

[02:06:28.210 --> 02:06:29.970]
But now if you want to keep in touch with what's going on.

[02:06:30.130 --> 02:06:31.450]
If you want to be right on top of it.

[02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:35.950]
For example, Indonesia is called an outbreak of verb flu in its team in capital and epidemic.

[02:06:36.570 --> 02:06:40.590]
And it's health and agriculture less words today from around the world converge on to card that help control the virus.

[02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:43.710]
Now I keep finding more and more stories about this and we do put them on our website.

[02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:46.090]
And not too many people in America are talking about this.

[02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:47.590]
Although I know this bush made a comment.

[02:06:47.590 --> 02:06:49.570]
Do you have a look in passing like, oh we're all going to die.

[02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:54.130]
Health Minister Satif Adilasu Patti, which I'm sure is not the way Brown says name.

[02:06:54.130 --> 02:06:57.330]
It sounds almost Italian to me, but nevertheless said the emergence of spring.

[02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:58.970]
I make a lot of mistakes in reading this crappy.

[02:06:59.190 --> 02:07:02.150]
You know what's too bad said the emergence of sporadic human cases of birds.

[02:07:02.150 --> 02:07:05.690]
When recent months in and around different parts of Jakarta home to 12 million people.

[02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.970]
Warned the epidemic tag.

[02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:11.610]
She was speaking before announcing that initial local test in a five year old girl who died on Wednesday.

[02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:14.410]
If they're suffering from birth loose symptoms was negative for the virus.

[02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:15.530]
Oh, thank God for that.

[02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:17.430]
She died, but not from that bad stuff.

[02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.030]
This could be described as an epidemic.

[02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:23.330]
These cases will happen again as long as we cannot determine the source she told reporters.

[02:07:23.690 --> 02:07:25.170]
But she assisted it would be wrong to label day.

[02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:26.210]
Here's the good part.

[02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:27.710]
It's not a frightening epidemic.

[02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:32.330]
It's just a plain old regular pedestrian epidemic as opposed to a frightening epidemic.

[02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:33.110]
God's right.

[02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:39.090]
Four Indonesians already are confirmed to have died since July from the Hathi pathogenic 8.5N1 straighter bird flu.

[02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:41.690]
Which is called the total of 64 people in four Asian countries.

[02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:45.130]
Since the late 2003 and has been found in birds in Russia and in Europe.

[02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:47.830]
Six other patients are still in the government.

[02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:51.530]
This is made in hospital in Jakarta suspected of having the avion flu.

[02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:53.870]
Or is that avion is in don't drink the water.

[02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:55.310]
I don't say that avion is good water.

[02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:56.470]
That's not reduced from France.

[02:07:56.770 --> 02:07:57.690]
Like I said, I don't like it.

[02:07:58.130 --> 02:07:59.210]
I'm going to drink bottled water.

[02:07:59.210 --> 02:08:00.290]
I'll drink sand, telegrenor.

[02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.710]
Thank you.

[02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:02.250]
Or a mountain valley.

[02:08:02.730 --> 02:08:03.610]
How come my mountain valley?

[02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:05.050]
How come I don't want to go into it?

[02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:06.970]
The UN World Health Organization last week,

[02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:10.370]
where in bird flu was moving toward a form that could be passed between human beings in the world

[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:15.070]
had no time to waste a prevent a pandemic and operate that spreads far more widely than they just your plain old regular.

[02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:18.450]
I'll hand them a quick look at the things.

[02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:21.650]
Maybe ins of people could die if they don't cut the crap and get with it.

[02:08:21.970 --> 02:08:24.070]
But of course, an America worried about important things like porn.

[02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:25.530]
So here's that story.

[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:27.970]
Recruit software, the porn squad from the Washington Post.

[02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:29.350]
This should be enough to make it.

[02:08:29.610 --> 02:08:32.310]
And right on the heels of that cob I read by Mark Durellet,

[02:08:32.410 --> 02:08:33.890]
who's leaving the country of York, of course, La Vika.

[02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:37.630]
You should be real fascinated to hear this.

[02:08:38.150 --> 02:08:40.530]
This is what your tax dollars are being spent for.

[02:08:41.170 --> 02:08:42.830]
Recruit software, the porn squad.

[02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:45.690]
The FBI is joining the Bush administration's war on porn,

[02:08:46.050 --> 02:08:47.330]
and it's looking for a few good agents.

[02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:50.370]
I bet you they're looking all regions of the country west.

[02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:50.910]
I'll do that.

[02:08:51.110 --> 02:08:52.410]
Randy West, Peter North.

[02:08:53.090 --> 02:08:57.750]
Early last month, the Bureau of Washington Field Office began recruiting for a new anti-accented squad.

[02:08:58.230 --> 02:09:02.150]
Attempts of the job posting was a July 29th electronic communication from FBI headquarters

[02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:04.310]
to all 56 field offices,

[02:09:04.670 --> 02:09:08.830]
describing initiatives as one of the top priorities of Attorney General Alberto Arcanzales

[02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:10.910]
and by extension lead director.

[02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:13.330]
That would be FBI director Robert S. Mueller III,

[02:09:13.530 --> 02:09:15.290]
who used to make some pretty good pasta, but no mole.

[02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:18.630]
Most of his comments here began propagating around the water coolers

[02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:23.630]
at 614th Street Northwest, and it said lights were the FBI's second largest field office concept.

[02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:27.870]
Concentrates on national security, high technology crimes and public corruption.

[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:29.150]
That was a bacon griff.

[02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:30.890]
Started like juicy.

[02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.630]
No.

[02:09:32.190 --> 02:09:35.550]
The new squad will divert eight agents to supervise or an assortant support staff

[02:09:35.550 --> 02:09:38.710]
to gather evidence against, manufacturers and purveyors of pornography.

[02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:43.490]
Not the kind of exploiting children, but the kind that depicts and is marketed to consulting adults.

[02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:44.590]
Oh my God.

[02:09:45.170 --> 02:09:48.430]
I guess this means we've won the war on terrorists and won an ex-sporated FBI agent,

[02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:53.170]
speaking on the condition of anonymity because poking fun at headquarters is not regarded as career enhancing.

[02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:56.170]
We must not need any more resources for espionage, he said.

[02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:59.630]
Among friends and trusted colleagues and experienced national security analysts said

[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:04.190]
it's a running joke for us, a few of the printable samples, things I don't want on my resume volume four.

[02:10:04.190 --> 02:10:07.390]
I already gave it home and honestly most of the guys would have to recuse themselves.

[02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:11.970]
Federal obscenity prosecutions which have been out of style since Attorney General Edwin Meast

[02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:16.030]
the Turret and the Reagan administration made pornography a signature issue in the 80s,

[02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:20.030]
do encounter many legal issues including first amendment claims, the FBI headquarters memo noted,

[02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:21.130]
first amendment, what's that?

[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:22.850]
Fill the rights, what that was at?

[02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:26.550]
Applicants for the porn squad should therefore have a stomach for the kind of material

[02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:28.890]
that tends to be most defensive to local juries.

[02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:33.890]
Community standards along with a brilliant purpose of an absence of artistic mirrored

[02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:36.730]
define criminal obscenity under current Supreme Court doctrine.

[02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:40.630]
Based on a review of past successful cases and a variety of jurisdictions the memo said,

[02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:43.610]
the best odds of conviction come with pornography that includes

[02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:48.970]
bestiality, urination, defecation, as well as sadistic and masochistic behavior.

[02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:52.790]
No word on the universe of other kings that help make porn a multi-billion dollar industry.

[02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:56.990]
Bestiality, urination, defecation as well as SNM, hey?

[02:10:57.490 --> 02:10:58.530]
There goes that movie.

[02:10:59.050 --> 02:11:01.470]
Popular acceptance of hardcore pornography is come a long way with

[02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:04.870]
own bit stars becoming mainstream celebrities in their product and the products once

[02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:09.230]
confined to CD shops and theaters being pervaded by upscale hotels and most home people

[02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:10.530]
and satellite TV systems.

[02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:14.270]
Explicit sexual entertainment is a big profit center for companies including General Motors

[02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:17.290]
and Rupert Murdoch's news corp, two major owners of Direct TV,

[02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:20.450]
Time Order Inc and the Sheridan and Hilton Mary Outenhigh at Hotel Saints,

[02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:21.610]
like we said before.

[02:11:22.090 --> 02:11:26.050]
But Gonzalez endorses the rational predecessor Ed Meast that an old pornography

[02:11:26.050 --> 02:11:27.590]
is a threat to families and children.

[02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:31.970]
Christian conservators, long skeptical of Gonzalez, greeted the pornography initiative

[02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:35.950]
with what the Family Research Council called a growing sense of confidence in our new attorney general.

[02:11:36.450 --> 02:11:39.750]
Alberto, Congress began funding the Obsidian Initiative in physical

[02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:44.690]
2005 and specified that the FBI must devote 10 agents to adult pornography.

[02:11:45.070 --> 02:11:48.350]
The Bureau decided to create a dedicated squat only in the Washington field or office.

[02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:52.010]
All other field or offices may investigate obscenity cases pursuant to this initiative

[02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:54.210]
if resources are available to the director for men.

[02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:59.570]
Field offices should not, however, divert resources from higher-party matters such as public corruption.

[02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:04.930]
Public corruption officially is forth on the FBI's priority list after protecting the US from terrorist attack,

[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.850]
foreign espionage and cyber-based attacks.

[02:12:07.230 --> 02:12:11.550]
Just below those priorities are civil rights, organized crime, like color crime and significant violent crime.

[02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:16.050]
The guidance from headquarters does not mention where pornography fits in, probably in your...

[02:12:16.050 --> 02:12:21.130]
The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigations top priority remains fighting the war on terrorism,

[02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:23.890]
so justice department press secretary Brian Rorcazza.

[02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:25.710]
However, it is not our sole priority.

[02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:29.430]
In fact, Congress is directed to focus on other priorities such as obscenity.

[02:12:29.790 --> 02:12:37.270]
At the FBI's field office, spokeswoman Deborah Weyrman expressed disappointment that some of her colleagues find grist for humor in the new campaign.

[02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:41.250]
The adult obscenity squad stems from an attorney general mandate funded by Congress.

[02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:45.250]
The personnel assigned to this initiative take the responsibility of this assignment very seriously,

[02:12:45.850 --> 02:12:48.850]
and are dedicated to the success of this program, she would say.

[02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:50.410]
She enjoys that will oak.

[02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:51.710]
What a max that would make, huh?

[02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:53.630]
A match made in purgatory.

[02:12:54.670 --> 02:13:00.730]
I'm telling you, that article I read before, that's the epitome that said that's the epitome of it.

[02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:03.130]
You have your thumb on it, the epitome.

[02:13:03.810 --> 02:13:05.090]
He said that on the ear once.

[02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:08.650]
Hey, listen, Ed Morrell was great, and Dan Radler gets all choked up.

[02:13:08.650 --> 02:13:11.470]
Danny Boy was on last night with Larry King, I told him that.

[02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:15.210]
And a couple of times I thought he was going to get choked up on there.

[02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:17.810]
In fact, he talked about the time he's gotten choked up on it.

[02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:21.210]
But Ed Morrell was this here, and there's a great movie about Ed Morrell.

[02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:24.330]
It's a George Clooney movie, which I'm not big on George Clooney, about Edward R. Morrell.

[02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:25.290]
I think I can't think of what it's called.

[02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:26.890]
It's either Outer, it's coming out.

[02:13:27.610 --> 02:13:28.390]
And he said it was great.

[02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:30.190]
But anyway, he wants that epitome on here.

[02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:33.010]
We all, all the great urineless make mistakes, right?

[02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:37.970]
Like me, for example, like half of the words that I butcher in those articles, like who cares?

[02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.950]
Nobody cares.

[02:13:39.230 --> 02:13:39.470]
Why?

[02:13:39.670 --> 02:13:40.090]
Makes them funny.

[02:13:40.330 --> 02:13:41.110]
Is that what it is?

[02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.090]
Oh, these are funny articles that I don't realize that.

[02:13:43.130 --> 02:13:43.530]
They can be.

[02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:44.970]
Oh, no, I know why I like them so much.

[02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.910]
Or why you like them so much?

[02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.570]
Like those cartoons.

[02:13:47.110 --> 02:13:49.490]
I don't think the one via Mark Throlet was all that funny.

[02:13:49.730 --> 02:13:53.730]
It kind of like, although it didn't have all the network stuff in there, that's what attracted me to it, of course.

[02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:58.150]
Because I still think that, and I don't care what Josh Cortes says, you know, who doesn't like the movie.

[02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:59.690]
That's fine, you know, no problem.

[02:14:00.150 --> 02:14:01.990]
I can handle the, whatever the hell I paid, what was it?

[02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:02.630]
25 bucks?

[02:14:03.190 --> 02:14:03.750]
Just deducted.

[02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:09.090]
No, no, seriously, this is a man who was so far ahead of his time is okay.

[02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:18.370]
Patty Triewski, who was a zillion years ahead of his time, and the acting performances in that movie are so spectacular by Peter Finch and William Holden and by what's your name?

[02:14:19.110 --> 02:14:19.110]

[02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.870]
What?

[02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:20.530]
Faith, done away.

[02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:21.290]
Faith away.

[02:14:21.770 --> 02:14:22.370]
All of them.

[02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:23.430]
Everybody in that movie is great.

[02:14:23.610 --> 02:14:25.030]
Yeah, the acting was good.

[02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:26.430]
Yeah, he just talked to movies stuff.

[02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.850]
That's all.

[02:14:27.170 --> 02:14:28.150]
And what about Ned Beatty?

[02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:29.250]
And what about Robert Duball?

[02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.470]

[02:14:29.650 --> 02:14:30.210]
What a cast.

[02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:31.070]
Huh?

[02:14:31.070 --> 02:14:34.670]
Just the line alone, just that scene where he's iracculating there on TV.

[02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:37.970]
I'm in the middle of hell, but I don't think there's any more.

[02:14:38.130 --> 02:14:40.570]
Oh, that was really the suits there that was doing the iracculating.

[02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:41.090]
Excuse me.

[02:14:41.230 --> 02:14:45.250]
He was just a mad prophet railing about the hypocrisies or of our times.

[02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:48.950]
He wanted to be a mad prophet, ranting about the hypocrisies.

[02:14:49.070 --> 02:14:50.030]
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

[02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:50.730]
Then grab it.

[02:14:51.070 --> 02:14:51.930]
That's a good scene too.

[02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:55.750]
The whole movie is great, but it's just punks like Josh Cortes shouldn't be watching Network.

[02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:57.770]
Okay, it's so far above his head.

[02:14:58.130 --> 02:14:59.210]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[02:14:59.570 --> 02:15:02.350]
Network is to you like what this show is to Tom Jirka.

[02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:03.710]
It's it's beyond your comprehension.

[02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:04.490]
Is that right?

[02:15:04.610 --> 02:15:08.770]
Well, I'm pretty sure that nobody's called in and said, hey, I watched Network and Josh was wrong.

[02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:09.770]
All they will know.

[02:15:10.150 --> 02:15:12.490]
I mean, I'm sure plenty of people have seen it out there.

[02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:14.110]
I haven't, I haven't heard otherwise.

[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:17.150]
So in other words, you're telling me that nobody liked the movie except me and George?

[02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.910]
I didn't say that.

[02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:21.450]
I just said a good message in the movie, but a little slow.

[02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:23.190]
Oh, excuse me very slow.

[02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:26.370]
What was the message that I'd say that way less to get on top?

[02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:27.370]
Is that the message you saw?

[02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:31.070]
14 past one at five 60 W.A.M.

[02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:32.910]
The Emil Costa's floor is number one.

[02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:35.210]
Agent Gore made the phase rate advise to get rest around review.

[02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:41.470]
You asked for it and now every Friday through Sunday night, lobster fest is backed by proper demand featuring main lobster served thermidor style.

[02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:47.090]
And it can still enjoy cramp fest every night with the last gun, snow crab legs, dungeon this crab, and Jonah Stone crabs too.

[02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:49.210]
The main used to include fresh oysters on hatch.

[02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:50.750]
And the sushi brought with over 30.

[02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:51.690]
About 30 minutes.

[02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:53.530]
There he goes with those damn droppings again.

[02:15:53.530 --> 02:15:57.450]
And in addition, the Emil Costa's got your hand card primer been from your flaming grill.

[02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.690]
FAMING!

[02:15:59.010 --> 02:16:02.190]
Delicious juicy New York steaks cooked order just the way you love them.

[02:16:02.430 --> 02:16:07.550]
Top off a fantastic feast with dessert at the unbelievable 40-inch chocolate fountain and hand it your own.

[02:16:07.810 --> 02:16:10.690]
Strawberry is marshmallow's other neck and treats just dip them in there.

[02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:14.410]
Don't forget the Emil Costa's most healthy are cooked living too because they don't use any cramp.

[02:16:14.690 --> 02:16:17.250]
No MSG, no cornstarch, no garbage, no MSG headaches.

[02:16:17.650 --> 02:16:20.350]
They cook all their fine cuisine only with cholesterol freaking oil.

[02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:26.410]
So if you want a fantastic feast that's good for you too, look at the reservation of the Emil Costa's three locations you'll find them in sunrise.

[02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:32.430]
Sunny Al's Beach and Pembroke Pines for the Emil Costa 954 572 3822.

[02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:34.910]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:39.250]
This is 516 QA6.

[02:16:41.130 --> 02:16:41.990]
Roger, come on.

[02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:52.070]
I've planned a region to an unsurcised big symbol of my choice of the United States of America in two republics or religious bands.

[02:16:52.490 --> 02:17:00.110]
One nation under unsurcised religious or non-religious representatives, debatable or individual,

[02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:04.570]
with or without liberty in their country, brawl or stun.

[02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:09.850]
We'll tell you that we'll tell you that we are here.

[02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:17.630]
We'll tell you that we'll tell you that we are here.

[02:17:19.430 --> 02:17:26.150]
We'll tell you that we'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:27.290]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:28.130]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:28.130 --> 02:17:28.750]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:32.330]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:40.930]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:43.750]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:44.550]
Absolutely.

[02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:49.390]
We'll tell you that we're here.

[02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:56.050]
907 votes out of whole.

[02:17:57.210 --> 02:17:59.150]
We're a TV actor actress of all time.

[02:17:59.570 --> 02:18:01.230]
I'm going to be really fascinated, ain't you?

[02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:04.170]
See, I'm not going to tell him right now how it came out the last time about a year ago.

[02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:06.630]
What that was at?

[02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.950]
What has it been outside?

[02:18:08.210 --> 02:18:10.450]
I thought it was like a little blowback.

[02:18:10.850 --> 02:18:12.090]
Now, there's a little blowback.

[02:18:12.490 --> 02:18:14.490]
900 in the summer, trying to get to 1000 by 2 o'clock.

[02:18:14.490 --> 02:18:15.270]
We got 40 minutes.

[02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.010]
And more from New York today, it's until o'clock, the most show.

[02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:19.350]
We got 910.

[02:18:20.510 --> 02:18:21.890]
But let's see, what we got right now?

[02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:22.310]
Who's leading?

[02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:24.090]
We got 75 different names on it.

[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:25.350]
These are exactly the same names.

[02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:26.790]
Plus, we had one or two editions on here.

[02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:28.590]
Like did we put a gaudy on there?

[02:18:28.650 --> 02:18:29.370]
Victoria Gaudy?

[02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:29.710]
I hope.

[02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:30.370]
I sure hope.

[02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:30.890]
Is she on there?

[02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.270]
Yeah.

[02:18:32.630 --> 02:18:33.350]
Did you have any votes?

[02:18:34.170 --> 02:18:36.130]
I don't see no Victoria Gaudy on my pool.

[02:18:36.610 --> 02:18:37.470]
Yes, she's got 19.

[02:18:38.090 --> 02:18:38.730]
Oh, yeah, she's who?

[02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:40.310]
That's because I'm looking way down on the bottom.

[02:18:40.670 --> 02:18:41.830]
And there she is zoomed up the list.

[02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:42.290]
She moves out.

[02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:43.710]
That's how it makes me angry.

[02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.370]
It's every time.

[02:18:44.770 --> 02:18:48.850]
Because basically what they're saying on A&E, which is an A&E deal and bi-group.

[02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:52.170]
They do all of these great bio-shows.

[02:18:52.170 --> 02:18:55.430]
And you could see the biography of John Gaudy on there.

[02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:56.210]
They've had that on.

[02:18:56.530 --> 02:19:00.330]
And John Gaudy, Jr., which by the way, I got that story about the Gaudy.

[02:19:00.810 --> 02:19:01.570]
They do the thing out.

[02:19:02.090 --> 02:19:03.230]
But anyway, forget about that.

[02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:06.550]
But it's like saying, well, you know, I'm his daughter and our family

[02:19:06.550 --> 02:19:08.510]
like we're moms through related.

[02:19:08.650 --> 02:19:10.050]
So therefore, you're interested in us.

[02:19:10.050 --> 02:19:10.190]
Right.

[02:19:10.290 --> 02:19:11.190]
And we're fine then.

[02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:12.950]
The whole attitude that they core.

[02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:15.450]
I mean, that was the one knock on the Godfather and good fellows.

[02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:16.730]
It's that it glamorized moms.

[02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:19.430]
It's using kind of like humanized them to make us empathize with them.

[02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:21.350]
And as opposed to the law enforcement.

[02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:24.330]
And the fact that these people were like butchering and murdering, etc. and so on.

[02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:26.130]
All the way, I did like it Don Crowley on it.

[02:19:26.710 --> 02:19:30.950]
The worst TV actor or actress ever is or was Donald Trump 98, Chuck Norris 85.

[02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:32.390]
The Donald's starting to pull away.

[02:19:32.710 --> 02:19:34.510]
And rightfully so, by the way, he's an idiot.

[02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:37.210]
So he's got, see, this idea because he's got a lot of money.

[02:19:37.450 --> 02:19:39.530]
You know who else really drives me nuts that they had on the other?

[02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:40.310]
Ted Turner.

[02:19:40.650 --> 02:19:40.830]
Yeah.

[02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:41.490]
What about it?

[02:19:41.490 --> 02:19:43.170]
Ted Turner has given a lot of money to charity.

[02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.710]
I'll say that.

[02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:47.150]
He's tried to do something with, and he's a self-made billionaire.

[02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:49.190]
But he just aggravates the hell out of me.

[02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.710]
Ted Turner.

[02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:52.270]
Even James Fonda finally caught on to his act.

[02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:53.390]
Chuck Norris 85.

[02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:54.390]
Tony Danda 65.

[02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.270]
Very annoying.

[02:19:55.650 --> 02:19:56.610]
Perry Spelling 61.

[02:19:57.010 --> 02:19:58.410]
Bob Sagitt 49.

[02:19:58.830 --> 02:19:59.590]
He should have more than that.

[02:19:59.870 --> 02:20:01.270]
He's the Antichrist.

[02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:02.970]
David Peruso 40.

[02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:04.170]
He's another one.

[02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:05.870]
It's like a comic book character with the orange hair.

[02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:08.710]
I was thinking that would be a really good pull to take someday.

[02:20:09.610 --> 02:20:12.190]
Who most resembles a comic book character?

[02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:14.790]
And I absolutely even though I think he's not too bad.

[02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:16.370]
Rob Marciano, the weather guy in CNN.

[02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:18.570]
With a head that looks like it's been in the vice.

[02:20:18.930 --> 02:20:20.290]
And they just tightened that thing.

[02:20:20.350 --> 02:20:22.210]
And his head is like about two inches across.

[02:20:23.250 --> 02:20:24.290]
David Peruso 40.

[02:20:24.430 --> 02:20:25.130]
Mr. T-39.

[02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:26.330]
Cannery was 36.

[02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:27.710]
Nice haircut, Mr. T.

[02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:28.870]
Roseanne 33.

[02:20:29.130 --> 02:20:30.070]
Ashton Croucher's God.

[02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:31.070]
Bob Tudy, man.

[02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:32.110]
But you don't have anything else.

[02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:33.030]
Although he does have the meat.

[02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:36.710]
Hall COVID-27, Ray Romano 25, and Will Smith 25.

[02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:39.050]
And a list way too long to read them all out of 916.

[02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:41.550]
We need 84 votes in 37 minutes.

[02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:42.930]
That's like a little over two a minute.

[02:20:43.230 --> 02:20:45.090]
That's like one every 25 seconds.

[02:20:45.090 --> 02:20:46.830]
What's the big stimulus with that, right?

[02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:47.950]
You would expect the audience.

[02:20:48.130 --> 02:20:48.690]
We got out there.

[02:20:49.530 --> 02:20:50.210]
Bristol, Oklahoma.

[02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:53.090]
Juris hearing the case against the former judge accused

[02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:55.430]
of exposing himself in his Creek County courtroom.

[02:20:55.770 --> 02:20:58.550]
We'll be allowed to see the sex toy at the center of the state's allegations

[02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.130]
that Judge Rule yesterday rejecting the fence motion.

[02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:04.950]
They can also hear testimony that a second penis pump was seen under

[02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:08.710]
former district Judge Donald Thompson's bench among other evidence Thompson's attorney

[02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:11.190]
sought to have barred from next week's scheduled trial.

[02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:14.310]
It is so fantastic and so unconnected, the factual support

[02:21:14.310 --> 02:21:17.630]
and so prejudicial attorney Clark Brewster complained in tying

[02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:20.730]
in trying to convince Judge C. Allen recalled a suppressed and state evidence.

[02:21:21.310 --> 02:21:24.550]
Thompson 58 has spent more than 20 years on the bench before setting down more than

[02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:26.970]
a year ago faces three counts of indecent exposure.

[02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:30.410]
Prosecutors' lights he masturbated with a penis pump under his robe

[02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:33.570]
by presenting over two murder trials in a civil trial in 2003.

[02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:37.890]
Thompson denies the allegations and said the pump season the case was a gag gift

[02:21:37.890 --> 02:21:38.730]
from a friend.

[02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:42.150]
Brewster argued that the state should be prevented from submitting the device's

[02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:45.190]
evidence containing the not only did it not function, but it was also

[02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:47.890]
sought in half on the file in the state's custody.

[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:49.010]
That must have hurt.

[02:21:49.350 --> 02:21:53.050]
Now, prosecutor Patti Hai, no relation I'm sure to jet high,

[02:21:53.470 --> 02:21:56.130]
said an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation chemist followed procedure

[02:21:56.130 --> 02:21:58.830]
in starting the pump in two to swab it for DNA evidence.

[02:21:59.070 --> 02:22:00.350]
McCall denied the defense request.

[02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:04.070]
The judge also refused to defense motion to prevent testimony from a courtroom reporter

[02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:07.710]
who said she discovered a different penis pump out of the judge's bench in 2001.

[02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:10.810]
Brewster said there was no evidence to link the pump to his client,

[02:22:10.810 --> 02:22:14.670]
but high-counter that testimony would help show this defendant committed the same crime

[02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:16.690]
over and over and over again.

[02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.990]
There's that over and over thing.

[02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:21.410]
McCall took other issues raised by Thompson's team under advisement,

[02:22:21.430 --> 02:22:25.370]
including testimony from woman who prosecuted a sexual relationship with Thompson

[02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:28.290]
and the admission of 180 hours of courtroom takes this into the

[02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:30.650]
Wushing Sound of the penis pump in use.

[02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:33.830]
No, the Wushing Sound.

[02:22:34.430 --> 02:22:35.550]
Do we have a Wushing Sound?

[02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:38.910]
Alphando, I got not that.

[02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:42.350]
No, you even hired me to better than that.

[02:22:43.390 --> 02:22:44.190]
How about this?

[02:22:45.010 --> 02:22:45.670]
Yeah, like that.

[02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:51.250]
I mean, that's more like a Wushing Sound of me.

[02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:53.610]
Brewster said he hadn't received the tapes until Friday,

[02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:58.130]
had no time to have an expert evaluate them or verify certain enhanced portions provided by prosecutors.

[02:22:58.530 --> 02:23:02.050]
If the jury's going to listen to these, they're going to need to listen to 180 hours he also told the judge.

[02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:06.250]
The trial is expected to begin Monday when attorneys begin questioning a 350-member jury

[02:23:06.250 --> 02:23:07.970]
pool the trials expected last one or two weeks.

[02:23:08.330 --> 02:23:10.370]
Two days hearings offered a glimpse at the lower details,

[02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:14.850]
jurors can expect to consider and even see if the judge decides that prosecutors can't

[02:23:14.850 --> 02:23:17.970]
met a photo they see will be used by witness to identify Thompson's penis.

[02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:20.410]
Brewster had sought that much of two days' motions,

[02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:23.310]
sealed arguing that they contain anecdotal remarks from hundreds of people

[02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:25.170]
with literally crazy things to say.

[02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:28.430]
He said media coverage of the hearing contains potential jurors.

[02:23:28.690 --> 02:23:31.450]
McCall refused citing the public's rights to know and the media's right to report.

[02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:34.590]
He allowed Brewster and Hyde to agree on some of the contention claims before they were

[02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:35.770]
arguing in the courtroom.

[02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:40.310]
Brewster said some of the states have evidence would never be raised and they routine exposure case.

[02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:42.770]
Because we've got a public figure we want to vilify, he said.

[02:23:43.310 --> 02:23:46.130]
He also made it clear that the former judge would not receive any special treatment.

[02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:50.770]
If convicted Thompson were to face up to 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine on each charge

[02:23:50.770 --> 02:23:53.090]
would have the register as a sex offender fine as well.

[02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:53.930]
How do you like that?

[02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:59.270]
It's just like those guys with a killed man always be very suspicious of what they got over those kills

[02:23:59.270 --> 02:24:01.450]
and what the judge got under his robes.

[02:24:01.450 --> 02:24:04.690]
Just kind of like them and religious notes too you know, that were those dresses.

[02:24:04.690 --> 02:24:06.410]
Sure kind of like the Swiss guard.

[02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:08.770]
933 we got a shot.

[02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:11.270]
This is New Rogers.

[02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:14.810]
This is 5162.

[02:24:14.970 --> 02:24:15.210]
18.

[02:24:17.050 --> 02:24:20.210]
The Unlittle come any worse than New Rogers.

[02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.830]

[02:24:24.350 --> 02:24:28.970]
This is their rather on special assignment for CBS News.

[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:32.330]
I now have a major announcement to make.

[02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:38.490]
I have decided to change my name from then rather to D-Rath.

[02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:44.510]
I thought the entire then rather name was getting in the way between me and my fans.

[02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:52.490]
I've also cut my hair to a point in the front and dyed the tip screen so I might appeal to the young hipsters.

[02:24:52.490 --> 02:25:01.890]
I've also traded in my Lincoln town car and got myself a new whip which is slang for car.

[02:25:02.470 --> 02:25:08.410]
My new ride is a Cadillac escalator and I've picked my ride.

[02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:10.490]
I've got the spinning rim.

[02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:13.470]
I've got the dykes hanging from the muc.

[02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:19.470]
And of course I've got a kick ass sound system where I can play or two parts.

[02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:27.290]
Plus I've got a plasma screen in the back seat so as I can kick it with my homies and play video games.

[02:25:27.770 --> 02:25:31.950]
I've redeperated my house or my crib.

[02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:33.370]
It's fat.

[02:25:34.470 --> 02:25:38.790]
And when I say fat, it's spelled Ph.A.T.

[02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:42.370]
which is slang for cool hip.

[02:25:43.090 --> 02:25:47.230]
Happen it because D-Rath is reinventing themselves.

[02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:54.290]
I'm wearing a blade and I'm coming at you wearing baggy clothes and dating hoes.

[02:25:54.350 --> 02:25:56.190]
This ain't no hola back girl.

[02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:59.970]
D-Rath on special assignment for Shibius new.

[02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:02.230]
Oh you kids D-Rath would Larry last night, huh?

[02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:02.590]
Uh huh.

[02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:08.890]
I've heard really, I all Tamil surfers see who Larry's got on and swat some snappers and spinners and squeezes bag ones or twice.

[02:26:09.170 --> 02:26:09.690]
And then that's it.

[02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:11.610]
But Dan was on my side and he was really good.

[02:26:12.330 --> 02:26:14.970]
Dan Rath which leads me into this next story that I'm going to read.

[02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:16.350]
You're not going to read more crap are you?

[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.970]
You bet.

[02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:19.930]
951 we need 49 votes in 26 minutes.

[02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.650]
Oh geez.

[02:26:20.930 --> 02:26:22.710]
That's less than two a minute for Christ's sakes, right?

[02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.230]
Right.

[02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:25.690]
We can do that blindfolded with our hand tied, deconsight our-

[02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:25.810]
Right.

[02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:26.850]
You'd think.

[02:26:27.450 --> 02:26:29.910]
Emotional rather blasts the new journalism order.

[02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:30.730]
This is good.

[02:26:31.050 --> 02:26:32.450]
He was very good last night all the way home.

[02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:34.790]
As usual he like cast a tiptoe around the edges.

[02:26:34.930 --> 02:26:35.690]
You don't want to say too much.

[02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:37.210]
Like Brian Williams, why I agree with you?

[02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:38.190]
I watch him every night now.

[02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:39.470]
Now let me just tell you this.

[02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:41.310]
I think that most people would have come and-

[02:26:41.310 --> 02:26:42.790]
First of all most people are watching the news.

[02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:43.970]
They watch you know daily show.

[02:26:43.970 --> 02:26:45.670]
Whatever they watch if they're under the age of 100.

[02:26:45.890 --> 02:26:48.930]
Let us old fart said actually are in the habit of watching the nightly news.

[02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:51.670]
You get hooked and you watch CBS watercrunk,

[02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:54.070]
I'd Dan Rath who run for about 100 years between the two of them.

[02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:55.990]
And I would never deviate from that.

[02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:57.330]
Deviate, yes, deviate no.

[02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:58.170]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:26:58.510 --> 02:26:58.790]
Deviate.

[02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:59.410]
You get in the habit.

[02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:02.810]
And like now when once they put the old funny dirty oaky doaky on there

[02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:04.030]
from the oaky fin oaky swan,

[02:27:04.350 --> 02:27:05.430]
she grew just around her teeth.

[02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:07.690]
I watched it once and bye bye.

[02:27:07.850 --> 02:27:09.850]
By the way he's also very condescending I've noticed.

[02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:11.230]
He's using oaky doaky.

[02:27:11.470 --> 02:27:12.850]
Oh he's just obnoxious.

[02:27:12.850 --> 02:27:13.630]
He has no business.

[02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:15.250]
He had really caused the auto-welow.

[02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:18.070]
I mean that's a match made in purgatory the two of them.

[02:27:18.210 --> 02:27:20.370]
Neither one of them belongs on here just to say hello or goodbye.

[02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:21.010]
Hopefully goodbye.

[02:27:21.470 --> 02:27:21.830]
Terrible.

[02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:24.310]
So anyway I saw that one night and I thought to myself,

[02:27:24.610 --> 02:27:28.510]
you people have to be schmitt me at CBS even though this is an intermediate stop on a way.

[02:27:28.930 --> 02:27:32.150]
So then I flipped over and of course at that time Peter Jennings was like on a way out

[02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:34.370]
to the big talk booth in the sky.

[02:27:34.850 --> 02:27:36.870]
And so that left NBC and Brian Williams.

[02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:38.570]
Now I agree and he's hard to look at.

[02:27:38.930 --> 02:27:39.430]
You get you.

[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:41.930]
That article I had yesterday where it said something about pretty boy.

[02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:43.370]
Oh man.

[02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.890]
They must eat some.

[02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:47.550]
I know a good ophthalmologist but at any rate.

[02:27:47.970 --> 02:27:51.810]
But he does a good job and he's easy to listen to and as long as you don't look at the fact he's got those

[02:27:52.470 --> 02:28:00.390]
800 little teeth and on the lower teeth and his eyebrows are like a cock-eyed and the fact that his face is not symmetrical.

[02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:01.210]
Other than that.

[02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:06.930]
And he also has that the thing that the weather guy is got which I can't think of his name right now because I have Alzheimer's.

[02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:08.190]
What thing is that?

[02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:11.950]
The guy from CNN and the weather guy that I'm so well Rob whatever's name is.

[02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:12.370]
Marciano.

[02:28:12.910 --> 02:28:13.710]
Very good.

[02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:16.110]
Rocky Mar, feel more like Rocky Marciano.

[02:28:16.450 --> 02:28:17.270]
How about Rocky Graziano?

[02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:21.370]
He used to be that Rocky Graziano he's maybe 135th and this gay man I was good.

[02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:26.010]
But anyway, he has that same like he put his hidden device in a kind of like squished up a little bit.

[02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:26.330]
You know what I mean?

[02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.490]
Like a like pimple head.

[02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:28.430]
Pimple head.

[02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:37.510]
Anyway former CBS news anchor Dan Rather said Monday that there's a climate of fear running through newsroom stronger than he's ever seen in more than his four decade career.

[02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:43.750]
Rather famously tangled with President Nixon and his age during the water gate years while Rather was a hard charging White House correspondent.

[02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:47.990]
Addressing the Fordham University School of Law Manhattan occasionally forksing back tears.

[02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:56.210]
He said that the intervening years, public seasons of every persuasion had gotten better and applying pressure on the conglomerates that own broadcast networks.

[02:28:56.590 --> 02:29:05.570]
He called it a new journalism order when he said he said this pressure along with the dumbed down, tarted up coverage, the advent of 24 hour cable competition.

[02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:09.450]
And the chase for ratings in demographics has taken its toll on the news business.

[02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:12.910]
All of this creates a bigger atmosphere of fear in the newsrooms you said.

[02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:21.690]
Rather was accompanied by HBO documentary and family president Sheila Nevin's both of whom were due to receive lifetime achievement awards at the News and Documentary Emmy Awards Monday night.

[02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:22.130]
And they did.

[02:29:22.650 --> 02:29:26.570]
Nevin said that even in the documentary world there's a certain kind of intimidation brought to bear these days.

[02:29:26.850 --> 02:29:28.450]
Especially from the religious right.

[02:29:29.130 --> 02:29:36.750]
If you made a movie about evolutionary biology Charles Darwin, it would be revolutionary to have said if we did a documentary on Darwin, I'd get a thousand hate email.

[02:29:37.710 --> 02:29:42.770]
Nevin asked Rather if he felt the same type of repressive forces in the Nixon administration as in the current Bush administration.

[02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:48.330]
No, I do not rather said that's not to say there weren't forces trying to remove him from the White House beat while reporting on water gate.

[02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:55.930]
But Rather said he felt supported by everybody above him from Washington bureau chief Bill Small to then news president Dixellant and CBS chief William S. Paley.

[02:29:55.930 --> 02:30:04.190]
There was a connection between the leadership and the sense of awareness together rather said it's not that to then leadership of CBS was interested in sureholder value and profits.

[02:30:04.310 --> 02:30:06.650]
But they also saw news as a public service.

[02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:11.490]
Rather said he knew very little of the intense pressure moving in the early seventies because of his bosses support.

[02:30:12.210 --> 02:30:15.650]
Nevin took up the cross for rather was emotional several times during the event.

[02:30:16.770 --> 02:30:21.490]
When a man is close to tears discussing his work and his lips quiver he deserves bosses who punch back.

[02:30:21.690 --> 02:30:23.310]
I feel I would punch back for Dan.

[02:30:23.310 --> 02:30:33.590]
Nevin said rather praise the coverage of hurricane Katrina by the new generation of TV journalist and acknowledge that he would have liked to have reported from the Gulf Coast covering hurricanes is something I know something about he said.

[02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:36.630]
It's been one of television's finest news moments. He said that Katrina coverage.

[02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:39.630]
He likened the coverage of President Kennedy's assassination in sixty three.

[02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:43.390]
They were willing to speak truth to the power where I rather said the coverage.

[02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:44.710]
Of course, I didn't last too long.

[02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:49.690]
Rather side step to question what should happen to the evening news and the expected makeover not my call.

[02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:51.510]
He said and he said he hadn't been asked either.

[02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:53.710]
I gave it everything I had. I didn't hold anything back.

[02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:56.070]
I did the best news. Can't we were capable of doing rather said.

[02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:59.570]
Nevin's one more single handedly is kept the art of the independent documentary on television.

[02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:04.210]
Said the HBO documentary show real life and do with it is little damage to the substance as possible.

[02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:07.850]
She said the producers and directors respect mostly the people on the other side of the camera.

[02:31:08.310 --> 02:31:16.490]
Nevin said she didn't shy away from such our rated topic says G string divas and taxi cab confessions but noted that sex and passion at the top is a literature since Chaucer's Day.

[02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:19.670]
The most our rated is a body bag not a naked body.

[02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:24.870]
Nevin said that's a good line. Most our rated is a body bag.

[02:31:25.090 --> 02:31:26.910]
He ought to make it body not in America though today.

[02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:34.070]
Not these days. Now what's going around as we've had a bloodless coup taken over by the fanatical right way in the limitics by crazy people.

[02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:39.490]
And there's one of them by the way decision for these individuals to get see she's cure of Phillips on the end of season.

[02:31:39.730 --> 02:31:46.470]
All of these people now there no longer news readers now their commentators now they got an opinion now they're sucking up to the bush mice to buy.

[02:31:46.470 --> 02:31:53.290]
And then they're all goose deaf and this is me Roger what solid this is 5.62.

[02:31:56.550 --> 02:32:01.250]
You saw it time you go to college now watching go back even further.

[02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:04.110]
It's time he goes to kindergarten.

[02:32:04.410 --> 02:32:07.190]
Okay kids now we're going to finger.

[02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:09.870]
How am I doing?

[02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:15.150]
Just fine Tommy dear but it's not nice to use that finger.

[02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:19.330]
Some kids are the teachers pet but Tommy Lee just lost a pet that teacher.

[02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:20.590]
Nap time kids.

[02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:23.690]
They teach. Come nap time we say you and we won't go.

[02:32:23.890 --> 02:32:26.710]
I'm afraid that wouldn't be appropriate little Tommy.

[02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:27.610]
Oh yeah.

[02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:32.070]
Make that big Tommy.

[02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:35.250]
And see me after class.

[02:32:35.490 --> 02:32:38.650]
Everything Tommy Lee needs to know he'll learn in kindergarten.

[02:32:38.650 --> 02:32:41.250]
Tommy do you know your ABC?

[02:32:41.770 --> 02:32:48.090]
Yeah I'm sure yeah there's a hepatitis A hepatitis B and then the one that Pam has.

[02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:53.070]
Time to read those check to your parents just where he belongs only on NBC world.

[02:32:53.890 --> 02:32:59.910]
Yeah well being Canadian she's about to have a tight as a 972 votes we need 28 in the 15 minutes.

[02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:04.110]
That would be like that would be like picking your nose you know what would be peace of cake.

[02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:08.510]
Getting those 28 votes in only 15 minutes should be should be don't bring us right to the edge there.

[02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:11.250]
Let us down okay that would be really bad.

[02:33:11.250 --> 02:33:14.490]
Speaking of that Pope Benedict the 16 year Nazi Pope.

[02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:18.710]
Hey we got a Nazi present Nazi Pope you know something to make a real fast comeback never again.

[02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:19.370]
Yeah right.

[02:33:19.970 --> 02:33:22.830]
Simon Viesenthal is already rolling over in his grave and he just croaked.

[02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:28.510]
Pope Benedict the 16th City of approved a document saying that homosexual men should not be ordained as Roman Catholic priest.

[02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:34.930]
A conservative Catholic website before yesterday to which I say a rational and choice okay that means that it closed the doors too late.

[02:33:34.930 --> 02:33:38.930]
The long anticipated document prepared a request of the late Pope John Paul the tooth.

[02:33:39.090 --> 02:33:49.370]
Reportedly calls on bishops to bar even chased homosexuals from seminaries have been chased out because the orientation is rooted in the person out of the assortment that may undermine their capacity to minister according to the Catholic world news.

[02:33:49.610 --> 02:34:01.990]
The report posted yesterday on cwnews.com and independent news service with links to the post-American publisher could not be independently corroborated but several Vatican sources confirm that such a document has been seen on his desk awaiting his decision.

[02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:06.110]
I wonder what he's going to do for a sign that or drink that cup of tea that sitting right next to it.

[02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:14.170]
If this is true what's a disaster said a gay priest who I think it's not going to be named and no many celibate gay priests who feel they couldn't live with any integrity in a church that treats gay men like this.

[02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:18.010]
And I know that many gay seminarians have been living celibate lives with ease who simply would leave.

[02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:24.970]
Since the recent priest text abuse scandal the issue of gay priest has gone from taboo to one of the most highly debated aspects of the crisis.

[02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:33.530]
Noting that the overwhelming majority of victims were teenage boys powerful members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy have framed the problem as homosexual priests unable to live chastly.

[02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:38.990]
Liberal tendency to root the scandal in a culture of clerical secrecy and the church's mandatory celibacy requirement.

[02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:49.630]
While the document does not represent any change in church teaching it is expected that a significant impact on American seminaries because it flies in the face of the facto policy of don't acts, don't tell them most of them.

[02:34:49.630 --> 02:35:01.790]
But you sure can tell by looking for that reason many conservatives here but there's a gift of policy that's badly needed corrective others however say they fear to drive some gay seminarians deeper into the closet even as it diminishes a declining pool of seminarians.

[02:35:02.050 --> 02:35:05.330]
They're all doing it in the pool naked by the way I think down in he's still in there too.

[02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:16.770]
I believe we would have a strong impact but I'm afraid it will be negative said the Reverend Donald cousins the former seminary rector rector who wrote a book several years ago describing how the priesthood is or is becoming a gay profession.

[02:35:16.770 --> 02:35:31.850]
The number of seminarians is already dramatically down from 40 years ago cousin said this may make the situation even more dire than it already is and I'm also concerned that it might drive out men who might be destined to give very fine service to the church and boy they sure can service those altar boys like nobody can practice makes perfect.

[02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:41.510]
Does that what they say practice makes perfect that's it and right in line with this and lack of wake o' Texas a dining contractor and we had a little on the story remember the starbucks thing in the coffee cup.

[02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:51.630]
I wish we were to ago a dining contractors moved coffee cups with a gay authors quote from a starbucks at Baylor University at Baylor University saying it was inappropriate for the Baptist school.

[02:35:51.930 --> 02:36:00.450]
Aaron Mark which oversees the coffee out let pulled the cups earlier this month in the campus to our consultant with Starbucks district office and Baylor's dining service school official said Monday.

[02:36:00.690 --> 02:36:11.490]
I think they were trying to be sensitive Baylor spokesman Larry Brumley said obviously Baylor is a Baptist affiliate institution and Baptist as a denomination been pretty outspoken on the record about the denomination views about the homosexuals.

[02:36:11.490 --> 02:36:25.830]
I'm a social lifestyle and agenda the quote from novelist armistede of Moe pen reads my only regret about being gay is that I repressed it for so long I surrendered my youth of the people I feared when I could have been out there loving someone don't make that mistake yourself life to damn short to which I say absolutely correct.

[02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:33.590]
I'm a company that's with a comma Canadian F and A Canadians kicking it Canadian style can't hand in prison the board of directors for the game.

[02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:49.210]
Us being lives of central Texas any thanks to the caption was unnecessarily restricted being the master understatement that he is how do you like that no more gay priest baby no more cat lectured no more donations in the airplane every Sunday no more of those smatters those fancy smatters to put on.

[02:36:50.650 --> 02:37:01.330]
Oh my god. I'm having to feel cross and we're having to feel guilty about certain things how are you doing on our 987 man 987 it's almost like being in heaven.

[02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:03.870]
This is me Roger.

[02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:07.830]
God this is 5.16.2.8.

[02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:16.810]
This is WQAM where they're very buildable and they don't come any better than Todd Keller.

[02:37:17.850 --> 02:37:19.570]
Thank you. Please be seated.

[02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:29.770]
I want to remind people that who might be listening that this administration is a group of frustrated,

[02:37:30.130 --> 02:37:35.990]
desperate people who kill innocent life and Americans out of view at this such.

[02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:41.430]
And now be glad to take some of your questions. Terry wants to start.

[02:37:41.430 --> 02:37:50.650]
Thank you Mr. President. As you know new Orleans is destroyed thousands are dead and countless families are now homeless.

[02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:54.950]
I'd like to get your thoughts on this overwhelming problem.

[02:37:55.130 --> 02:38:04.830]
Oh we don't have a problem let's ignore it sir. Might I remind you that you have a responsibility as a commander in chief to step up and act on the people's behalf.

[02:38:05.310 --> 02:38:06.710]
Okay here's what I intend to do about it.

[02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:22.650]
Thank you sir. I'm curious if you're worried that your poor handling of Hurricane Katrina will lead to your downfall in Washington DC.

[02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:34.290]
I don't worry about anything here in Washington DC. I mean I feel comfortable in my role as the president and my role in the president is to push terrible disease in order to destroy life.

[02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:37.390]
And I have made my position very clear on that issue.

[02:38:38.830 --> 02:38:47.950]
David thank you Mr. President thousands of struggles remain stranded in New Orleans surrounded by raw sewage and without food.

[02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:51.850]
What is your administration proposing they eat?

[02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:56.070]
Beauty. Listen thank you all for coming out and joining.

[02:38:57.410 --> 02:39:00.170]
We all need a bus.

[02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:06.830]
I'm on vacation increasingly extended periods of time.

[02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:12.330]
We only need a month long so we intend to stay forever.

[02:39:12.690 --> 02:39:14.570]
I just got back to my whirlwinds.

[02:39:14.570 --> 02:39:15.790]
Sure it's hard work.

[02:39:16.050 --> 02:39:19.530]
I've got access in the world.

[02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:22.950]
It's a it's hard work.

[02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:25.230]
It is hard work. It is hard work.

[02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:27.910]
Read us right to read.

[02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:31.330]
With everything going wrong.

[02:39:31.430 --> 02:39:35.030]
He did what any of us would do. He went on vacation.

[02:39:35.710 --> 02:39:39.470]
Hey bossen, let us work this go.

[02:39:39.890 --> 02:39:43.930]
But we have a lot of a lot more work to do. Now get back to work.

[02:39:44.490 --> 02:39:48.550]
All in all we really have no time all the time.

[02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:51.390]
I only get two weeks of vacation a year.

[02:39:51.390 --> 02:39:53.450]
How many days there Christmas vacation?

[02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:55.450]
All in all we work songs.

[02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:59.330]
I know we're back here.

[02:39:59.610 --> 02:40:02.150]
Work again. If you don't work your ship.

[02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:03.950]
You can't have any vacation.

[02:40:04.470 --> 02:40:07.370]
How can you have a vacation if you don't work your ship?

[02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:08.710]
No one is pulling around.

[02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:10.110]
I've got to get back to work.

[02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:11.250]
Hey man.

[02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:14.650]
On 17th we got Grandpa Mo from New York coming back to work today.

[02:40:14.770 --> 02:40:17.110]
How do you like that? Maybe not coming back but doing a show from New York.

[02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:18.570]
We got the Mad Dog.

[02:40:18.730 --> 02:40:20.590]
For Marlon's baseball I've said that last night.

[02:40:20.690 --> 02:40:24.010]
That could have been a precipitous situation.

[02:40:24.470 --> 02:40:25.870]
In other words it was a lousy loss.

[02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.930]
What I'm trying to say.

[02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.490]
Yeah really was.

[02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:29.630]
Should have been doing that losing to a girl seemed like the match.

[02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:30.830]
As far as the 3-2 I think?

[02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.190]
Yes.

[02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.870]
Not good.

[02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:33.350]
No matter what the score will not go.

[02:40:33.450 --> 02:40:34.390]
But I'll have a shot.

[02:40:34.930 --> 02:40:37.070]
Worst TV actor actress ever. We got our thousand votes.

[02:40:37.250 --> 02:40:38.030]
Thank you profusely.

[02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:39.750]
Some people would say, well what's the big deal?

[02:40:39.890 --> 02:40:41.570]
Why do you keep like because we feel like it?

[02:40:41.890 --> 02:40:44.930]
It's like a little bit of a challenge, right?

[02:40:44.930 --> 02:40:45.470]
Right.

[02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:48.870]
Not a big deal. It's not going to make us any money or lose us any money while we're there.

[02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:51.830]
And I'm going to change my life. Certainly not going to change either one of your lives.

[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:54.670]
And maybe if Josh Washington's never getting, he might like a better this time.

[02:40:55.250 --> 02:40:55.550]
That's a big deal.

[02:40:55.850 --> 02:41:00.610]
Maybe they can send it to one of those joys in Utah and they can take out the, certainly the sex part.

[02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:02.750]
And they can take out all the pondress parts.

[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:05.010]
And of course in that movie they'd have to take out a language part.

[02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:06.250]
So like I said don't watch it.

[02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:10.270]
The worst TV actor actress ever is or was Donald Trump 108.

[02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:12.650]
He ain't so great and that's for sure.

[02:41:12.650 --> 02:41:16.650]
Chuck Norris 92, Tony Danza 71, Torrey Spelling 68.

[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:19.070]
How you can see the daughter of Aaron Spelling?

[02:41:19.350 --> 02:41:19.810]
She is.

[02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:20.710]
And that's why she's there.

[02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.430]
I see.

[02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:25.550]
Now what we want to show is Aaron Spelling that he was a great, uh, Maven.

[02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:27.890]
Night time soap opera ones, but I forget which ones.

[02:41:28.110 --> 02:41:29.150]
Besides that no to one.

[02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:30.770]
Which is the one that he made for her.

[02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:32.270]
A vehicle for her.

[02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.890]
A vehicle?

[02:41:33.130 --> 02:41:33.430]
Yeah.

[02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:34.870]
Maybe you had to get her a caddy rat.

[02:41:35.250 --> 02:41:36.190]
Five seconds, 51.

[02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:37.670]
Mr. T-45.

[02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:39.970]
David Peruso 42 with the orange hair.

[02:41:39.970 --> 02:41:46.330]
Rose Anne 39, Ken O'Rea 36, Ashton Kuchi Kuchi 31, Hulk Hogan 28, Ray Romano 27,

[02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:47.310]
everybody hates Ray.

[02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:48.670]
Will Smith 27.

[02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.270]
Mm hmm.

[02:41:49.430 --> 02:41:54.410]
J.G. Walker 25, David's Hasselhoff 23, Victoria Gotti and friend, Richard 22.

[02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:58.450]
And I see a lot of similarities in kind of a Jewish attack in the thing.

[02:41:58.910 --> 02:42:01.070]
What I never did get to the story about the goddy did I?

[02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.990]
Damn it.

[02:42:02.250 --> 02:42:04.170]
Well let me find it here real quick.

[02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:05.230]
I have to say a lot.

[02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:06.310]
They probably know about this already.

[02:42:06.430 --> 02:42:07.150]
I can't find it.

[02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:08.310]
Oh, G.R.

[02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:09.590]
You back out of that thing to get in here.

[02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:14.070]
This accused mob boss John A. Jr. Gotti who insisted he left organized crime years ago and

[02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:16.150]
only wanted to be a typical suburban dead.

[02:42:16.410 --> 02:42:18.110]
May soon get his wish after victory in court.

[02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:21.550]
Gotti could soon be freed after being acquitted yesterday and has securities for our church.

[02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:25.670]
Having a misproud declared on three more serious counts including a boxed and bloody kidnapping.

[02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:33.410]
Project prosecutors suggest they would seek to retry the Sunday laymossed mob boss John Gotti and defense attorneys asked him to be released on bail.

[02:42:33.810 --> 02:42:35.910]
The judge said he was likely to grant the request to coming days.

[02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:39.510]
And drawing a plus from Gotti's supporters and I would be surprised if he winds up on that show.

[02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:40.350]
Let's hear it.

[02:42:40.390 --> 02:42:41.270]
The whole goddy family.

[02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:43.390]
The god, the godson mishfucker wouldn't that be great?

[02:42:43.650 --> 02:42:44.190]
That'd be something.

[02:42:44.530 --> 02:42:45.290]
The goddy clan.

[02:42:45.850 --> 02:42:46.610]
Where did I leave off?

[02:42:46.930 --> 02:42:51.490]
Friend Reshard 22, Bill Shantner 20, Kelly Rippen 19, Erica Strada 17, Eric Uf Fairy.

[02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:57.690]
Terry Seinfeld 16, David Schwimmer 14, Don Johnson 12, Herbae Villesreys 11, Lorenzo Lamis.

[02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:59.050]
I think that is a personal shot.

[02:42:59.230 --> 02:43:05.130]
Lorenzo 10 and Jalilo White 10, Mario Lopez, the alleged rapist and after that small disease.

[02:43:05.130 --> 02:43:06.470]
I think I'll do this.

[02:43:06.750 --> 02:43:08.250]
Grandpa Moe coming up next.

[02:43:08.310 --> 02:43:09.090]
Bye, bye, bye.
