[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520]
Ah

[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.500]
Subbit like I was in a tin can and that criminal that was that I

[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.300]
Don't know didn't it started hollow that sounded okay. I'm I know from where I am. It's not okay

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.360]
Hey, it's you that's good enough. That's all that counts. That's right me. Yeah. What's up you?

[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.560]
You a ham. Oh, yeah, were they lucky?

[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:40.080]
That guy how about my Spartans baby. I'm gonna tell you something that guy was about as lonely as all alone as a guy with body odor in L.

[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.260]
They right and

[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.140]
You can smell it. You couldn't smell the defeat in the area. Yeah, and if the canes it starting off had started off

[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.260]
Oh, and two. Oh wow that would have been that would almost have been like the dolphins losing the jets

[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.160]
Well, that wasn't unexpected. Why wait Neil? Why now? Why do you say that? Why not unexpected?

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.180]
I picked the game 17 6 on the S. B. N.

[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.980]
That's your last week excuse me although Kansas City's pretty damn good looks like excuse me. Yes on ESPN on my selection segment

[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.020]
I said the jets are not as bad as they look last week the dolphins are not are not as bad as they look last week the dolphins are not as good

[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.700]
I gave the score jets 17 the offense six. I was all I have to go to the last week they played a half

[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.660]
They were good in the second half when they realized that vendor missed the team bus. Yeah, I mean they had to go to New York

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.440]
Where the jets always beat them. Yeah, and the offense. I have no offense

[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.380]
I'm gonna have this kind of a year. It's gonna right up and down

[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.880]
Hey, if you look pretty weak yesterday, they missed the bus also. I picked that too. Boy, they look bad. Really bad

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.000]
You're a friend Tom Brady got knocked around for the joint

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240]
I've been in a course a special team is really a stunt

[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.120]
But we don't want to and Michigan state. I would have beat you a lot of money

[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.540]
Be a bait of a man that they were gonna blow that lead out again

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.740]
I don't know how long that they actually would pull it out and over time

[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.560]
But they do that all the time. It's like some teams just have this neurotic repetition

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.620]
They just famous for doing the same thing 38 to 17 and I thought to myself

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.700]
And they can get out of the third quarter with a three touchdown lead

[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.240]
Then they're gonna win it and of course they didn't so you're watching a football this weekend

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.940]
Yeah, I watched a little football. I saw my buddy Tom Brady Pat Quinn. I mean Brady Quinn. Yeah, oh Brady Quinn

[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.020]
Yeah, I know to them. I know who that is. Yeah, but

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.120]
See, it's not important. We at least they made it exciting anyway. They pulled it on over time touchdown

[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.440]
Jesus couldn't pull it through for me. Well, I can't be glad again that you're not here this week

[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.560]
I am with the would be Brian or I mean we did in fact and just the latest thing that I

[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.000]
Printed out here is that the tropical stormy to could become as much as a her category three

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.280]
Hurricane by the time it hits the keys. Oh, I knew is that right? Yeah, we didn't get that on our report

[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.380]
Well, I guess got the latest and the greatest from your friends at the herald

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.200]
So I'm on top of it. Oh, if it's in the herald it must be right

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.180]
Son of shine in here. It's beautiful. There's not a cloud. It's got to be like 77 today

[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.180]
Man, it's just like heaven all week all week now. We'll have a week of rain. I guess well good luck to you

[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.480]
You'll need it. Thanks. I don't think it doesn't look like the storm is gonna be too much of an impact up here

[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.160]
But don't say that I know don't say that I got suckered into saying that last time based on the predictors and the prognosticators

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880]
Then of course to date turned out they've got him pretty bad

[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.100]
So don't say that because looks like there could be a lot of rain out I'll get to eventually here in a couple minutes

[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.720]
Lot of rain and wind yeah

[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.660]
Downing trees power outages. It said we're not like Katrina. Oh similar to when Katrina hit Florida

[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.760]
With a beat that bad here possible. Yeah, cuz it seems to be going south

[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.100]
Is that what you're probably said last time we thought it was gonna hit Bokeh and then it took that little jog

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.320]
All it takes is just a little bit of a jog there, you know at the ass end and

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.740]
That's what happened with Andrew

[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.700]
Remember Andrew was supposed to go north. Can you imagine if it would have?

[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.760]
Because I said I sat out on my well part of the time I said out on my

[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.020]
Epadio and it was just it was like the end of the world and that was in West Broward and of course

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.540]
You know hitting homestead so one can only begin to imagine and this rain Nagan

[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.240]
He's this guy's a knucklehead to come to find out. He's an idiot

[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.020]
Yeah, I'm being bringing I was people to come

[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.580]
Everybody to come and they open up dad there. They got no power in most of the place. They got no potable water

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.520]
They got no nothing and of course all the disease in the unhealthy environment their hospitals are for the most part close down

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.820]
The bars are open and I got the bars open in the French quarter. Yeah, there you go

[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.580]
That's what's important and they can just get the fairgrounds open in the bars. Everything will be okay. Oh speaking of the fairgrounds

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.100]
Yeah, there's an update on Gulfstream

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520]
Yeah, I

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.540]
Talk to a guy who told him who's close to the construction people who told me they could work 24 hours a day from now until they're opening

[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.900]
And they won't even have the first floor finished. Well, that's good

[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.260]
Yeah, but I bet you they'll bring back Gary Puckett in the Union gap to sing out there in the banjo

[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.100]
Right, that's all that counts

[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.540]
It's like when Halea when the Bernady brought in all those Huchi Kuchi groups and that was gonna bring the fans back to the race track

[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.200]
Yeah, no that's a few people watching the

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.300]
Brings anybody out there for the race and it was lame acts and not one person would come into the track and bet you know

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.940]
Even lots of race so they just never learned their lesson, you know, and of course now there

[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.320]
Your buddy Mike Mayo actually wrote a good comment. I thought the slot machine about the slots

[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.440]
Yeah, he's got a petition thing going and nice going there Michael the Mayo. That was well done. I read that yesterday

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.340]
Yeah, nothing's gonna have any impact but at least you know

[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.180]
It's an outlet for

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.500]
It's unconscionable that the legislature doesn't enact what the people voted for

[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.920]
Yeah, but I governor never does he will say that the the paramutual people with all the respect to my friends at

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.860]
Topino Park that the per mutual people are there was enough. Yeah, well as soon as judge Mo

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.900]
Soon as he said the given to go from judge Moe they should have started ordering the machines and said look

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.880]
This is it and we're gonna go ahead and the things said by July 1st

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.720]
And he didn't do it that would have gotten them off the rest but they did they're just kind of sitting back

[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.140]
But a beep but it would be like like always in Florida, you know

[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.260]
I think they're afraid of the governor because he's

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.300]
He know what I like it well now the keys the other report that we have received you

[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.420]
Would do that again in a video here mr. Goldberg and gas stations along us one in the key look at that

[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.540]
There's your fat ass governor long as the sun stays off the road will be safe

[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.440]
You said yeah, he's got a hell of a family the moment you said that there came his ugly fat push on my TV on CNN

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.660]
I can't believe that that is shocking timing is everything for to be yeah

[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.140]
And then he also if you ended this announcement about the storm

[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.220]
He's gonna say by the way I forget about the slots

[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.380]
Forget about the class size forget about the bullet train forget about the slots. Yeah, I'm your addicted

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.320]
They don't lose well those people that and the fact is that the public likes him

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.880]
I still can't figure that out. That's one of the great mysteries of all time is why the public likes this loser and is this functional

[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.800]
Fony family the worst they exactly

[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.200]
I was talking about one time one time at a Marlins game back at IOD I had I had

[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.300]
Season tickets to give me like was I maybe the first or second season for the Marlins against the opening season and my seats were right behind

[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.960]
He about five rows behind his he had the front row boxes and I was like any orange like in a first or second row the orange seats and

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.700]
He shows up there with his entourage with this big fat red neck obnoxious fundraiser guy

[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.320]
It was sitting right next to me that took up three seats with his ass and one of his buddies down there was you

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.200]
You can tell you there's that near Roger and he turns around and looked at me the I think this is before he was governor

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.060]
Would have been wouldn't it yeah? How long yeah, and there he was turned around to give me a look that would just kill and I wanted to flip him off

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.780]
But that would have been a bad idea, but I just give him I just give him the equal and sour look

[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.040]
You know somebody was we were talking a couple days ago

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.800]
It's somebody was saying that this family what they're doing to this country where this country is gonna be by the time Bush

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.480]
Leagues leaves office. Uh-huh. We're gonna be the the deficit is gonna be over 700 billion

[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.160]
And right and we aren't gonna have any friends anywhere in the world and we will cease to be a power

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.980]
Yeah, the China will be the whole world makes America now it's even slopping over the hit Americans too. So anywhere I go I'm I'm Canadian

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:01.080]
A oh yeah, you're laughing, but this is the new thing that a lot of Americans that they actually go out and get like you

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.060]
There a candidate t-shirt or a cap or both, you know, and when it go abroad especially to Europe they're like a Canadian

[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.320]
How's it going a I'll tell you when you when you'll lose that

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.600]
Perspective from other people not to you know stereotype raining, but the minute you get behind a wheel of a car

[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.040]
They'll know you're not. Yeah, that's why I don't drive here. Okay

[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.440]
Oh brother, well there's that star. I can't believe you had another big one coming again. Just never stops

[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.220]
Yeah, I mean I'll be in tomorrow. We'll see. Yeah, well we may not be on the year tomorrow. Yeah

[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.280]
That's what I'm always hoping for I'm thinking about 1015 comes along a big gust of wind big

[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.700]
out and all of a sudden the tower goes down and but the track of the song so I checked doing the

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.620]
Investigative work that you would expect from me. I checked that my sources and coming it looks like it

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.920]
Maybe true about your leader

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.860]
So if you plan on getting suspended anymore you got like October about three and a half months to do it till the end of the year

[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.140]
I don't mind the suspension. They always get lifted. Yeah, I'll be careful

[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:06.340]
I'm not commenting on that story anymore. Well, why why is that I threw out the first ball and I'm done

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.320]
Yeah, just like your BS about your buddy there

[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.600]
Do do do do do do do do do stick all the grief into my basket and then I'm left to hold in the sack

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.820]
My buddy is your close personal pal

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.260]
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do I just want to make one comment because I know I'm sure he's listening right now

[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.640]
And that is you can't talk about other people's ratings unless you have any okay? I'm just mentioning that

[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.540]
Anybody in particular, but for somebody who's probably listening right now because I have no life. He has no life

[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:32.780]
Do

[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.200]
When you when you look up your number and it says below minimum reporting standards, you know it's a problem

[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.900]
When it has a minus in front of it. It's not a good sign. Yeah, speaking of guilty by the way. How about those panthers?

[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.520]
Hey, I think there's gonna be a little excitement about them this year

[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.700]
Well, I know they're gonna be pretty good team

[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.300]
I don't know if they're gonna be a seven or not knowing the South Floor. I'm gonna tell you

[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.800]
I was so depressed and seeing the attendance at the three Marlin Phillies games over the weekend. That was so lame

[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.000]
I didn't even I didn't look to see what it was

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.080]
It was a little over 30 on Friday. Sorry. It looked like they had a good crowd

[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.940]
I tried seven

[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.940]
27 and Sunday yesterday was 25 a little over 25 now that's lame

[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.480]
Yeah, they've been standing remotely. This is the season of the series of the season and Von Tro and Beckett bitch

[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.560]
right down the last few games

[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.720]
Just nippin tucked for the wild card and you get you know

[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.800]
mediocre. I mean decent crowds, but nothing like you'd expect in a real sports time and now labor day is over

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.560]
No excuses anymore and the herald today if you want to gag. Yeah, they have a editorial about how they

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.460]
Got to make a deal for a stadium and then it they talk about this third

[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.460]
They could have made a deal when the difference in money was 30 million dollars

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.260]
I'm gonna tell you something the difference in money was never 30 million dollars

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.700]
They underestimate the cost of that stadium from day one, but yeah, the herald well a hero wants them to build a right across the street

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.040]
Just to goose up their property value. Well, they know that can't happen anymore. I know that

[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.400]
But I'm just saying that anything that the herald is for is because it's good for the herald

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.200]
That's true that then a lot of other things have changed there the personnel have changed

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.100]
But that's the one thing they care about the only the heralds interest nothing else. They suck. I can say that

[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.760]
There you go. Don't say though. I said it and it's on my time. I'm soon. I have to worry about the herald sucks

[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.360]
Hey, great. Listen, have a great day. I think Monday's a real gambling. I got the game. Oh, yeah

[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.260]
There's everything but I put four games tonight and I'm going to batten down my hatches and

[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:31.060]
Stock up on corn be for some going down batten down the hatches and they get ready to move to nances

[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.200]
Or something like that. Okay. Hey, I'm good. Daniel. Okay, stay dry. I don't want to tell you what does set to rely on

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.860]
But he said it's curaline easily and then he said something about well

Individual plans from this to health as a south floor have exclusions limitations in terms medical underwriting required

[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.460]
87 dollars based on mail a jt on ifd 30

[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.860]
Summers officially here and so are their scorching hot south Florida temperatures. Is your grudge back in?

[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.480]
Hey everybody. I'm brown and brown

[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.540]
Accountable for everybody brown and brown. That's a human being

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.960]
I'm a big disappointment, but I got a brown nose and I know where to point it

[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:28.720]
There was no one to get them saved. They don't both recover again. Anyway, I did everything

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:35.220]
I possibly can to show myself home for the good luck plan. Oh, what a god

[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:43.060]
The wrecker of fever when I'm a chore than a weasel he's fever and a clueless son of a bitch

[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.440]
A clueless stick brown nose in the ring

[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.740]
Get his gags round nose in the rig

[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.100]
New Orleans is wiped out in gone

[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.380]
But w said I did one heck of a job and it sure pays off

[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.760]
To be a brownie and another white maize

[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.740]
The Christian Fony the national god is down and down

[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.760]
With all of us just to get the press out of town everybody go home

[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.220]
There's nothing to see

[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.780]
Everything here is big, big pain

[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.120]
All the hurricane gave us nothing easy

[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.720]
For geofrown social engineering like a giant republic in Swingy

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.060]
Praise Jesus for our lord and game

[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.480]
Praise Jesus for our lord and game

[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.660]
I don't believe compassion's what we lack

[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:44.460]
It serves the right to have less blacks and you descend to say it's a national disgrace

[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.320]
They shouldn't have it black

[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.240]
In the first place this is no time to play the blame game

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.460]
Since we know that the remains are caused by gain

[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.420]
School are not the right kind of all-mong

[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.940]
Like Scottie McLean and Carl Gold

[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.480]
All we're achieving in a parakeet right when dream

[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.000]
You make everybody white like me

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.860]
And the ignorant son of a bitch

[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.920]
You get to chug

[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.480]
Ground nose in the rig

[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.440]
Pull how I miss bed in line

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.100]
You're crazy and horses

[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.480]
I'd rather you that than watch floating corpses

[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.040]
I'm a negligent murderer now

[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.060]
And I'll keep going down and keep my nose brown

[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.740]
I'm a negligent murderer now

[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.960]
But I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown

[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.240]
I'll be damned I forgot what I was going to talk to Hank about

[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.840]
Was that?

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.620]
Well you're going to have to both remind me tomorrow

[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.920]
About Chris Shankledide

[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.260]
It was 82 of the voice of the New York Giants

[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.180]
All right, I'll read it though

[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.180]
Long time ABC as sportscaster

[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.040]
He did everything from the Olympics to bowling

[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.840]
Died after a long battle with Emphacima

[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.920]
Chris Shankled

[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.720]
Shankled

[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.040]
He called gymnast Nadia Cummeneets his perfect 10

[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.420]
The 17th and 17th Olympics in Montreal

[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.540]
Was in the booth for the 58 NFL championship

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.860]
Game between the course of the Giants

[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.120]
And he once said on a Giants broadcast

[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.840]
Which I saw with my own four eyes

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.060]
He said he faked him out of his jogs trap

[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.080]
And then there was a long pause

[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.360]
He said he faked him out of his shoes

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.900]
That was live TV

[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.780]
You know, if somehow by doing the second one

[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.120]
You'd forget that he said the first one

[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.920]
But too late

[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.720]
Also done to clen-denon for more of Pirates Slogger Died

[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.300]
He was 70

[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.440]
Some sports deaths

[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.380]
Well, I got to put that in my pile for tomorrow

[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.580]
Because I'm sure that Hank will want to talk about Chris Shankled

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.240]
Or maybe not

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.760]
10-14 already

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.860]
We got the reader coming

[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.100]
I'll give you the advisory on read

[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.800]
Don't let me also forget what it gets to be about 20-11

[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.920]
There'll be a new advisory on read

[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.420]
And I'm not going to put myself in a position

[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.440]
Like back with Katrina

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.380]
Of like soft pebbling this baby

[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.960]
Because Troy Stratford came in and bitched me out

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.920]
After and all I was doing was just passing along the information

[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.400]
That we were getting from the National Hurricane Center

[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.740]
All the other prognosticators

[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.560]
But I'm not going to do

[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.100]
I'll just give you whatever we got

[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.460]
You know

[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.000]
And you do our your own conclusions

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.440]
In other words, if you want to panic, please do

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.440]
As we learned in the last couple of weeks

[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.520]
Better be safe than sorry, right?

[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.640]
All the old clichés

[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.400]
When a doubt trot off the hurricane shutters all of that stuff

[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.580]
10-15 at 5-60 WQM

[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.640]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.740]
That's the new thing

[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.600]
If you never coast your house will simply chose to be okay

[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.140]
I'm dying off again

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.440]
You know it's easier to get some flowers to be paid

[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.820]
Nail it up, nail it up, nail it up

[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.160]
Ha!

[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.440]
Her case

[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.100]
Oh

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.220]
She's the same

[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.460]
That they must be the same hurricane

[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.720]
You wish the trade of the clock was more like those of hurricane

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.580]
Better run, better run, better run

[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.560]
Oh my god

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.500]
The only god of the feeling is a weather

[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.880]
Channels keep hurricane

[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:24.080]
He says people should leave while he's alive on the scene

[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.040]
hurricane

[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.540]
He has not seen, has not seen, has not seen

[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.040]
Hur-

[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:33.760]
Hur-

[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.120]
I'm actually that weather fairy is a hyperventilating right now

[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.940]
What's the thing?

[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.680]
Are you-

[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.040]
Are you-

[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.540]
I-

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.120]
I want to do, I give you the real thing here, nail

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.400]
They have Brian, you fairy

[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.740]
20 after 10 at 5-60 WQM

[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.300]
So before we get into yesterday's uh the weekend's poll result

[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.140]
You realize we had almost 3,000 votes on the poll 28-62?

[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.280]
Well, shocking is what it is

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.420]
Shocking and maybe one of the reasons we're starting to get a lot more votes on the poll

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.540]
is the fact that we put the poll where people can see it

[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.340]
At the top of our website is the poster way down there on the bottom where Eric can't put it all the time

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.080]
Nice going Eric

[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.880]
Go have a few sandwiches, go get a few with those um breakfast burritos Eric they're good for you

[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.460]
Get your blanchard you're up to about 700

[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.800]
So here's the latest on the hurricane situation

[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.660]
Well, it's not hurricane yet, but

[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.280]
Rita strengthens evacuations ordered or planted in South Florida

[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.440]
This is uh from the heralds so consider that

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.460]
Residents were ordered to leave Key West and to Florida Keys this morning

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.520]
It signs that tropical storm Rita could strengthen into a major hurricane

[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.720]
Is it approaches the region?

[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.200]
Oh my god

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.680]
The National Hurricane Center is telling us there is some risk that Rita might reach

[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.520]
Categorize three status as it approaches the key said our reaint owner

[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.280]
Monroe County's emergency management director our policy is to call for a

[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.140]
Generally evacuation areas that might be prone to category three impacts

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.500]
He said the Monroe County sheltered at FIU's main campus along with

[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.980]
South a uh along southwest eighth street and they'd county will open early this afternoon

[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.080]
Officials in date and brown or respected when i was partial evacuations later today

[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.880]
School's are open in both counties but will be closed and browned tomorrow now

[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.900]
That the herald says that in one sentence and then later on it says

[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.320]
Broward schools are expected to close tomorrow. There you go

[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.900]
Yeah, so it all depends on if you'd rather have the pain in the air

[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.660]
Yeah, it's just if you don't like your kids just send to school

[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.100]
Right if you've ragged in them and yeah, just keep them home and then George can sleep in tomorrow

[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.060]
Forecasters emphasized that Rita showed no sight of inflicting the

[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.700]
Tempuk atastory delivered last month by Katrina New Orleans and the uh

[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.660]
Gulf Coast will thank God for that

[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.900]
But but now look at the pattern here first New Orleans and now Key West you see that i wonder if it has a

[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.520]
Yeah, I'm sure that Pat Robertson will find out and it does

[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.720]
Uh forecast you said South Florida's weather will begin to deteriorate this afternoon

[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.820]
We mean grow progressively worse throughout the night into tomorrow as Rita intensifies into her cane and moves closer to the region

[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.980]
Oh my god

[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.680]
I reasoned panic, but i'd be uh prepared this time okay

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.120]
I'm not gonna open leave myself open for a Troy Stratford coming in and open up a big bald headed mouth

[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.540]
And say well you would regard to people this yeah

[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.480]
Go sell something Troy get out of my face you loser

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.640]
residents of Dayton, Howard would advise to be uh being prepared immediately

[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.880]
Immediately for gust that approach hurricane strength of 74 miles an hour

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.780]
For up to five inches of rain and for five foot storm tides as far north as Miami Beach

[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.100]
With up to three feet of storm platform through the rest of coastal date and

[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.600]
Wow

[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.220]
sustained winds could exceed tropical storm strength of 39 miles an hour is uh this

[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.220]
As early as tomorrow morning in metropolitan, Dayton, Howard

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:35.640]
Forkash to set downing trees causing power outages similar to those experience fewer than four weeks ago when Katrina swept through

[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.500]
South Florida

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.840]
When some of us underestimated because the prognosticators blew it big time they were full of crap

[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.320]
The situation will be worse in the keys which will experience the state hurricane force winds in eight foot storm surge

[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.040]
And up to 15 inches of rain 15 inches of rain

[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.840]
residents worded out of the lower keys including key west this morning and a mandatory evacuation of tourists was extended throughout the keys

[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.340]
Schools are closed in the island showed us for residents will open a noon in marathon and alamarada

[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.460]
residents of the keys were urged to install their hurricane shutters now

[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:10.760]
Not later now and secure loose objects experts recommend that residents of Dayton, Howard prepare for similar action

[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.000]
Max may feel that dodging a wolf full of the national hurricane center

[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.840]
Says i'm ready to have mine put up if the track shifts my shutters are already out and sitting by the windows

[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.560]
Well, I sure hope that you get to it right away max other than big gust of wind will come along and blow all of my shutters away

[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.640]
And it could be like flying objects like projectiles, you know what

[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.500]
Maybe kill some people as somebody we know what say
