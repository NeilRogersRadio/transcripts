[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660]
Yep, you give me a lot more money. You know what there's a guy in the piston mom. There's a guy who could be his biggest star outside of Shaquille

[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.760]
Shaque! Because you say whatever your guy says I don't think that guy. That guy. That guy that's not that guy.

[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.140]
That guy.

[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.360]

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.760]

[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.580]
Anyway, Wago's not a nominal.

[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.780]
You got something going on with him too? No, no. I like Kelly. I hope he does well.

[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.520]
Do do do do do.

[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.960]
And those two aren't exactly getting along too well. In fact probably somebody...

[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.660]
No, no, no.

[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.760]
No, no. Too happy they're guilty. This is a super job.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.040]
You know because played by play guys tend to be very jealous of each other,

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.240]
especially if they have like a big pompous ego.

[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.840]
But don't do that.

[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360]
They're like, I was going to say the good ones aren't.

[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.200]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.240]
Yeah?

[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.960]
No, they're not. They don't care. They just go out and do their stuff.

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.540]
They're not jealous of the other guys.

[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.680]
Don't start with this hockey talk.

[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.140]
Uh, great code text.

[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.480]
Oh, we're talking by play guys.

[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.480]
Because you had noticed, uh, great code text writes in the uh,

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.000]
Harold this morning. Oh, let's bring back the rats to hell with the NHL.

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.700]
I mean, this guy has such a moron. He always has been always will be.

[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.220]
He's an idiot.

[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.580]
Absolutely idiot.

[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.900]
They're not going to bring back the rats.

[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.340]
They can't throw crap on the ice.

[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.920]
It was a really stupid ass idea in the first place.

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.020]
Only in Miami would people come up with that.

[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.140]
It's just ain't going to happen.

[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.640]
Well, they did ask for permission.

[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.340]
Yeah.

[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.660]
And they haven't heard back yet.

[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.100]
Yeah, well, they better not get permission.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.280]
It's so stupid to delay.

[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.640]
The whole concept of all the lot of these changes is the speed to game up

[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.240]
as opposed to slowing it down every time they score a gold,

[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.260]
I have to take 500 rats off the ice.

[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.600]
You think they're crazy.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.600]
I looked at the scores today and uh,

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.940]
with a couple of exceptions,

[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.060]
there weren't that many by scoring games.

[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.640]
No, no,

[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.140]
Leafs blew their game in the last couple of minutes and then wound up losing

[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.900]
on the shootout.

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.380]
And over time, I hate that shootout.

[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.240]
But it is, oh, that's not sports.

[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.240]
First stupid now.

[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.040]
I mean, either it's a hockey game or it's a shootout.

[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.340]
You know, make up your mind.

[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.100]
Is, uh, you know, are you playing a hockey rules or is this, uh,

[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.380]
they're just doing it because they're desperate to try to add new viewers

[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.040]
and it's not going to happen in the States.

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.380]
They're not going to get new viewers because they've seen some rules.

[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.620]
They're not going to get new viewers on the outdoor channel.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.440]
Oh, on OLN.

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.380]
I got that here.

[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.520]
You got it on your cable.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.300]
You better get that.

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.780]
I do.

[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.800]
I've been okay.

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.720]
Well, then maybe not.

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.140]
I don't know.

[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.400]
I was watching the Gameway of Style on Sports Channel.

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.720]
In fact, let me see.

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.160]
Where's the, uh, I think it's three four.

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.960]
I don't know where the hell they're finding it.

[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.940]
Ha ha ha.

[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.060]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.260]
There is, oh, here it is.

[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.940]
That's camping out for this week.

[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.620]
I'm Emma Brown.

[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.300]
Thanks for watching.

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.840]
Camping out.

[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.820]
She's camping out, eh?

[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.720]
Well, on the channel.

[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.560]
She's camping out.

[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.620]
Oh, after watch that.

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.900]
She's camping out.

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.740]
Oh, brother.

[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.720]
Ha ha ha.

[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.080]
Yeah.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.660]
Oh, brother.

[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.240]
So we're real excited about guilty.

[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.120]
And Tante is going to win their division this year.

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.980]
They're going to kick some ass to get in the playoffs for the first time in a while.

[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.740]
And there'll be a lot of 40 bad wagon jumpers.

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.600]
I was just pleased to see that who was the one that told me?

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.800]
Maybe it was Greg Cote.

[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.320]
One of the articles that I read was that there were a lot of empty seats

[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.980]
even though they claimed by a thousand there.

[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.080]
empty seats.

[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.420]
Yeah.

[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.800]
Yeah, this is a prize made.

[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.580]
They got a long way to go to get people back.

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.020]
And what's not a sports town anyway?

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.880]
It's a football town.

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.240]
That's it.

[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.780]
That was Dave Hodge calm today.

[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.620]
Oh, that's the one I read.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.820]
Yeah, where he said that the 5,000 empty seats, not for opening nights,

[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.460]
sports town have a point.

[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.500]
When the stand-up champions Tampa Bay Lightning come to Tante Mourn,

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.420]
they better not be no 5,000 empty seats.

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.120]
Or I'm going to like start asking a lot of serious questions.

[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.320]
Oh, more so.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.960]
Mourn said that the only had about a thousand tickets left for tomorrow night.

[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.140]
Yeah.

[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.120]
Randy, Red Deer, Randy Mourn.

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.720]
That guy.

[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.760]
That's silly clown.

[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.620]
The mascot.

[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.840]
He had to replace Stanley C. Panther.

[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.900]
Just be the team mascot.

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.660]
You know, you're very hard.

[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.560]
You don't like Mourn?

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.200]
No, I didn't say, oh, and now you're starting, man.

[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.900]
His wife is probably listening right now.

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.940]
Don't ever, don't ever say something that she can grab on to.

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.920]
She's the most sensitive thing in the world.

[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.760]
All I did was.

[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.300]
I like him.

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.940]
No, I like Randy.

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.560]
He's a good guy.

[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.680]
Yeah.

[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.900]
He goes very far now to be his role in life as to be a silly goose.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.120]
He wants to be a silly person.

[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.580]
And he's going to have a job at it.

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.400]
But nevertheless, but you know me, I don't like anybody.

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.380]
I'm just a hard ass.

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.920]
You know, you're just an old softy.

[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.440]
I'm just, I kind of like balanced.

[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.300]
I'm just old.

[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.940]
You like everybody.

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.240]
You're just real easy guy.

[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.860]
And I'm just a hard ass.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.460]
We're a little as bastard that never lets out on the world.

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.780]
Just, I don't like everybody.

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.380]
Yeah, well, give me a name or somebody that you can't stand.

[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.500]
Well, I'll see that with my own.

[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.880]
Wait a minute.

[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.320]
Somebody outside the building that you can't stand.

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.860]
Oh, that kind of takes away my.

[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.820]
Yeah, well, come on.

[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.360]
Let's hear it.

[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.060]
Besides that wouldn't be any big revelation.

[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.780]
That must be crazy.

[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.500]
I must be nuts.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.660]
Yeah, I don't like him.

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.680]
John Henry.

[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.580]
Oh, I can't stand.

[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.220]
How about Wayne?

[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.760]
You know what?

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.400]
I don't have huge problems with Wayne.

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.880]
Really?

[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.540]

[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.880]
We want to start talking about the food in the press box again.

[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.960]
That wasn't him.

[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.040]
Who was that?

[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.000]
It was a guy who was a president of the stadium.

[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.860]
Oh, I see.

[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.200]
Wayne, do you think Wayne cares what I say about the food in the stadium?

[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.060]
I don't know.

[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.980]
I know he cares about some of the stuff.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.660]
He cares about some of the stuff people say.

[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.340]
Because I remember the time that we had to put Zagaki on air.

[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.920]
That's before I came to the station.

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.280]
And they took you off the air while he was giving you a call.

[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.880]
He was calling you from his plane or something.

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.500]
The story goes.

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.520]
And Zagaki was on air for a few minutes

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.000]
while you were getting instructions for Wayne about some damn thing.

[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.760]
And then he did the same thing with Mad Dog.

[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.280]
Don't you remember on his very first broadcast?

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.200]
His very first game with it often.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.620]
Yeah, Wayne went on the booth.

[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.280]
He came into the booth and you better know what you're talking about.

[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.300]
He was talking about the...

[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.920]
You know, I've never had a problem with the guy.

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.960]
And I haven't always...

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.820]
They'd even about the guy.

[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.520]
And I've been critical about some things he's never said a word.

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.580]
Yes, I can.

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.520]
Yes.

[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.460]
Oh.

[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300]
Yeah, he's our main man.

[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.220]
No, the guy with the thin skin is the Marlins.

[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.220]
Really?

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.480]
Are you going to start with that again?

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.440]
No, he's the one in the world.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.960]
He's serious.

[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.820]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.860]
Yeah, well, good luck.

[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.020]
David Samson.

[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.620]
You don't mean David.

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.500]
You mean Jeffrey Luria.

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.820]
Luria is fine.

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.020]
We did it!

[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.460]
Oh, you mean David Samson is the one that's got the thin skin?

[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.340]
Yes.

[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.100]
Got a fat voice like that.

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.300]
I don't think I can afford to have thin skin.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.840]
Maybe that's why he's got a voice like that because he's got thin skin.

[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.980]
I like Luria.

[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.600]
He's all right.

[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.020]
Really?

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.680]
I want to say I'm learning something already this morning.

[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.100]
I thought you were probably the other way around.

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.260]
No problem.

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.900]
No, I've sat conversation.

[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.220]
So I'm going to look at what David Samson had went on the other station on Joel Feinberg

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.880]
station and said Hank's a whatever he said.

[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.260]
We're doing a ask.

[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.180]
That was not Luria.

[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.080]
I see.

[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.100]
So it was David Samson, but you can't see it.

[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.920]
Hank was to say it was David Samson.

[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.300]
We've been...

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.780]
No, it was.

[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.140]
I don't have a problem, Sam.

[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.040]
I get peeveiled again.

[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.280]
Well, you better not say it.

[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.420]
Oh, that's on my time now.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.860]
That's okay.

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.500]
It's after 10.

[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.660]
I get peeveiled again.

[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.920]
That's as far as I go with it.

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.320]
Yeah.

[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.980]
So the dolphins are going to be three and one after Sunday.

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.840]
They're playing a girls' team and they're everybody in town.

[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.320]
And you don't have to count your chickens.

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.360]
I hate to say this, but as mediocre as the league and I don't care what you say, I mean,

[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.720]
I see a lot more football than you do because I have the luxury of being home with the package

[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.680]
and see all the games.

[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.880]
I see all the games too.

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.800]
How do you do that?

[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.440]
Last Sunday I was at the Fox offices in New York, I watched every game.

[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.960]
Really?

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.580]
Yeah, but that usually doesn't happen.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.340]
Well, on Sundays if the dolphins aren't home or if I'm not covering a game, I'll go.

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.900]
Even last week, two weeks ago when I was at the dolphin game, I watched all the late games afterwards.

[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.340]
But the fact of the matter is the league is so unbelievably weak and watered down.

[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.240]
A lot of bad teams.

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.260]
They just might be okay.

[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.280]
They might be all right.

[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.980]
And of course the paper does not make an excuse, but when you lose both your coordinators

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.500]
and when you lose Teddy Bursky and now Rodney Harrison for the season, they're defenseless.

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.640]
They can't stop anybody.

[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.840]
I mean, those are the two stalwarts on defense.

[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.820]
And they really missed the last race.

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.380]
Those are two hard guys to replace.

[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.540]
Well, this week they go into Atlanta and we'll see what happens there.

[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.880]
Well, if they can't beat Atlanta, then forget about it.

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.320]
But you know something, what do they got to prove?

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.300]
They won three super balls in four years and some of these children are sending me faxes now.

[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.380]
Oh, all the dolphins are two and one and your team is two and two and they really saw it.

[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.580]
Yeah, yeah, right.

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.820]
Tell me about seven or eight weeks what the situation is.

[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.880]
You loseers, you bandwagon.

[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.060]
Seriously, I can't imagine.

[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.940]
I know it's human nature anywhere.

[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.000]
There are a certain number of people that always want to jump on a bandwagon, be part.

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.780]
Because they have no life, you know.

[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.300]
Absolutely correct.

[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.740]
And I was talking about that earlier.

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.240]
Yeah, about guys like these university Miami boosters.

[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.260]
Oh, yeah, eternal soul.

[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.000]
The world.

[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.680]
That's right.

[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.680]
That's what they are.

[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.420]
That's right.

[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.300]
Never could give up to you.

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.580]
I've never seen anything as juvenile as I was saying that's a Georgia yesterday before the show.

[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.980]
The whole of you have had not just the sports programs, but a lot of the people who are involved there within the university.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.480]
The whole thing is just so juvenile.

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.420]
And I know pretty well because I did those a hurricane baseball games for six years.

[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.400]
And man, what a bunch of overgrown children, people in the sandbox never gave it up.

[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.420]
And so much politics that goes on air.

[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:29.940]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.480]
There's more politics that you end in Washington.

[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.500]
It's amazing.

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.520]
I know.

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.260]
And we were going to do the game.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:36.660]
Remember that?

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.980]
And we were on IOD.

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.920]
We were banished.

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.320]
Hank and I were going to do a game.

[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.300]
I got about that.

[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.980]
Sunny was in New York or somewhere.

[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.900]
He was phoned in for Rick Weaver doing a dolphin game.

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.660]
And so the idea was, since I broadcast you and baseball for six years, five on radio, one on TV,

[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.080]
that we were going to do a game together, which would have been a lot of fun.

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.800]
It would have been fine.

[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.020]
And it was vetoed.

[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.860]
It was nixed by the blue nose hurricane administration.

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.180]
They didn't want, I hadn't had nothing to do with you, but it was more than they didn't want an old proverb like that.

[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.800]
Near Rogers on the game.

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.700]
I'd only done them for six years, you understand.

[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.400]
I remember when you did them, you were good.

[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.140]
I would know.

[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.700]
I was not good.

[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.300]
I was great.

[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.140]
Well, I mean, let's call a spade of spade, Mr. I did a damn good job there.

[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.140]
I mean, I was no Mike Rosenthal, but I did the best I could.

[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.200]
You did the games by yourself, too.

[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.140]
No, I did not.

[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.360]
Who did I'm talking about?

[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.920]
I've done many things by myself, but that wasn't one of them.

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.860]
No, I had Bob Berger on it with me.

[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.880]
Oh, yeah, Bob Berger.

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.040]
And then I had Mort.

[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.100]
What was his name?

[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.880]
Mortimer Steward.

[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.180]
Mort, I can't think of his last name.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.220]
Old, old guy.

[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.640]
He was a W's news for about a year.

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.340]
Mort Lubo.

[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.260]
Oh, what a memory.

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:39.800]
You know, it.

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.360]
You remember Mort Lubo?

[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.860]
He used to do Princeton football.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.540]
He was old when he was born.

[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.720]
He was about 600 years old and he did the cover.

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.820]
And in between those two, I had Dave LeMont.

[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.180]
The guy that killed Sonny Hirsch.

[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.140]
No, sir.

[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.960]
I used to like Dave.

[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.520]
He was a good guy.

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.720]
I said he farted constantly during the games and just used to drive me nuts.

[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.920]
See, one thing about doing the Mark Light Stadium in Hurricane baseball.

[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.000]
No, sir.

[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.080]
Remember, we didn't do the games in the broadcast booth on radio.

[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.000]
We did them up on the top of the stairs being able to do it.

[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.980]
When you first started doing those games, you used to do them down below, right?

[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.940]
Back a home plate.

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.460]
No.

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.080]
I saw you doing games.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.480]
Never.

[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.160]
Never?

[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.700]
Dreaming.

[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.480]
You're hallucinating.

[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.780]
No, we had a spot.

[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.120]
You know, we're the, not that the main press box, but there was a press box on the side,

[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.080]
like on the first baseline.

[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.760]
And there was a stairwell.

[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.640]
I think there were, we had a boot set up on top of the stairwell.

[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.380]
It was perfect, right?

[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.440]
Next to the bleachers.

[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.380]
And there was always the aroma of the, one thing about that place, man.

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.360]
They really had good food.

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.960]
I mean, they sold dry and sausage and stuff.

[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.700]
They still do.

[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.800]
And the aroma of that would come wafting up by your sitting there.

[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.520]
And then every now and then, oh, it's these Lamont farted again.

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.720]
But he was, he was okay.

[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.240]
He's a good guy.

[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.220]
And then all of a sudden, when we found out that he, you know, he and Pete Boulder stand sunny in the back and

[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.140]
basically, huh?

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.680]
Sonny got the job back.

[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.320]
Yeah.

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.500]
He put more of the airs on ESPN.

[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.960]
Everybody winds up on ESPN, you know, no thing.

[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.640]
Chris Moran was on ESPN.

[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.800]
Lamont is not on ESPN.

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.720]
He's a sideline reporter for ABC.

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.160]
Who is Lamont?

[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.460]
Oh, do Lamont Cranston?

[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.300]
Yep, he's.

[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.240]
And I said yesterday I had to, this is going to be a long crossover day because I want to talk about Bouldster.

[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:18.680]
And even though his buddies with that idiot Dan LaBaster, the Bouldster made the right choice, I had been arguing with Josh Cordis for a long time about that.

[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:26.720]
I thought that he, you know, if you're a signature voice of a team, a major league, a French or whatever sport it is, that you can really become big, you know.

[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.580]
But, uh, Moran's, especially geographically isolated from the rest of the universe in civilization, I don't think that's the case.

[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.880]
Hey, Bould's doing a playoff.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.920]
Yeah, he already had a thing.

[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.940]
He's getting a tremendous amount of cover done ESPN TV and radio.

[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.340]
And he's great.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.400]
That's his call.

[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.600]
And he's going to do other sports.

[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.120]
Yeah.

[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.280]
Nice going, Bouldster.

[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.200]
And lose the orange hair, by the way.

[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.180]
But, uh, he's going to be very good.

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.980]
So he made the right move.

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.380]
What did we do wrong?

[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.220]
Nothing.

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.040]
On that note, yeah, we're okay.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.640]
We're okay.

[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.580]
For old, for the old daughtering Jews, we're doing a lot of work.

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.500]
We're fine.

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.060]
Did you have Bino on today right after a Mike Verrudino?

[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.480]
Yes.

[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.700]
I thought I heard you say that.

[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.020]
Yep.

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.340]
We might keep it old here.

[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.180]
Let's get Jimmy to Greek back on one more time.

[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.780]
Let's get Jimmy back on there.

[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.280]
Yeah, Jimmy would be involved today.

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.960]
Some racially insensitive comments.

[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.220]
Yeah.

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.500]
It's going to be the next Bill Bennett.

[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.120]
No, nobody could be that.

[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.920]
Oh, brother.

[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:30.440]
It's just amazing to me that no matter what these people do on the far right, it just slides off their ass.

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.900]
It's like a rush with the oxy, you know, and the hearing thing and all that stuff.

[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.360]
It's like it never happened in Bill.

[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.640]
How about you, the chain deal?

[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.120]
How about you, the chain deal?

[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.200]
With a pervert phone calls and the Bill Bennett with his gambling problem.

[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.940]
Oh, I'm not chaining going on Russia show.

[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.260]
Yeah, across the five of the choices.

[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.140]
That's a great point.

[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.000]
We're going to call into Sean Hannity too, because they had to pacify that.

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.480]
It was sure all the right wing rat and Nazis that don't work.

[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.800]
We got control of this bitch here.

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.840]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.380]
Yeah.

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.720]
Now, we'll see.

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.920]
You'll see, uh, you think, uh, Roe v. Wade's got a, uh, a tenement.

[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.320]
He had to do that for a hand to do that call between heart stints.

[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.820]
He'd know between niecedens, whatever.

[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.180]
He's all knees now.

[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.780]
He certainly isn't all heart.

[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.180]
God is punishing him, man, for his evil ways.

[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.340]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.300]
And now that Bush is back in a bottle, I think the Lord's punishing him too,

[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.740]
because the Lord works in mysterious ways.

[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.540]
That's what Franklin Graham said.

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.740]
Did you see that?

[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.360]
You know, Billy Graham's kid.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.660]
Yeah.

[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.440]
Why did they put these people on the air?

[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.720]
What is wrong with these people?

[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.400]
That's exactly why they put them on.

[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.220]
Because they're outrageous.

[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.800]
They're ridiculous.

[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.100]
They say assing on things that gets everybody pissed off.

[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.660]
That's what they put people like Robert sit on and Franklin Graham.

[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.960]
Oh, Paul, well, who the hell cares what those people say?

[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.500]
They pay for it.

[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:38.780]
They're crazy.

[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.000]
They're crazy.

[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.440]
They're gonna bet boy in the bakers.

[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.380]
Jim and Tammy fail.

[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.720]
Well, she does have nice across here.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.260]
Yeah.

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.720]
And don't forget to hand him a plot crotch.

[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.540]
Boy, we're in a wrong businessman.

[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.000]
Tax-free, baby.

[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.900]
Tax-free.

[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.920]
Could you imagine the last ten, fifteen years, if we didn't have to pay any taxes?

[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.380]
We wouldn't be sitting here right now.

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.680]
I know I wouldn't.

[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.200]
No way.

[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.100]
Oh, I would.

[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.120]
Why is that?

[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.060]
I wouldn't.

[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.480]
Yeah, I have to be who I would.

[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.300]
You would be in Vegas right now, whatever you have.

[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.820]
Like a big Hugh Hefner like mentioned in Vegas and just plunging your guts out every day and

[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.860]
looting the life of O'Reilly.

[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.700]
That wouldn't be bad.

[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.520]
But we just have to keep sticking our nose to the grindstone and grinding it away.

[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.620]
Listen, it's that time.

[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.980]
It's time for my first break already.

[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.460]
Glad to help you through the first segment.

[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.200]
In fact, let's go to noon is what I'm saying.

[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.060]
I'm gonna pick off early.

[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.040]
I'm gonna break it up.

[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.000]
I'll see you, man.

[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.880]
All right, you two.

[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.620]
I'll see you.

[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.720]
I'll see you.

[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.420]
I'll see you.

[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.100]
Oh, the crap you could unwrap.

[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.760]
All the slime all the time.

[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.160]
That little number I wrote the plantation tire.

[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.840]
South University Drive plantation.

[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.100]
A Zanzairo repair.

[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.940]
Northeast 12.

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.660]
North Miami.

[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.820]
The baseball season is in full swing and with Cece.

[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.540]
Here you go.

[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.800]
Thank you very much for finding me.

[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.500]
My thousand bucks are so I'm really out of luck.

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.720]
As more than Heidi Flaz was charging me.

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.460]
So you very much the FCC.

[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.460]
For proving that free speech just isn't free.

[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.280]
Absolutely.

[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.540]
Clear channels, a dear channel.

[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.360]
So how it's done must go.

[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.080]
A turni general astronaut doesn't like strong words and so.

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.920]
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rush limo.

[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.940]
So food he wants so very much.

[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.740]
That's a fool.

[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.580]
You very much dear Mr. Bush.

[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.680]
Or your rowy curly sitting on your touch.

[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.560]
Or Halliburton and Ron all the companies who hail.

[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.420]
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.

[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.180]
She's an upper tier rich rich and a lazy isn't male.

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.300]
So you will so very much.

[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.980]
So you think she need to.

[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.920]
Thank you and everything you do.

[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.040]
Your pace maker must be a fake.

[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.500]
You haven't got a mark.

[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.660]
As far as I'm concerned you're just a face you face so far.

[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.740]
And as for condolences she's a intellectual.

[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.660]
So food you also very much.

[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.100]
So you very much the EPA.

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.020]
For giving all the Lasca's oil away.

[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.840]
It really is a bummer when I can't fill my home.

[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.700]
The ozone and the no-go zone now that animals here to say.

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.340]
The nuclear intergame I'm going to take left in LA.

[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.760]
So you also very much.

[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.240]
Sure.

[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.300]
So what the planet fails.

[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.360]
Let's save the great white males.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.920]
You also very much.

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.240]
I'll take you sure they're going to be like their faxing calling in for this new poll today.

[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.920]
Which we've done before but it's so why not.

[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.380]
Well faulty towers.

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.240]
Okay.

[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.720]
That's felt if a WLTY I do believe.

[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.800]
I never watched it.

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.180]
I don't think it's more than like it was.

[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.480]
It's okay.

[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.600]
It was no money pie pie.

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.700]
I've done places on my own.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:49.880]
Yeah.

[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.000]
Once you see money pie time.

[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.140]
Why do I see faulty time.

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.140]
It was just fine.

[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.160]
It was fine.

[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.580]
There was one episode that was very funny because there were a lot of Nazi jokes going on.

[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.280]
Oh, I see.

[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.720]
Well, speaking of Nazi jokes.

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.880]
And conduct their.

[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.440]
Oh, it's non-radical Muslim governments.

[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.820]
It's a 55-bit of the planet channel he wasn't on.

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.160]
He is a Nazi joke.

[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.880]
1015 at 560.

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.240]
Look at that.

[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.000]
1015 already.

[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.240]
It's almost time to go home.

[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:11.440]
I'll be.

[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.360]
I got that on here.

[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:12.860]
The whole near.

[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.180]
George, Dick Cheney told the press he's a little bit ticked off that you didn't visit him in the hospital.

[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:21.980]
Dick Cheney can.

[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.080]
Oh, is there a problem between you two?

[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.880]
I admitted that Dick Cheney can.

[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.240]
And ask.

[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.780]
So how do you really feel?

[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.460]
Best of all.

[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.740]
Dick Cheney's.

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.460]
And a faithful Muslim.

[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:33.860]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.020]
Hey, speaking of the Bushmeister.

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.040]
Aw, wait.

[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.920]
We got that thing back.

[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.700]
Nice going to Eric.

[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.260]
You're seeing it very big all the way down at the bottom of our website.

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.120]
Unfortunately, you'll have to look for it.

[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.080]
Oh, we can move it.

[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.780]
No, I think that's fine.

[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.600]
That little human incentive to go from a top always right.

[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.700]
Yeah, that's fine.

[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.700]
Right above Pentagon's strike.

[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.820]
We'll see how to be looking at that.

[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.440]
Now, is that still working in Pentagon's strike?

[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.260]
Or is that also a click on it?

[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.320]
I don't want to.

[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.720]
I don't have time to click on it.

[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.840]
But we got the thing from the Brit tabloids.

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.420]
They're the daily mirror.

[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.140]
I believe it is.

[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:06.620]
Yes.

[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.460]
And this is bigger.

[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.560]
I think than we had it before.

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.360]
It's just beautiful.

[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.260]
Got a picture of your president on there with his hand raised.

[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.020]
How can 59 million 54,087 people be so dumb is what it asked.

[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.800]
And they happen to be absolutely correct.

[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.300]
And that needs to stay on there in perpetuity.

[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:23.720]
Okay.

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.440]
Just see not only does he needs to be put in a way from the public where we can all be safe.

[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.840]
If you know like in a rubber room somewhere and all the people who voted for him also need to be put in their own rubber rooms.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.640]
We need a lot of rubber rooms.

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.620]
The answer to you.

[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.200]
The answer about that video is here.

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.660]
It works.

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.220]
Good.

[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:39.900]
Excellent.

[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.600]
Pentagon's strike.

[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.480]
You have to take a look at that.

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.940]
It will like you start thinking about.

[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.480]
Hey, yeah.

[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.460]
Is he playing?

[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.440]
Where's he playing?

[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.220]
Go maybe Erre fillet chases in there too.

[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.460]
We just have him up yet.

[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.540]
I don't normally go in for these conspiracy.

[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.120]
Wow.

[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:51.940]
Until I tell you.

[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.160]
It's something you have to take a peek at.

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.980]
No, it's just right.

[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.680]
Where's that plane?

[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.200]
Where's the plane?

[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.500]
Speaking of the insanity of this group of fascist pigs that we have in here now.

[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:05.420]
A suicide car bomb and killed 10 more people and wounded eight others today near the Iraqi oil ministry and bagged.

[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.300]
It's in the bagged ad.

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:06.960]
What are you saying?

[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.180]
The good news coming from around.

[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.700]
There isn't any.

[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.780]
A red key of many of us exploded on the eastern side of the Capitol.

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.220]
A roadside bomb also killed the US soldier on patrol on a highway north western bagged ad.

[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.100]
The number of US troops killed in Iraq continues creeping up every single day.

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.500]
Now it's 1947.

[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.560]
A year that will live in for me but a very ugly number.

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.180]
In terms of dead soldiers died for nothing.

[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.100]
Absolutely nothing in Sindhishian is right.

[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.860]
If one more dies it's a crime.

[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.480]
Every time another one dies it's a crime and is blood on the hands of everybody who supports this crap.

[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.860]
Including the Spongebob Democrats who don't have the balls to stand up and say enough already.

[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.240]
Bring them all home.

[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.540]
Put that bunch of ragheads in charge over there to let them do their own thing.

[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.020]
It's like the Israelis and the Palestinians.

[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.020]
Let them kill each other.

[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.840]
And if the Sunnis and the Shias and the Kurds in the way, who cares?

[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:54.820]
Man.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.020]
They have to put people for the American way in charge over there.

[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.660]
The Kurds.

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.180]
1761 votes on our poll yesterday.

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:07.680]
Most people follow religion because they're pathetic because they don't have a brain to think for themselves.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.060]
Because somebody filled their head with a lot of crap when they were like a little kid.

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.420]
And they never had the...

[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.300]
They never had the temerity that balls the question.

[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.540]
They're like, hey this sounds ridiculous to me.

[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.880]
This all sounds like a bunch of bubble miceies, okay?

[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.680]
That's what the Arabs say, right?

[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.500]
Most people follow religion because of brainwashing, 448 and man, you got your thumb right on it, okay?

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.540]
The thumb right on that first page of Genesis.

[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.680]
In the beginning, God created that...

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.280]
Right, my ass, your mama.

[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.840]
He made the stars also.

[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.280]
You read the first page of Genesis and after that you'd flush that thing down the toilet.

[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.160]
Say, what kind of a moron wrote this crap?

[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.840]
Fear of death, 437.

[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:42.580]
Oh.

[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.620]
Weakness need for a crutch 386, which is right in line there with a fear of death thing.

[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.080]
Over there's got to be a heaven in the hell.

[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.060]
And after we die, we're going to go to the perligates if we're really, really good.

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.060]
And if we don't touch ourselves and we've go up there and we're going to like praise God forever.

[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.820]
Oh God is good, God is going to be doing anything else and there's no hall of hall up there, but nevertheless it'll be great.

[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.460]
Now I understand you can have all the bananas puts you on up there even with hogging does and the Ben and Jerry's and never getting an ounce.

[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.920]
That's right.

[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.140]
That's a good poll.

[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.180]
My idea of heaven is, hey, you're honest like that.

[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.080]
For the weekend, sure.

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.000]
All right, I'm going to work on that for tomorrow.

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:15.920]
My idea.

[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.780]
See, I shouldn't have said that on here because then they'll be calling.

[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.340]
I don't really know what they do.

[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.380]
I don't care.

[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.940]
Most people are sheep on 41.

[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.500]
It was a late addition and it went zooming into the top four nicely.

[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.000]
Most people are sheep.

[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.920]
God forbid you should think for yourself and ask questions.

[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.940]
Would my mother and father really lie to me?

[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.660]
There were some people that told me about Sandy Claus and the tooth fairy.

[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.860]
You used to put a diol under the pillow.

[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.040]
Yeah, it used to be a dime.

[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.440]
He was in today if you put a diol under a kid's pillow.

[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.800]
Let's throw it back at you.

[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.660]
Stupidity 96.

[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.680]
Most people fall originally because they're stupid 96.

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.300]
Like a common sense 68.

[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.540]
Because they want to belong to a club, a social club, 65.

[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.460]
And many of these organizations, that's why the Jews go to show on high holidays.

[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.440]
Not because they're religious.

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.860]
Not because they want to hear all that Hebrew mumbo jumbo from the good book.

[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.300]
But because of the fact it's a social club and they must put it in appearance.

[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.240]
You know, it's the good show.

[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.760]
Oh, it showed up on the show on Russia show on the New York River and we have big deal.

[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.940]
Yield 60.

[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.320]
Jewish Yield, Catholic Yield, all the guilt all the time.

[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.300]
And they really believe in fairy tales 60.

[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.180]
Out of almost 18 years old.

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.380]
It's very, very sad.

[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.480]
You don't need it.

[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.860]
You shouldn't want it.

[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.220]
Oh, but it gives me such tremendous comfort.

[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:20.760]
Yeah.

[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.960]
Week, week sister baby.

[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.560]
Week sister.

[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.680]
There's nothing worse than being a week sister, sledge.

[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.440]
Zellertree that led to the Goulogs.

[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.640]
He is so illiterate that it's a scary, you know what?

[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.840]
It's just for the any time he pronounces a tries to stay a word with more than one syllable.

[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.900]
He says it in such a pathantic way.

[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.960]
Like, hey, look at me.

[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.160]
I'm actually pronouncing a word with more than two letters in it.

[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.460]
Like FU.

[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.940]
Okay, here's today's poll.

[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.780]
The funniest TV show of all time.

[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.460]
I know we did this before a long ago and too bad, okay?

[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.740]
And this isn't one that I went back in the archives for somebody sitting in a bunch of really marginal poll ideas.

[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.980]
Which we always thank everybody for them even if they suck.

[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.640]
And you know, the rest of them were so bad I put this on here.

[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.400]
And it's okay.

[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.460]
What's the funniest TV show of all time?

[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.680]
All in the family 75 is the ready doubt.

[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.740]
Signed failed.

[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.040]
Oh, I forgot about that one.

[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.560]
58.

[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.440]
I'm going to kill myself right now.

[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.040]
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:13.880]
Right.

[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:18.100]
Although we got that assistant suicide thing and the bush sure crowds is, oh, there is something wrong with that.

[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.680]
Choose life.

[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.420]
Choose life.

[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.940]
And don't forget about Terry and her.

[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:21.580]
Shooob.

[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.840]
Signed failed 58.

[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.560]
Money, price, time, flying circus 49.

[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.040]

[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.780]

Brought to you by IBS Home Carros Bound in school, where you can learn

I guess Stanley's brothers, when she was on a show, she kept hearing R.T.sake, eat it,

[00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.950]
Jim managed it for the man.

[00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.970]
Guilty will be in today for the mad dog.

[00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.250]

I don't know.

Oh, don't tell me he's going to start screwing off now.

[00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.070]
We can't afford to be mad dogless.

[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.870]

Oh, we're dogless for two days, that's bad.

[00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.190]

[00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.590]
So you want to think about those two, man?

[00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.430]
We've really got to appreciate Mandage tremendously.

[00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.870]

[00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.730]
like ever have the audacity to try to put mad dog in this place.

[00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.030]

[00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:31.390]
No.

[00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:36.150]
I've had a cute, strange sound on his microphone there, like I found the least spot.

[00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.350]
Maybe Joe Zagaki did that.

[00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.630]

[00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.790]

[00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:58.430]
No, it's too old.

[00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.030]
It's ancient.

[00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.930]
We never be like put a life of Riley on there.

[00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.810]
Or Ozzy in a Harriet, which wasn't funny at all.

[00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.470]
It was like, eh, eh, like that.

[00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.550]
All the rick was on there.

[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.370]

[00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.210]
And George will be on all next weekend if you don't like it too bad.

[00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.390]
That's our new attitude, okay?

[00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.010]

[00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.730]
Go away.

[00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.550]
It's the second turn of that crap.

[00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.190]
Like you're going to be like, yeah, yeah.

[00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.510]
You know, it's free entertainment.

[00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:29.890]
The price is right.

[00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.870]
And in an otherwise terminal boring day when you're sitting waiting back for that damn,

[00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.150]
what's this new one called now, this new storm?

[00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.390]
Oh, I forget.

[00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.490]
I lost track.

[00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:39.510]
Uh, Tammy.

[00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.270]
No, Tammy, where is the way up there?

[00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.210]
I beg your pardon?

[00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.710]
There's another one heading at us that Tammy's telling me.

[00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.950]
Well, they're all over the place, but Tammy's what I'm thinking about.

[00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.350]
And it looks like going to be a lot of rain.

[00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.310]
Starting later on today and through maybe into tomorrow.

[00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.190]
And who knows when more crafts.

[00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.050]
So just sit back and it's free entertainment.

[00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.750]
Crank the way you up real out or right out there in your vehicle.

[00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.050]
Open up the windows, roll them down.

[00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.070]
Have the balls to crank it up real out and say, hey, you see what I'm listening to?

[00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:02.830]
How do you like that?

[00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.550]
And people look at you and they'll go, you're very, very cute.

[00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.430]
How many QA and hello?

[00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:07.650]

[00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:08.190]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.770]
The honeymoon.

[00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.190]
The honeymoon is Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows and Art Turning.

[00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:12.930]
Thank you, sir.

[00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.450]

The honeymoon is.

[00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.370]
Well, yeah, not to be confused with the Jackie Gleason show, which was Jackie Gleason,

[00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.690]
but a separate show, right?

[00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:19.070]
Right.

[00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.850]
I think that's absolutely right.

[00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:21.770]
He's still dead by the way.

[00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:22.910]
Dominic QA and hello.

[00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.170]
Yes, now.

[00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:24.950]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.190]
Get smart.

[00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.130]
Is that a show or a command?

[00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.590]
That's a show, my friend.

[00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.330]
OK, so I don't need to tell you to get smart.

[00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.410]
He just died, man.

[00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.070]
He just died.

[00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:33.590]
What a shame.

[00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.210]
Yep.

[00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.070]
Where did I know?

[00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.990]
Some people don't know Don Adams from Don Nights.

[00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.510]
Another one is Jonathan Wintoshel.

[00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.650]
Jonathan Winters was a panic.

[00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.550]
He was very funny for about 10 minutes.

[00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:45.650]
OK, that's fine.

[00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:46.370]
Put where your head.

[00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.610]
Oh, Jonathan Winters was very funny, especially when I used to have a tape.

[00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:55.790]
Jonathan Winters doing a really dirty old joke about some old farmer.

[00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.450]
And I know it was about some old lady on a farm somewhere.

[00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.830]
And the traveling salesman, I can't do it on the air because you're a sort of a sprick,

[00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.950]
huh?

[00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.250]
But it was Jonathan Winters.

[00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.030]
And of course, that was really funny because it was a very dirty joke, but nevertheless.

[00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.990]
And he was good.

[00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:08.710]
Yes.

[00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.590]
I'll tell you who I did not.

[00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.770]
I liked him for about two minutes and then he became a parody of himself.

[00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.210]
Rich little.

[00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.030]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.090]
I never liked him.

[00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.630]
Never got it.

[00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.190]
I saw him again.

[00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:18.930]
It would be so much.

[00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.410]
You know, because he did the same like six impersonations over and they all sounded like the

[00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:22.970]
same person.

[00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.570]
Yeah, they all sounded like Rich little.

[00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.110]
They all sounded like Rich little doing something like a fusion of Richard and his own

[00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.330]
character.

[00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.130]
I want to hear it's Rich little doing anybody.

[00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.210]
Dominic Q.A.

[00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:32.630]
And hello.

[00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.490]
And you know, what's up?

[00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.950]
How are you?

[00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.550]
How you doing, sir?

[00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.850]
Great.

[00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.190]
Pretty good.

[00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.150]
Neil, hey, I got one for the poll.

[00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.930]
How are you doing?

[00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.430]
It's a new show called Little Britain.

[00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:41.230]
What is it?

[00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.730]
Little pregnant?

[00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.250]
Yeah, Little Britain.

[00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.130]
Hey, and can you shameless your class, Neil?

[00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.550]
Yeah.

[00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.690]
Can you put me that Brad DeBlood of the Monty singing the song for me?

[00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:51.290]
Okay.

[00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.130]
Thank you.

[00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:52.750]
See ya.

[00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.070]
Good bye, fellow bills.

[00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.650]
Oh, the bills are going to really get bombed on Sunday.

[00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.630]
I just thought I'd put it to a massive dolphin victory.

[00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.010]
They were, you know, I'm not like jumping on a bad wagon.

[00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.070]
I still can't stand the organization or the team or anything about them.

[00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.330]
And Gus Ferrar, of course, is a joke.

[00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.710]
But nevertheless, the league is watered down.

[00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.550]
That may be the key.

[00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.230]
Now, the pantheon is on the other hand.

[00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.230]
Not that we want to do a more hockey talk that Hank tried to lead me down that path.

[00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.330]
But I told you, I'm serious.

[00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.830]
They got a nice roster, man.

[00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.970]
They got a good organization.

[00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.610]
Not well.

[00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.970]
They're between Jacques Martin, Jack Martin the Frog and Keenan, if they're upstairs, way

[00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:24.290]
upstairs.

[00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.730]
They're doing a good job.

[00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.110]
They're going to put a nice set of team on A ice and LaWongo is the best in league for

[00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.410]
my money and nice going.

[00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.630]
Too bad a Leafs through that game last night in OT on the shootout, but how's it going?

[00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.750]
They got to the point.

[00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:36.510]
What's the point?

[00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.110]
482 votes on the pool.

[00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.770]
The funniest to TV show of all time.

[00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.350]
And we can put every show on her.

[00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.810]
We can even put shows like Dragnet.

[00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.710]
That was kind of funny.

[00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.030]
Yeah.

[00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.570]
I don't go put it on there, Josh.

[00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.390]
Don't worry.

[00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.930]
You ever did Dragnet?

[00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.410]
Do you, you don't know Jack, Jack Webb from the Wicked Webb?

[00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.550]
No, you're right about that.

[00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:54.570]
Charlie's Webb, I don't know.

[00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.130]
Well, how about the movie Dragnet?

[00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.770]
Even if he was in an episode.

[00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.530]
Was Henry Morgan in that or was he on the show?

[00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:00.430]
First it was Ben.

[00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.970]
Who was that big fat guy Ben that was with Jack Webb on Dragnet?

[00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.550]
I don't know.

[00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.510]
And then there was Henry Morgan.

[00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.390]
Ben Alexander.

[00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.170]
All right.

[00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.210]
And then Henry Morgan, which I couldn't, Henry Morgan was another one.

[00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.650]
He was like a stereotype of himself.

[00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.250]
He always played that same kind of like Sark Cassie.

[00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:15.710]
And it would be just the way he looked.

[00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.590]
But he just always seemed to play Henry Morgan.

[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.150]

[00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:18.870]
You know what I mean?

[00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.850]
There's some people who are always with yesterday's brutality.

[00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.510]
Same thing.

[00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.250]
And I like him.

[00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:28.230]
He always has that same deer in the headlights, dazed, a little bit stupid.

[00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.450]
He's like a stupor.

[00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.970]
They don't come no more stupor than your president.

[00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.230]
He is just pathetic.

[00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.190]
Tragic.

[00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.490]
No wonder the rest of the world despises.

[00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.730]
Yesterday I happened to be around town.

[00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.210]
And I see under a overpass you know kids right graffiti and stuff.

[00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.570]
And there was in big letters F Bush only didn't say if it had the

[00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.510]
word on there.

[00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.070]
Absolutely.

[00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.590]
And I thought to myself.

[00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.030]
Yeah.

[00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.630]
They know the rest of the world is under him.

[00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.570]
Man, how come America is so slow?

[00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.730]
How come half America like that thing says how can 59 million Americans be so dumb?

[00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.330]
The dumb man retarded.

[00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.130]
This is what this is what you call a leader.

[00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:12.070]
This is a man who lies and sacrifices human life and says choose life and is a

[00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.650]
fetus hunger.

[00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.310]
What did I always tell you about those people?

[00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.590]
They're crazy people.

[00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.350]
The fetus they're obsessed with.

[00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.410]
But once you're out of the room, baby, you're on your own.

[00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:20.490]
And if we have a chance,

[00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.170]
we'll sacrifice your life so that we can make some brownie points.

[00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.990]
Oh, you say brownie.

[00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.770]
And this Harry admirers man,

[00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.850]
don't let anybody fool you when the stuff is starting to see out real big time.

[00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.270]
Now it's seeping out.

[00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.870]
And there's nothing worse than seeping brother.

[00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.910]
In fact, people know that seeping is very bad.

[00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.850]
Very uncomfortable.

[00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.610]
And so the next stuff comes out.

[00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.710]
I don't think she's going to confirm.

[00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:39.810]
I think she's going to go here.

[00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.850]
They're going to find out this.

[00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.110]
She's a real real Nazi.

[00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.150]
And even the similar moderate Republicans all for them.

[00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.610]
They're going to say, we don't think so.

[00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.470]
This is not what we hit in mind.

[00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.810]
18 to 11 at 560 WQAM on a great Thursday.

[00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.770]
The Panthers are one and it's well more than you want, huh?

[00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.650]
5,000 MTC stats.

[00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.170]
That is pathetic.

[00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.050]
I understand there was a way for a long time.

[00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.830]
And they've been really, they've given you a lot of crap.

[00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.830]
But Jesus, you think I'd open it?

[00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.710]
It's just the euphoria.

[00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.730]
Air Canada Center last time.

[00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.470]
And they had a tailgate party for a hockey game here.

[00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.450]
The last and for four hours before the game.

[00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:13.610]
How do you like that?

[00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.050]
If there's a butt, I smell it.

[00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.010]
I don't give a crap quick that very much to say.

[00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.630]
If he wasn't the first pincher, I said, what?

[00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:42.850]
I know what I'm talking about.

[00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.590]
I'm reporting at the time though.

[00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.710]
I can't see elevated down.

[00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.270]
And on my way to the car when I pulled my golden bus, I do have a 300-page.

[00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.090]
The boys are back in town.

[00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.710]
The boys are back in town.

[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.270]
The boys are back in town.

[00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.630]
The boys are back in town.

[00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.090]
The boys are back in town.

[00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.690]
The boys are back in town.

[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:14.570]
The boys are back in town.

[00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.210]
The boys are back in town.

[00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.710]
Why you look?

[00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.530]
I'm a God of all you spoiled old books.

[00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.250]
I know everything that's going on in tattoos.

[00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.470]
But I even know all the new Maja rules.

[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:33.850]
I'm hip to the judge.

[00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.970]
Daddy, hold me.

[00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.290]
You guys are going to talk to Daddy.

[00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.150]
You said it's you when I take you place.

[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.450]
I know I ain't no way of playing.

[00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.450]
But when they drop my boys, look yay.

[00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.470]
You little smoothies.

[00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.530]
Look at the game.

[00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.150]
Look at the game.

[00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.470]
Look at the game.

[00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.530]
Look at the game.

[00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.350]
See if anybody shocked at my dog is not under the name of moral.

[00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.550]
Let me just give you the idea.

[00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.430]
You know, playing in bitch all we want about this place.

[00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.310]
But the fact of the matter is there is one good thing that is there's so they're oblivious.

[00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.070]
So we show up whenever we feel like it.

[00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:20.550]
That's pretty much the kind of see Joyce Mott of us to sign those ridiculous contracts that nobody did or would.

[00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.170]
But we have our own deal that we just kind of like made up as we went along.

[00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.610]
I'm the one that was the originator and everybody said that's a good idea.

[00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:27.970]
Just show up when you feel like it.

[00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.410]
You want to take a couple of days off. Go ahead.

[00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.650]
It's like that handgun thing.

[00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.610]
Somebody pisses you off.

[00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.410]
Always cap away, especially in Florida.

[00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:34.490]
I'm going to call in lazy.

[00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:40.190]
Now wait till Josh hears this story and thanks whoever facts that and gave me the heads up on this because I had no idea.

[00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.410]
This is shocking.

[00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.490]
Uh-oh. What it is?

[00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.210]
You know what story this is about network?

[00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.390]
No, I don't.

[00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.410]
Well, you better hang on.

[00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.170]
You better strap yourself into that cheer, Mr. Looking forward to it.

[00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:49.890]
No, you're not.

[00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.150]
CBS and George Clooney are planning a live remake of network.

[00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.590]
I'm as loud as hell.

[00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.390]
I'm as loud as hell.

[00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.330]
I look like a big fish at any moment.

[00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.610]
Oh!

[00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:07.590]
Petting Chasky's critically acclaimed skating satire of the television industry in which a network's news division encourages an anchor and aging anchor to rape madly on the air for the sake of beer ratings.

[00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.770]
Howard Veal.

[00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.830]
I'm as loud as hell as my life's 30 fingers anymore.

[00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.230]
Oh!

[00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.770]
It says I know, but in 1976 this is in the Washington Post.

[00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.410]
In 1976 it was considered shocking and outrageous.

[00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.090]
Executives at CBS were taken by surprise when Clean Ecloney leaked word of the project.

[00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:27.230]
It was a great way to make it happen that the company had been actively developed for the next fall to the A&P while promoting a slick good night and good luck.

[00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.650]
I got to see that.

[00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.270]
It's supposed to be very, very good.

[00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.570]
I want to see it too.

[00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.670]
Ironically, that's what it's like to details.

[00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:42.910]
How in the 50s CBS Newsman Edward Armero defied corporate and advertised a pressured, exposed a scaremong where he had centered Joseph McCarthy and the House of Un-American Activities Committee's Communist Switch on.

[00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.870]
Hey, Joe McCarthy!

[00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:44.790]
You're fairing!

[00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:51.950]
Contacted yesterday, CBS forced until the TV calmed that the network redo was in the worst, but they're sure on details at the Surrey stage.

[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.390]
When he heard that Clean E leak, he said...

[00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.430]
I am as loud as hell as my life's 30 fingers anymore!

[00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:59.930]
It's not the first time Clean E's in a live TV movie for CBS.

[00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:09.990]
Five years ago, he executed Produced and Co-starred in a live remake for CBS for the 64-code War Flick Fale Save, in which the squadron of US bombers has mistakenly sent to Nuke Moscow.

[00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:21.990]
Nearly 16 million viewers watched CBS live, Black and White Productions, in which both the heavyweight cast had included Richard Drifus as Potus, Brian Denny, Sam Elliott, James Cromwell, Harvey Kytel, and Don Chiddle.

[00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.990]
I wonder if he's akin to...

[00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.010]
...Bodil.

[00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.230]
The Fifth Beal.

[00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:26.950]
I think they're close.

[00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:33.190]
Plenty and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves go way back in mid-90s when Clooney was considered something of a show killer.

[00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.630]
People in the TV industry are notoriously superstitioned, and in fact it works on a lot of series that fail.

[00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.470]
He or she can find himself or herself branded a show killer like Paula Marshall.

[00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.330]
Moonves went ahead and cast and repaid lead role in a little series they developed called ER.

[00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:53.370]
These days, whenever anyone writes about Chavsky's flick, which won several Oscars, including Best Screenplay, the word, Prussianth, is always attached.

[00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:54.370]
Prussianth.

[00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.430]
Remember the Prussians they were responsible for WWI?

[00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.970]
Yeah.

[00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.270]
Long time news anchor Howard Beal...

[00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.310]
...Pimus Madness Hell, but I just don't think this anymore.

[00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.890]
...We're being played by Peter Frinches, twirling at the lowest rate of the evening newscast.

[00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:12.190]
He's given two weeks notice and that night on the evening news tells viewers he'll commit suicide on the air on his final broadcast.

[00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:18.130]
He's effectively canned, but the network has persuaded let him apologize on the air next night and go out with dignity.

[00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.930]
Instead, he rants again in the ratings go through the roof.

[00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.670]
He says, bullshit on the air.

[00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:28.470]
The network encouraged by an ambitious young executive, paid down a way, gives him his own nightly segment and builds him as the mad prophet of the airwaves.

[00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.390]
What's wrong with being a mad prophet, ranting about the hypocrisies of our times?

[00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.210]
Angry prophet.

[00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.930]
I beg your pardon?

[00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.410]
Well, would you like to be an angry prophet, ranting about the air?

[00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.090]
What's wrong with it?

[00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.530]
It was probably that.

[00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.150]
Ratings are su...

[00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.330]
...toend us in first, but then they begin the lag.

[00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.110]
The network decides to have members of a terrorist organization assassinated on the air.

[00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.590]
Cloney told the AP that when he screened a film for a group of young people, none of them recognized that it was...

[00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.230]
Oh, here we go.

[00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.230]
This is the best.

[00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.930]
Here we go, boys and girls.

[00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.330]
This is the problem, Josh Cordis.

[00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:02.970]
Cloney told people, the AMP, that when he screened a film for a group of young people, none of them recognized it was a dark set there.

[00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.410]
I couldn't understand it that I realized that everything Chasky wrote about happened.

[00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:13.090]
And so suddenly, the idea that the anchor is more important than the news story, and that you'll be doing sort of reality based shows all happened, Cloney said.

[00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:18.870]
And when you have a great speech, that great speech with Ned Beatty is chairman of a corporation trying to take over the network sitting there going.

[00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.910]
There is no USA, there is no Soviet Union, there is only Xerox and IBM.

[00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.630]
You realize all of those things were true or came true?

[00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.930]
There are no Russians, there are no...

[00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.870]
That was a good story I had to do that day where I had that whole...

[00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.590]
I thought I did a mediocre, fair job of reading that thing.

[00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:33.550]
Not like Ned Beatty.

[00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:39.470]
Early in the film, when Bill was told he's skewed to old, he in news division had Max Schumacher played by William Holden,

[00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:44.050]
get Frank Chud at a bar, and Bill jokes he'll kill himself on the news the next night.

[00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.330]
Schumacher, you get a hell of a rating, I guarantee you a 50-year easy.

[00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:51.790]
We could make a series out of it, suicide of the week, or hell violent ourselves, execution of the week.

[00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.330]
Bill, terrorist of the week.

[00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.630]
Schumacher, I love it.

[00:40:54.950 --> 00:41:01.970]
Suicides, assassinations, mad bombers, mafia hitmen, automobile smash-ups, the death hour, a great Sunday night show for the whole family.

[00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.890]
Well what if it does need right off the air?

[00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.770]
Seriously, anybody who doesn't like that movie has needs to work on their life.

[00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:11.910]
That's all I can tell you, Josh.

[00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.450]
You need to work on your life a little bit.

[00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:14.070]
Thanks.

[00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:19.390]
I'm just telling you right now that's all I mean, you know, we're at any way that's exciting news, that's gonna bring that back.

[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.190]
I'm a mother hell of a 20-year-old city.

[00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.930]
I will say this, it's one of those things they will never duplicate, you know.

[00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.690]
It's like it'll be, and I try to redo the Godfather.

[00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.250]
So did I hear you say that failsafe was broadcast live originally?

[00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.010]
Yes, really?

[00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.090]
That's what it's all there.

[00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.530]
Incredible. I wonder if it's out on DVD.

[00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.050]
Well there's probably one pretty good way to find out.

[00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.550]
Well there's a real quick way to find out and let us go on your Amazon.com right now.

[00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.270]
Right now, and do a little googling it.

[00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.630]
When it now check that out.

[00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.430]
526 votes, it's not even love at a clock yet.

[00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.790]
What's going on here boys and girls?

[00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.190]
This is gonna really frost that Joel Feinberg's asked.

[00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.790]
When he finds out we got more than 10-15 people listening to this highly paid show.

[00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.130]
Too bad Joel, and by the way we would do anything to hurt you.

[00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:06.050]
We would like right over your foot, we'd like stick an old piece of gum onto your armpit.

[00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.830]
That's right, maybe even do that. Shoot you in the leg.

[00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.130]
Anything, because you would do anything to hurt you and your crew.

[00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.310]
It said Joe Rose, we like a lot.

[00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.810]
Anybody else over there would like to know?

[00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.210]
Zach, and Zach Crent.

[00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:16.490]
Oh Zach Crent!

[00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.350]
Oh, that's a door, door, door.

[00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.370]
Oh yeah.

[00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.010]
Now this line nine, if this is the same from yesterday, you know.

[00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.430]
Oh, there they go.

[00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.130]
They just disappeared.

[00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:25.710]
Oh, that's a bad name.

[00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.170]
WQA and hello.

[00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.330]
What are you doing?

[00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.610]
This is champagne, Illinois reporting.

[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:31.290]
Yeah.

[00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.230]
How are you?

[00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:32.990]
Pretty good.

[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:38.230]
I have a poll, not a poll, but the University of Illinois is in champagne.

[00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.730]
Yes sir, home of the University of Illinois.

[00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.890]
Mom, so sorry man, you got zooked.

[00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.950]
Hey, it's cold already bro.

[00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.910]
Is it really?

[00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.310]
Oh god, it's about 35, that's cold already.

[00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.730]
Well better you than me.

[00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.750]
It's sunshine in Toronto, maybe it's like 70 or seven, it's nice.

[00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.070]
May I make a suggestion for the police?

[00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.530]
Please go right in.

[00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.770]
Cpno Sharkey.

[00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.250]
Thanks, I'm nuts.

[00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:02.570]
Okay, what do you say?

[00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.070]
He said thanks, I'm nuts.

[00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:04.930]
No, before that.

[00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:05.550]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.310]
No.

[00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.690]
567, I was saying go, oh, I look at that.

[00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.330]
Look at this QAM, hello.

[00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.910]
Neil.

[00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.790]
Yes sir.

[00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.230]
What for the poll Saturday night live?

[00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.930]
Saturday night live, well how could we do that at last?

[00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.530]
I put it on there.

[00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.050]
I put it on there.

[00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.410]
Especially when Tom Brady hosted it.

[00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.190]
WQAM, hello.

[00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:22.450]
WQAM, hello.

[00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.230]
QAM.

[00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.370]
Got shot all weekend and love that.

[00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:28.670]
WQAM, hello.

[00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:29.950]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:30.530]
Pretty good.

[00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.550]
I got one for the poll.

[00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:32.150]
Okay.

[00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.470]
You're living color.

[00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.510]
Saturday night.

[00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.230]
You're living color, I was on for about five minutes.

[00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.470]
Yes, the way's worth.

[00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.090]
Okay.

[00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:38.890]
All right.

[00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.170]
Jim K.

[00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.150]
I'm a U-Farton.

[00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:41.130]
Jim Kary also.

[00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.770]
Very good stuff.

[00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.290]
Yeah, it was on for about five minutes, it was a funny show.

[00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:45.090]
Yeah, about five minutes.

[00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.070]
That's good, it was too good.

[00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.890]
It seemed like it was a shorter night.

[00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.670]
531 votes, what do we got here now?

[00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.950]
The funniest TV show of all time.

[00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.870]
All in the family, 86.

[00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.470]
Signed, felt 74.

[00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:57.930]
You must be crazy.

[00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.650]
Oh my God, not that there's anything wrong with that.

[00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.530]
Being crazy?

[00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.710]
Yeah, he gives me spiel keys, man.

[00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.970]
I just can't stand him.

Oh, and where the hell did I have that story about him in drugs?

[00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.630]
I think that was in one of the inquiries I've never done in the year.

[00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:28.290]
Huh?

[00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.710]
You mean besides the story that you read previously about it?

[00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.230]
Yeah.

[00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.790]
Wow.

Lucy.

[00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:59.910]
Jonathan Winter Show, SCTV.

[00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.730]
Vinnie Hill Show, which you're sneaking some on that I haven't even mentioned,

[00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.270]
which is good, SCTV was great.

[00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.090]
Especially the very comal thing in bed.

[00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.730]

This is Neil Roger.

[00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.210]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.490]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.230]
This is your playing.

[00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.210]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, any questions.

[00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.870]
Finally, and by the time they lay,

[00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.570]
I will say love will feel this after a while.

[00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:48.570]

the solution to revenge.

[00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:04.990]
He was the leader of the GOP.

[00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:12.550]
Naysyş不知道 how bad his testamentation to the 그녀.

[00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:42.530]
I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy, I'm a little bit shy

[00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.390]
It's 1102 at 560 WQAM.

[00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.870]
500, how many votes in that first hour that is shocking to me, 578.

[00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.270]
578, that's great.

[00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.950]
In the sunshine state, aren't you amazed?

[00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:20.750]
Shot.

[00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.350]
We're making some serious progress here is what we're doing.

[00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.170]
All the time, his patient wanders off, found our later shot and raped it.

[00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.470]
This is one of the sickest stories I've ever read in my life.

[00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:32.430]
See, this is my new thinking, especially with the new Florida Law.

[00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:38.490]
As long as the governor and legislator decided it's okay to go and kill people, people

[00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.090]
like this, if we find the, which we probably will never find this person, but if we ever

[00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:46.970]
did, just, just blow them away and drag their body off and throw an endict somewhere or

[00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:47.790]
in a dumpster.

[00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.290]
Oh, he'll get in the nose here.

[00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.070]
Like, he wants to pound a time in America, you know, those garbage trucks that grind

[00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.010]
all this stuff up, just toss it in there, just grind it up.

[00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.050]
An 85 year old Alzheimer's patient who wanted to wait for her homeless found less than an

[00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.590]
hour later, raped and shot on Hammondville Road in Pompa, the beach.

[00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.790]
Rape and shot.

[00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.750]
I don't know that we've ever seen a worst case, BS.

[00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:11.110]
Oh, spokesman Jim Leadall said, we've had cases of elderly women raped before in cases

[00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.550]
of the murder, but this is about as bad as it gets.

[00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:17.010]
The woman's daughter helped her get dressed about five o'clock Monday morning at the home

[00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.390]
they share.

[00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.470]
The daughter went to another room for a few minutes and when she came back, she found

[00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.170]
that her mother, who suffers from adult dementia, had gone outside.

[00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.210]
When she couldn't find her mother, she called 9.11 about 5.30 in the morning, about 6

[00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.870]
o'clock, a deputy patrolling outside the North Broward Detention Center, found the woman

[00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.850]
lying on the sidewalk on the 3,000 block of Hammondville Road.

[00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:38.570]
She was fully clothed, but at a gunshot wound to her pelvic area in a broken leg, a hospital

[00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.350]
exam found that she'd been sexually assaulted.

[00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:41.850]
Oh, my God.

[00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:43.970]
The woman is recovering in the hospital after surgery.

[00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.410]
Do you want to go home Leadall said she doesn't remember the attack at least to this

[00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.750]
point, so we don't know exactly when it occurred or where.

[00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:57.190]
Anybody with information should call the BS0954-786-4200 or crime stoppers at 9.10.

[00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.030]
5.4-493-TIPS.

[00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.430]
That is just as sick as it gets.

[00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.730]
There's just too much slime walking around in the world.

[00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.850]
I'm starting to agree with these gunnuts.

[00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.630]
I just kill them.

[00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.590]
This is wrong away.

[00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:10.430]
That's all.

[00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:12.010]
There's more of us than there are then.

[00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:12.890]
That's right.

[00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.930]
Let's go and get them.

[00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.750]
I'm not so sure about that part.

[00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.170]
We'll see when the dust settles.

[00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.190]
That's right.

[00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.090]
When the gun's full still is raining, baby.

[00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.130]
You slime balls, you maniacs, you lunatics.

[00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.290]
Of course, we have to make way in those prisons for those hardened drug dealers.

[00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.730]
How's that Anthony kid doing?

[00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.430]
That 23-year-old kid that was the head of the scale.

[00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:32.570]
He had that little pot scale.

[00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.470]
Well, it's the head no more.

[00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.390]
Is he still then?

[00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.230]
But the good thing is that he still get weed in South Florida.

[00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:38.390]
0560.

[00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.030]
He was a drug dealer.

[00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:41.130]
Let's kill all of them.

[00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:41.970]
Let's put him away.

[00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.190]
Let's take up all the jail cells.

[00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.250]
Let's stop the rapists and the murderers and the arse of this.

[00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.650]
Let's put him off their industries and let's put the little ladies in tennis shoes out there

[00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.110]
that had a pinjo in their ass tray.

[00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:52.770]
Yeah.

[00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:53.390]
Yeah.

[00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:57.250]
And the punks, of course, any punk which means in Florida anybody under the age of 90.

[00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.890]
WDQ, I am.

[00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.470]
Hey, how are you doing, Pali?

[00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.470]

[00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:01.750]
How are you doing, Pali?

[00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.090]
Clear my throat for you.

[00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:09.410]
Hey, Neil, what is the importance of getting over a thousand votes on the poll?

[00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:10.490]
Absolutely none.

[00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.430]
I'll make more money that way.

[00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.090]
Yeah, we make a lot more money that way.

[00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:15.230]
Do you believe me?

[00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.350]
No.

[00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.270]
By the way, who do you want to remake a piece of crap like that?

[00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:22.090]
Yeah, right.

[00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:25.970]
And you have one that tells me where you're coming from.

[00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:27.170]
I know not one other thing.

[00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.530]
I don't have time for morons, OK?

[00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:29.430]
You know what?

[00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.470]
Will and Grace, we just had that spot on there.

[00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.530]
Yes, we'll have to put that on because somebody will vote for it.

[00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.350]
Once you're out, we'll not put on that pool.

[00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:40.170]
And that is that 70 show because anybody who would vote for that 70 show obviously is

[00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.530]
not the deserve to be on the face of the planet.

[00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.450]
Is there any argument about the...

[00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:44.870]
No, no, no.

[00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.890]
It has some potential like in the first season.

[00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.750]
Yeah, you know, it used to be OK.

[00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.910]
OK, let's put it on there.

[00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:50.790]
That's 70 show.

[00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.670]
No, go ahead.

[00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:52.470]
No way.

[00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.750]
It's very big since he got married to a demimore now and actually people who...

[00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.990]
And that little bag of the Julio that's on there.

[00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:00.890]
Very, very big.

[00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:01.690]
That's 70 show.

[00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.790]
I got news for a man.

[00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:08.490]
If my life had a consistent watching that show a lot, I would just...

[00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.830]
On a thing, unassisted suicide.

[00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.690]
WNQAM, hello.

[00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.230]
potential like in the first year.

[00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:14.930]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.510]
Hey, Joe, go on a foot of poll.

[00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.210]
OK.

[00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.970]
Soap.

[00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:19.310]
Soap.

[00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:19.710]
That's right.

[00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.950]
OK, thanks.

[00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.610]
Soap.

[00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:22.210]
Remember soap?

[00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:22.850]
Yes, I did.

[00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:24.250]
I prefer body wash myself.

[00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.970]
Is there anybody left who's using soap, by the way?

[00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.970]
That would be sad if there was bigot.

[00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.230]
You know, now you go into your drugstore or supermarket, wherever you buy your toiletries.

[00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.930]
And there's like 85,000 different brands of body wash.

[00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.570]
There's a lot of eaters and there's like all these real macho kind and there's even

[00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.870]
old spice which nobody would have brain would use that.

[00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.830]
But there's a lever and...

[00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:48.710]
You leave it.

[00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.770]
Dile and I know you leave it.

[00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:51.930]
It should have done a long time ago.

[00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:57.310]
And coast and most and post, post these, it's just incredible.

[00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.430]
And you know what I can't find?

[00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:03.130]
My only complaint that I had was, you know, the bottle gets all slippery when you want

[00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.270]
to apply more and everything.

[00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.750]
No, the bottle...

[00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.450]
See, first of all, you don't need to...

[00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.490]
I bought a dispenser and so now it's just...

[00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:11.570]
No.

[00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:12.870]
As much as I want.

[00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.630]
You don't know how to do it, man.

[00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:15.110]
You just...

[00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.190]
Yeah, it's really sad that I have to need to see people how to take a shower.

[00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.590]
I'm not going to get one of those scruffies.

[00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:21.970]
No, why not?

[00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.570]
Scrumgee.

[00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:25.170]
No, you're wasted like 90% of the soap there.

[00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.550]
Listen, I don't care.

[00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:27.590]
Listen to me.

[00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.910]
No.

[00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.730]
You get this scrungie and you put a...

[00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:31.410]
You smear...

[00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.790]
You learn how to take it on there.

[00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:33.630]
And that's it.

[00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.930]
And then you close the thing up again.

[00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:35.890]
You snap the thing close.

[00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.630]
You put it wherever you're...

[00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.930]
I gave it a try.

[00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.390]
And then...

[00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.110]
Well, if you have enough on your scrungie, that takes you your whole body.

[00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:44.450]
Sorry.

[00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:45.390]
Even putting your...

[00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.010]
I'm telling you, that's the way to do it.

[00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.990]
You know, I got a credit log.

[00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:50.050]
You have such a hard ass man.

[00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.350]
It's just man-killed in a new catalog.

[00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:53.030]
Oh, okay.

[00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:54.150]
Like I'm going that way either.

[00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:54.470]
Whatever.

[00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:56.050]
WNQAAM, hello.

[00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:57.490]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:58.110]
Pretty good.

[00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.630]
Hey, Neil, let me ask you a question.

[00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.790]
You think you can dig up the creek there and play the old brain cocks on there?

[00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:03.310]
No.

[00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.810]
WNQAAM, hello.

[00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.350]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:07.010]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:11.450]
Can you play Buffalo Bill with Pristilotion and the basket?

[00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.950]
No.

[00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.410]
WNQAAM, hello.

[00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:14.370]
Hey, Neil.

[00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:15.150]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:16.830]
Hey, Neil, couple for the poll.

[00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.630]
The OIG show on HPEO.

[00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.190]
Yeah.

[00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:22.910]
And Kirby enthusiasm.

[00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.650]
Kirby enthusiasm, is that an order or a show?

[00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:26.290]
I know.

[00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.290]
Thanks for your time.

[00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.750]
Thank you.

[00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.450]
That's it.

[00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.970]
Don't ever give an order like that again.

[00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:31.890]
Whatever you do.

[00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.630]
All right.

[00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.210]
567-0560, pound 560 on the horizon.

[00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.610]
I was supposed to play that Phil Henry thing.

[00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:39.150]
Go on, let me forget.

[00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:39.730]
Don't forget.

[00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.150]
Because the Buffalo Bill suck.

[00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.950]
And Buffalo, why I don't want to go through it again.

[00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:43.450]
What's the point?

[00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.910]
Buffalo is just a horrible, awful place.

[00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.430]
Anybody that would ever take it at Buffalo is a fine city and a great place to live.

[00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.970]
And they're full of it, man.

[00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:52.830]
They're crazy people.

[00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:54.030]
They also need to be locked up.

[00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:58.590]
See all the same people are locked up and the crazy people are walking around loose on the outside.

[00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.270]
WNQAAM, hello.

[00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.690]
Yes, I get a photo.

[00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:03.750]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.690]
The Groucho Martial.

[00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.130]
Groucho Marks, you bet your life, man.

[00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.090]
Right?

[00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.310]
I mean, he was always with me.

[00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.710]
And it wasn't called the Groucho Martial.

[00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:13.790]
It was called you bet your life.

[00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:14.110]
Right.

[00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:14.690]
Okay.

[00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.330]
You bet your life Groucho Marks him for the however you want.

[00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.830]
Actually, it wasn't a comedy show.

[00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:21.690]
It was a quiz show, but it was the idea was there's a funnier show.

[00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.070]
It was a fun groucho to be with your spin.

[00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:27.630]
I forget George Petteman is dead, but I found it was some reason that I hated him like Poisoner.

[00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:28.650]
He's either a right-winger.

[00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:29.390]
I don't know.

[00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.490]
That was before the days we even talked about too many right-wingers.

[00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:36.070]
Maybe he did something with Joe McCarthy or with what's his name?

[00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.310]
Rick Kohn or his brother, Maricone.

[00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:42.090]
Ten minutes after 11 to 560 WQM, 619 votes.

[00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.370]
Now, what's the significance again that thousand mark?

[00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:48.410]
I say we're going to get like 27 conzillion votes on the pool today.

[00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:49.970]
And then they will fear us.

[00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.570]
How do you like that?

[00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:51.830]
Then they will fear you.

[00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.530]
My mind is just cluttered with all these lines.

[00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:56.810]
These famous lines from great movies.

[00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.870]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.390]
Yeah.

[00:54:58.770 --> 00:54:59.050]
Like.

[00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.710]
Get the chop.

[00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.170]
Jack Lemmon, you know something?

[00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:10.550]
Stop thinking about all the great lines and the people who delivered them.

[00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.810]
And I'm not that we would do a poll on that because it's just a little too convoluted.

[00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:14.330]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:14.750]
Right.

[00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:19.510]
Now, Jack Lemmon had that one and then he had the one that you always confused.

[00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:20.850]
Which is what?

[00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:21.910]
Pls stop it!

[00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:22.770]
Or is that one?

[00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:23.030]
Yes.

[00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:23.970]
That was Jack Lemmon.

[00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:30.790]
11 after 11 at 560 WQM, our friends at Dollar Matrius have an absolutely unbelievable offer for you.

[00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:34.610]
Because right now when you call 1-800-Matrius, you can get yourself a free tank of gas.

[00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.630]
Take the full amount of any gas receipt off your next mattress.

[00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.330]
Up to 10% off your purchase, so in other words, if you spend 50 bucks at the pump,

[00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.310]
take 50 bucks off any purchase of $500 or more.

[00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.730]
And you can save more gas by skipping those phony sales this Columbus Day weekend.

[00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.770]
If department stores are under so-called mattress stores, double the price and then take half off,

[00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.550]
which is exactly what they do over here, what kind of a sale is that?

[00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:59.610]
Call 1-800-Matrius and choose the complete line of Celi and Serta and Sivins and King Coral,

[00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.730]
with heavy-paid externs and foster.

[00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.390]
When you call 1-800-Matrius, you still choose the date and time for delivery.

[00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:09.070]
Any two out of Windows 7 days a week from A to A until 10 PM, even on Columbus Day,

[00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.430]
even on Sivins, even on Tisha Bob, even on Sint-Hustura.

[00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:13.230]
How do you like that?

[00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:18.230]
Don't waste time and money driving all around town shopping for a mattress, especially with a price of gas nowadays.

[00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:19.370]
Do this smart thing.

[00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:24.750]
I've been using these people for a very long time and most of the folks at QM are on the Dalai-Makris bandwagon out too and might fully.

[00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:27.970]
So when you should be too, call 1-800-Matrius or log onto their website,

[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.510]
macrius.com and keep in mind that a portion of every purchase goes to Hurricane Katrina Relief,

[00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:40.470]
call Dalai-Makris toll-free 1-800-MATTR-ES, leave off the last ends because it stands for Stupendous Savings.

[00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:47.310]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62-A-M.

[00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:52.670]
Where the bag is, you can't.

[00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:59.430]
The

[00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.430]

[00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:03.350]
Well, Buffalo has a football team, the greatest in the land.

[00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:05.730]
And everybody thinks they're great.

[00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.510]
And they're really hot.

[00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.910]
The Buffalo Bill, so do not put a watch.

[00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.650]
See what I mean.

[00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.970]
So just sing a lot.

[00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:15.370]
When you sing my amy, when you say Buffalo Super Bowl,

[00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:19.670]
and you're deaf, Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Bills,

[00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:24.290]
the greatest team in the history of human race,

[00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:28.650]
and a Buffalo Bills, the greatest team.

[00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:32.030]
St. Slice, Thread and Can't Be Here.

[00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:34.890]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:37.730]
And you're jazzed up that redneck stuff.

[00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.030]
You listen to that banjo.

[00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:41.430]
Holy sweet God, listen to that.

[00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:45.330]
When you say Buffalo Bills, it don't sound so rednecky doing it.

[00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.230]
Everybody sing along now.

[00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:50.390]
Are you Bill Fands? Here we go.

[00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:54.350]
Well, the Buffalo Bills are the best team.

[00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.630]
They have the best record over the last five years.

[00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:59.070]
And they went to the Super Bowl four times,

[00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:01.590]
which is what I can say for this scum-soccon vision,

[00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:02.970]
and they're at the greatest.

[00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.230]
Because I really like their uniforms.

[00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:09.230]
They sure is hell beat the heck out of having a fish on the helmet.

[00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:14.230]
Because they're the Buffalo Bills, the best football team,

[00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.970]
what I ever see in the history of my life.

[00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:22.810]
They are the Buffalo Bills, the Buffalo Bills,

[00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:24.710]
the homogen Kelly, the greatest.

[00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:25.650]
What if I can believe?

[00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.570]
Yeah, everybody, the Buffalo Bills, dead of Buffalo Bills,

[00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:35.250]
and they've been around, longer than the stinking rotten fish.

[00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:40.190]
Well, they're the Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Bills.

[00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.050]
What would you rather have as a pen of Buffalo or a fish?

[00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.370]
Wow, what all happened there?

[00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.850]
I was a little bit. I guess.

[00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.230]
I was kind of a stranger.

[00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:50.670]
Let's play it again, see if it does that again.

[00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.710]
11, 17, and 5, 60, and 2.

[00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:54.170]
I see that 70 show got a vote.

[00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.050]
Let me just say this to you.

[00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:57.010]
Seriously, I say it from the bottom of my part.

[00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.310]
If the funniest TV show of all time is that 70 show,

[00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.970]
I would take my TV set right now, no matter how big or small it is.

[00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.630]
And I would stick it into a dumpster.

[00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.410]
At first, I'd take a ball-peen hammer and I'd smash the picture tube

[00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:10.470]
to make sure that nobody could ever want it again.

[00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.890]
And I'd put into a dumpster and I wouldn't replace it.

[00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:13.210]
Very good.

[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:15.770]
shove it up your rectum and plug it in.

[00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:16.450]
Raptum? Yeah.

[00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:17.710]
That's not a bad idea.

[00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:18.670]
That'd be pretty funny.

[00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.810]
Maybe Ashton Quicker.

[00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.570]
I mean, that's his vote.

[00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:23.570]
You can tell me that that show once upon a time was very, very funny.

[00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.590]
And I'm trying to envision that, even though it makes no point.

[00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.350]
Well, I take your word for it that Howard Stern was funny once upon a time.

[00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.270]
Yeah, he was. And so it was Don Imance.

[00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:31.390]
I take your word for it.

[00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:32.330]
Yeah, I certainly don't.

[00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:33.930]
I'm a person. I heard it.

[00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.530]
Let's get ready to mumble. Come on.

[00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.290]
Let's do it.

[00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.330]
Both the FBI and the CIA are calling it the first case of espionage.

[00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:41.810]
And White House in modern history.

[00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:45.050]
Well, there is more crap going on inside that thing.

[00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:49.810]
Officials tell ABC News. The alleged spy worked undetected at the White House for almost three years.

[00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.890]
Leandro are our, our arrogant CEO, 46.

[00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:55.430]
I wonder if he was named after the arrogant ballroom.

[00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:56.170]
I'm sure he was.

[00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:02.110]
Leandro, arrogant CEO, 46 was US Marine most recently assigned to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney.

[01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:02.630]
Uh-oh.

[01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:07.910]
I don't know if a case where the vetting broke down before I resulted in the spy being in the White House had Richard Clark.

[01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:13.890]
We know Richard Clark was not ABC News consultant, former White House advisor, and honest guy who they are smeared and smeared.

[01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:22.650]
Federal investigators say arrogant CEO and actualized citizens from the Philippines used his top secret clearance to steal classified intelligence documents from White House computers.

[01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:27.030]
In 2000, Ergon CEO worked on the staff of then Vice President Al Gore.

[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.810]
When interviewed by a Philippine television, he remarked how valued Philippine employees were at the White House.

[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.330]
I think what they like most is our integrity and loyalty, Ergon CEO said.

[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:41.750]
Officials say the classified material which he stole from the Vice President's office, that's Dick Cheney by the way, is that Al Gore?

[01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.650]
See, that doesn't say which one.

[01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:44.510]
No, it doesn't.

[01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:53.890]
Well, I guess Al Gore, including damaging dossiers on the president of the Philippines, he then passed those on about position politicians planning a coup in the Philippines in those Filipinos.

[01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.470]
I can't imagine there are any people, any Filipinos left on those islands.

[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:02.170]
You know, if they're all here, or they're blowing up, well, or part of that.

[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:12.910]
Even though it's not for the Russians or some other government, the fact that it occurred at the White House as a matter of great concern said John Martin, not the Harnest driver, but he was the government's leadies espionage prosecutor for 26 years.

[01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:19.150]
Last year after leading the Marines, Ergon CEO was cut by the FBI while he worked for the Bureau at Intelligent Center at Fort Mom with New Jersey.

[01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:26.350]
According to a criminal complaint, Ergon CEO was arrested last month and accused of downloading more than 100 classified documents from FBI computers.

[01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.350]
Oh my God.

[01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.330]
Information was transferred mostly by email.

[01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:35.290]
US Attorney Christopher J. Christie said at the time of his arrest, no relation to Luke Christie or what's your name? Christy Kruger.

[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:42.730]
Since that arrest official say Ergon CEO has started to cooperate, he's admitted to spying while working on the staff of Vice President Dick Caini.

[01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.790]
How do you like that, which inspires me to play?

[01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:45.470]

I like that.

[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:18.790]

[01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.390]
I like that.

[01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.430]

I like that.

[01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:09.870]
I like that.

[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:21.590]

[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:21.590]

[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:21.590]

[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:30.810]
And people say,

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:30.810]

[01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:33.230]
been dating since April and became engaged in June.

[01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:34.030]
Right.

[01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.230]
Tom and Katie are very excited.

[01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.550]
The entire family is very excited.

[01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.210]
Leanne DeVette cruises sportsman told people.

[01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.350]
I wonder what she does for the Scientologists.

[01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:43.990]
It would be homeless first child.

[01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.990]
Cruises to children.

[01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:47.850]
Conor 10 is available 12 from his marriage to Nicole Kibman.

[01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:48.690]
They were adopted.

[01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:49.570]
Am I correct about that?

[01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.250]
Yes, you are.

[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:52.070]
So this will be his first child assuming.

[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.850]
No, that this actually is there is as much

[01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:56.670]
chance that this will be his child is those

[01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.330]
their kids are Michael Jackson children.

[01:03:58.330 --> 01:03:59.830]
They're considering the turkey boys.

[01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:02.830]
You know, the thing was I was talking about on IFC this morning

[01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.350]
with have that round table with these various

[01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:06.230]
things and Charles Nelson Rodley was doing a whole

[01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:07.670]
short sitting in Tom Delvier's lap.

[01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:10.410]
Yes, isn't it ironic that the one of the other people

[01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.190]
on that panel there was Bert Reynolds.

[01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.630]
Oh, you didn't mention that.

[01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.990]
In fact, I think in the movie deliverance when they did

[01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:19.370]
the casting they find they had Ned Beatty be the one up

[01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:22.010]
in the woods who got raped in it because they said

[01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.010]
Bert might enjoy it.

[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.670]
I mean, Bert, are you really are you fooling anybody?

[01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.690]
Bert, you know, is he is there anybody?

[01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:28.670]
Come on, Bert.

[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.990]
Although we did like Bert and Jack's especially Mr.

[01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:32.830]
Freebie used to like it because he used to get freebies

[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:33.370]
there all the time.

[01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.730]
What a that's another piece of fall off from 9 to 11.

[01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:37.590]
Another casualty was Bert and Jack's.

[01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.250]
They had the great peppercorn Charles that you put up

[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.850]
on your costume.

[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.730]
It's like a plot.

[01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:42.530]
Right.

[01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.550]
No further details available to that added that

[01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:47.330]
home is 26 has never felt better.

[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:48.650]
Well, we never felt this.

[01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:49.610]
So how can you tell?

[01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.030]
Crews 43 is now shooting mission impossible three.

[01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.610]
Oh, brother, you lose time.

[01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.750]
It crews the ain't full and nobody.

[01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:58.770]
You go on Murray.

[01:04:59.130 --> 01:04:59.750]
I'm a good friend.

[01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:01.930]
Murray does all those paternity test shows.

[01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:03.850]
Oh, does he really want to see what's in the envelope?

[01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:05.890]
Murray Pupik is still on the air.

[01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.230]
My God.

[01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.830]
Happy 98th birthday, by the way.

[01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:08.470]
More in How is Connie?

[01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:09.890]
She's doing still not pregnant.

[01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:11.830]
668 votes.

[01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.950]
What's the funniest TV show all time all in the family?

[01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:15.410]
101.

[01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:16.810]
Signed failed 95.

[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.770]
I might have to get some of these themes out of crane.

[01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:19.750]
Just just that one.

[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:21.950]
Well, when you know that I got the one that goes.

[01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:23.670]
Da da da da da da da.

[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:25.490]
I got to hear somewhere.

[01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:27.010]
Oh, no.

[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:29.850]
Well, I have to find that disc.

[01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:33.970]
You know, you know the one where the hell you know, you know, in fact, I'm going to look for it now.

[01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.930]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:36.770]
I don't have it.

[01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.110]
I got it.

[01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:40.070]
Well, I'll be there.

[01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:43.770]
Can't find it.

[01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.290]
I'm going to hear it, I got it.

[01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:47.870]
I got it.

[01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:49.010]
All right.

[01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:54.970]
By the way, somebody won the 166,000 dollar jackpot at the $1,000 wheel of fortune.

[01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.290]
Sloss it would buy last night.

[01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:56.830]
Yeah.

[01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.090]
It wasn't me.

[01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:00.030]
Oh, three machines away mine.

[01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.130]
It was a good machine.

[01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:02.450]
Now, what am I looking for?

[01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:03.730]
I'm looking for all more.

[01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:04.710]
All in the family.

[01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.310]
Da da da da da da da da.

[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:10.710]
Well, the reason that this is better than you just playing the regular one is because it's got something in the beginning,

[01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:13.370]
which again, my Alzheimer's for rents me from Rember to what it was.

[01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.990]
Right.

[01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.050]
What a little commentary by people.

[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.470]
Oh, this is a two disc thing.

[01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:20.250]
I better be on the first disc because I do believe that's the one I just stuck in there.

[01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.770]
I stuck it.

[01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.190]
Low and Ranger, howdy duty.

[01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:23.730]
That was a really funny show.

[01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:28.290]
Your hit parade, the Honey Motors, Ernie Kovak show.

[01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.450]
How about the Ernie Kovak show?

[01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:30.170]
Let's put that on it.

[01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.050]
I won't be able to remember it.

[01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.310]
Maybe book a bridle vote for it.

[01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.450]
Just the rule time's sake.

[01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.710]
I cannot believe that I can't find all in the family on here.

[01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:37.790]
Maybe it's not on this thing.

[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.030]
Oh, I'm positive it's on here.

[01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.830]
How about if I just read over there and you want to know why I can't fight it?

[01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.030]
Because it's on the second disc and the very last cut.

[01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.950]
Don't you hate that?

[01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.210]
I do.

[01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:48.230]
No, it's serious.

[01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:52.150]
That's why when you're looking through a stack of crap and you're trying to find something in the very last thing,

[01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:53.910]
it's always a little last place you look.

[01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.930]
There should be like a hundred pieces of paper and you're like

[01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:01.710]
leaping through frantically trying to find something and the very stick and last one there it is.

[01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:04.010]
That's just even the Pope being too happy about that.

[01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:05.530]
You know the Nazi Pope with the BDI?

[01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:06.150]
Yeah.

[01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:06.870]
That one.

[01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.830]
Cardinal Knott's finger.

[01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:11.330]
Yeah, the one I went to Cologne to pick up all those young altru boys for the future.

[01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:12.190]
He is the devil.

[01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.910]
Hello, I'm Carol O'Connor.

[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.570]
To close the album, our own song.

[01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.590]
We dedicated to you then and to you now.

[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.770]
Now we're young fresh.

[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.950]
We listen to me rich ain't.

[01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.130]
Boy, the way Glenn will have played.

[01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.250]
So let me play for you.

[01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:33.430]
I played with you.

[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.710]
We had it made.

[01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.150]
Those were the days.

[01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:39.990]
It didn't go well Christmas.

[01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.270]
Everybody was in play.

[01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.290]
We all know what's now right.

[01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:49.170]
Those were the days.

[01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:51.930]
I did you what you wanted.

[01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:56.670]
Those were girls in red one room.

[01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:01.210]
Mr. We could use the bad light right there for our dad.

[01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.410]
People say the name can't tell.

[01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.490]
If we'd always played the rent,

[01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:11.490]
French Sparrow in a same pretend.

[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:15.610]
I was like a...

[01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.210]
The way the friends lived, me.

[01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:22.330]
I was the badger to win.

[01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:25.070]
I did that my dad did that.

[01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:26.910]
That's what you wanted.

[01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.970]
That's it.

[01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:32.550]
And we sure didn't start to walk on.

[01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:35.810]
Tastes with realy snow, that's all.

[01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:39.590]
I don't know just what went wrong.

[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:42.430]
The world is dead.

[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.310]
The world is dead.

[01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:47.950]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:52.090]
This is 5.62 AF.

[01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:54.910]
Y'all!

[01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:04.610]
When we're back at Rome,

[01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.950]
Maine says she's getting engaged to home.

[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:10.090]
Last of them on.

[01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:15.490]
When my statement says I do just like she and Heidi Klum

[01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:18.510]
It won't last a month.

[01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:24.130]
When Robert Downey Jr. says I'll stop being a boozer at home.

[01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:26.410]
Last of them on.

[01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:31.590]
When Courtney Love is bad and ends up in rehab,

[01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.870]
It won't last a month.

[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.210]
Chippa-larri, Maine's home,

[01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.290]
What's your people?

[01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:39.710]
Yeah.

[01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.630]
The men, men, still that's wrong.

[01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:44.350]
This is so that's wrong.

[01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:46.990]
Contrast me with the favor.

[01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.010]
Face off, wrenches on.

[01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:51.910]
Go.

[01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:56.730]
11.32.28 till noon at 5.60.

[01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:57.870]
That all in the family thing.

[01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:59.130]
I don't think you'll hear that.

[01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:01.230]
Anyplace else in the history of the human race?

[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.450]
Nope.

[01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:02.730]
On the face of the globe.

[01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:05.050]
Ed Naha's got a really good come.

[01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:05.730]
I'm not going to read it.

[01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:06.290]
Bush to America.

[01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:07.710]
I know better too long.

[01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:08.910]
Much too long.

[01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.350]
But I just think you may have to judge it.

[01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.010]
It'll definitely be on the website today tomorrow.

[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.010]
A week from Sookas.

[01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:13.990]
Whenever we get around it,

[01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:15.310]
when we feel like it, how do you like that?

[01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.950]
Now this fact you just sent me this is the epitome.

[01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:21.790]
This is this is the epitome of what's wrong with South Florida.

[01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:23.130]
Even though they're on the West Coast.

[01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:24.330]
Well, where are they?

[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:25.270]
Oh, in Fort Myers.

[01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:26.710]
Like I said, that's South Florida.

[01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:27.670]
South West Florida.

[01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:28.470]
Yeah, it still counts.

[01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:29.810]
That's the old coast.

[01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.390]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:31.790]
I'm not going to John.

[01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:34.530]
I'll just not going to use his last name or the name of his business.

[01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.470]
But never let John need obviously help.

[01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.450]
See, people like you, John, first of all, you're in Fort Myers.

[01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.670]
So we don't care about you.

[01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:42.870]
Yeah, why would we care about anybody in Fort Myers?

[01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:43.750]
You can't get a diary.

[01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:45.390]
You're not going to do anything for us.

[01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:47.790]
You're not going to like give us your oral support and listen

[01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:48.690]
with your sour voice.

[01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:49.790]
Just go away.

[01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:51.050]
It reminds me of the guy that called the other day.

[01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:54.530]
Remember we did the movie a poll last week about what would you?

[01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:55.730]
What do you least enjoy?

[01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:56.870]
And you're talking about on the show.

[01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:57.330]
Right.

[01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:59.370]
Obviously hockey won by a mile in horse racing.

[01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:03.010]
But anyways, to the guy suggests movies, which one of them getting like

[01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.590]
four or five votes, but movies.

[01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:05.210]
Yeah.

[01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:06.530]
Do you know?

[01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:07.690]
No, there's like movies.

[01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:11.090]
I mean, no, obviously never heard of movies like Josh has got no tastes.

[01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.170]
It's like not like music.

[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.270]
Who doesn't like that?

[01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.010]
Like he's food.

[01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.570]
Yeah.

[01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:17.090]
I don't care about food.

[01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:20.470]
Like you can't end a food channel saying all quit talking about food so much.

[01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:21.350]
God.

[01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.950]
Oh, and speaking of the food channel, I wonder what the guy I'm right now.

[01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:25.150]
Cook with me.

[01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:26.710]
And a little bit of water.

[01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.450]
Are going to meet the butter.

[01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.590]
A shovel in your meatballs.

[01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.970]
Hello, butter.

[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:32.850]
Exactly.

[01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.990]
It helps me talk to it.

[01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:40.690]
A little bit of rosemary and our.

[01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.970]
Paul and Nick.

[01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.450]
Oh, she's chopping up rosemary and she's throwing her ass in there.

[01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:49.410]
Anyway, John says consider adding the polls to your polls the following.

[01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:50.530]
None of the above.

[01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.510]
I don't give a shmit about this pool.

[01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:54.290]
And then he says, hey, sometimes it happens.

[01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:55.030]
You might be surprised.

[01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.130]
There was every election had a nothing above line.

[01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:02.650]
Why would we put none of the above on a pool about how many shows?

[01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.970]
Do you see what I'm saying?

[01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:05.330]
Yeah, because he's a cellar post.

[01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:06.850]
That's why I fasted it almost threw it away.

[01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:09.310]
But I thought John, we get a lot like that.

[01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:11.550]
Man, you are in a perfect spot for it, Myers.

[01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:14.650]
I hope you and the beesleaves and for Myers and April's have a wonderful life together.

[01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:16.150]
It's a match made in purgatory.

[01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:17.530]
Perfect spot for you.

[01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:21.810]
Now this story, they should go to show you if there's anybody who thinks I'm exaggerating.

[01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.770]
When we keep losing more and more of our rights.

[01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:26.870]
You see, once you start losing the first ones, it doesn't stop there.

[01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:28.150]
Right, double the effect.

[01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.410]
It's a fast-dominal effect in New Orleans.

[01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:32.190]
Okay, it just doesn't stop.

[01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:36.330]
And the public just hits back very just like that pool in the estate, just like sheep.

[01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:38.750]
And well, what can we do on a ring in our hands?

[01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.150]
Or most of them don't even give a crap.

[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:43.330]
If you watch in that 70s show or everybody loves Raymond.

[01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.510]
Seriously, I just know words to describe how bad this stuff is.

[01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:52.430]
But anyway, Oregon woman kicked off flight in Reno over an offensive shirt.

[01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:58.530]
A Portland woman's flight home was stocked short in Reno all because the message on the t-shirt she was wearing.

[01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.350]
Lori Heasley, I wonder if she's came to the beesleaves.

[01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.310]
I'll sure hope not for her say she's got enough problems.

[01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:08.730]
Lori Heasley claims it's a freedom of speech privilege, but airline officials say the message brings safety concerns.

[01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.870]
And you know what we care about in America, don't you?

[01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.110]
Safety safety safety safety.

[01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:14.150]
I pay.

[01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:16.690]
Heasley says there are bigger problems in the country.

[01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:18.490]
I can't believe people can be so petty.

[01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:21.810]
Tom Heasley boarded her flight Tuesday morning in LA.

[01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.990]
Heated for Portland, Oregon with a stopover in Reno.

[01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:29.470]
But when Southwest Airlines employees answered the cover of her shirt, her stopover became a stopoff her flight.

[01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:32.270]
I was told basically that I had to cover my shirt.

[01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:35.230]
I was told if I cover the shirt, I can basically stay on the plane.

[01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:40.430]
So she covered the shirt, but during a nap while passengers were boarding in Reno, the cover came off.

[01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.290]
And Southwest employees insisted change the shirt or change flights.

[01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:49.070]
I didn't feel that I should have to change my shirt because we live in the United States and in Sweden with speech.

[01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:52.570]
It was based on the movie The Fokkers and I didn't think it should have offended anyone.

[01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:53.210]
But it did.

[01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:54.970]
There were a whole bunch of people out there.

[01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:59.250]
I'd say about 30% of the American public who lived just to be offended.

[01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:00.450]
They're just waiting to be offended.

[01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.770]
Looking around for stuff.

[01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:06.650]
The shirt had pictures of members of the Bush administration and a phrase based on the movie Meet The Fokkers.

[01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:11.650]
But with one crucial vowel change, oh, that couldn't have been the, oh, I love that.

[01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:12.770]
I wish I had one of those shirts.

[01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:15.970]
Meet the Fokkers with the, let's see where you can order it.

[01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:20.790]
It was enough to cause complaints from other passengers and it's a problem the airline has had to deal with before.

[01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:23.830]
That harb in Southwest Airlines said we do get it occasionally.

[01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.650]
What someone is wearing, what someone is reading.

[01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.670]
Oh, oh, listen to this.

[01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:33.530]
I never fly to airline because I don't like taking 16 different flights to get from like Miami to Orlando.

[01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:36.990]
But I guarantee I would never subsidize them with a dime.

[01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:41.750]
This attitude is so obnoxious when what someone is wearing, what someone is reading,

[01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.970]
and what someone might be saying and very much a judgment call.

[01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:47.310]
But one other customer has become concerned.

[01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:51.510]
We do have to become involved and see what we can do to make everyone as comfortable as we can.

[01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:55.970]
What people might be saying or reading or wearing or thinking.

[01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:59.550]
How about if you're on a plane with a Hussage Shaco like the great Ahmed Khan?

[01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.190]
Yeah, or a turban?

[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.610]
Well, and while Southwest may have kept a peace on its afternoon,

[01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.910]
hop to Portland, a woman not afraid to use her freedom of speech will not be using her freedom of choice.

[01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:11.590]
I most likely will not be flying Southwest Airlines again after this.

[01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:16.050]
She said Southwest Airlines told he's least you can take a different flight home if she changed her shirt.

[01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:19.510]
She refused it after the rented car and drive home from Reno to Poland.

[01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.770]
You go, honey, you go.

[01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.790]
Good.

[01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.850]
Golly Miss Maude.

[01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.690]
That's pathetic.

[01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:28.990]
I just got your read net and I still I can't believe it.

[01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.510]
Well, remember they hate it for a freedom.

[01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:35.810]

[01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:38.450]
And pictures of Bush and the Nazi regime.

[01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:42.310]
At least they didn't have like a swastik on it that we know of and probably should have had that on the back.

[01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:44.710]
Jesus, Kate Christ man.

[01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:49.690]
So like I'm trying to tell you nothing any of you care obviously because you know you're oblivious Newton John.

[01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:52.910]
What we care about is going to that thousand votes by two.

[01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:58.190]
That's that's all we care about getting paid and getting to a thousand votes and making sure the audio vault keeps percolating away.

[01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:59.590]
Give them spots on right.

[01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:01.470]
Right so far that we don't have any.

[01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:06.750]

national car right on the right.

[01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:25.670]
I actually knew that I just didn't chime in with it.

[01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:26.310]
I see.

[01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:29.110]
And what do you mean you didn't chime in with you said you couldn't remember it.

[01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.810]
Well I actually remembered later but no later.

[01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:36.250]
Well when you're sitting on the throne that's not the time and yes remember Joanne

[01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:36.610]
Worley.

[01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:38.290]
Joanne Worley from life in.

[01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.570]
Yeah.

[01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.610]
She used to be on a lot of a game show.

[01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:41.130]
Very annoying.

[01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:45.550]
See the only problem we can do a poll on your favorite I think maybe long long long time

[01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:48.550]
real about eighty years ago we did a poll on your favorite game show panellist.

[01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:50.190]
Oh panellist.

[01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:50.710]
Yeah.

[01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:52.490]
Not your favorite game show we've done that.

[01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:58.550]
But that would require real ancient parts like me and Bokobryne and Hank and yeah.

[01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:03.630]
Because there are games shows anymore really other than prices right there unless you watch the game show

[01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:06.790]
channel and you Adam your Adam and you don't watch the game here.

[01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.830]
I watch reruns of match game.

[01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.310]
Oh match game is great.

[01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:11.690]
I try not to miss it right.

[01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:17.010]
In fact you can see as it evolved you can see Richard Dawson's ego becoming out of control.

[01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.910]
Yes.

[01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:21.970]
And if anybody chose him the winner at the end of the show that's a fan here.

[01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:27.950]
If anybody chose somebody other than Richard you can see the exasperated disappointed wounded puppy

[01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:28.910]
look on Richard's face.

[01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.630]
Oh no.

[01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:31.350]
It didn't prick me well I don't understand.

[01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:35.010]
And by the way have another beer Richard okay have another pop.

[01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:40.490]
Okay somebody says the funniest TV show of all time and you must be gesting entering at

[01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:43.450]
16th season America's funny is to home videos.

[01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:44.230]
Fat.

[01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:48.410]
But put that on there immediately okay now that's not the one with Bob Fag a saga is it?

[01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:49.430]
I don't know there's so many.

[01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.830]
Might be.

[01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.110]

[01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:55.150]
And then I'm not going to read this stuff about mode just a bunch of gratuitous stuff here ripping my good buddy mode.

[01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.810]
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

[01:20:56.030 --> 01:21:00.690]
But it does say did you hear Geldie on a video play by play no actually I didn't even think to come in here and

[01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:01.350]
pop it up.

[01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:05.110]
He sounded good very good as a matter of fact almost to be the stand as market.

[01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:08.410]
I thought he was going to be good down and I said that continuously constantly.

[01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:09.450]
Yes.

[01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:10.870]
Yes you did.

[01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:18.470]
Yes I have all along because I knew he was going to do an excellent job and certainly a huge improvement over both Chris Moron and that old funny

[01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.810]
dirty.

[01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:19.830]
Jugs McDonald.

[01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:23.690]
Hey Jugs you know he may be a decent guy or whatever I don't know.

[01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:31.850]
But you were in fact we got the NHL channel here in the show all these old games we got a whole bunch of channels that show hockey games because these people are

[01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:40.730]
sick with it and even even old islander games when they show on there with Jugs McDonald and other games I watch he he was the same you know Jugs you

[01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.870]
know you're legend in your own mind funny dirty.

[01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:48.390]
But nevertheless Geldie is going to be a superstar I think he and the booster are going to be the sound for the sports stars of the future.

[01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:49.090]
What do you say Josh?

[01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:50.470]
Yes that's about right.

[01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.750]
It sounds very enthusiastic about that.

[01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.630]
Well I'd have to hear Geldie.

[01:21:55.110 --> 01:22:00.590]
Oh man now can we have any spy reports of this one because I'm not taking any calls probably I'm busy rambling on.

[01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:07.690]
Why I like rambling on Greg and Sebring says I'm a 52 year fanatic of Malcolm in the middle so we get America's funny stone videos and Malcolm in the middle

[01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:11.670]
he says I knew a lot of kids when growing up had parents just like Hal and Lois I see.

[01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:15.370]
I wonder if anybody had kids had parents like Archie and even.

[01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:20.350]
But let's see here it is it says I want to add one of the poll from Eric in Jupiter but we're getting polls.

[01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:26.590]
Facts is from all over the place man from Jupiter Uranus the daily show with John Stewart how can we've left that off.

[01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:29.450]
We got the Chappelle show on Eric and we talked about it earlier.

[01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:30.730]
Well how can we left it off.

[01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.110]
It's on the center.

[01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:38.450]
It's going to go zooming towards the top and might even pass that jackass Jerry Seinfeld that's who who's in first place that would once

[01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:40.070]
16 and all in the family one away.

[01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:45.250]
I think we're getting freaked on that I'm not buying that I know it was huge and very popular in the audio.

[01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:52.870]
But I don't care I mean the idea that could be all in the family that must be a mash see that already got a vote it's moving up fast it got one.

[01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.530]
It's zoom it up there man.

[01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:03.070]
Oh wait a year this this is a heartwarming story of course we're pretty pissed off it didn't happen to us not the hurricane part but.

[01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:08.570]
Jack will ensure man hadn't had much luck since Hurricane Katrina center fleeing from her in the world in zone.

[01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:13.190]
But that changed on Tuesday when the money came flooding in instead of the water.

[01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:21.290]
The 57 year old return librarian won 1.6 million dollars playing the slot machine and evangelized down in opalusus Louisiana.

[01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:25.230]
How do you like that Josh 1.6 million playing the old slots.

[01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:32.070]
I'll be playing sometime yeah you'll be get around to it eventually will be an opalusus before midnight when asked how she'd spend the money.

[01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:36.350]
Sherman reply first of all I like to find somewhere to live because my house was destroyed by Katrina.

[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:44.070]
Sherman have been staying under sisters three bedroom home in opalusus with about 26 other people since Katrina flooded 80% of New Orleans and left their homeless with.

[01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:52.150]

[01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:58.230]

[01:23:58.670 --> 01:24:03.390]

[01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:04.050]

[01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:14.230]
17 quarters $4.25 later she was a millionaire.

[01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:21.870]
When you first see it happen you just go dunce said Sherman still appearing somewhere days by her good fortune.

[01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:29.110]
You just don't realize what what oh no you just don't realize what done happened until the first next to you hits you and says what you done it.

[01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:41.730]

[01:24:55.270 --> 01:25:01.210]
Well we got to see that happen is of course if we ever get real slots in South Florida which we're still waiting on pins and needles for that.

[01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:08.670]
Understand the people at the top of the parking they own two of the galaxy casinos that went the caboone that went for sure.

[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:22.330]
Yeah so they got some serious some issues over there so they're putting their lives back together again but I still say look at all the money that's being lost every single day in Florida for education and all the jobs that people could be working right now because of the fact that the

[01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:49.150]
abortion issue and the moral issues to get these Bible something possible every time and every

[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:55.170]

it doesn't explain everything but it explains a lot George Bush our president is sending the bottle

[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:48.990]
again the drinking rumors have been making the rounds for months and even before that people

[01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:54.510]
speculated that Bush's accidents choking on a pretzel dropping his dog crashing his bicycle

[01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:59.770]
of more alcohol related for someone who makes such a point of flooding his physical prowess his

[01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:04.970]
habitual clumsiness is somewhat suspicious after all Bushy his wife's Laura's pet name for him

[01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:09.910]
just as it's his pet name for her which is a bit creepy first game prominence as a high kicking

back flippin siss boom bar male cheerleader at Yale of course we're all familiar with Bush's

[01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:19.270]
epic battle with the bottle he boozes his way through college he's persistently liquid up through

[01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:23.690]
his 20s failing to show up for National Guard duty but never missing boozed ranch weekend barbecues

[01:43:23.690 --> 01:43:29.690]
with his Texas buddies in his 30s but dirty man he's so continuously sliced that he screws up

[01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:34.750]
every sure thing business venture is that he sets up for him at 40 so the story goes his wife

[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:44.190]
chasing former cheerleader renounces booze forever in a medium shot we see Bushy mournfully pouring

[01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:48.430]
out the last of a fifth of bourbon onto the patio pavement while Laura witnesses the act with a

[01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:53.050]
whitefully look of affection relief and secret triumph Bush's renunciation of booze is being

[01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:57.530]
such mythic status that many people republican true believers conveniently overlooked the fact that

[01:43:57.530 --> 01:44:02.010]
his renunciation of adult beverages was hardly a redemptive turn of fortune all that happened was

[01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:06.610]
that Bushy of notchis drunk became Bushy of notchis tea toler proclaiming that his life was now

[01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:11.710]
in the hands of Jesus Christ not Jim beam but the recent revelations about Bush logging down southern

[01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:17.150]
comfort as a raccoes down the tubes as a raccoes down the tubes and whirlens goes down the drain

[01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:21.790]
calls into question whether he actually gave up booze and gave his life to Jesus in the first place

[01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:26.450]
huh that Bush continued to hit the sauce after taking the pledge explains a good deal of his

[01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:31.790]
weird behavior one minute scared schmitless the next after a sequence swig of early times and

[01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:37.190]

phony bluster telling his speckless femur chief ground you're doing a heck of a job other creepy

[01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:01.650]
of the movie so in other words you're trying what you're trying to tell me is that there are a whole

[01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:06.290]
bunch of really funny shows on here like wk rp was a very funny no i did not think it was a

[01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:10.310]
funny show at all okay in fact the the guy would have mustache what was his name that was the

[01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:17.750]
uh dj dr johnny fever yeah uh uh tessman Howard has been didn't uh it didn't amuse me that's all i

[01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:21.270]
just didn't find it even the least bit amuse all right especially i didn't end up in this

[01:48:21.650 --> 01:48:26.090]
it just i'm just i'm into cornball sitcoms they just don't do it for me you didn't like

[01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:28.630]
something i think you're uh family time

[01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:35.830]
oh that was not all the shows of that john reman just any of them all right just check it

[01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:39.970]
Bonnie uh what that was in Bonnie Franklin what was that show one day at a time no one day at one

[01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:44.490]
day at a time uh they're just like any of these shows like that and then that's not of this era

[01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:49.230]
that's a lot longer than this and they they don't show sucked one day the time did uh

[01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:53.010]
did suck although by the point that never wore a bra well isn't now there's a reason to watch

[01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:57.790]
how about happy days now that's not bad uh brutal show that was one of the most popular shows

[01:48:57.790 --> 01:49:03.290]
in the history mr well so if you're questioning my look if anybody tells me i don't have a sense of

[01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:06.470]
humor they obviously never listened to this show and they don't work for Greg Reed okay there's

[01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:12.510]
two appoints for me right there all right let's check it i don't watch the daily show i

[01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:17.430]
i grant you very funny i've seen clips and they were very very funny and i like john stewart a lot

[01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:21.950]
i just don't watch it that's all it's not part of my life i had to warm up to it but but

[01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:25.730]
i wouldn't have any difference if i thought it was the greatest things since sliced bread i'm

[01:49:25.730 --> 01:49:29.670]
not interested in watching those kind of shows it's just when you reach a certain point in your

[01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:36.130]
life you don't have time for certain um whatever comedy exactly and there could be a reason

[01:49:36.130 --> 01:49:39.610]
dodo dodo dodo that's it i've lost a little bit of my sense of humor over the last four years

[01:49:39.610 --> 01:49:43.910]
dodo dodo dodo dodo again you would know anything about that right being humorless

[01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:50.710]
eight hundred and seventy two votes we got a battle going on sign felled one thirty six now

[01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:55.630]
so you tell me that sign fell was funny it had it had been funny some of the political hysterical

[01:49:55.630 --> 01:50:01.570]
not because he was that wasn't the point of the show some of the shows were hysterical

[01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:06.210]
laugh I'm going to go ahead and look forward right now on my just crawl right on the floor for a

[01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:11.570]
half an hour the uh the master basinshow was hysterical now what what were you gonna say uh uh

[01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:16.470]
yeah the master basinshow right when they went to that station the one where they were right to

[01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:21.270]
well naturally that would be uh right up your alley you know the whole thing sexual I made it

[01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:26.790]
a good show no it was funny was dr. Ruth the contest dr. Ruth is she still and she probably had a show

[01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:31.430]
yeah that wasn't funny there's not funny about her she's funny about her all right

[01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:37.390]
the thought about her talking about sex is uh I don't get the music is a panic yeah well there you

[01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:42.350]
go one of my what I tell you she's last found her to me then Jerry Seinfeld sure look at without a word

[01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:46.630]
or where the process for repeating them already there is David Paul certainly you're acting

[01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:51.530]
in the directories acting because like Brownie was acting contracts and the better job um and then

[01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:55.570]
they were in the project starting to do that and maybe they should have done sooner Paul's

[01:50:55.570 --> 01:51:01.090]
and reinterrated his commitment to get the 60,000 hurricane victims still in shelters in some other

[01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:04.770]
kind of housing by the middle of this month right but just make sure they don't come back because

[01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:08.870]
obviously uh we don't want too many dark photos the trailers look like very nicely appointed

[01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:12.950]
do they really but they were disappointed them they were just short to a point and probably the

[01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:18.110]
same guy that the pointed uh brownie brown is director FEMA the fact that there was so little

[01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:22.930]
outrage about this kind of stuff and all these totally uh it goes along with that whole concept

[01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:28.890]
of mediocreism or I like that word crony isn't a mediocreism let's patent it yeah let's not find

[01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:32.490]
the best of it the best and the brightest because they would make bush look even worth any already

[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:37.350]
does anybody brighter than a dim bulb let's think of a dim what about kuhu isn't it what about the

[01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:42.350]
clockwork orange what about it that was funny wasn't the tv show no it was kind of funny it was

[01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:47.590]
funny in a very sick way he talks like that move on time tonight at eight a single mother struggling with

[01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:53.230]
inner demons face-to-face with a suspecting killer on the run i thought to myself this is not good

[01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:59.610]
so i think i'll offer it oh thank god television is doing so much to elevate the brains of the

[01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:03.750]

guaranteed was it part of the aluminum or whatever

[01:53:29.130 --> 01:53:32.750]
if it worked for the fact the media of course very willingly and enthusiastically

[01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:36.830]
conspired to make him look like some kind of irresponsible a gone nuts or a jack-in

[01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:40.930]
well they're not off the go so our Dutch friend out there says and

[01:53:40.930 --> 01:53:44.410]
avoid talking about a hard ass well that's those Dutch men they are really who are they

[01:53:44.410 --> 01:53:47.150]
if he if he go to Amsterdam and we're just avoid the Dutch

[01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:52.010]
i know i'm serious how to help you do that you go there to mingle with the tourist and

[01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:55.670]
wonderful people from all over the world okay the Dutch are just why

[01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:59.930]
right are tough at least the birds are got an excuse i feel sorry for the

[01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:02.150]
birds they just brought up in that concentrated

[01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:05.830]
mentality with that whole royalty thing it's like a new

[01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:09.690]
surround their neck they can't help it but the Dutch have no excuse

[01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:15.030]
maybe it's a bad cuisine anyway he says yesterday i listened for five

[01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:17.650]
minutes to get these first pants or commentary first off not a

[01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:20.810]
commentary it's called play by play it's like listening to a high school kid

[01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:24.130]
doing a high school game why is it that so many people get jobs on that stage with no

[01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:28.530]
experience it's not who you know but who you up there he says watch your language okay

[01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:31.970]
that's the problem with this country if you know someone you get a job somewhere ask

[01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:36.630]
Mikey Brown he says there's that old Brownie Brown it's talk some get some quality people

[01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:43.990]
there's not options anymore do we says come to it do we was do decimal system so that's

[01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:47.850]
what he says not be nice if we got some calls on that but of course it's narrow casking again

[01:54:47.850 --> 01:54:50.750]
i don't want to talk about the panthers of the hockey game although obviously they're

[01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:55.010]
going to be very good this year and a nice start but it wouldn't be nice to hear a little

[01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:59.130]

[01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:47.170]

all we could put it on there but i know it is now like it like it was really ever on

[01:56:55.990 --> 01:57:00.610]
their to deal with all the story of that so no it was like all the other shows when and they

[01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:10.910]
the spanking midgets in the uh... uh... the adulterous uh... whatever yeah every day

[01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:14.930]
it's a comedy show it'll get a lot of votes and it's certainly a hell of a lot of funny

[01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:20.010]
and seven of ones year touting like wk rp in Cincinnati it was funny everybody loves Raymond seven

[01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:25.730]

[01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:37.670]
very fun and i wanted the spirit was okay it has moments uh... the algae show the algae show the

[01:57:37.670 --> 01:57:42.550]

sensational are you being uh... served never heard of it arrested well never seen seventy show

[01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:56.710]
bad dream of gene great yet smart not for me than like it more you like that we would genie but you

[01:57:56.710 --> 01:58:00.670]
didn't like the Beverly Hill billy's right now i dream of genie was cute and i would never miss

[01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:04.590]
the number of the Beverly Hill billies have to do with i dream of genie miss you i didn't think it

[01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:09.570]
was funny and i'm questioning whether you actually ever saw an episode of course before you were born

[01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:13.470]
i would imagine that some of those shows were hysterical they ripped into everything the

[01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:18.370]
Beverly Hill billies they satirized everything in everyone including themselves and it was a panic

[01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:22.170]
but what does that have to do with the new me because i just on the same on the same

[01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:26.050]
on the same money was it who are they satirized you know i dream of nobody in the shows were just

[01:58:26.050 --> 01:58:30.290]
you when you watch them again it's like you know what i didn't realize the show wasn't really

[01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:38.010]
funny and be which same thing never missed an episode but it was only cute this is blast for me

[01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:42.610]
i never lost unless it was like paul inmate a guest appearance then i would you know i see my scenes

[01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:50.450]
but other than that well yeah paul anyway great theme song in both cases

[01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:08.870]
so there there are different kinds of humor okay my dream and genie i dream a gene wasn't one of those

[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:12.690]
like the old Steve Alan show where you'd like laugh so hard you'd almost pin your pants you're just

[01:59:12.690 --> 01:59:19.010]
roller key like a sight no but it was cute and it was cute and yes you would laugh you would laugh

[01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:23.670]
you know i don't care what you say when i was like when i went out and then you know i tried

[01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:28.830]
watching it again and other than barbraiden being really really hot yeah i i failed to see the comedy

[01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:35.430]
oh i just i just i want to strike gag a lot of very primitive sight gags she would bling i'll

[01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:38.850]
tell you what was funny too but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy to the battle bill oh it's good

[01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:44.150]
i think it was atomic battery surprise the speed

[01:59:46.050 --> 01:59:48.370]
in fact it was funny and very gay

[01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.710]
oh

[01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:55.110]
all right

[01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:57.630]
cute

[02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:06.250]
now i'll tell you sure here's another one i'm sure that was supposed to be funny and is one of the

[02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:10.910]
most it has one of the greatest cult following of any show in the history of television i could

[02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:17.630]
never begin to tell you why can i give you a clue oh yeah now don't put it on there because if

[02:00:17.630 --> 02:00:21.050]
you know it would vote for the Brady bunch was funny i'll tell you another one since you

will watch the world we can spend all day talking about it because you are my three sons was

[02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:29.850]

She got 14 votes.

[02:04:13.770 --> 02:04:15.590]
She's got 14, she's right under SNL.

[02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:18.050]
And put her in the same category with SNL, please.

[02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:19.150]
Jess leaves me limp.

[02:04:19.290 --> 02:04:21.730]
It's like putting the sign fell in the same category with all in the family.

[02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.130]
No.

[02:04:22.650 --> 02:04:23.690]

Yes, sir, speaking.

[02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:28.410]
Yeah, I know.

[02:04:28.570 --> 02:04:32.890]
How about Rocky and his friends and the original Superman with George Reef?

[02:04:33.230 --> 02:04:34.430]
Now, what was funny about Superman?

[02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.690]
It was hilarious.

[02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:38.250]
He had a fat guy with man boobs.

[02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:39.310]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:43.470]
It was hilarious the way he would on a table, you know,

[02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:45.390]
flying in the air practically.

[02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:48.050]
Yeah, yeah, he's on my camera.

[02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:50.450]
He was doing well.

[02:04:50.530 --> 02:04:51.910]
Rocky and Volmick a lot of be on there.

[02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:52.770]
Absolutely.

[02:04:53.210 --> 02:04:53.850]
Let's put it on there.

[02:04:54.130 --> 02:04:55.570]
Now, there's one of my favorite shows.

[02:04:55.730 --> 02:04:56.270]
What's wrong with that?

[02:04:56.370 --> 02:04:57.230]
No, congrats on me.

[02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.670]
All those things.

[02:04:57.670 --> 02:04:58.010]
Right.

[02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:04.070]
I watched them and, well, Rocky and Volmick was great.

[02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:05.410]
And what was the spin off on that?

[02:05:05.550 --> 02:05:10.350]
The one with the Canadian, the Royal Canadian Mounties with the, what's his name?

[02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:11.290]
Dudley Do Right.

[02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:12.090]
Dudley Do Right.

[02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:13.370]
What was the name of that show?

[02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.890]
I don't know.

[02:05:15.010 --> 02:05:17.430]
I think that was a little feature that they had within the Rocky and Volmick.

[02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:19.110]
No, no, no, there was another show.

[02:05:19.630 --> 02:05:20.330]
It was a spin off.

[02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:23.010]
Well, I could look it up in the book, but there's no way I'm going to do that.

[02:05:23.210 --> 02:05:24.630]
Because I got the TV book also.

[02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:26.930]
What is the funniest TV show of all time?

[02:05:27.170 --> 02:05:29.570]
Signed, spelled 147, all in the family, 124.

[02:05:30.110 --> 02:05:31.690]
Mighty Python, flying circus 79.

[02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:38.090]
The Simpson 71, South Park 70, Chappelle Show 47.

[02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:39.730]
How is Boris bad enough?

[02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:41.050]
Not enough.

[02:05:41.630 --> 02:05:43.170]
Family guy and what about Natasha?

[02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:45.110]
Family guy 42, Marywood Silver, 40.

[02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.830]
I'm not going to read all these because there's 80s.

[02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:50.650]
I was just reading the first page or Marywood Silver, 41.

[02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:54.550]
Tonight with Johnny Carson 28, Faulty Towers 25, Cheers 24.

[02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:58.050]
See, I put the Rocky and Volmick old stuff in the same category with like South Park

[02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:58.730]
with those guys.

[02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:02.150]
Okay, for today, a lot of South higher that was going on the heads of the day.

[02:06:02.150 --> 02:06:09.270]
A lot of South higher, a lot of great voices, you know, of course the voices on Rocky and Volmick

[02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:11.170]
were more than Edward Edward Horton.

[02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:12.590]
I wonder if he was kind of Tim Horton.

[02:06:12.710 --> 02:06:13.870]
Yeah, he's dead now, I think.

[02:06:14.090 --> 02:06:15.790]
Yeah, he's dead.

[02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:16.270]
All right.

[02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:19.090]
Who else is the voice on it?

[02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.610]
I don't know.

[02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:20.630]
I don't know.

[02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:21.210]
He would know.

[02:06:21.330 --> 02:06:21.950]
We don't want to know though.

[02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.990]
Cheers 24.

[02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:23.470]
Cheers.

[02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:30.490]
Jackie Gleason Show 19, Jefferson's 19, Serenade in life 15, Carol Brantjo 14 with Tim Conway

[02:06:30.490 --> 02:06:31.790]
and Harvey Corbin.

[02:06:32.170 --> 02:06:33.290]
Yeah, Harvey Corbin.

[02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:35.190]
Some of the sketches were good.

[02:06:35.410 --> 02:06:35.630]
What?

[02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:37.550]
Some of the sketches were good, but it was mostly good.

[02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:40.370]
I think he Lawrence, Vicki Lawrence, I think she and Carol were doing something.

[02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:45.390]
The Honeymooner's 12, Curbianthusiasm 10, I love loosely 10, Benny Hill Show 10, and

[02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:49.350]
after that single video, some of them are going to waste hours and hours reading 7,000

[02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.870]
different names.

[02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:53.970]
And again, we take the poll to find out your taste and, you know, we know you like being

[02:06:53.970 --> 02:06:55.370]
in the live screen better than any other flavor.

[02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:57.510]
So obviously you like Seinfeld better than all the family.

[02:06:57.870 --> 02:07:00.690]
And, you know, if it was going to be whatever we like, there would be the point taking

[02:07:00.690 --> 02:07:01.270]
the poll, right?

[02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:01.770]
Right.

[02:07:02.050 --> 02:07:03.950]
We know a lot of your taste is in your touch.

[02:07:04.570 --> 02:07:05.510]
Wait till you hear this story.

[02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:07.230]
Now, what I just tell you about Oprah, right?

[02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:07.850]
Don't make me wait.

[02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:12.950]
What did I just tell you about that bitch that you see in your life both mentally and physically?

[02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:16.110]
Well, better if you avoid Oprah because that bit we play with her.

[02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:20.790]
In fact, let me just play the beginning of that one moment, please.

[02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:22.930]
Oh, here it is.

[02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.370]
It's under.

[02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:24.430]
Please welcome Jennifer.

[02:07:26.210 --> 02:07:30.490]
I don't know if you've ever watched any of that show, but it's like he's got all the

[02:07:30.490 --> 02:07:33.890]
women, the stepper wives out there in the arts and they're all hopped up on some doggy

[02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:34.550]
uppers or something.

[02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:38.570]
If you're watching the intro and then they all just go crazy.

[02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:41.430]
Every time she says something, they have to pan to someone in the audience with this like

[02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:44.650]
moonless struck look on their face, practically crying.

[02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:46.910]
Well, when was spring's Colorado?

[02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:51.430]
Angelique Fiorillo says the border that crashed through one wall of her second story apartment

[02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:55.410]
out another might have struck her if she'd been in her usual spot watching Oprah.

[02:07:55.890 --> 02:07:56.510]
How do you like that?

[02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:57.010]
Hmm.

[02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:59.550]
Or maybe if she'd been sitting in the living room eating some okra.

[02:08:00.170 --> 02:08:03.250]
Fiorillo said that she was in the neighbors apartment when the table size rock thundered

[02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:04.630]
out red mountain Tuesday afternoon.

[02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:05.870]
We're like, oh my god.

[02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:06.430]
What is that?

[02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.910]
Oh my god.

[02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:09.110]
He said, we're like, her husband was a worker.

[02:08:09.250 --> 02:08:11.090]
Two cats, Odin and Loka.

[02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.710]
Loki.

[02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:12.250]
Loki.

[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:14.470]
Took cover under a bedroom dress and were on her.

[02:08:14.630 --> 02:08:15.690]
What's Odin and Loka?

[02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:16.110]
Loki.

[02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:17.990]
Those are Norse gods.

[02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:19.270]
No, I was really.

[02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.690]
Yes.

[02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.650]
Well, I'll be damned.

[02:08:20.850 --> 02:08:22.310]
So many gods and so little time.

[02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:22.710]
There's always.

[02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:23.510]
Oh god.

[02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:25.350]
Rain had apparently loosened the mountainside.

[02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:28.390]
I'm least a slide that sent the border bouncing down the mountainside, glancing off

[02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:30.850]
key branches and then crashing to a quarter of a field.

[02:08:30.850 --> 02:08:31.510]
What was apartment?

[02:08:32.630 --> 02:08:36.750]
It landed on the grass lawn outside leaving a trail of debris indoors and out.

[02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:37.530]
I'm doing ok.

[02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:38.810]
I'm alive, Fiorillo said.

[02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:40.210]
She did say I have no life.

[02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:40.870]
But other than that.

[02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:46.210]
So she wasn't an unusual spot watching Oprah and it saved her life and it could do the

[02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:46.870]
same for you.

[02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:48.330]
Are you silly women of America?

[02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:53.070]
They were like brainwashed with a swill with those silly ass pastel backgrounds and

[02:08:53.070 --> 02:08:53.990]
those stupid couches.

[02:08:55.090 --> 02:08:56.970]
Swill rhymes with Dr. Phil.

[02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:58.270]
Now wait till you hear this.

[02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:59.530]
Crunk is good.

[02:08:59.970 --> 02:09:00.430]
Is it?

[02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:01.670]
How good is it?

[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:02.730]
Have you ever been cranked up?

[02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:03.650]
Not today.

[02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:05.030]
Not really.

[02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.410]
It's early.

[02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:10.670]
In fact when I claimed my first horse at Hazel Park, Ray Crunk was the trainer driver.

[02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:13.050]
Ray Crunk had a short wife about two feet tall.

[02:09:13.290 --> 02:09:16.090]
He was like understudied Joe Marth Jr. for those of you who are paying attention.

[02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:18.310]
Crunk is good among the new hot words.

[02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:19.310]
It's oval wicked.

[02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:22.550]
Is that just oval from that made the original in the New Orleans?

[02:09:22.770 --> 02:09:22.990]
Ova.

[02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:23.490]
Ova.

[02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.910]
It's oval wicked and even underbuff.

[02:09:27.650 --> 02:09:29.190]
Have you ever heard any of these words?

[02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:31.850]
Well, oval wicked but not underbuff.

[02:09:32.150 --> 02:09:35.750]
We have Crunk, juice, energy drink here in the building.

[02:09:36.090 --> 02:09:36.170]
Right.

[02:09:37.130 --> 02:09:37.570]
Obviously.

[02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:38.310]
Freshly squeezed.

[02:09:39.010 --> 02:09:43.670]
There are just some of the entries in the book published today that list newly coined

[02:09:43.670 --> 02:09:46.470]
words as well as jargon used in technology, politics and the media.

[02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:49.390]
Crunk, the American hybrid for crazy and drunk.

[02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:51.050]
Are you talking about the present again?

[02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:55.790]
Is an example of how words evolved from popular culture, corned to Susie Dent, author

[02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:58.750]
of fanboys and overdogs, the language report.

[02:09:59.270 --> 02:10:01.690]
Crunk is entering all sorts of offshoot terms in the US.

[02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:04.410]
Crunk and B.

[02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.810]
Crunk rock.

[02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.650]
Crunkster.

[02:10:07.050 --> 02:10:09.410]
And looks to set the catch on in Britain too, then, said.

[02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:13.490]
New words travel from one variety of English to another and they speak English and English

[02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:14.310]
and Britain since when.

[02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:18.190]
And at rapidly increasing rate, thanks to the way language has exchanged over email

[02:10:18.190 --> 02:10:19.290]
chat rooms, TV, etc.

[02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:22.670]
Dents in a book also discusses the tendency to big up our language.

[02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:24.530]
Nothing is ever good or even great anymore.

[02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:26.970]
Instead, we opt for overbooking an underbuff.

[02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:30.610]
The government appointees are zars and experts are mysters.

[02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:35.650]
Oh, yeah, spin mysters, like left wing spin mysters, the push myster and the mole myster.

[02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:38.070]
Job titles also reflect this kind of inflation.

[02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:41.790]
The head of verbal communications is really just a receptionist while stockboys have been

[02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:45.810]
promoted to stock, stock, stock replenishment executives.

[02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:50.770]
As for the fanboys in the book titled, then said that the guys who are absorbed by a passion

[02:10:50.770 --> 02:10:53.870]
for comic books or computer games, fanboys.

[02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:55.570]
The book also looks at book camera.

[02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:57.150]
In fact, that's what they do in China a lot.

[02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.630]
Fanboys?

[02:10:57.930 --> 02:10:58.270]
Yeah.

[02:10:58.530 --> 02:10:59.950]
You ever see those Chinese fans?

[02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:00.650]
I'm sure you have.

[02:11:00.850 --> 02:11:02.110]
What do they call those fans?

[02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:04.850]
The book also looks at book camera.

[02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:06.010]
They're a shift in the past century.

[02:11:06.130 --> 02:11:10.970]
The year on 1905 saw the introduction of peace economy with the next year came Serena

[02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:11.410]
Soros.

[02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:12.350]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:13.410]
Serena Soros.

[02:11:13.710 --> 02:11:14.930]
Was that just Soros?

[02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:16.550]
So many words on list of related events.

[02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:19.870]
1940 introduced Jim Crow and 1980 brought Reaganomics.

[02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:21.730]
Podcasting was last year's word.

[02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:26.710]
The firmman referred to the 2005 word of the year is Sadaku, a big partner.

[02:11:27.190 --> 02:11:28.910]
SUD, OK, you how you be saying that.

[02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.550]
Sudoku?

[02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:30.570]
Never heard it.

[02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:31.490]
Sudoku.

[02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:36.490]
The logic puzzle that's replaced crosswords is a favorite way to kill time over lunch break.

[02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:37.290]
Sudoku?

[02:11:37.590 --> 02:11:38.890]
Never heard it or never heard of it?

[02:11:39.170 --> 02:11:39.690]
Don't know from it.

[02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:44.090]
Fanboys whose dense third annual language review book, Publisher Serra Kid says, it's

[02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:47.730]
dense as a resident word expert on London channel for countdown programs.

[02:11:47.730 --> 02:11:49.650]
Well, isn't that totally wonderful, huh?

[02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:51.250]
And have a great day, mate.

[02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:53.150]
Good day, Art.

[02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:57.530]
Just, oh, and I got, thanks to George, who did a lot of work and came up with very,

[02:11:57.910 --> 02:12:02.950]
but the one that I did find from EIU online store about that little ability thing that I

[02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:04.090]
had a little bourbon yesterday.

[02:12:04.090 --> 02:12:04.610]
Well, we got more.

[02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:07.530]
How come we're not getting any calls about Kelly in that hockey game, damn it.

[02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:08.410]
WQAM, hello.

[02:12:08.770 --> 02:12:09.410]
Hey, Neil.

[02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:10.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:13.970]
The funny show of our time with the 2004 President D. Bane.

[02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.810]
OK, great.

[02:12:15.330 --> 02:12:15.970]
WQAM, hello.

[02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.770]
Neil.

[02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:17.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:18.450]
A couple things.

[02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:19.430]
One for the poll.

[02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:20.270]
How about Nightcord?

[02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.510]
Nightcord's good.

[02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:22.070]
I like that.

[02:12:23.170 --> 02:12:26.890]
And regarding John Schneider, I think Al Bina was the term you're looking for.

[02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:30.870]
No, that wasn't when I was thinking of it, but he looks, on that show, he looked very

[02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:32.930]
close to Al Bina, which is of course white hair.

[02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:38.870]
It was so light blonde, and it had to be a dye job, man, because he used to say, I'm

[02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:39.770]
dyed on the hair.

[02:12:39.810 --> 02:12:40.850]
I'm thinking of toehead.

[02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:42.050]
Yeah, yeah, toehead.

[02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:42.610]
Right.

[02:12:42.610 --> 02:12:46.130]
And this is sort of regarding what you guys were talking about yesterday.

[02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:51.490]
What was that guy who worked alongside Billy Graham and he wrote a book and you used to

[02:12:51.490 --> 02:12:53.050]
talk about the book a while back?

[02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:55.570]
Oh, oh, the guy that died.

[02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:57.390]
Oh, man.

[02:12:57.570 --> 02:12:58.390]
He looked right in the eye.

[02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:59.630]
And they were like, they're well to God.

[02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:02.410]
They're well to God by Charles.

[02:13:03.570 --> 02:13:04.650]
Oh, nothing Riley.

[02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:06.130]
Yeah, Charles, nothing Riley.

[02:13:06.270 --> 02:13:07.530]
No, we'll find it for you.

[02:13:07.650 --> 02:13:08.350]
It's a great book.

[02:13:08.590 --> 02:13:08.770]
Excellent.

[02:13:08.970 --> 02:13:10.910]
I was trying to find it a while back.

[02:13:11.070 --> 02:13:12.190]
And I couldn't find it.

[02:13:12.190 --> 02:13:12.590]
I looked for it.

[02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:12.590]

[02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:12.590]

[02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:13.530]
I couldn't find it anywhere.

[02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:16.550]
He was Canadian, so you have to probably look on a Canadian.

[02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:20.010]
In fact, I don't think for a long time that the American booksters wouldn't cure it.

[02:13:20.290 --> 02:13:20.970]
Charles Templeton?

[02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.970]
Charles Templeton.

[02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:22.870]
Who would you come up with?

[02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.670]
The gubid.

[02:13:24.010 --> 02:13:24.410]
Amazon?

[02:13:24.510 --> 02:13:24.930]
That's it.

[02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:27.150]
And you can get it from Amazon.

[02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:28.210]
Oh, okay.

[02:13:29.190 --> 02:13:33.670]
I used to listen to you in camp, and you used to be a long time great in South, and

[02:13:33.670 --> 02:13:35.910]
that's the blob guy.

[02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:36.990]
What's his name?

[02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:38.670]
Lob Lasseter.

[02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:40.230]
Oh, that's his name.

[02:13:40.230 --> 02:13:40.690]
I'm a double.

[02:13:41.370 --> 02:13:42.690]
Yeah, I'm trying to remember him.

[02:13:43.130 --> 02:13:44.130]
Okay, everybody up there.

[02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:45.670]
And get him out of your mind, please.

[02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:47.410]
I will do.

[02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:48.150]
See you.

[02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:48.990]
L. Blabo.

[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.750]
Let's see.

[02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:50.710]
Let me start by saying.

[02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:53.630]
I never listen to talk radio until I heard your show about seven years ago.

[02:13:53.670 --> 02:13:54.550]
I've never stopped since.

[02:13:54.810 --> 02:13:55.890]
It's by far the best out there.

[02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:59.050]
But boy, your taste in music entertainment and food, we must be desired.

[02:13:59.370 --> 02:14:00.550]
Just say no to moe, it says.

[02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:02.790]
Your taste in food is impeccable.

[02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.430]
What am I taste in food is sensational.

[02:14:04.670 --> 02:14:05.310]
You don't get to be this.

[02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:06.390]
Well, now that's odd to us.

[02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:07.630]
Some people just are sloppy.

[02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:08.130]
They're really.

[02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:11.510]
Like fat boy, I wouldn't say because he weighs 600 pounds.

[02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:12.590]
He's got impeccable taste.

[02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:14.190]
But I have great taste in food.

[02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:15.210]
I was the other one's entertainment.

[02:14:15.330 --> 02:14:16.310]
And that's not correct.

[02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:18.190]
And music, hey, I'm an old funny dirty.

[02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.830]
That's all night.

[02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:20.150]
I like the music I grew up with.

[02:14:20.150 --> 02:14:21.630]
And if you don't like it too bad, you mama.

[02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:22.670]
Oh, here it is.

[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:23.090]
I'm on it.

[02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:25.470]
Fractured fairy tales and what do you dog?

[02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:26.610]
Now, fractured fairy tales.

[02:14:26.610 --> 02:14:28.790]
That was also part of the show.

[02:14:29.290 --> 02:14:31.310]
There was a segment on Ronald King Bullway.

[02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.470]
Right.

[02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:33.090]
So let's just leave it a dad.

[02:14:33.490 --> 02:14:34.330]
Little this, little dad.

[02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:35.630]
Now he's a wealthy dog.

[02:14:35.630 --> 02:14:35.790]
Now he's a wealthy dog.

[02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:36.570]

[02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:38.050]
I think they said wonder dog.

[02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:38.490]
Right.

[02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:39.630]
You didn't like that?

[02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:41.330]
Well, I liked underdog better.

[02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:42.210]
Oh, it's a.

[02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:44.810]
You see how easily I got sucked in there.

[02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:46.510]
I thought they were talking about Steady Wonder dog.

[02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:48.110]
There's no need to care.

[02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:49.210]
Wonder dog.

[02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:51.490]
Oh, look at the pole, Josh.

[02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:52.370]
Look at that pole.

[02:14:54.010 --> 02:14:55.670]
Why are people always telling you that, I didn't?

[02:14:55.890 --> 02:14:58.690]
Grab a hole to your kneecaps and spin around the next year.

[02:14:59.290 --> 02:14:59.670]
This.

[02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.750]
2007.

[02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:01.390]
That was amazing.

[02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:02.610]
Got a thousand eight.

[02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:04.110]
I'm going to have to spin around the next year.

[02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:04.930]
I'm going to have to spin around the next year.

[02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:05.170]
Oh.

[02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:10.370]
Now this has to be mistaken.

[02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:11.370]
It must be.

[02:15:11.590 --> 02:15:13.650]
It must be a fig newton in my imagination.

[02:15:13.810 --> 02:15:14.630]
Another error in here.

[02:15:14.890 --> 02:15:16.610]
I know that there were some people in there.

[02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:18.870]
And fixed that audio vault impeccably.

[02:15:19.050 --> 02:15:19.730]
Well, I can always.

[02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:22.330]
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

[02:15:22.670 --> 02:15:22.850]
Oh, wait, wait.

[02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:23.770]
Yeah.

[02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:24.610]
Oh, wait, nevermind.

[02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.950]
Oh.

[02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:29.730]
Do we have Bill Cosby's show on there?

[02:15:31.190 --> 02:15:32.150]
Oh, let's try it now.

[02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:32.990]
Oh.

[02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:36.290]
So, this is on it.

[02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:37.690]
This is not a tumor.

[02:15:38.050 --> 02:15:39.750]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:41.110]
Did you see Will and Grace last night?

[02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:41.710]
Sure, no.

[02:15:41.950 --> 02:15:42.870]
Yeah, that was great.

[02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:45.670]
I like the party.

[02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:45.910]
I like the party.

[02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:46.090]
You see?

[02:15:46.210 --> 02:15:46.950]
Get this.

[02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:48.230]
Have a seat.

[02:15:49.170 --> 02:15:50.290]
Have a seat.

[02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.850]
Have a seat.

[02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:52.630]
That's great comedy, right?

[02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:56.250]
In that Brian Williams, the way he tilts his head down like head, Murrell.

[02:15:56.450 --> 02:15:58.730]
Now that's fair and balanced news, Governor.

[02:15:58.730 --> 02:16:02.810]
I still can't get the image of dead bodies floating down Bourbon Street out of my mind.

[02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:05.730]
Oh, what you ought to do is watch an episode of Joey tonight.

[02:16:06.450 --> 02:16:07.470]
I, I, Joey.

[02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:08.330]
Yeah.

[02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.750]
Sure.

[02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:14.990]
It's all part of the quality deep programming provided by the fifth largest of things contractor in the world.

[02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.470]

[02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:16.530]
Or in order.

[02:16:18.610 --> 02:16:19.630]
And then that will you.

[02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:20.190]
Thank you.

[02:20:58.870 --> 02:21:03.450]
33 cities almost half those surveyed the total fall into the top of the ability a bracket

[02:21:03.450 --> 02:21:08.410]
This reflects the fact that many global business centers have developed a infrastructure and widespread available available

[02:21:08.410 --> 02:21:13.430]
They still the overwhelming majority of cities in the top of the ability range are based in Western Europe and North America

[02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:20.450]
With Western Europe having the slight edge only three cities in eastern Europe fall into this bracket along with 13 cities from Asia

[02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:25.650]
All cities in North American Western Europe have ratings below 20% in contrast all cities in Latin America

[02:21:25.650 --> 02:21:31.470]
African the Middle East exceed this the worst destinations in the survey are those of Algiers and Port Morris

[02:21:31.470 --> 02:21:36.410]
Being papa and New Guinea where many aspects of daily life present challenges all ten cities with the liberal

[02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:40.030]
The electric seats 50% are in Asia Africa for the Middle East

[02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:46.490]
Despite the clear difference of living standards between eastern and Western Europe the expansion of EU and strong economic development

[02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:50.230]
Experiencing Eastern Europe since the breakup of the survey union something these catch up on the West

[02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:55.970]
The three cities in Eastern Europe were the best livability in the seas Budapest, Vaudislava and Prague

[02:21:55.970 --> 02:22:00.990]
Oh, gotta go to Budapest and Prague our fond of EU what I'd love to but you know

[02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:02.130]
I will next year

[02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:08.110]
Factors such as improved transporting communications infrastructure along with greater availability of good services

[02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:11.130]
Mercational activities have played a part in slowly bringing these cities in line with the West

[02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:15.610]
Much less desirable our states be set by corruption and instability further to the east

[02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:19.150]
Tashkent and Baku in the former Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan Azerbaijan

[02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:26.570]
Scrum along the worst in the region ratings of 42 and 38 percent both countries are prone to a corruption civil unrest with the threat of petty crime

[02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:28.690]
Terror and like a general amenities also playing part

[02:22:28.690 --> 02:22:35.050]
Istanbul and Turkey has an unenviable livability rating of 39 percent in far due to recent terror attacks including the

[02:22:35.050 --> 02:22:38.090]
2003 attacks which specifically targeted the expatriates

[02:22:38.090 --> 02:22:39.070]
Conversely

[02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:45.750]
Austria's capital of Vienna shares joint-second spot would Geneva Switzerland not even New York both cities have a rating of 2% with their

[02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:50.570]
Climate's a factor beyond human control is the main pitfall to live there Athens released livable destination

[02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:52.590]
Western Europe also suffers from climate issues

[02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:58.210]
Although its infrastructure also serves to bring it down its ranking despite this

[02:22:58.210 --> 02:23:03.850]
Athens still occupies the top tier of economist intelligence units livability scale Athens never been there

[02:23:03.850 --> 02:23:10.350]
Lot of a lot of a bad air and a lot of very hairy people don't like the Greeks. They don't like that. I say that

[02:23:10.350 --> 02:23:14.130]
Okay, I don't know any Greeks with low crime little trepid

[02:23:14.130 --> 02:23:19.270]
Instability or terrorism and a highly developed infrastructure Canada has the most livable destinations in the world

[02:23:20.170 --> 02:23:21.170]
How do you like that?

[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:25.010]
When the rating of just 1% has resulted a small threat from petty crime

[02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:31.870]
Bankouber's the highest ranked city of 127 survey to further to Canadian cities countering Toronto feature in the top five with ratings of just

[02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:37.830]
3% they're tied well although higher crime rates and a greater threat of tear puts US cities below those of Canada

[02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:40.110]
US cities are still among the world's most livable

[02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:43.270]
Cleveland and Pittsburgh of the joint best-scorey cities in the US

[02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:49.090]
7% enjoy 26 places in the global ranking a lack of availability of recreation activities in certain

[02:23:49.090 --> 02:23:55.110]
Infrastructional shortfalls put Lexington as the least little will US city survey Lexington Kentucky in 56 place

[02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:58.310]
Although it's a game of 13% is still mighty low

[02:23:58.310 --> 02:24:03.430]
See I'm trying to find eventually we will find the whole list here without having any sort

[02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:08.930]
Without having to pay for it. Oh, yeah, we don't want to do that although no land American city survey manages to present

[02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:13.950]
Ideal living conditions either to any fall into category where extreme difficulties are faced although Bogota in Columbia

[02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:22.030]
117 comes close to the rating of 49% Bogota like Caracas Venezuela has been subject to high-profile levels of instability on rest and violence

[02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:24.190]
You don't want to go there?

[02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:30.410]
No, I'm talking about that that experience driving from the airport into downtown Caracas a few years ago

[02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:36.610]
That was that was a re relever a revelation without the Bible all those little those

[02:24:36.610 --> 02:24:40.570]
10 roofed huts up in the last one time he's

[02:24:40.570 --> 02:24:43.730]
Zillions of them all with little TV antennas on top of course

[02:24:43.730 --> 02:24:49.470]
Oh, he's the connected and then you get in downtown and the area's just teaming teaming with people

[02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:52.190]
It's so it's like it's like we're jaded with sardine can

[02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:56.390]
But the anti airport was like paramilitary atmosphere. You know, they were all had their

[02:24:57.470 --> 02:25:02.050]
Camouflage suits on and the whole deal kind of a scary kind of like what the US is gonna be about to

[02:25:02.050 --> 02:25:08.730]
What do you mean two years the two sit in two minutes two city score 90% and 75% not bad the higher the number the worst it is

[02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:14.390]
Due to widespread guerrilla warfare in Columbia and violent civil unrest and opposition to Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez

[02:25:14.390 --> 02:25:16.490]
Come on Pat Robertson. Let's take him out

[02:25:18.310 --> 02:25:22.530]
With scores of 20% month of the day when you're a Gues Santiago in Chile and Buenos

[02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:27.470]
Automata in Argentina 64th joint offered the best of incandescent land America. That's not too good

[02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:32.110]
This is largely thanks to relative efficient infrastructure and the availability of goods and services

[02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:38.030]
They are closely followed by US Commonwealth territory San Juan and Puerto Rico 23% rank number 68 and

[02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:41.830]
San Jose and Costa Rica ranked 70 of 24%

[02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:44.510]
Latin America's longest serving unbroken democracy

[02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:50.830]
Costa Rica alongside candidate Australia's got some of the most liberal places in the world Melbourne is ranked second overall

[02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:56.510]
With the ranges 2% Perth Abilade and city joined Zurich Toronto and Calgary and joined fifth place with ratings of 3%

[02:25:56.510 --> 02:26:01.790]
Just below this Brisbane and joint 11th elsewhere in the region cities in Japan who's even Hong Kong South Korea

[02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:06.230]
Singapore and Taiwan all for good standard living with a humid climate foring the scores down a wee bit

[02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:07.630]
Just north of Australia

[02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:11.550]
However, a very different picture emerges with port more as the Papa Papua New Guinea

[02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:16.490]
We are turning the worst joint score of all 127 cities surveyed with a rating of 66%

[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:19.790]
In fact, if you go over there and just walk around the streets they're all the only the same thing

[02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:20.950]
I'm dying out of here

[02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:22.710]
They suffer from high crime rates

[02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:25.930]
Corruption instability low availability vendor payment good services

[02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:31.210]
And a dilapidated infrastructure the proximity of port more is be to Australia highlights the two tiered nature of the

[02:26:31.210 --> 02:26:37.230]
Vibollini Asian countries with a number of well-developed urban centers next through the countries where less favorable conditions apply

[02:26:37.890 --> 02:26:45.010]
How do you like that? Here's the fact that says hi up alley. How about good time should a pool had one of the classic theme songs that George hates like poison

[02:26:45.010 --> 02:26:47.830]
I'm sure you mentioned that I don't know why I don't hate it

[02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:49.930]
I just don't like it not like that welcome back cauter

[02:26:49.930 --> 02:26:51.870]
And I hate that it's not on here

[02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:57.590]
I hate that to find the right distance. I don't even are not Joey Scarborough or whatever the hell that guy's name is

[02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:59.470]
Yeah, what about it? Hey it

[02:27:00.410 --> 02:27:01.970]
Yeah, that's the one oh

[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:04.010]
Oh

[02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:09.790]
What about the 500 time I heard it I decided to hate it

[02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:14.450]
I got good time here not good time

[02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:21.070]
So I would rather have a jelly roll or an extra roll

[02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:23.710]
Or rock and roll

[02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:31.830]
Okay, let me do the break please all right, so what the hell was that good time then good times my ass

[02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:38.370]
That's what I heard yeah, I'm serious. I'll be good. You know, you just not gonna do it because you're a harness. I don't have it

[02:27:38.370 --> 02:27:41.090]
That's all you don't have it. I don't oh

[02:27:53.830 --> 02:28:00.510]
Who is that is that's flying the family song of course cool team again. She was a cheek. Oh

[02:28:03.930 --> 02:28:11.490]
I don't want to

[02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:11.490]

[02:28:40.770 --> 02:28:41.150]
Making away

[02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:45.430]
See let me just say this to you anybody who doesn't like that theme has got some kind of a problem

[02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:49.590]
Well, it's how it goes about me. You give me a song that's about my bad taste even Josh would agree

[02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:54.850]
That's a pretty good team song. Yeah, I was listening to my car this morning on the way here not necessarily you don't like that

[02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:59.830]
S TV things going over in the T. Don't listen to TV themes in your car or in your home

[02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:05.470]
You don't sit there with your with your iPod or your Sony Walkman listen to TV things unless you're a crazy person

[02:29:05.470 --> 02:29:07.170]
You don't like that theme. It's okay

[02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:10.470]
It's fine. You know, he's still believes you're gonna buy in that TV, you know

[02:29:11.050 --> 02:29:14.810]
No, he knows better one sixteen and five sixty-vehicle. I'm the

[02:29:15.250 --> 02:29:15.930]
Rogers guys

[02:29:15.930 --> 02:29:17.710]
The federal government is just more in the

[02:29:18.930 --> 02:29:24.970]
Underwoods are in services of the most parties brown offered no apology and mostly blame others for the

[02:29:24.970 --> 02:29:25.430]
Department

[02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:26.670]
My

[02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:32.090]
There's no one left to blame I said brownie

[02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:35.690]
You're the government shame I said brownie

[02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:40.730]
Here's up in blame. There's no one I know

[02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:43.610]
More lame George Bush

[02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:47.290]
You better make them shut up before he says

[02:29:47.290 --> 02:29:50.970]
It was you will mess up you can defend it

[02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:57.950]
But I'm sure you will find many think that he should do time

[02:29:57.950 --> 02:30:01.690]
I was just tired of this but he's way too dumb to run the

[02:30:02.650 --> 02:30:05.510]
F E M A some people died when he ran

[02:30:08.490 --> 02:30:12.310]
Now that everyone knows that your leadership votes

[02:30:12.310 --> 02:30:14.050]
You can go back to your

[02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:20.610]
Today most Republicans and Democrats criticize the fact that the ground is still on the federal payroll

[02:30:20.610 --> 02:30:27.130]
That maybe because as long as he remains an administration official his testimony must be cleared by the White House

[02:30:27.130 --> 02:30:30.090]
You're fired 21 past one and of course we're getting

[02:30:30.090 --> 02:30:34.970]
Inundated with facts isn't caused about Gildey's great debut as voice of the panthers last night and not

[02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:40.070]
It's about to take place outside. What is it? It's pitch black outside. Oh, yeah

[02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:43.250]
Let me look at that Miami radar right and earlier and it wasn't much going on

[02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:45.330]
But now we got Teresa and Stan

[02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:47.490]
Tammy and Stan

[02:30:48.810 --> 02:30:50.850]
My favorite do I was it was veka Stan

[02:30:50.850 --> 02:30:56.070]
Let me look at that national weather service radar momentarily. Let me put the emotion in the oh

[02:30:56.070 --> 02:31:04.970]
Gee, woo there are some yellows and some reds and some stuff coming really you got any onion kind of like whipping around some red peppers and green peppers and yellow ones

[02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:11.190]
Let's see what this faxes you just sent from lorraine Baltimore. We got a list of involve them are ball ball more

[02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:12.870]
How you like that? All right?

[02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:15.590]
Lori has one for the pull how about the three studios?

[02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:18.910]
Yeah, you know, how about that all right? Remember what they used to say

[02:31:18.910 --> 02:31:23.610]
Don't don't don't don't yeah, I think most said that they had their own show every Saturday morning when I was a kid

[02:31:23.610 --> 02:31:27.730]
You can still find them on cable sometime if you're lucky also you were talking about wonder dog earlier

[02:31:27.730 --> 02:31:30.150]
I think you meant underdog. Yeah, no the facts said one dog

[02:31:30.970 --> 02:31:37.750]
Whose real life voice was that of the late great really I never do that hey the late great Nebysh wallie Cox

[02:31:47.470 --> 02:31:49.330]

[02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:22.090]
Can we run your brought? Yeah, there's nothing on that. Are you sure positive? It's only one way to find out

[02:32:22.090 --> 02:32:25.730]

Well, the situations Blake or Polly don't bother wonder bras here to make them stick out

Balled very funny guy used to be on pantomime quiz with my kid in Hermione Gingold you have no idea

[02:35:10.190 --> 02:35:15.790]
I hear some other show that some people might say was funny, but I'll tell you right now nobody world because there was any humor on this show

[02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:26.510]
There only a couple of reasons anybody watched that show they read their obsessed with Susan day or surely Jones or both of them or obsessed with David

[02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:30.930]
Cassidy who had better here than either one of them and of course so you can't imagine which one was my kid

But I beg to do to she beg you know we can say to share the village

[02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:47.030]
We know in the building bring their own

[02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:52.310]
To work with them we've got and it's not even 130 quite yet. It's not one

[02:35:52.310 --> 02:35:58.790]
A thousand eighty three votes. I mean we'll do a hundred like it was like like it nothing just falling right down

[02:35:58.790 --> 02:36:03.890]
I'm too excited thrilled to death in fact if I were you and run right into Greg right now say I want a huge raise

[02:36:03.890 --> 02:36:06.710]

Just like that make no mistake about this is meal Roger

This is 5.62.8

[02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:22.650]
And hold it

[02:36:33.890 --> 02:36:34.010]
Oh

[02:36:37.710 --> 02:36:40.650]
And there ain't no really

[02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:48.030]
I go to the station I gotta ride me

[02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:51.390]
A lot of this president

[02:36:51.390 --> 02:36:53.890]
I just feel a little bit that same

[02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:57.210]
Take a look at the gas gauge

[02:36:57.210 --> 02:36:59.190]
Need a point to eat

[02:37:00.050 --> 02:37:01.170]
I'm gonna feel love

[02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:24.590]
So

[02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:30.890]
You know we had a great pull a great pull idea and

[02:37:31.170 --> 02:37:34.790]
I wrote it down so I can't remember I wrote it earlier today remember what it was

[02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:38.370]
Uh, what's your idea of heaven something like that? Oh, yeah

[02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:42.610]
That's it for good good for you. I could have pretended to forget so I could use it next week

[02:37:44.130 --> 02:37:48.330]
For prices those ideas are what's your idea of heaven? I like that a lot

[02:37:48.330 --> 02:37:53.310]
And I'm actually gonna write down now on something I'm not gonna throw out. Yeah, I think that was the problem

[02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:57.190]
Because you know me I threw all this stuff on the garbage like in a rage

[02:38:01.330 --> 02:38:03.470]
Oh, this is a great song

[02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:06.810]
So

[02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:13.890]
I like the bean part

[02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:21.450]
Look at this look who wrote the theme from good times or maybe maybe sings it

[02:38:21.450 --> 02:38:28.870]
I guess sing is this who wrote it or sings it Jim Gill strap and Perth blinky William Jim jock strap

[02:38:32.110 --> 02:38:37.230]
I didn't I just don't understand. I mean hated that show, but I think it's a fantastic theme song right?

[02:38:37.390 --> 02:38:43.450]
You know, yeah different taste. Oh look at that huge. Oh, all that blob. There's a Tammy in her skin

[02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:46.970]
It is rain and oh boy

[02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:52.190]
Tammy really a good thing as opposed to a bad old joke up in a rubber stand

[02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:56.210]
He's back in the studio with nice shoes. Tammy off towards the east a little bit off now

[02:38:56.210 --> 02:38:58.330]
We're dropping down the into the

[02:38:58.330 --> 02:39:02.390]
He looks a lot better now. There's not out there in the storms. You know all like a beaten and haggard

[02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:03.510]
More haggard

[02:39:04.050 --> 02:39:07.290]
Leave the start and turn and we're starting to feel a bit of 48 miniapolis

[02:39:07.290 --> 02:39:11.030]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's gonna start getting a little on the you know, and then you're gonna say I say we told you

[02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:14.430]
That's no underground stuff like that now say it, but we're not drowning over here

[02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:19.370]
Andy and Miami says what about police squad with nothing eelsing well actually was on for about what five minutes

[02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:20.970]
They're about to graduate

[02:39:20.970 --> 02:39:23.030]
It says although it had a limited number of episodes

[02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:27.830]
It deleted the native gun movies while I'm sure was very good that I'm recall seeing I don't know

[02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:31.550]
I mean there was on for 30 seconds. Yeah, half a week

[02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:38.530]
I think they can't stop doing show on that because again the whole question is the funniest TV show of all time

[02:39:38.530 --> 02:39:42.190]
Of course, I love lasineels and good Canadian boy by the way, but

[02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:46.030]
Gifts are Andy Python burst after trying to eat gator

[02:39:46.570 --> 02:39:52.350]
It's got the pictures. Oh, we've seen it. They're passing it around all of a sudden and the picture to have amy really? Yeah

[02:39:52.350 --> 02:39:57.670]
Big talk in every grades national part there it is which goes to show you know the oldest question your eyes

[02:39:57.670 --> 02:40:01.110]
A bigger than your stomach when people can't finish a meal especially kids. Oh, yeah

[02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:02.950]
It's got big eyes but his eyes are bigger than a stomach

[02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:07.670]
Well, I guess the same could be said of the Python. Oh, and isn't it appropriate? We do the money Python

[02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:10.850]
And what the hell is that thing about? I don't know if we can play that anymore

[02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:14.810]
Every sperm is that what that's called right? Yeah

[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:18.350]
I'm about something to tell the all family it's

[02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:23.210]
Mills close

[02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:26.270]
There's no more work way destitute

[02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:33.250]
Come in my little I've got no option but to sell you all for scientific experiments

[02:40:34.470 --> 02:40:39.930]
No, no, that's the way it is my love. They have the Catholic Church for not letting me wear one of those little rubber things

[02:40:42.130 --> 02:40:48.270]
They're the best money. Oh, yeah, absolutely the best and of course kind of Lisa said it wasn't we a laugh ride that money Python play in the york

[02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:51.890]
Just about our seven thousand dollar designer shoes

[02:40:51.890 --> 02:40:53.830]
That were our next girlfriend. I mean boyfriend

[02:40:53.830 --> 02:41:00.210]
The alligator has some foreign competition at the top of the Everglades food chain and the results of the struggle our horror movie messy

[02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:07.010]
A 13-foot Burmese Python recently burst after apparently tried to swallow a live six-foot alligator hole

[02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:09.950]
But don't swallow those gators especially their holes

[02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:16.190]
The incidence is heightened by all the spheres that the non-native states could threaten the host of other animal species in the Everglades

[02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:20.210]
It means nothing in the Everglades is safe from pythons the top-down predator

[02:41:20.210 --> 02:41:25.810]
Our Frank you said Frank Mazzotti a University of Florida wildlife professor a lot of wildlife at the University of Florida

[02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:29.950]
Over the years many pythons have been abandoned in the Everglades by pet owners

[02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:34.810]
The gory evidence of the latest gator python encounter the fourth documented the past three years

[02:41:34.810 --> 02:41:40.690]
Was discovered in photograph last week by helicopter pilot and wildlife researcher the snake was found with the gators

[02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:43.170]
High-end quarters protruding from its midsection

[02:41:43.170 --> 02:41:48.310]
Mazzotti said the alligator may have clawed at the python stomach as the snake tried to digest it

[02:41:48.310 --> 02:41:54.330]
Oh, man getting eaten from the inside in previous instance the alligator won or the battle was an apparent draw

[02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:57.450]
There had been some hope that gators can control Burmese pythons

[02:41:57.450 --> 02:42:00.430]
Mazzotti said this indicates to me it's going to be an even draw

[02:42:00.430 --> 02:42:06.030]
Sometimes the gators are going to win and sometimes the python will win and sometimes aerophile might do it

[02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:09.690]
It's unknown how many pythons are competed with the thousands of alligators in the glades

[02:42:09.690 --> 02:42:14.890]
but at least 150 of them captured the past two years said Joe was a loose key a wildlifeologist and crocodile tracker

[02:42:14.890 --> 02:42:17.510]
What do you for a new for life? I'm a crocodile tracker

[02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:18.210]
Raw

[02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:23.350]
Uh pythons could strengthen many remember that sound by the OJs I'm a crocodile tracker

[02:42:23.350 --> 02:42:27.990]
No pythons could strengthen many smaller species that conservationists are trying to protect plenty of the reptiles

[02:42:29.170 --> 02:42:31.950]
otters squirrels woodstorks and sparrows

[02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:36.750]
Was a loose key said 10 or 20 foot python could also produce a risk to unwear a human especially a child

[02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:42.130]
He had it. I don't think this is an imminent threat. This is not a be afraid be very afraid since you're patient

[02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:49.090]
That's exactly what it says here. This is not a what this is not a be afraid be very afraid

[02:42:49.090 --> 02:42:52.370]
So it's very afraid. Yeah, it's very afraid. It's not

[02:42:52.970 --> 02:42:57.110]
So there we go. Oh, yes, there's a facing arrest now. I give up

[02:42:57.110 --> 02:43:02.170]
Kate Moss will be arrested as the first supply cocaine when she returns to Britain

[02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:07.550]
Shane super this is in the online sun the British showroom of Rock tabloid

[02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:11.830]
For her change supermodel be asked to attend a police uh, attend a police station

[02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:17.530]
Where she'll be formally arrested interviewed under caution. I have I you know that that's supposed to be in the English language

[02:43:17.530 --> 02:43:20.350]
I can't understand what those celiacs brits are talking about

[02:43:20.350 --> 02:43:26.590]
She will attend a police station like attending a funeral I guess right her own and before my arrest and interviewed under caution

[02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:31.090]
So maybe the caution lights are on I don't have any cool what that means

[02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:35.430]
That means you get to have a race. It's like an indie you know the function like the

[02:43:35.430 --> 02:43:36.990]
You like flag huh?

[02:43:37.430 --> 02:43:39.050]
Trying to be a little frag gay

[02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:45.890]
1111 votes this and who you are even real. I got plans for that money already. Oh my god

[02:43:45.890 --> 02:43:50.290]
We're gonna have a bonus that gonna come in here just toss in hundred dollar bills in every direction

[02:43:50.850 --> 02:43:56.710]
In fact, that would be surprised that many bell comes in it was checkbook right now and and writes it and gives both of you guys a big fat one

[02:43:59.350 --> 02:43:59.710]
I

[02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:02.650]
Was gonna say it gives you both a big wet one. Hey as a right congratulations

[02:44:02.650 --> 02:44:07.790]
Did you speak at a mighty belt that we ever get those his spank numbers from the spring book that I had a beg for the other day?

[02:44:07.970 --> 02:44:11.570]
No, I beg for them and I guarantee the reason being that they're really bad

[02:44:11.570 --> 02:44:15.250]
We don't have in spite of the wishful thinking of a few of our Julios out there

[02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:17.490]
We have a very decreasing number

[02:44:17.490 --> 02:44:21.470]
You know the very elbow lift was bad enough and the fact that I spoke the truth then I was very bad

[02:44:21.470 --> 02:44:22.770]
And he's supposed to suck up, you know

[02:44:22.770 --> 02:44:27.610]
And then of course we had the alienito thing and that was just when we're starting to mend our offense a little bit

[02:44:27.610 --> 02:44:35.010]
And that was bad still wasn't just huh and you're still a denial you always have been about what about the Hispanic audience those that speak English anyway

[02:44:35.010 --> 02:44:39.350]
They all listen well you can say they all listen, but so evidently they they lie a lot

[02:44:39.350 --> 02:44:42.930]
They don't put it down in the diaries because once upon a time we did fairly well

[02:44:42.930 --> 02:44:47.650]
But then recent years as especially since little alienito right will say 60 minutes fame

[02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:49.270]
Huh we'll see all

[02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:53.930]
See if I can come down on one hand you're always telling me that you don't know anybody who listens to the show

[02:44:53.930 --> 02:44:57.450]
And then on the other hand on your time and of course you don't hang out with Julios anyway

[02:44:57.450 --> 02:45:02.050]
That's right except your relatives and who they'll once am see the operative word is hang out

[02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:07.750]
Yeah, see I know people that listen to the show. I don't have friends who do I see make any sense

[02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:09.730]
Yeah, I've had for years that

[02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:13.110]
If we they would no longer be friends after listening to the show

[02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:17.750]
I'd have to severely talk to them about that funniest TV show of all times

[02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:24.750]
Signed failed 175 all over the family 143 a big crocodile a big alligator tear comes to my eye

[02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:22.430]
Made it wasn't shocking, looked like one of the kids.

[02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:25.310]
The cash pay, he does know we're her friends.

[02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:29.390]
All of them are skinny, free, so would she.

[02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:31.910]
The people are then his mother.

[02:46:33.130 --> 02:46:36.210]
I'm calling to his friends as do I think I can stand.

[02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:38.850]
The people are then his mother.

[02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:40.030]
And we're all in the same place.

[02:46:40.030 --> 02:46:42.470]
And the parent he, she were.

[02:46:43.850 --> 02:46:45.790]
All of them sold out the food.

[02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:49.250]
But he's not in, he's been.

[02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:52.570]
All of us are in a stable.

[02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:56.290]
And when that's true, we're dead.

[02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:59.870]
She made the movie a stupid man.

[02:47:01.210 --> 02:47:04.090]
He was drunk at cops and she'd take some daytime mass.

[02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:07.790]
She leaves her teeth right on the cat's life table.

[02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:09.610]
All of us are the kids.

[02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:11.310]
He's for what's said.

[02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:13.630]
The people are then his mother.

[02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:17.990]
But calling to his friends is no white man when the fans.

[02:47:18.670 --> 02:47:20.570]
The people are then his mother.

[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.970]
You're probably for this way.

[02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:24.970]
Anybody who was married to Bruce Willis is definitely tainted goods.

[02:47:25.890 --> 02:47:27.050]
It's all I can tell you.

[02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:29.810]
1137 votes on a poll.

[02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:31.530]
Van your 1200 by Van of the show.

[02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:32.230]
I'm pretty impressed.

[02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:33.750]
It takes a lot to impress this old queen.

[02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:36.010]
But nevertheless, that is really something.

[02:47:36.390 --> 02:47:36.770]
And you're right.

[02:47:36.910 --> 02:47:38.170]
I mean, it's definitely a free job.

[02:47:38.170 --> 02:47:38.930]
They're on sign tell.

[02:47:39.210 --> 02:47:39.610]
You think?

[02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:40.150]
Yeah.

[02:47:40.570 --> 02:47:41.430]
Why do you say that?

[02:47:41.610 --> 02:47:43.810]
Because I mean, yeah, it would be in the top 10.

[02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:45.450]
I think Tom Jicke is doing it.

[02:47:45.690 --> 02:47:46.210]
There you go.

[02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:47.990]
I think Jicke and his buddies over there,

[02:47:48.270 --> 02:47:50.410]
his racetrack pals, they do it over there to scum Sentinel.

[02:47:50.650 --> 02:47:51.290]
They're creeping it.

[02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:53.110]
Because they like, although Jicke were doing it,

[02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:54.130]
she is would be way up.

[02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:54.870]
They only got 31.

[02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:56.530]
It's nice, Johnny Carson.

[02:47:56.650 --> 02:47:57.890]
But 30, man.

[02:47:58.030 --> 02:48:00.550]
Anyway, you're like this to Ray from Federal Way, Washington.

[02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:02.170]
Don't make a federal case out of it.

[02:48:02.390 --> 02:48:03.290]
I have no idea where it is.

[02:48:03.390 --> 02:48:04.690]
And having never been in the Great Northwest,

[02:48:05.090 --> 02:48:06.730]
maybe when Josh comes back from Seattle,

[02:48:06.730 --> 02:48:07.930]
who give us the allow down.

[02:48:08.430 --> 02:48:09.470]
Have you ever been there before?

[02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:10.190]
No.

[02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:10.930]
Really?

[02:48:11.310 --> 02:48:13.470]
George Hans, he's been all over that to a neck of the woods.

[02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:13.930]
Just indeed.

[02:48:14.310 --> 02:48:15.990]
Cool to get into the great wonderful place.

[02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.490]
Yes, it is.

[02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:18.890]
Anyway, two high school boys followed Goldfish

[02:48:18.890 --> 02:48:19.930]
at a school assembly,

[02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:22.230]
and were punished for their stern talking too.

[02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:24.450]
In fact, they had a head, how were on the speakerphone?

[02:48:25.150 --> 02:48:27.010]
Animal rights activists said that's not enough.

[02:48:27.430 --> 02:48:29.110]
After learning about this stunt late last month,

[02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:31.030]
people for the ethical treatment of animals.

[02:48:31.290 --> 02:48:31.890]
Oh, no!

[02:48:32.170 --> 02:48:33.990]
Here we go again with those people.

[02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:34.470]
Teda.

[02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:35.370]
Oh, boy.

[02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:39.070]
Urged Federal Way Public Schools to adopt a district-wide policy

[02:48:39.070 --> 02:48:41.670]
prohibiting the use of animals in school functions.

[02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:43.870]
Oh, cracker, please.

[02:48:44.530 --> 02:48:47.050]
We feel certain you'll agree that killing fish in the name of school

[02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.510]
spirit is unacceptable, or Jennifer O'Connor,

[02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:51.870]
an official with the Norfolk Virginia based group.

[02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:54.130]
Well, guess what, honey?

[02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:54.930]
Norfolk you.

[02:48:55.450 --> 02:48:57.370]
School District's spokeswoman Diane Turner said

[02:48:57.370 --> 02:48:59.370]
the boys ate Goldfish on September 20th.

[02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:01.190]
Apparently, after processing the do-so,

[02:49:01.250 --> 02:49:03.050]
one of them got elected as a class officer.

[02:49:03.610 --> 02:49:06.270]
Turner said school officials liked to do boys on proper behavior

[02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:07.230]
and called their parents.

[02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:08.890]
They received no further discipline.

[02:49:09.370 --> 02:49:10.990]
These are good kids who made bad decisions,

[02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:13.050]
and Turner said what they did was not appropriate.

[02:49:13.130 --> 02:49:14.610]
We used as a teaching moment.

[02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:18.090]
So Peda has to stick their nose into the public school system

[02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:21.150]
in the state of Washington because some kids swallowed a goldfish.

[02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:25.610]
Oh, a lot of people eat fish all the time across this country.

[02:49:25.770 --> 02:49:26.010]
Yeah.

[02:49:26.010 --> 02:49:31.290]
And the world every day and chickens and geese and ducks

[02:49:31.290 --> 02:49:34.410]
and cows and all of these things.

[02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:35.210]
Like the low and pig.

[02:49:35.950 --> 02:49:37.530]
Most things, how does that brought worse?

[02:49:37.630 --> 02:49:39.330]
You get Gary Sarner one of them kosher brats?

[02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:40.430]
Extra cheesy.

[02:49:40.750 --> 02:49:42.630]
Extra cheesy kosher brad for Gary Sarner.

[02:49:42.890 --> 02:49:43.570]
It's cranky, Gary.

[02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:44.570]
You're going to rot in hell.

[02:49:45.690 --> 02:49:48.110]
Well, even without eating it, he'll still rot in hell.

[02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:50.270]
Investigators say here's a little follow-up.

[02:49:50.290 --> 02:49:52.170]
We like to keep you abreast.

[02:49:52.450 --> 02:49:55.990]
Lindsay Lohan, who is one of the most boring people ever to come down the plate.

[02:49:55.990 --> 02:50:00.490]
Like, this is why anybody cares about Lindsay Lohan just puzzles the hell out of me.

[02:50:01.290 --> 02:50:03.850]
Investigators say today they don't believe that somebody photographer

[02:50:03.850 --> 02:50:07.430]
has caused teenage actress Lindsay Lohan to crash her Mercedes into a delivery truck.

[02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:08.790]
It was not a factor.

[02:50:09.250 --> 02:50:10.230]
It didn't cause the action.

[02:50:10.390 --> 02:50:12.550]
So they're like county sheriff's deputy Scott Gage.

[02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:14.330]
Maybe she had to call herself on.

[02:50:14.430 --> 02:50:17.010]
Maybe it was the Bill O'Reilly factor that caused her to crash.

[02:50:17.230 --> 02:50:17.990]
Maybe it was a...

[02:50:18.610 --> 02:50:19.990]
Yeah, it could have been the O'Reilly factor.

[02:50:20.330 --> 02:50:21.170]
The hot sex factor.

[02:50:21.430 --> 02:50:23.510]
The agency's conclusion to have their statements

[02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:24.770]
made by Lohan's representative,

[02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:27.250]
it leaves the official cause of the accident yet to be determined.

[02:50:27.690 --> 02:50:30.530]
Within seconds of the crash, at least two photographers were stepping images

[02:50:30.530 --> 02:50:32.770]
of the expressed actress, witnesses be saying.

[02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:36.090]
He had said that the investigation has shown that the case may be a civil matter.

[02:50:36.430 --> 02:50:41.030]
He said the citation may be issued for violation of the California vehicle code and infraction.

[02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:43.330]
I may already tell you what the accident was.

[02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:47.310]
It was a very violent crash and witnessed Catherine's star 50 of New Orleans.

[02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:48.930]
It was such a loud impact.

[02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:49.970]
It was explosive.

[02:50:51.390 --> 02:50:56.310]
The airbags in Lohan's Mercedes deployed an actress and her friend opened their doors and ran to a nearby antique store.

[02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:59.250]
Ben's driver stumbled on the street, was helped by employees of the restaurant.

[02:50:59.250 --> 02:51:03.110]
Witnesses said the stretch of Robertson where the crash occurred is a Haunt for stars

[02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:05.030]
who are drawn to its boutique and eateries.

[02:51:06.130 --> 02:51:09.130]
The area also brought celebrity photographers open the snap, candids, photos.

[02:51:09.130 --> 02:51:13.190]
It was the same neighborhood four months ago that Lohan made headlines with a celebrity photographer

[02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:16.670]
when he ran his car into her car for she should have lots of accidents.

[02:51:16.970 --> 02:51:22.830]
That accident gave rise to a special investigative task force that prosecutes criminal cases against aggressive paparazzi.

[02:51:23.290 --> 02:51:28.050]
On May 31 police arrested Gala and Ramirez, 24-hours suspension of assault with a deadly weapon,

[02:51:28.390 --> 02:51:31.130]
and said Ramirez was attempting to photograph Lohan when the collision occurred.

[02:51:31.530 --> 02:51:36.130]
Several other paparazzi were on the scene almost immediately to photograph and videotaped a distressed Lohan.

[02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:41.990]
The crash prompted a new law that imposes steep financial penalties for paparazzi who committed assaults in their

[02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:47.130]
pursuit of celebrity photos. The measure which goes into a pectian everyone was signed on Friday by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegh.

[02:51:47.850 --> 02:51:50.550]
Now what would you rather be a paparazzi or a peasant or a Montenegro?

[02:51:50.550 --> 02:51:52.710]
I want to be a stalker rotsie. I can't remember.

[02:51:53.930 --> 02:51:55.710]
How about a peasant or a Montenegro of the Church?

[02:51:56.150 --> 02:52:00.270]
What's his name? He'll tell you.

[02:52:00.390 --> 02:52:03.230]
What's his name? He'll tell you.

[02:52:03.470 --> 02:52:06.110]
What's his name?

[02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:08.290]
I see the movie Misery with James Coynecanti-Bates.

[02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:10.170]
I don't know. I saw it.

[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:10.910]
Maybe it was Josh.

[02:52:11.270 --> 02:52:12.270]
Josh did you see Misery?

[02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:15.890]
I did not. He said he saw a network and that was Misery.

[02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:19.730]
So he said he doesn't like it. That's all. He just doesn't like it.

[02:52:19.730 --> 02:52:22.150]
At least he's being honest about it. He's not just sucking up just to be out.

[02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:25.750]
I told you what I liked about the movie and I told you what I didn't like.

[02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:29.130]
What's that? When Faye Dunhamay was on top of the world or on top of what you're holding?

[02:52:29.690 --> 02:52:33.010]
No. I liked the message. I agree with what the movie's about.

[02:52:33.490 --> 02:52:35.050]
It was just too long and pondry.

[02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:36.170]
It didn't keep my attention.

[02:52:37.470 --> 02:52:41.430]
What about the speech by Ned Vady when Howard Beall was sitting in the ICT boardroom?

[02:52:41.530 --> 02:52:44.470]
Ryan with Madness, hell! I don't think I can take this anymore.

[02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:45.930]
You didn't like that, Sam?

[02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:48.570]
I'm chosen to preach thisness to Bill.

[02:52:48.890 --> 02:52:49.470]
Why me?

[02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:51.390]
Because you're on television, dummy.

[02:52:52.130 --> 02:52:53.950]
Where do you get that? Do I know that?

[02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.450]
Yes, you do.

[02:52:54.790 --> 02:52:55.330]
Oh, no.

[02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:58.370]
Listen to me. Television is not the truth.

[02:52:58.370 --> 02:53:03.170]
So turn off your television sets. Turn them off right in the middle of the scene.

[02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:05.830]
I've chosen you.

[02:53:06.430 --> 02:53:06.790]
I chose you.

[02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.870]
I chose you.

[02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:08.070]
Why me?

[02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:10.270]
Because you're on television, dummy.

[02:53:10.590 --> 02:53:11.750]
Hey, don't get so about it, Ned.

[02:53:11.890 --> 02:53:12.650]
What do you think it's so exciting?

[02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:14.950]
Right, don't sense deliverance up there in the woods and entry.

[02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:15.770]
Entry?

[02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:18.350]
The Senate defied the White House yesterday.

[02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:21.170]
Well, I said to this Bushmeister, he's got a real tourist man.

[02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:22.070]
He don't even know what it means.

[02:53:23.090 --> 02:53:26.370]
The Senate defied the White House yesterday and voted to send new limits on interrogating

[02:53:26.370 --> 02:53:30.690]
detainees in Iraq and elsewhere, underscoring Congress's growing concerns about reports of abuse

[02:53:30.690 --> 02:53:33.410]
of suspected terrorists and others in military custody.

[02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:38.110]
46 Republicans joined 43 Democrats and won independent, emboldening to define and limit

[02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:41.430]
interrogation techniques that U.S. troops may use against terrorism suspects.

[02:53:41.610 --> 02:53:46.410]
The latest sign that alarm over treatment of prisoners in the Middle East and that Gitmo Bay, Cuba,

[02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:48.210]
is widespread in both parties.

[02:53:48.290 --> 02:53:49.370]
Aburgar Reb.

[02:53:49.530 --> 02:53:54.190]
The White House had fought to prevent the restrictions with Vice President Cheney visiting Cuba Republicans in July,

[02:53:54.190 --> 02:54:00.190]
and he scopes from yesterday repeating President Bush's threat to vetoed larger bill that language is now attached to a $140 billion

[02:54:01.010 --> 02:54:02.470]
military spending measure.

[02:54:02.830 --> 02:54:03.450]
How do you like that?

[02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:05.930]
Now, Bertha Gonzalez is going to be torturing A.J.

[02:54:06.210 --> 02:54:06.570]
Portramata.

[02:54:06.690 --> 02:54:06.970]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:10.050]
He wants to put him all in the old news.

[02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:14.630]
Okay, I think when we definitely do the break, because we're going to have close to 1200 votes today.

[02:54:14.910 --> 02:54:15.210]
Wow.

[02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:18.210]
And like I said, maybe like 20 or 30, it might even be real.

[02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:20.650]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:42.770]

Oh, I come from Prague, the Texas Queen, the guitar on my knee.

[02:55:30.490 --> 02:55:34.090]
While they died in the weeds, the Anna high-race cash for the POP.

[02:55:35.070 --> 02:55:36.450]
Oh, cut, enough.

[02:55:36.890 --> 02:55:38.430]
Don't put the blame on me.

[02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:41.850]
But I come from my vacation for a photo opportunity.

[02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:44.870]
Swain your partner round and round.

[02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:46.870]
Now, do a little swim into an Oral and stand.

[02:55:47.290 --> 02:55:48.450]
Swain to the left, to the right.

[02:55:48.610 --> 02:55:49.050]
Here we go.

[02:55:49.050 --> 02:55:50.290]
Swain a little more, job.

[02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:51.090]
No, see no.

[02:55:51.430 --> 02:55:52.750]
Oh, cut, enough.

[02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:54.670]
Why didn't those people flee?

[02:55:55.250 --> 02:55:57.170]
The person will leave the end of it.

[02:55:57.170 --> 02:55:58.430]
It gets more Iraqi.

[02:56:00.610 --> 02:56:01.730]
Oh, oh, oh, right.

[02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:05.630]
Okay, so the consensus is that Geldy's doing a phenomenal job.

And what about Al-Azino about hockey, anyway?

[02:56:12.810 --> 02:56:14.830]
Have you heard any Dutch hockey players except maybe?

[02:56:14.970 --> 02:56:15.610]
Well, he's not Dutch.

[02:56:15.890 --> 02:56:16.210]
