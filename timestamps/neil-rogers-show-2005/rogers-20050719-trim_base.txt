[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.560]
Music

[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.040]
Sounds like deals in the house.

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.360]
What?

[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.320]
That's not the thing.

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.540]
You should have been talking to Jack.

[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.440]
Good.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.440]
Thank God.

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.680]
I was talking about how miraculous it is.

[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.460]
The Internet, which was off the three days, miraculously is repaired 15 minutes before you come on the air.

[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.260]
The rest of us can't get it done.

[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.580]
It was the dump mysteer.

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.900]
It came in and waved his magic wand.

[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800]
You fell in all of a sudden by the beam.

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.000]
That's what he was wearing.

[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.540]
He was waving something around.

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.440]
Oh man.

[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.640]
What are we going to do about those Israelis by the way?

[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180]
I know that car is a car with that one.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.320]
I wasn't talking about that today.

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.580]
What about Israelis?

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.720]
I heard I had a fire report even though I said nothing to do with my thing.

[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.700]
Some of us shy isn't Israeli.

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.880]
You're a board off producer, whatever you want.

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.780]
He is Israeli extraction.

[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.800]
Well, how sad.

[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.960]
I had an experience with a group of Israelis that were so disgusting and loud and obnoxious and pushy and just, oh, many.

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300]
They're very aggressive people.

[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.800]
Aggressive my ass.

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.180]
Don't you know the old line that they were going to put in there for LL?

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.080]
Oi!

[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.300]
Visit Israel before it visits you.

[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.100]
Yeah, right.

[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.920]
Man, oh, man.

[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.540]
Pushy and just all over my back and all over, just disgusting.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.780]
I don't want to tell the whole story eventually.

[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.160]
I don't want to take up your valuable time with it.

[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.480]
What do you mean we're on your time now?

[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.160]
Oh, that's right.

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.500]
Like I said, I'll save it.

[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.540]
Yeah, thank God we got that fold fake.

[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.060]
I wasn't looking too promising.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.160]
I was thinking about going back to bed when I came into this morning about 820.

[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.160]
This place is good.

[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.920]
This place.

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.900]
Or accident-wing to happen.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420]
Four days with no internet.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.260]
Four.

[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.720]
Yep.

[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.020]
And I mean, you know, this part of this operation depends on the dissemination of news in a certain area.

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.720]
The dissemination of news?

[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.540]
What is that?

[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.900]
That's dark.

[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.140]
Was it a war of pull-up change?

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.920]
Oh, I see.

[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.840]
So I also understand we have a little problem with the direct TV too.

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.540]
I wonder if they haven't paid their grill on that thing.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.400]
Oh, that's out too.

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.720]
I do believe.

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.420]
I don't know.

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.460]
As long as they get that the Univision Weather Girl on, we're okay.

[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.200]
And then this week we got the hockey deal finally.

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.180]
I just forget about it already.

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.660]
We need to please all your hockey people.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.840]
I'm not forgetting that.

[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.580]
Wow, the thing is huge.

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.220]
You're not the only one on that.

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.660]
So I won't even, I was prepared to bring it up with you at some point, but don't.

[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.360]
You're not into it.

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.040]
It's not even waste our time on this.

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.360]
That's a good plan.

[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.080]
My time's over.

[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.440]
And it's just talk about getting led down to Garden Panth, man.

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.640]
Players are playing up 24% of the salary.

[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.180]
Really?

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.720]
Just, yeah.

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.560]
See, the whole thing is based on trying to keep alive a bunch of phonie franchises.

[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.560]
That's what sports become.

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.500]
So including the Florida panthons.

[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.800]
I think you could apply that to baseball.

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.500]
Yeah.

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.400]
There's franchises that have absolutely no reason to exist anymore.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.660]
Yep.

[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.400]
They don't have the money.

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.140]
They aren't growing people.

[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000]
The word Florida coming in.

[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.760]
Even like, you know, Buffalo, I'm on Pittsburgh.

[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.660]
Franchises have been around for a long time.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.080]
But they just, they can't support it.

[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.080]
They just, the markets are too small.

[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.560]
Yep.

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.300]
And I don't know.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.320]
I guess there was also the fact that they keep moving into Sun Valley areas.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.200]
Right.

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.500]
Where they're not supported.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.380]
Like Atlanta, where they fail the first time.

[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.580]
And they come back the second time.

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.820]
And like Nashville and like Florida and like Carolina.

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.440]
Nothing could be fine if into a get out of Carolina.

[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.900]
So the answer to all of this is add more franchises.

[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.480]
That's it.

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.320]
That's a great idea.

[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.940]
Instead of 31, I'd have 100.

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.340]
And then they all make the playoffs.

[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.740]
Yes.

[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.060]
Gotta get our Supreme Court justice appointee today.

[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.000]
Looks like this woman is what's her name?

[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.720]
I got to hear somewhere.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.420]
Let's see.

[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.860]
Her name is Edith Clement.

[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.100]
She's a US court of appeal judge in Nulleen.

[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.920]
And of course, it's been accelerated not because they want to cover up the Carl Robes.

[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.220]
That is why they've accelerated it.

[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.300]
Yeah, I thought he was going to take his time on this.

[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.820]
Yeah.

[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.560]
That's what they were saying on the right.

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.040]
I think Brian is urgent to get this on the agenda, right?

[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.260]

[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.800]
Now, Friday was going to take this time.

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.180]
And today it's or yesterday,

[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.720]
Oh, we got to do it right away.

[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.320]
Exactly.

[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.780]
But kind of a cover up.

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.140]
That's an ongoing thing in that.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.720]
Well, let's see.

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.460]
Deaf was telling me a week from the tomorrow.

[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.920]
Let's see.

[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.600]
Next Wednesday is the 27th.

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.080]
And there's the book comes out.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.740]
The spring book.

[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.500]
Oh, I'm really looking forward to that.

[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.820]
What does that mean?

[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.060]
Well, I have two, two else think.

[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.700]
Oh, trends.

[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.660]
Yeah.

[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.280]
Also, the odds are that you're doing for it.

[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.160]
I'm asking that all over.

[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.360]
Do for a shot, right?

[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.720]
Right.

[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.560]
Do for a good shot.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.040]
Well, see.

[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.040]
What do you want me to say?

[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.540]
What do you want me to say?

[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.340]
I don't want to say anything.

[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.020]
Whatever it will be.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.400]
That's the way it is.

[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.220]
Now, if you'd speak all the, uh,

[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.920]
speak an eponnie a little while,

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.400]
I'm going to show you.

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.280]
You'd go sit up there.

[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.320]
I would do what?

[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.380]
Speak it in the right language.

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.180]
I've showed it.

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.980]
Oh, I see.

[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.720]
You're sitting in Dave County right now.

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.360]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.000]
One thing here, man, they all speak English.

[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.620]
So I should move up there.

[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.520]
My numbers would go up.

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.540]
Even that is really group.

[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.180]
Oh, and actually, they were not speaking English.

[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.140]
They were talking in Hebrew.

[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.800]
And just, oh, man, I just, oh, can't even explain to you

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.140]
how obnoxious and disgusting.

[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.440]
And the woman, the reason that this all transpired

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.940]
was very early in the morning.

[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.880]
There were only two of us playing.

[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.160]
Me and this other very nice lady.

[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.060]
She just had a thousand bucks on the wheel.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.240]
And she's sitting there waiting to get paid.

[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760]
And only a muzzle club here comes this guy with his entourage.

[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.340]
Muscle club.

[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.360]
And she was very impressed by that because she was Jewish.

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.620]
So obviously she was easy.

[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.680]
Oh, are you Jewish?

[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.220]
I might have, but maybe I'll move.

[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.340]
But am I in there all Jewish?

[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.600]
And they're all, you know, I'm Jewish to the point of being obnoxious about it.

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.400]
And now they all sit down.

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.800]
And they're like putting on this disgusting act next to me.

[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.860]
The two machines to my left, which says nobody playing.

[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.720]
And they're not playing either.

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.100]
This sitting there, taking off space,

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.460]
empowering over my shoulder and her shoulder.

[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.020]
And the place is empty.

[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.860]
Finally, I leaned over to her and I said,

[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.020]
I can speak some words to them too, but not the word to you.

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.060]
No, are you Jewish too?

[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.100]
I said, yeah, but what does that have to do with being Israeli?

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.720]
So just say, talks of voice.

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.480]
And then she says, she says, oh, but they have to be very aggressive over there.

[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.200]
You know, they just have to, I said, what does that have?

[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.820]
See, this is the thing about ethnic, you know, they're all saying about birds of a feather flock together.

[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.480]
That's exactly correct.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.260]
So in other words, Cubans in Miami,

[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.280]
whether it's Jews from anywhere,

[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.460]
whether it's blacks with OJ and everything is a racial thing,

[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.840]
birds of a feather stick together and just makes me one of barbs.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.040]
Cub.

[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.540]
I said to her, I said, what's there, what does that have to do with the way you behave in public?

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.600]
The fact that they have to be aggressive.

[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.260]
First of all, they're not over there right now.

[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.760]
They're here.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.920]
Number one, and number two, that's just an excuse for a rude barbaric behavior.

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.880]
So I think of what I'm going to oversee a contest.

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.040]
The most obnoxious ethnic group, whether it's the Korean-flavored Indian crowd,

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.700]
whether it's the Russians who are also, or the old Italians,

[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.840]
also loud and obnoxious,

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.460]
or now the Israelis who have thrown their big hat into the ring.

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.460]
They threw their kippah into the ring.

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.740]
Is there any kind of Islamic population up there?

[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.460]
Are you kidding me?

[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.320]
Is there any kind of Islamic population?

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.980]
Holy!

[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.440]
Holy moly, man!

[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.320]
You never got the cab here?

[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.540]
Yeah, well, that's everywhere.

[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.580]
The cab drivers.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]
Well, believe me, we've got terrorists in waiting all over the place.

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.020]
And see that, that's the thing.

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.240]
That's why people are so stupid.

[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.980]
Like, we saw the pictures of these four guys in London, you know?

[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.420]
Yeah.

[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.140]
And there are even sitting people here who look just like that.

[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.220]
They look exactly like that, or like the 19 on the 9-11.

[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.820]
Now that crowd.

[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.040]
I mean, so how do you know by looking at somebody, right?

[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.900]
Of course, the British were there bringing intelligence over there.

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.660]
They said, oh, yeah, we looked at the one guy, and he said it wasn't worth pursuing.

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.160]
And then they lowered the terror alert in June.

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.400]
Tell me where to be right on top of it.

[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.540]
When you get on an airplane today,

[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.780]
do you guys take a look at the people who are getting on the plane?

[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.280]
Not anymore.

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.800]
And I would say for about a year after 9-11, for about a year,

[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:27.080]
I looked very with three raised eyebrows at all of the people I would survey each one of them.

[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.780]
And think to myself, oh, that looks like a terrorist to me.

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.300]
I still have a tendency to do that.

[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.840]
You know, I travel so much, you know, I get on my mind.

[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.740]
I'm watching these people, you know what I'm saying?

[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.400]
Well, can I handle this guy?

[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:40.820]
Yeah.

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.280]
I'm done.

[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.740]
I'm finished.

[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.340]
Not if he looks like Ronald Martinez.

[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.440]
Oh, no.

[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.980]
But he doesn't look like a terrorist.

[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.160]
He just looks like a thug.

[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:50.780]
Yeah.

[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.740]
Well, thugs are in in Hylia.

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.740]
Well, what's happening?

[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.300]
I wouldn't know.

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.540]
I haven't been to Hylia.

[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.180]
There are two places I haven't been to in several years.

[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.140]
I haven't been to Hylia since that incident with Rauou.

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.980]
And I also haven't been south of Carl Gable since Andrew.

[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.120]
That's a good idea.

[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.520]
Oh, no.

[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.040]
What's happening with a slot thing, in closing, before we run into my first break there?

[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.140]
What's happening with the slots?

[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.120]
There's nothing recent.

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.460]
There's no new way out.

[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.920]
How is that possible?

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.420]
It's the 20th of July tomorrow.

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.720]
I haven't seen the word or heard a word about it.

[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.460]
So I keep scouring the internet to see if I can find anything.

[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:30.960]
I've been there.

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.160]
I've been scouring the internet here.

[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.240]
It's been down a little less.

[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.280]
Now, I'm gonna see on the back.

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.260]
So now you got it back.

[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.460]
Just leave it to me.

[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.860]
It's all you.

[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:39.980]
Pass, okay.

[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.620]
Stop wading your magic wand.

[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.080]
Yeah.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.220]
Just like that.

[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.740]
There it is.

[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.560]
And the wand, too.

[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.200]
Right.

[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.020]
Well, listen, that's Tuesday.

[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.780]
So you probably have a pretty good assortment of places you can plunge your guts on Tuesday.

[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.680]
No, I'm plungey.

[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.320]
My guts on a new television today.

[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.600]
What is that?

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.520]
Oh, you're buying a new TV?

[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:57.860]
Yeah.

[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.300]
What kind?

[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.200]
Uh, I'm gonna get...

[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.540]
EG, of course.

[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.120]
Hey, yes, definitely HD.

[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:09.120]
The guy's coming over from Sound Advice to make sure I get something that fits the...

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.740]
Well, what brand?

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.940]
I'm not talking about the size.

[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.600]
What brand?

[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.280]
It's Samsung.

[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.020]
Oh, uh, Mitsubishi.

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.780]
Oh.

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.200]
And what time is this going to start?

[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.480]
Well, actually I'm looking at two.

[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.620]
I'm looking at a Mitsubishi.

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.420]
And I'm looking at the Sony.

[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.100]
Uh, let me just...

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.060]
Oh, the Sony is, uh, it's not HD.

[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.260]
What do they call the Sony thing?

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.920]
Uh, yeah, but I want...

[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.900]
I told them I want HD.

[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.960]
What do they call that, George?

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.080]
I don't know.

[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:35.740]
Bill.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.260]
Yeah, you do.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.000]
Bill.

[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.600]
Fill it off your park at 1225, called it at 1254, Eerie.

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.920]
Collotto, you know what?

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.480]
Perimetto's Mountain Near Park.

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.700]
Harness racing from Mohawk at 720, George and Downs in Australia, 10 tonight.

[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.600]
Let me tell you something.

[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.360]
I have a weapon in my pocket, okay?

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:52.940]
Really?

[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.320]
Yes.

[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.160]
I have it.

[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.780]
I have it.

[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.260]
I have it.

[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.140]
I have it.

[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.140]
You hear the one.

[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.400]
Anyway, I have a ticket from Sunday.

[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.560]
From Hollywood, I left early.

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.320]
And I hit the late pit tree there for four digits.

[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.460]
Really?

[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:08.780]
Yeah.

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.860]
So it's a signer.

[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.280]
And so when I go back to the side...

[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.400]
It's not going to be finer than the cash in a big signer.

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.660]
Yeah, but I'm going to wait for Saturday.

[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.560]
I'm not going out there during the week.

[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.220]
Did I mention you do not ever go...

[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.140]
I think I originally touted you to go there.

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.040]
Don't ever go to Fallsview Casino and I will find you.

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.140]
Yeah, you told me about it.

[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.300]
Don't tell me about it.

[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:26.940]
Clip joint.

[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.360]
Yep.

[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.880]
Did they respond to you?

[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.740]
You wrote to them, didn't you?

[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.620]
Yeah, they called.

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.360]
She called me twice and we love to have you come back.

[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.900]
And even if you don't want to gamble, we'd like to count the room into meals.

[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.000]
And I feel so bad.

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.380]
Now why would I go slip all the way to Niagara Falls to see water fishing over a bunch of rocks again?

[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.320]
I'm going to see them in a million times.

[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.260]
You know, what's to see at once?

[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.280]
It's very nice to see.

[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.780]
And that's it.

[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.120]
You know, what do I need to see that?

[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.580]
So go back there for free meals.

[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.900]
They did so.

[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:52.640]
They did so.

[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.520]
They did so.

[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.260]
They called me twice.

[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.920]
Good for them.

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.440]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.720]
Scrum.

[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.860]
Listen, and send it back to Israel, by the way.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.400]
Oh, brother, those are Israelis.

[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.460]
I'm telling you right now.

[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.200]
It's enough to make me stand up for the PL.

[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.560]
Oh!

[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.940]
Have a great day.

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.520]
Don't lose them.

[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.980]
Like, in the Samsung, give it a think about it.

[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.960]
I looked at the Samsung.

[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.020]
Oh, boy.

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.720]
Happy to.

[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.640]
We love the crew.

[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.060]
It's a great set, man.

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.640]
I'll tell you.

[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.900]
When you watch your...

[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.400]
Now, this is your first HD set?

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.860]
Yes.

[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.020]
When you watch a live sporting event on HDTV, man, it's just...

[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.440]
It's a different experience.

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.180]
It's breathtaking.

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.040]
Yeah, that's what I'm looking forward to.

[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.540]
And, as a matter of fact, and I see you...

[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.700]
The problem is, you won't be home.

[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.100]
Because you're going to be our cover-in-a-games,

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.220]
but like a football game.

[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.100]
I mean, hockey is fantastic, and baseball is amazing,

[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.320]
but an NFL game in HD is just unbelievable.

[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.260]
If I can watch the opening Thursday night game on it.

[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:44.900]
There you go.

[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.700]
That's the whole idea.

[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.660]
If I watch the Patriots on it, I'm going to wait another Super Bowl.

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.900]
Seven and a half over the Raiders, the first game.

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.900]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.600]
Lions already lost their hand.

[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.020]
The Lions are already lost.

[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.800]
I think we lost those Dolphin Whites just in time, by the way.

[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.360]
I'm not going to knock your friend Jimmy Cipolis again

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.020]
because I put you in a bad position, but...

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.980]
I still... I'm still pissed off about that, because it's so outrageous.

[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.360]
It's so degrading.

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.940]
The whole thing is lying in Friday's...

[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.820]
Oh, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's nothing but a...

[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.700]
And I know, he's not a one of your buddies.

[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.080]
I guess you have to ask about this one line that he had inside Friday's paper.

[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.840]
Did you see it?

[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.780]
I saw the line about the TV guy, which wall is it about?

[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.880]
He wrote the now that they've added Matt Moore to the...

[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.600]
Oh, that's it.

[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.580]
So now they have Matt Moore, Jimmy Cephalo, and Joe Rose.

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.140]
Right.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.960]
And he said...

[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.680]
He said, all they're missing is a play by play guy.

[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.660]
Was that what he said?

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:44.980]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.480]
Well, it's about Tommy Roodle line.

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.760]
Hey, starting your a tub of crap, man.

[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.100]
And by the way, quick play, and what's that 760 in Palm Beach that he's all whipped up about?

[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.020]
Got me.

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.300]
That was the week you go Friday, Roodle column.

[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.680]
Oh, I was out of town.

[00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.180]
I was out of town.

[00:13:59.180 --> 00:13:59.740]
Oh, man.

[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.200]
Just go back into another, you got the internet spec.

[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.180]
Go back and do a search on that thing on Sony.

[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.520]
We do week you go Friday's calling.

[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.120]
He wrote about...

[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.780]
Oh, that guy.

[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.780]
The best afternoon sports in South Florida is on 760 and West Palm and this guy's this guy.

[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.460]
I mean, I'm going to figure something.

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.680]
But this respect that our people get in these newspapers.

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.800]
Now that they take Catherine Harris, very jackass and Jim Cerny and put them all in a very

[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.940]
tricky small plane.

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.000]
Maybe the one at JFK Jr. was a sort of flying.

[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.800]
God, why was you put Jim Sarny in there?

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.180]
Why not?

[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.460]
He's the antichrist.

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:36.760]
Oh.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.040]
He's a suck up.

[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.280]
Okay.

[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.200]
Jim is Jimmy's syphilist, all your buddies.

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.420]
And Jimmy the Greek, too, even though he's still dead.

[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.240]
Have a great day and pick the Samsung.

[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:48.940]
Trust me.

[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.620]
I'll see you.

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.060]
Bye.

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.400]
I can't endure.

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.320]

That's right and like he said that just this morning he's gonna change you in every day

[01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.780]
First of all if anybody like you know

[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.740]
Bleed the name then they were gonna be out and they said if anybody committed a crime now

[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.180]
He said this morning if they murdered at least five people

[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.140]
Then they're gonna be out and he'll think about it right by the way

[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.080]
Do you want this seven page facts about actors who served in the military and those who didn't?

[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.080]
No, why do I care about that?

[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.260]
Well, why is that of any interest?

[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.140]
That's what happens when I get it to go to the bathroom. I can't can't know is this include actors who served in the military

[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:27.520]
Like I went over there and made like their propaganda movies like John Wayne don't add them to the marine

[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.580]
How do you like them? Well good for him get smart Don

[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:35.740]
Now here's the facts that says since I'm a little bit. I realized that that top-of-business was gonna be even more than

[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.780]
No idea business no, but big

[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.500]
Cosmo top-of-the-oe-o-carreo

[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.760]
Pantro from the Cisco kid was real career. We know that the Cisco kid though, which we did not know was dumping Ronaldo

[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:51.860]
That brings back some memories. See school poncho. Thank God that TV doesn't stereo type minorities, you know

[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.160]
I

[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.120]
Know that's your favorite TV thing so I crank it up

[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.820]
probably

[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:04.960]
You know you had your aim as an Andy and then of course you got this now queer queer eye for the

[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:12.340]
Frag guy and all these other horror all these screaming mincing. Oh god. You think I watch those? Oh no

[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.840]
Well, you know this folk they wouldn't put a show on called queer right for the straight guy then have a couple of

[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.820]
You know none queer acting guys. Oh, I see what would be the point? Let's see. What was the movie?

[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.060]
I'm trying to think who's that great actor see

[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.660]
I can't think of who he is either face of all birds no

[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.240]
But in the same category great actor who played in some a fag movie

[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.920]
And anyway, I always the boys in a band the real straight looking one. I can't think of his name right now

[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.700]
What a shame look up boys in a band again. Maybe a cast please Josh it with it. Let him get that on it

[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.460]
The dog of St. Bernard was named Neil on top of it

[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.800]
Forget that one. I just remember when the guy told me two minutes ago my birthday too

[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:55.360]
That's why I played the birthday thing and he regulations to multiply them. He's the birthday boy. Okay. Here's what we got so far four hundred and thirty eight people have

[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.560]
done our survey thing our little sex survey

[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.640]
You don't have to lie because they're not tracing these all of them. Maybe they are

[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.480]
Which of these applies to you? I'm a 100% heterosexual male

[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.080]
No, yes, furances yet

[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.860]
265 I couldn't relate my horror house 50

[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.960]
I'm a heterosexual male who's had at least one sexual experience with a male 50

[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.160]
I'm a heterosexual female no gay experiences 12

[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.040]
I'm really a bisexual male do you believe us oh really 12

[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.060]
I'm a gay male who's had sex with a woman nine. I'm a gay male never had sex with a woman six

[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.160]
So let's see three point three percent of the audience is uh gay. How do you like that? Do you believe that?

[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.680]
I thought it was like 10% when you took this before

[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.340]
I'm a lesbian is that they're all going now. I missed a beat of firton

[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.120]
I'm a lesbian who's had sex with the five just as you said that I'm really

[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.900]
One I have to interrupt because I just threw away another fact from spending about the beat of firton being done to bed

[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:55.800]
I'm really a bisexual female five. I'm a lesbian never had sex with a man four and I'm a heterosexual female who has had lesbian sex for

[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.880]
So let's see you take your your dikes. I mean

[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:06.260]
2% and what we got three point so five about five percent of the audience is gay. How do you like that?

[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.620]
Contrary to popular rumour

[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.640]
Certain people like to spread

[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.120]
Certain trained monkeys like to spread

[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.920]
Don't don't don't

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.420]
You're not getting to my pile here at all

[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.620]
We've been ashamed of that to carry these over for Thursday

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:26.720]
Top AIDS to President Bush and vice president Dick Cheney were intensely focused on discrediting former ambassador Joseph C Wilson

[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.780]
And they's after he wrote that op-ed article for New York Times suggesting the administration manipulated intelligence

[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:37.160]
To justify going to war in Iraq federal investigation has been told and of course that was the thing smear and smear

[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:43.580]
Whether it was Richard Clark whether it was Scott Ritter whether it was Hans Blitz whether it was Paul O'Neal or whether of course

[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.400]
It was Joe Wilson smear and smear

[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.920]
Prosecutors investigating whether administration officials illegally leaked the identity of Wilson's wife the CIA officer

[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.660]
Would have worked undercover have been told that Bush's top political strategist Carl Rove and Cheney's keep the staff

[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:04.080]
Lewis Scooter Libby was specially intent on undercutting Wilson's credibility according to people familiar with the inquiry

[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.520]
Although remember I told her this is just the beginning and they can try to cover it up right now

[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.300]
But meanwhile the grand jury is still doing their thing. I'm holding my breath

[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.780]
Although lower level White House staffers typically handled most contacts with the media

[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:20.140]
Rove and Libby began personally communicating with reporters about Wilson prosecutors were told

[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.040]
Assurge directly familiar with information provided two prosecutors said

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.960]
Rove's interest was so strong that it prompted questions in the White House

[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.260]
When I asked at one point why he was pursuing the diplomats so aggressively

[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:34.000]
Rove reportedly responded he's a Democrat

[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.380]
Rove then cited Wilson's campaign donations which leaned toward Democrats the person from into the case said

[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.700]
So here you go when did that cheer him out

[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.800]
And the media man the CNN I'm gonna say it again for the 80 minute time they need to be taken right off the air

[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.960]
When did that take them out CNN take off the tower take off the satellite

[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.500]
They put such garbage on they had some bimbo on there yesterday who was

[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.900]
Supporcially having a debate or discussion

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:06.160]
About Scott McClellan about the older questions from the media about curl rope. She had a summer public an operative on there from the RNC

[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.980]
And then she had Jack Valendi on there, you know the screenwriters of the Hollywood guy, okay

[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:18.280]
It was just the same the same thing is the other guy while you know press secretaries always have to like be loyal to their president

[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.020]
And it's a tough job

[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.280]
It was just pathetic

[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.800]
It was just pathetic

[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:33.560]
Bubblehead bimbo is asking the really tough questions on CNN MSNBC MSNBC now they got revolving bimbo's some of no look too bad

[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.600]
But that really that's the new deal now let the guy bother. Oh, you don't even know who lester hold is so what tell you know who

[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:47.040]
I just I'm shocked by that. I don't watch it. You know who Chris Matthews is okay? Maybe who talks out of the side of his mouth

[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.640]
Oh that guy yeah, and you know who Joe Starbroy is from a Florida congressman right when

[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.720]
Real remember the personality like a dead man. I guess if I sell it

[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.900]
You can't complain about the personality on MSNBC because they don't have them and then they got Ronnie Wagen Jr

[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.680]
Hey Ronnie too fairy that little a screamer

[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:09.340]
It's a pretty sad we could put our own news never come and put some pro interesting people on, you know

[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:10.940]
but

[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.260]
Talk to Greg about it's because I know we're very news intensive on QA

[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.800]
20 since past 11. Oh before we do the break

[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:25.840]
It's been a crawl row just a quarter of Americans think the White House is fully cooperating with the federal investigation of that leak of

[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:31.420]
Valerie planes name a number that's declined sharply since the investigation began and three quarters

[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:38.560]
75% say that a presidential advisor crawl row was responsible for leaking class of that information. It should cost him his job

[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.020]
There's nothing worse than a bad leak

[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:49.620]
It's kind of like when it burns you know it burns skepticism about the administration's cooperation is jump as the initial investigation began and said oh

[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:56.640]
And I forgot to mention something a handkerchief mind me Thursday morning a magical word. You know what the word is for blood sugar? I get a cinnamon

[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.960]
Or a cinnamon yeah, let's say cinnamon they were closed

[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:09.920]
Mm-hmm, but not don't put sugar on it though. Well, that makes it best skepticism about the administration's cooperation is jump as the initial investigation began in September

[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:17.220]
2003 nearly half the public 47% believe the White House was fully cooperating that felt a 39% a few weeks later and now

[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:23.060]
Lower still only 25% who also want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge and some property in the Everglades real chief

[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:29.480]
They believe that the cooperating as opposed to covering up stonewalling up this skating lying through their teeth

[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.580]
Etc. All of these things

[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.420]
27 past 11 and five 60

[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.780]
WQM probably be good idea if I did the right spot

[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:43.880]
Yeah, well, I guess a whip talk about this crap especially have only these two days a week to iracculate

[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.580]

[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:32.780]

[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:32.980]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.680]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.520]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.880]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.360]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:41.700]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:50.900]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.000]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.740]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.200]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.640]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.400]
They're supposed to put the gun in the floor.

[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.080]
나와."

[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:07.580]
나와 Fight!

[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:07.860]
나와 Fight!

[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.740]
The poison brings him to普's eyebrows.

[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:12.840]
The poison brings him to普's eyebrows.

[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.600]
Their wife called love.

[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.360]
My wife called love.

[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.960]
That's because there's no violence in there.

[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.620]
That's all for his wife.

[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.840]
That's because I never did every one I got.

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.100]
People always say,

[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:24.520]
story,

[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.160]
No joy today, man. We got the guilty for maybe gully into a couple of

[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.200]
the boys today. It's just a ton of dollars from them for between two and full.

[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.020]
What do you think? All right, I'm gonna come on. Gully were requesting a few

[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.380]
boys. Anyway, oh, here's that story. I finally had a check of writers. I scoured

[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.720]
the internet and I finally found this story and we saw it on CNN but they didn't

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.580]
feel it was important enough to put on their website or to even buy the repeating.

[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.020]
Gunman shot dead three suini Arab members of the team drafting a

[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.260]
reaction to constitution today, striking a blow against the body scene as the

[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.580]
best hope for providing a political end to the insurgency.

[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.040]
Drawing suini Arabs on to the committee do deliver a new constitution of

[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.780]
August 15th was the chorus tone of the U.S. Act's strategy of persuading

[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.940]
members of the arrested minority to move off the streets and into peaceful

[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:21.860]
polymers but three of them now. The fish is mortal, man. Oh, speaking of

[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.700]
death, this here's the most important story. It's a damn good thing you're

[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:29.160]
going back into my pile. Okay, this may be the most important story and be a

[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:35.160]
good idea for a poll question someday. All right. Did you look up boys in the band

[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.040]
by the way? Yeah, in the cast. Yeah, which one you want. I don't know who they

[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.780]
were. How about Frederick Holmes? No. How about Leonard Frey? No. How about

[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:51.160]
Cliff Gorman? No. How about Kenneth Nelson? No. Maud Adams? No. Ruben Green? No.

[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:59.120]
Robert Lattornix? No. That's the great. Lawrence Lockingdale? No. Keith

[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.720]
French. Maybe the one thinking I wasn't in that movie. We only got one more

[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.580]
Peter White. No. No. No. What's in that movie? What's another gay movie? I

[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:13.540]
guess. And the idol, it'll come back to me. Firm tied to freezing Ted Williams

[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.820]
head to open and boitten beach. This is the most important story and it would

[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.780]
lead to a great poll for you to take some day. Whose head would you like to think

[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:25.340]
we ought to freeze? That's good. Not a good poll idea? Yeah. A company

[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.420]
associated with the Arizona firm that froze the head of baseball legend

[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:34.880]
Ted Williams plans to open a crash facility in Boiton Beach. Oh God. Talk about

[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:42.120]
the petrified forest. Point and beach. Oh. Suspended animation. That's the name of

[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.040]
the outfit. Expect to open in August. The facility was approved for one by

[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.020]
Boiton Beach commissioners in March after being repeatedly rejected by

[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:55.000]
vocal officials. Plus. That's the movie is if there's Bellalagosi in it. Where

[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.620]
they have. No, I don't think so. Where they hate he saves the woman gets killed

[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:03.320]
as well. It's killed in the car crash and he saves her head. Oh. What's the

[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.680]
thing? You see that? Have it's yet the head that wouldn't die or something. Yeah.

[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.420]
Something like that and then her head is alive. He's got the. The tubes that

[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.280]
going into with the blood is flowing. Her head is like a Vincent price. No. I

[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.020]
saw just a couple of school. Okay. It is really bad. It's one of those grades.

[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.080]
You movies, but it's camp. It's fun. You know, I love that. It's something like having

[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.440]
your head on a table. And she's seen an eye and got nobody which is kind of cute.

[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:33.700]
I was thinking on TV shows. This one all excuse you maybe I'll check the

[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.300]
deck. They come to the first season.

[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.080]
This is more. It's not a set of file.

[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:55.320]
If you pick it onvertward again, that's the word I was thinking of a lot. Anyway,

[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.180]
the facility was approved for one after being repeatedly rejected by Boko.

[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.200]
First of all, the boy in B said, here we got plenty of dead heads here. Why not?

[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.560]
The company's manager used to work for our core life extension foundation with

[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.240]
reportedly severed Williams head. Oh God. Is that enough to make me want to play

[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:18.160]
that severed head bit or what? Oh my God. It's a severed head. Yes, severed head.

[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:22.460]
The new fabric sweeping animation. Everyone who's anyone has got a severed head.

[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.740]
And if you think it's not for you, then just listen to this drama-pods version of an

[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:31.880]
actual letter sent to us by a satisfied severed head customer. Okay, that makes $623 for all

[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:39.000]
your Halloween candies. $623. Isn't that a lot for a bag of candy? Well, it's our finest

[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.960]
mixture. You two get the caramel corn balls, the tapioca sugar daddy's and the two spilled

[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.060]
wax pump gifts. Well, I guess it isn't good deal. It's severed head in the middle of

[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.320]
the Zangnut bar. Sweet for geez. I'm so sorry. Please let me give you all this

[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.740]
Halloween candy for free. You better. Yes, a severed head is your ticket to thousands

[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.980]
of millions in freebies worldwide. So pick up yours today and remember if it's not dead,

[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.800]
it's not severed head. The company came to use to work for our core life extension foundation,

[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.460]
which reportedly severed Williams head and stored the body parts in a steel bin in Arizona

[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:20.440]
after we died in July 2002. Cryonix supporters claim that future scientific breakthroughs

[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.580]
will allow doctors to bring frozen dead bodies back to life, but more scientists contend

[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:29.440]
that it's highly unlikely and will happen anytime soon. It's out of the question the

[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.280]
foreseeable future said, Mehmet Tone, who are a Harvard biomedical engineer, who's

[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.800]
now-and-that was hysterical when Hank asked me this morning, do we have any Muslims

[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:44.440]
here? Oh, God! We got more ragheads here than you can shape your thing out.

[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.620]
You can shape your magic wand at, though. We can't even freeze and revive individual organs,

[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.880]
let alone freeze a whole human being, said Mr. Toner, where about the feeding morality

[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.000]
said Charles Platte 68 mortality and mortality. Said Charles Platte, a science fiction

[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.780]
writer with no medical background who will manage the lab, type was out course, keep operating

[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:07.260]
orificer. The soft-flutter laboratory primarily acts as a processing facility of freeze-dead

[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.480]
bodies, Platte said it will not store bodies. There's just going to be freezing.

[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.300]
We're freezing over here. Isn't that great? Lovely. I still think that's a good poll

[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:21.760]
idea. Whose head would we have frozen so we can bring them back sometime? And then

[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.500]
of course they'll all say, oh me? Yeah. You? No, I don't think so. No, not me, me, but

[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:33.240]
me isn't them. 560-705-60, pound 5-60. We're not going to make our thousand things

[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:38.760]
on here today, John, not even a chance. Just slow it under a crawl. 488, that's not so

[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.720]
great. We need to get to like about 600 by noon and have a shot. Don't you think?

[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.720]
Maybe. Which of these applies to you? 491. I'm 100% heterosexual male, no gay experience

[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:54.820]
297. Over 60%. I'm a heterosexual male who has had at least one sexual experience with

[01:21:54.820 --> 01:22:01.360]
a male 65. With a male man. I couldn't get laid in the warehouse 54. I'm a heterosexual

[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:06.080]
female, no gay experience 26. I'm really a bisexual male even though George doesn't

[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.460]
believe in 13. I'm a gay male who has had sex with a male. I don't want to love a

[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:14.020]
male. Just relax. I'm a gay male. Never had sex with a woman 7. So what does that

[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.100]
like for a few years, 0.6% gay men? I'm a lesbian who's had sex with a man 5. I'm

[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.740]
really a bisexual female 5. I'm a lesbian, never had sex with a man 4. And I'm a heterosexual

[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:28.680]
female who has had lesbian sex 4. Got to just get complicated or what? And I can't even

[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:34.060]
keep track. He had diaphragm. It's that number two that I don't believe. Number two,

[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:38.160]
I'm a heterosexual male. Guess what? We don't care.

[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.120]
When it comes to a gay man, he's new blood, he's new blood, he's new blood.

[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.860]
He's a gay man.

[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.080]
Our Snoop Dogg, that's what I'm here to talk about me and the Disney. Let's go to some

[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:56.840]
calls. New Orleans, Louisiana, hello. Do you know how to roll a bun? Oh, definitely.

[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.660]
That's cool. Do you go to come to that night? That's got meetings and since I had a

[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:09.040]
trip, I'll have you back. Overland Park, Kansas, hello. Hey, can you come to know a

[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:15.760]
lady for a quarter pound of COEAT? I'm down to do that. I need to get some money from

[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.100]
you. I'm even the parking lot after the show. And then we're roll from there.

[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:26.080]
Hey, Stargay, the bomb. Las Vegas, hello. I noticed you've been following that joint

[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.880]
night. Take a hit already. Exactly.

[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:41.540]
That's the proper way. Thank you. Thank you for having me, Larry. It's 1145. I didn't know Larry

[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.960]
had him. And how hard work by the way is the actor I was thinking about. I had a

[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.520]
lucid moment there during the break. How hard work? Okay. And the movie was a TV movie,

[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.040]
a certain summer 1972 with him, sure, or as you'd think about the young man whose father

[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.960]
comes turns out to be. And of course, how hard work is about a straight looking and acting

[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:02.160]
as anybody. And how about Michael Ankeen, right? Making love, remember that movie with the

[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:08.260]
Janet Jackson, with Janet Jackson, and Kate Jackson too? I remember that. Yes, I do. Michael Ankeen.

[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.800]
Harry, I was trying to look at that in the end. I beg your pardon? Wasn't Harry Hamlin

[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.980]
with that movie? Harry Hamlin, sure. She looked awfully, ever since then, I was starting

[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:18.740]
Harry Hamlin with when he got married to Nicolay Sheridan, which didn't last forever,

[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.060]
but nevertheless I thought, oh, sure, right. There's also that Greek movie. Really?

[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.100]
I didn't know he was into. Yeah, a clash with the Titans.

[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:33.120]
How the whole book, who is always considered, in fact, isn't a timely because he played

[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.500]
D-Tro in all the Presidents men. Huh. See how all of these things kind of wake up

[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.400]
like a big jigsaw puzzle? And I'm trying to figure the movie out. I guess it was in fame,

[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.320]
where Lee Roy's girlfriend had a big ass, you know, a bitch who's rare,

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.940]
little tights, bobo. What is it about black women and big, sloppy asses? You know, what is that?

[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.780]
Genetics. Never thought that is? Sure. No, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.960]
What is that? I'm talking about a big old ass. I'm not talking about a big old ass.

[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.520]
A big old ass. Like a lot of you who is like, I'm talking about a sloppy big old ass.

[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.920]
Huh? Cornbread. Corn home?

[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.240]
Hi, ranking security and intelligence officials. Oh,

[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.780]
we're having a movie out.

[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.720]
Hi, ranking security and intelligence officials warned in the weeks before the London

[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.000]
bombings that the war in Iraq had increased. The risk of terrorism in Britain. It was reported

[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.680]
that it had increased the war in Iraq, okay? Are you following this boys and girls? I don't

[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.680]
understand how that could work. A report by the joint terrorist amalization center,

[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:45.900]
which includes officials from MI5, MI6, GCHQ, NGLX, and all these others, and the police

[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.020]
explicitly linked US to let involvement in Iraq with terrorist activity in the UK,

[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.380]
although it concluded that no group currently had the intent to keep a bill of demand

[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.220]
of the attack the New York Times said, which of course did that turn out to be right?

[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.080]
Events in Iraq are continuing to warrant this motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist

[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.460]
related activity in the UK. The report, a copy which was leaked to the paper by a foreign

[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.660]
intelligence agency BCAN. The legal embarrassed Prime Minister Tony Blair and other ministers who

[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:16.400]
yesterday, bluntly rejected a think tank reports conclusion that the Iraq conflict had increased

[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.260]
the terror threat to the UK. It doesn't take a genius to finger that out. We don't need to bring

[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:25.460]
back Shiloh Comes. Both Downing Street and the Foreign Office refuse to comment on today's claims.

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.980]
We do not comment on leaked documents that Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:34.180]
A foreign office spokesman added, we do not comment on alleged leaks, whatever they are. I remember

[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.020]
what I said before, nothing worse than a bad leak. The New York Times reported that the secret

[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.880]
J-PAC report was sent to British government agencies and foreign governments in mid-June

[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.340]
had said, in mid-June, at present there is not a group with both the current intent and the

[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.340]
capability to attack the UK. The J-PAC report was written about three weeks before,

[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.180]
four suicide bombers launched attacks on three London tomb trains,

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.380]
QPE and a bus currently 56. The report prompted the government to lower its formal

[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.320]
threat assessment by one level from severe defiance as substantial as reported by the Guardian

[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.760]
on the day after the July 7th attacks. Security officials insisted that I'm creating a threat level

[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.880]
without a perfective response to the police and emergency services through the blast. How do you

[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:22.500]
like that? They are so out to lunch, man. They're just, uh, listening. I don't understand how

[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:28.360]
attacking people, you know, increase as a threat. How about you, Farton?

[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:32.120]
Well, you tax someone. How come they don't, you know, just love you after that?

[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.620]
How I see you, how I see you. Yeah, like I said, it takes Charlotte Holmes and Dr. Watson to figure

[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.040]
that one out. And maybe Miss Marple threw her ass in there. Leo Carillo. Carroyo.

[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:46.460]
A group called Floridians for a stem cell research in Cures launched a California style initiative

[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.220]
yesterday. I'm sure you talk about this at length. Oh, yeah, yeah. When its leaders pledging to

[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:55.740]
seek taxpayer money, not only for research on embryos, but also for therapeutic cloning.

[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.780]
The group is starting a statewide campaign to raise one and a half million dollars at

[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.260]
Fonda Bert-Erenson, a Palm Beach County commissioner. The money would be used to collect these

[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:09.380]
six under 11,000 signatures needed to put the constitutional amendment before voters in the

[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:15.200]
September 2006, uh, Goober, an interior primary. I still have to go, boy, just see if they make

[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.600]
it a constitutional amendment. And then these fat ass right winners like Jeff Bush can't say,

[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.660]
oh, no, can't do that. See that? I see it. I mean, is there any doubt about it?

[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:31.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60, calm 5 60, they've risen in singular wireless lines. Any minute now,

[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.240]
we're going to get the name of that to Nusapin Courthierge appointee. What did I do?

[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:39.600]
I already tossed that. I tossed it because I read it on when Hank and I were doing the crossover.

[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:44.100]
When we did our 45 minute crossover, I guess he did some abroad, some circuit court judge from

[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:50.980]
Nalines, who is a okay with Roe v Wade. But if they were pissed off about Gonzalez,

[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:55.180]
Jose M. In his gun, they're really going to be pork off about this all in right winners.

[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.180]
All of the other side was a kid in his. Oh, it's interesting that I'm starting to have like a real

[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.680]
conflict and I'm sure which group of people I despise more if I'm missing a go at him or those

[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:09.880]
as railies. Oh, I can't even describe you there. Their behavior was like it. It was like the first

[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:15.940]
day out of the house, you know what I mean? Okay, maybe some people do not know how to behave when

[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:22.440]
they're let out of the house. They can't intermingle with other human beings. They are lacking in

[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:29.480]
social skills, if you catch my drift. This is really people. They were like, oh god.

[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:37.560]
W.A.M. Hello. Yes, sir. What makes a world women so holy and so easy?

[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.060]
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello. How you doing?

[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:52.440]
I'm coming about your ice cream cold earlier today. Yeah. Was that all taken by just old people

[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:57.620]
because old people are the only one that's still like plain flavors? No, that was nationwide man.

[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:03.760]
That was among all people. Young, old and between fetuses. I mean, you name it. Crazy man. Yeah.

[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:09.500]
Lucky road roads. Hey man, I love rocky road. Man, I bet my own taste. Okay, Fowler, go get some.

[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.400]
Nothing like traveling in a rocky road. It is really rock solid. Yeah.

[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.580]
Why are we going to start with the ice cream crap again? I can't do that.

[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.400]
Oh, I don't want to admit to Josh that I've fallen off the wagon a couple of times.

[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.740]
Oh, you don't have to sit here? Yeah, you already know. Oh, sit him when I was starting to say

[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.480]
before. You know what is really this is a miracle. I better not suggest this.

[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:36.400]
What cinnamon toast bread? Bread is one of those things that you just don't metabolize well.

[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:41.480]
It turns to sugar immediately and even if you do the cinnamon toast. No, I saw a blurb on TV so I

[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:48.740]
googled it. Cinnamon and blood sugar. Okay. And come to find out. Now be very careful when you go

[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.540]
under your supermarket because they also in the room in the herb section in the spice rack.

[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.420]
They have cinnamon mixed with sugar. You do not want to want to be buy an apple.

[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:01.340]
Pretty convenient to sprinkle. Yeah, but just paying grounds cinnamon which who doesn't like cinnamon?

[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.300]
Let's face it. No, what I know. Now I'm going to say something here and you're going to you're

[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.740]
going to laugh at me but it's true. I've tried it twice. Josh don't listen, put your fingers in your

[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:17.900]
rear. But they already were there. But Hagen Das banana nut which you know I'm addicted to that.

[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.160]
If you do your melting in a microwave 99 seconds, I know that sounds like an awful lot but it is

[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:30.260]
when you buy it. It's rock solid. It's like a brick. Anyway, you take your Hagen Das banana nut and

[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:34.800]
you like melted, you know, however much you like a little bit and then you take your cinnamon,

[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:40.120]
your grounds cinnamon and you shake on a lot which see ordinarily it would be I mean there's

[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.300]
certain things that wouldn't mix the flavor of your bad. It wouldn't make it. It wouldn't cold

[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:51.380]
mingle. But the cinnamon and the banana nut is a real nifty mix. It's great. You swirl it all

[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:56.340]
through there. Okay. Okay. And the amazing part of this is at least I can always think from my

[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.880]
own personal experience is that your blood sugar was up a little bit and then like magic,

[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.940]
way that little magic wand you got there like magic, it starts going down again.

[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:11.820]
And so what I've been doing is I like take my cinnamon and what I'll do when I'm watching TV,

[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.080]
I have a red on my little coffee table in living room. And I'll take the cinnamon and like shake

[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.020]
a bunch of it into my into the palm of my hand. You know, I just lick it off, you know. I mean you can

[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:25.680]
do with a spoon but that's not fun. No, it's a little bitter though, isn't it? No. Cinnamon is bitter?

[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:32.780]
Well, when you take it straight like that. Isn't it a little harsh? I never took it straight.

[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:39.380]
No, that's what I heard. No, it is non-harish. I'm going to give me some during the break and

[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:44.880]
I'm going to give my little jar of cinnamon. Right. If you don't believe me, go on a line and read

[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.000]
about just do a Google on cinnamon and blood sugar and you'll find zillions of articles. Now,

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.860]
they do also recommend like apple pie because it's made with cinnamon. I don't buy that. I'm sorry.

[01:32:55.180 --> 01:33:01.160]
Pie. That's what it says. Now, maybe for some people depending on their own metabolism, maybe some

[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.400]
people can eat apple pie. It's got a lot of cinnamon on it and then study your sugar, go

[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.080]
to the scar walk and then you can actually go down because I tried the cinnamon toast thing.

[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.480]
I got some nice rye bread which rise not like the glycemic level isn't all that bad like white

[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:17.660]
bread. I got some rye bread and I shared some butter on there after I toasted it. I put on some

[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:25.040]
cinnamon and now then work here. Sugar still goes zooming. Not good. But a hot gondas, banana,

[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:31.480]
nut. Now, you might want to try to have some different flavor. I'll check my blood sugar next

[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:39.180]
time I have some. No, you won't. I'm dying on the hand. I keep crying and why don't you get

[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:47.640]
corralled at me and do something with me? I don't think I can do about it. Wait, wait, wait,

[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.020]
I just want to be easier to like restrain and rest on it. If all of you get the oil

[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:58.920]
or give them a little.. what do they call that? What is it? The kid of blood sugar kid, right?

[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:07.500]
All right, someone on the compact head. What about you later? Yeah, whatever it is. The acute

[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:14.160]
check. Yeah, acute check, right? You were thinking of it. Okay, here's what we got so far.

[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.060]
speaking of sex which of course is all anybody cares about me what else are we going to do about this

[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:21.800]
Our economy

[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.660]
No, this is your fearless leader

[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.560]
He's meeting with Australian Prime Minister Howard you know Howard

[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:40.840]
533 people are protected on our survey so far. We're not gonna make that thousand by two o'clock

[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.660]
I'll bet you your life on her right now Josh

[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.520]
We're not gonna make it. I'll make that same bit. Yeah, that's pretty weak

[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.360]
533 I got into his governor and cricket. I just because we don't have any naked pictures

[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.800]
I'm a hundred percent heterosexual male low-grade experiences 321

[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:01.060]
I'm heterosexual man who's had at least one sexual experience with a male 74

[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:06.860]
13.7 percent I couldn't get laid in a warehouse 54. I'm a heterosexual female low-grade experiences 31

[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.500]
I'm reading a bisexual male 14 really I'm a gay male who's had sex with a woman

[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:17.160]
11 I'm a gay male no sex with women 9 total of 3.6 percent

[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:22.360]
I'm reading a bisexual female 6. I'm a lesbian who's had sex with a man 5

[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.300]
I'm a heterosexual female who's had lesbian sex 5 and I'm a lesbian never had sex with no man

[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.140]
I don't want to see one of those things

[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:42.120]
Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M

[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.260]
Tell him

[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:07.380]
You

[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.820]
Enjoy

[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:16.060]
I'm crazy, I'm so cringy, I'm so so

[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:20.260]
I'm just saying, the girl from Dawson's Creek

[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.400]
I think the whole thing springs howling

[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:29.360]
She's being pulled by the cow chanting creek

[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.200]
She is the clear ballastie

[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.960]
She has an IQ of 3

[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.360]
Wonder what she knows to make

[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.400]
She's being a crying collegeee

[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.600]
For Katie Holmes seems a sculling fuse

[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.380]
She's scared like a farm that's lost track of its mom

[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.660]
There's no way that this young girl is prepared

[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.520]
For the life where she's married to Tom

[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.260]
She's like she's not crying nothing in her cupboard

[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:17.300]
Wonder if she ever heard a bell around her

[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:22.700]
Oh, someone's saying, the girl from Dawson's Creek

[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:27.280]
I don't think her brain is functioning well

[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.600]
She's really not, since she can't even tell

[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.340]
She's got full pain while the wheel

[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:39.740]
I think the time will be

[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:47.800]
She's like the only show of all that we need

[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.420]
Okay, so I got my assidim in right here

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:53.180]
My gourmet, my gourmet gourmet, your grandson

[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:54.620]
You gonna lick it?

[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.880]
No, I'm a sprang, I'm a sprang of the sprang of my ham

[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.280]
Mmm, how can you say that? What do you do, car?

[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:03.520]
Better. No. What's better about cinnamon?

[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.780]
What is by itself? That's why people make it with sugar

[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:10.060]
No. No, they miss anything with sugar just because of my fat, much sweeter

[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.860]
No, this is really good

[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.920]
In fact, I can feel my blood sugar plummeting, I may just hit the floor any second

[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:18.200]
There you go

[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:22.320]
So I googled it and I did, I don't want to bore everybody with all this

[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.520]
Because most people are not diabetic, although a lot of you are

[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:27.880]
Many of you aren't, you're either in denial or you're just a full of it

[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.600]
First of all, you shouldn't be nice cream anyway, you fast-slime, you're gonna be dead

[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.500]
Yeah, someday, you know, we have a spoonful of cinnamon bit

[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.040]
We do, we do

[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.920]
One thing about that cinnamon, oh, it's a little... it's a little...

[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:06.920]
Oh, yeah, I feel like, oh, wait

[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:14.380]
Okay, now what am I missing about that? What is it supposed to be about?

[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.540]
I think it has to do with Don't Forget the Cheese

[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.980]
Really? That's what I inferred

[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.940]
I say it sounds like something gay to me, leave it to you

[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:29.100]
Anyway, Cathy Wong who's an MD, well what's that MD?

[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.320]
a naturopathic doctor at naturopathy?

[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.700]
Oh, well, I'll take your work for it.

[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.080]
No, there's not a real doctor.

[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.560]
Kathy Wong writes on a website called Alternative Medicine,

[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.940]
one of the easiest things you can do to improve blood sugar

[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:44.260]
and increase insulin is to add up to a half a teaspoon of cinnamon

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.500]
to your diet each day.

[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.460]
That's not a whole lot.

[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.440]
Half a teaspoon, is it?

[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:49.380]
No, it's not.

[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.500]
Some of my research highlights about the cinnamon

[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.480]
blood sugar connection are and it's got a long thing on here.

[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.800]
A human study published in diabetes care looked at 60 people with type 2 diabetes,

[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:05.920]
30 men, and 30 women, and 30 men, with an average age of 52,

[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.520]
they were divided into six groups, groups 1, 2, and 3, consume 1, 3, or 6 grams of cinnamon daily,

[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.700]
respectively, groups 4, 5, and 6 were given placebo capsules,

[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.760]
corresponding to the number of capsules consumed for the three levels of cinnamon.

[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:21.180]
After 40 days, all three levels of cinnamon intake reduced,

[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:24.980]
fasting blood glucose ranging from 18 to 29 percent

[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.780]
to aglycerized 23 to 30 percent.

[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:28.720]
Dr. D. Man.

[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:31.580]
LDL cholesterol, that's the bad stuff, 7 to 27 percent,

[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.920]
and total cholesterol, 12 to 26 percent.

[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.440]
And also, not only do they do that, but they also have antioxidant activity cinnamon.

[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.040]
Okay, good.

[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.620]
The active compounds are not lost with heating so you can try adding cinnamon to water

[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.960]
before heating and boiling them together.

[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.680]
You can do you like to put in your cinnamon tea.

[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.340]
If you don't like to look or texture teammate with ground cinnamon,

[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:53.780]
try making a tea bringing water to a boil with a piece of cinnamon bark added to it.

[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.020]
Where do you get cinnamon bark?

[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.480]
They have that, you can bite in jars.

[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.760]
Have you ever seen cinnamon bark?

[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.780]
Yeah, for price, great.

[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.080]
It's sprinkling cinnamon on salads.

[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.460]
Open your writing a bit to chicken or meat before cooking.

[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.780]
Don't use more than a half teaspoon a day in the month

[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.240]
that appears to be safe for most people.

[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.180]
Well, your mama, I'll use that over much I want.

[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:17.240]
Cinnamon increases vitality and balances energy.

[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:21.580]
Especially good for people who tend to have hot upper body and colder lower body.

[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.260]
Cinnamon also improves the digestion of fruits,

[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:25.460]
melts another dairy product.

[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.560]
It's all I also for you, very important,

[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.980]
very important thing since you're an IBS guy now.

[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.960]
You got that irritable bowel.

[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:31.440]

[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.580]
And they're right.

[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.700]
Cinnamon is also good for bloating, gas,

[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.020]
poor digestion are throtticinemia,

[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.580]
pain-flementsal periods, and diarrhea.

[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:41.740]
How do you like that?

[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.340]
All right then.

[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:45.320]
I've started sharing it right now for you.

[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.300]
I'm going to go get some.

[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.780]
I'm going to get it right there at your public.

[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.700]
In the spices in the spice doing.

[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.880]
Be sure not to get the one with a sugar all on your case.

[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.060]
I'm going to do that.

[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.260]
Don't get the one with a sugar one.

[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.680]
That's kind of productive.

[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.180]
Don't be taking poison in your cinnamon.

[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.780]
I'll use sugar in the nutrients wheat or something.

[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.200]
What a cinnamon in the nutrients wheat.

[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.800]
tongue 5, 60, and they've arrived in singular wireless lines.

[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.080]
They're aeg operative recognition

[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.280]
and what sort of a crime constitutes a firing offense?

[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.580]
You know, I appreciate your opinion.

[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.180]
That my answer really hadn't changed.

[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.520]
For 24 hours ago, it's the same answer.

[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.720]
Now I'll be glad to answer another question if you got one.

[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.640]
I'll be glad to repeat what I said yesterday.

[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.400]
But do it.

[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.720]
Which is there's an ongoing investigation and people shouldn't.

[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.080]
What?

[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:43.520]
Don't be confused.

[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.420]
I was in the principal.

[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:45.800]
The investigation is over.

[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.880]
I think the investigation is over.

[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:48.520]
I'll deal with it.

[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.540]
If you have another question, I don't want a short change, you honor.

[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.680]
What do you think the Edith's come on?

[01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:58.500]
Pardon me?

[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.540]
Edith's come on for the court.

[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.980]
Oh, well, I think it's important.

[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.820]
Let me refer you back to the first question.

[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.240]
What are you talking about?

[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.120]
They're all yucking it up.

[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:08.680]
I'm a good friend.

[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:09.500]
Nothing.

[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.380]
Just the people are serious about this guy.

[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:13.720]
What?

[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.780]
You know any of those people?

[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.660]
No, I don't.

[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.680]
I don't need to thank John.

[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:19.660]
I'm actually very serious about it.

[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.040]
If someone's from a woodbine the other day,

[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.940]
in fact, they should have been hanging out

[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.960]
at the burning bush.

[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.600]
5.6705.60.5.

[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:28.220]
60.8.

[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:28.580]
Verizon.

[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.580]
Singular wireless line.

[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:30.700]
WDQAM.

[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:31.000]
Hello.

[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:32.940]
OK.

[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.400]
Three very quick but important points.

[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:36.960]
Yes.

[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:40.360]
We're going to see how the media is manipulated by these people

[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.680]
with this diversion with Supreme Court.

[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.280]
See how they really are?

[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.520]
Because they're already warning the residents

[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.180]
of the business.

[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:47.200]
Let's see what they really do.

[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:48.460]
Another thing.

[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.100]
We have people like Yadda Ross-Wayne

[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.620]
going into their air return.

[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.300]
There are a lot of thought.

[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.440]
She's talking about terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.

[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.200]
And when one of those do,

[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.580]
you know that guy they caught on my enemy.

[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:00.900]
She's defending him all over.

[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:01.300]
Was there a

[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.900]
conspiracy or anyone on all of his panic cases?

[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.020]
A third point.

[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.780]
So I saw on the target magazine for 2005.

[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.380]
This is to have a

[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.380]
as a

[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.180]
one of the 8000 great talks of all time run.

[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.920]
The four million that greatest talks of your host ever in.

[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:19.880]
It's ridiculous.

[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:20.640]
It is not.

[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:23.000]
But I just really would like to know how these people,

[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.520]
they warned the media that this is what they're going to do.

[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.480]
Let's see what they do to combat that.

[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:28.880]
Because that's what they're doing.

[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:29.520]
OK.

[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:30.400]
That's

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:30.720]
another thing.

[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:31.160]
How

[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:34.640]
did you hear you say when they asked them a question about the

[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.320]
the real thing?

[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.100]
How people started laughing at that

[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.780]
and that's the person of this country

[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.000]
and that the right hand house was stupid.

[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.960]
Yeah, people are dying and we're laughing.

[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.380]
OK, good luck you pal.

[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:46.900]
Yes.

[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.780]
Can't because people demand additional freedoms.

[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.380]
So it's an economic interest.

[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.620]
I think it's in the world's interest.

[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.640]
I mean, seriously, how can anybody with a straight face look at this and say

[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.200]
if this is the leader of the free world, this is our president, this is a man who's

[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.380]
oh brother, that was a straight face.

[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.980]
No, come on with a case.

[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:05.460]
Yes.

[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.740]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.560]
OK, nobody on that line.

[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.280]
Will I tell you a little swim and grim?

[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:11.800]
You know what?

[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.900]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.900]
Hey, yes, Nuneo.

[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:17.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:22.120]
You know, I was listening to the article that you read about the escalation of violence.

[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.240]
And I was I had it, you know, you know, you remember General Boykin?

[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.240]
Sure.

[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:33.180]
And he said our God is better than your God and we were in a Christian country.

[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.340]
I like it when he said,

[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.020]
dear God, that was my favorite.

[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:37.860]
Well, as I say,

[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:41.480]
but I mean, that that basically I have three things against me.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.740]
I'm white American and Jewish.

[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.320]
Well, you're done for, man.

[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.540]
Don't go to Israel, by the way.

[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.760]
My mom's going.

[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:48.680]
I'm fighting with her.

[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.080]
Yeah, packer is a lot of sandwich.

[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.860]
OK, packer is some still halva.

[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.440]
That's unbelievable.

[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.240]
She's fighting.

[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:55.820]
Now she says she's sick.

[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.120]
She's more scared to go to having sure a mall at night than to go to Israel.

[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:00.620]
Yeah.

[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:02.660]
Exactly.

[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.680]
You know, she's never been scared.

[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:06.400]
I don't want her to be so I don't want her to go.

[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.220]
You know, just keep her off the bus.

[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.360]
All right, I'm going to be safe.

[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.200]
Good luck to him.

[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:13.400]
Happy Shivuas, by the way.

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.320]
5, 6, 7, 5, that's what I wanted to say.

[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.620]
Those Israelis there, OK?

[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:20.420]
Two things.

[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:22.660]
Number one, happy Shivuas and number two,

[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.320]
Kasa Houss and number three get lost.

[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.260]
Get out of here.

[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.300]
Get off my shoulder.

[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.240]
Get away from me.

[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.280]
Get off everybody here.

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.020]
Go act civilized, even if you have to put out a big act.

[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.380]
God will they're disgusting.

[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:35.120]
Come in if you want to.

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:35.320]
Hello.

[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:36.340]
Hey, Leo.

[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.340]
Good to hear you back again.

[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:38.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.280]
This is for Josh.

[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:41.640]
Man, instead of out eating a sheet to put it,

[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.580]
just sprinkle it up on the blonde and then just enjoy.

[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:44.740]
Kick back and slow it on, man.

[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:45.620]
There you go.

[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:46.240]
All right.

[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:46.960]
Come in if you want to.

[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.180]
Hello.

[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:48.740]
Two.

[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:48.840]

[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:49.060]
I am.

[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:49.280]
Hello.

[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:53.300]
We'll splash the gas in here right now.

[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:53.880]
Q.A.M.

[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.380]
No time.

[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.360]
Come in if you want to.

[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:57.540]
Hello.

[01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.480]
I got two questions.

[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:00.180]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:01.020]
One.

[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.500]
Do you know any place where this guy says this for a few days?

[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.860]
Yeah, I want the second question.

[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.680]
Okay, we don't work on it.

[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.720]
Okay, like I said, getting back to my pile here.

[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:13.900]
Why?

[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:14.840]
I thought I'd give it a shot.

[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.780]
Lee, at least there's some different proposals today.

[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:17.220]
I'll say that.

[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:17.800]
Oh, it's great.

[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:18.460]
You kidding me?

[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.740]
This is some heavy duty craft we got going on here today.

[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:22.660]
I'd love to do it.

[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:23.080]
Zero.

[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.700]
Yeah, I like why I like that.

[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.200]
See this?

[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:26.880]
That?

[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.760]
From 13 at 560 WQM for years, I've been telling you about dry concepts.

[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.260]
The best car pertaining to your company around versus why I've used

[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.940]
in my houses for over 20 years.

[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:39.660]
But are you aware that dry concepts can also save you hundreds,

[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.020]
even thousands of dollars in other areas?

[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.220]
Dry concepts also do fantastic drip recreating.

[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.280]
A poultry leather furniture restoration,

[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.300]
mattress cleaning, oriental rug cleaning,

[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.960]
and repair pet-order treatments and water damage too.

[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.640]
Dry concepts can also clean and restore your talent,

[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.860]
grow quickly and efficiently.

[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.980]
Dry concepts professional staff is always improving

[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.000]
the serve you with the most advanced cleaning systems under the sun.

[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.040]
And during this month, during the month of July,

[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.020]
do you believe it's already July 18th?

[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.280]
Nighty, I can't stand it.

[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:08.960]
Before you know it, this whole scheme,

[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.380]
I mean, some of things are going to be over here.

[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.780]
During the month of July, it's dry concepts.

[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.440]
Summer scissor sales take advantage of great savings for them

[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.020]
on all of dry concept services from carpet cleaning to tile and

[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:19.400]
grab clean.

[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.080]
It's the only place you ought to be calling.

[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:23.060]
And don't forget to give your written guaranteed price

[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.660]
for the job before they start, no matter what they do for you.

[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:27.180]
So when they've routed in the Palm Beach,

[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.220]
it's called them tool-free,

[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:31.200]
1-800-248-5071.

[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:34.280]
That's 1-800-248-5071.

[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.660]
Run the wicked web at dryconcepts.com.

[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.940]
Don't forget, you really can clean today and entertain

[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:41.400]
tonight when you use our good friends at dry concepts.

[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.840]
What a comfort sport!

[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.200]
We honor the fear of the stories.

[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:46.280]
We honor the battle.

[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.580]
Sport when you bite six times.

[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:49.860]
Keep it away here.

[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:58.080]
One time ago, I can still remember when I first saw

[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:00.340]
American pie.

[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:05.600]
And I knew if I had my chance,

[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:13.880]
that I'd try to get right in her pants and maybe try to date her for a while.

[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:19.400]
Her nude scene really made me Randy.

[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:23.380]
I choked on my popcorn and my candy.

[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:31.680]
I'll be at her doorstep and better to get on dress.

[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:39.940]
I can't remember if I cried when I read that she became a bride.

[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:45.640]
A breath of relief I did find the day.

[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.260]
She left that guy.

[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:57.480]
So high, high, Miss American pie.

[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.320]
Fancy a season she would date me,

[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.260]
would just buy in the sky.

[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:05.020]
Since I was just a boy,

[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.380]
I wish that I was your guy.

[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:11.380]
I had no chance and held at least I tried.

[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.540]
My proposition has been denied.

[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.740]
Okay, COVID-19 at 5.60 WDQAM.

[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.180]
Whatever you're saying, the number of Iraqi civilians

[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:29.660]
on my violent death in the two years after the US-Land invasion was today put at 24,865

[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:30.900]
by an independent research team.

[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:31.700]
But who's counting?

[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.520]
The figures compiled from Iraqi and international media reports found

[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.380]
US and coalition military forces were responsible for 37% of the deaths

[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:44.580]
with anti-occupation forces and insurgents responsible for 9%.

[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.920]
A further 36% were blamed on criminal violence.

[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:51.100]
So I just like to kind of place that we'd like to hang out, right?

[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:51.940]
Right.

[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:52.700]
It's cool enough.

[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:53.920]
So where would you like to hang out,

[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.600]
bad dad or televised?

[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.040]
What are we saying?

[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:00.560]
No seriously, I think it's good.

[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:01.420]
People say to me,

[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:02.600]
what do you travel all over the world?

[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:06.000]
You go to Europe all the time and how come you never go to Israel?

[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.200]
And my immediate thought is,

[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.500]
Oh, for what?

[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.040]
To put myself in jeopardy?

[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:12.920]
The hotel's there.

[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.620]
Yeah, no thanks.

[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.840]
And the food there is from hunger.

[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.980]
So then even the Arab safe fair.

[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.580]
So then that's attributed to US and coalition military forces

[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:26.620]
peaked in the invasion period from March to May 2003,

[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.320]
which accounts for 30%.

[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.240]
About 30, man.

[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.760]
Most of it indecent to your period,

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.520]
but the longer term trend has been for increasing numbers to die

[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.300]
at the hands of insurgents.

[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:36.360]
What do you like more?

[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:38.620]
Better detergents or insurgents?

[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.100]
Figures of tantalized me from the Iraqi interior ministry

[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:43.600]
put the average civilian and police officer

[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:47.560]
debtroller and insurgent tax from August 2004 to March 2005

[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.480]
at 800 a month.

[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.700]
That's like about 10,000 a year.

[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.540]
It sounds like to me.

[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:54.240]
John Slebotta, now I take you here this.

[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.300]
John Slebotta of the Iraq Body Count Project.

[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:01.340]
What was co-authored the report with Oxford Research Group said

[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.720]
the Iraqi civilian debt toll was the forgotten cost

[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.440]
of the decision to go to war in Iraq.

[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.880]
On average, 34 Iraqis every day have met violent debts

[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.400]
since the invasion he said.

[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.100]
Our data shows that no sector of Iraqi society has escaped.

[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.120]
We sincerely hope this research will help to inform

[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:18.640]
the decision makers around the world about the real needs

[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.340]
of the Iraqi people as they struggle to rebuild

[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.420]
this country, the one that you bombed in this revision,

[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.300]
and the risk of the reins and shut off the electric

[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.780]
and the water and the oil, etc.

[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.520]
Getting to something much more serious.

[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.260]
A 27-year-old married man was arrested and charged

[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.100]
leaving threatening notes on women's cars

[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.080]
demanding that they remove their panties

[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:40.440]
and leave them in the space where their vehicle was parked.

[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:41.740]
Police told Channel 6.

[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:43.820]
How do you like that?

[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:44.380]
Did it work?

[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:48.520]
Investigators said Nicholas Cogrid 27 could wait until

[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:51.560]
a woman would exit a vehicle in a parking lot

[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.340]
at Celebration Health in Oslo,

[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.140]
a county, and other locations.

[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.860]
Then leave a note between the front drivers

[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.900]
and rear passengers around the windshield.

[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:02.260]
If the door was unlocked, he would also leave the note on a car seat.

[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.160]
Cogrid demanded that the woman remove their underwear

[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:06.840]
and taste the garment in the parking space

[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.840]
where he presumably would pick it up later.

[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.680]
Local 6 news reported an anti-alverist

[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.300]
that I'm assuming this is Channel 6 in Orlando.

[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.380]
If they didn't comply, he threatened to find them

[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:19.780]
and perform various sex acts.

[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.540]
I mean, this is whatever it's a crappy channel.

[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.480]
Does it say what's the name?

[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:24.460]
What?

[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:25.540]
Which act?

[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:26.600]
No, not yet.

[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.380]
The first incident of threatening notes

[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.240]
is reported in 2000, but no reliefs appeared

[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.380]
till last May.

[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.660]
Several months of surveillance at a parking lot led

[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:35.140]
deputies to the arrest of Cogrid.

[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:37.000]
After questioning he admitted to the crimes,

[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.960]
and now faces 6 felony counts of written threats

[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.120]
to killer DuBotel injury,

[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.560]
police at Cogrid's also struck in St. Cog,

[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.100]
Cassini and Orlando.

[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.120]
Later, similar to Cogrid's or found on cars

[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.260]
at a home depot on Highway 192 in St. Cog,

[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.800]
a nearby Windixi and a target's door

[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.660]
on North Violin Street in Cassini,

[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.400]
sheriff detectives are looking to speak

[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.480]
to additional women in the mayhem.

[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.760]
Just look for someone right in the round with Opanizo.

[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:02.960]
That's gonna give you the first clue, right?

[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:03.380]

[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.580]
Oh, it's speaking of Israel.

[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:08.340]
This is one of my favorite stories of all time.

[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.380]
See, I think the one that really bothered me was that woman,

[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:13.360]
you know, seeing that we need to pay her $1,000.

[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:16.500]
She was so impressed by the fact that these Israelis were Jewish, you know.

[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:18.740]
Like, first of all, it's a novelty here.

[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.600]
There's nothing novel about being Jewish in Toronto, okay?

[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:23.060]
That's number one.

[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:26.720]
And number two, it's just, it kinders up that whole thing

[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.340]
about the birds of a feather flock together like a whole hanged.

[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.100]
It's annoying.

[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.360]
Their behavior is obnoxious.

[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.240]
They're acting like a bunch of barbarians.

[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:35.960]
And you're impressed because they're Jewish.

[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:36.880]
I'd be embarrassed.

[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:38.920]
How is humiliated?

[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.220]
That's it like a bunch of vile animals.

[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.920]
Anyway, foreign sokolov was among the legions of consumers who had turned

[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:49.100]
to Canadian pharmacies,

[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.920]
purchasing tablets to increase the strength of her bones

[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.020]
because the medication was cheaper in Canada

[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.840]
than her home in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.720]
Then she saw an advertisement in a Jewish magazine

[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.500]
that offered another alternative.

[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:05.220]
Now, Sokolov 74 goes on the internet and offers her orders of medication

[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:09.540]
from Israel where she can find lower prices than those of Canadian pharmacies

[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:11.200]
and where she prefers to spend her money.

[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:14.000]
There were enough companies that have been strangled

[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.800]
and not doing business with Israel because of the little boycotts.

[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.740]
And if I can do anything at all in my small way, I'll do what she said.

[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.800]
She was trellin as she said that I'm sure.

[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.140]
Tiver Krell all the time.

[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:26.900]
Israel companies such as

[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:32.000]
see this is spelled M-A-G-E-N so I'm assuming it's Megan David Medz.

[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:33.260]
Megan David Medz, not Logan.

[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.940]
Megan David Medz.com, isramedz.com,

[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:39.240]
court the prescription drug market by advertising

[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.120]
in national Jewish newspapers and magazines,

[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.540]
often fission lower prices in solidarity.

[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:47.580]
Megan David Medz.com ads tell shoppers they're going to be saving money

[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:50.160]
and supporting the Israeli economy at the same time.

[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.960]
For her first order, placed in May,

[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.960]
MeganDavidmedz.com tried so called off $115.80

[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:00.480]
for a dozen 70-mg tablets of phyza max.

[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:01.740]
What is that?

[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:02.860]
Harder.

[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:04.180]
For bones I guess.

[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.700]
Plus $9.99 for shipping.

[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.800]
The same order would cost $210.79 at a Walgreens in Tamarack

[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:12.720]
and $133.23 from Canada prescription plus

[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.620]
an online supplier for prescription drugs.

[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.160]
So if you save $18, almost.

[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.620]
I can't even much a Western year

[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.560]
of the Israeli government establishes drug prices

[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.600]
rather than allowing them to be saved by the free market

[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.240]
as in the US, rather than allowing the public to be raked

[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.300]
by the pharmaceutical companies such as the US.

[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.340]
The prices are as much as 70% lower in Israel.

[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.140]
MeganDavidmedz.com claims some brand drug named drugs

[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.180]
are identical in Israel,

[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.500]
others are generic products that have the same chemical ingredients.

[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:44.160]
But critics say Americans who buy from other countries

[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.020]
are compromising safety for cost

[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:48.400]
and you know what we're concerned about in America, don't you?

[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.000]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.580]
You got it. Safety, safety, safety.

[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:56.600]
Many Canadian pharmacies have disclaimers that if you're hurt

[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:57.580]
you have the right to sue them,

[01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.940]
so tell them again as the FDA's director of pharmacy affairs.

[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.540]
If anything goes wrong with prescription drugs sold in the US,

[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.880]
he said consumers have recourse with the state pharmacy

[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:05.900]
board on the FDA.

[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.040]
It's more of a threat to public health of US citizens

[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.740]
because we don't know anything about these medications,

[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.780]
how they were made, how they were stored,

[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.140]
how they were shipped as opposed to your state licensed pharmacy.

[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.420]
They were in Florida, he said.

[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.220]
Soak a lot of say she's not swayed by arguments that US drugs are safer.

[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.820]
The American drug companies are rovers, she said.

[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.620]
They're not very straight with us, they're greeny.

[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.680]
I'm sure the drug companies that Canada don't wish to poison their people,

[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:29.600]
Israel does not wish to poison its people.

[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.700]
Nice going, Frank Florence, whatever you need.

[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:37.580]
So she's fine from Israel to support the Israelis.

[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.180]
They're nice, lovely.

[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:40.220]
And to save a few bucks.

[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:41.120]
Nobody ought to be able to talk to her.

[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.060]
Why not? You can do both.

[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.000]
There you go.

[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.080]
26 past noon at 5.

[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.300]
60 WDQ AM.

[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:49.600]
Got Moe off today.

[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:50.400]
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.040]
And I said, so I'm going such a good mood today.

[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.700]
The ghost of Moe ain't lingering over.

[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.620]
He'll be back tomorrow though, Moe.

[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.080]
And look at all that Lenny Martez on this schedule.

[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:02.180]
First, the advert came in before to show this morning for his usual meat and

[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:04.960]
greek. Then everything's insolent, and of course,

[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.300]
but you know, a little meat and greek.

[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.980]
I said, how come Lenny Martez is all over the schedule?

[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:10.500]
And he said,

[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:15.480]
27 after noon at 5.

[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.900]
See if you made it. That's the reason, Troy.

[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:18.040]
Maybe that's the ideal deal.

[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.700]
The ammo cost is for this number one.

[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:21.720]
Ancient gourmet buffet.

[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:23.560]
That's not just my opinion, as I well know,

[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:24.620]
having eaten their decision times.

[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.860]
But also, the opinion of Zagat restaurant review.

[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:30.780]
U.S. Fortenau every Friday through Sunday night lobster faces back

[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:33.120]
by popular demand that ammo cost featuring main lobster,

[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:34.620]
served thermidor style.

[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.340]
And you can still enjoy crab fest every night with less than

[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:40.440]
snow crab legs, dungeon is crab, and Jonah stone crabs.

[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.280]
The menu still includes oysters on a half shell, and a sushi bar with over 30

[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280]
but 30 men.

[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:45.920]
Different items.

[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.080]
In addition, the ammo cost his handcar,

[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.460]
a primary cook, just the way you like it, and from their flaming grill,

[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.340]
succulent New York steaks too.

[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:55.140]
Top off dinner with the Zod at the unbelievable 40-inch chocolate

[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:56.900]
fund, where you can hand it to your own strawberries,

[01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:58.700]
marshmallows, other deck and treats,

[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.500]
which are a little cinnamon on it too, by the way.

[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.940]
And don't forget the ammo cost, and what's healthy living,

[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.820]
cooking all their fine cuisine with cholesterol,

[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:08.660]
free canola oil, no MSG, no headaches, no cornstarch, no crab.

[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:12.080]
So book your reservations at the NAMO cost relocations there in sunrise,

[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:18.340]
sunny-als, beach and tempered pines, for the NAMO cost call 954-572-3822,

[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:20.120]
when you're in the mood for a real pig out of real face.

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:22.880]
This is the place the NAMO cost Chinese buffet.

[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:27.020]
The way it comes to an end of your life is the way it comes to an end of your life.

[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:29.200]
The biggest personnel in the world,

[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.040]
who could go to the Russian economy,

[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:32.300]
and get the chance to go to the city of NAMO.

[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.440]
Poor city of life, so you can go to the city of NAMO.

[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.340]
You will be, yeah.

[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:39.360]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:14.840]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:14.840]

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:14.840]

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:14.840]

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.940]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.320]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.100]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:35.320]
I, the slurry king, and they don't come any better than New Raj.

[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.360]
I'm an epic fan here.

[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.540]
I'm an epic fan.

[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:41.780]
It seemed to me an academic at that going right.

[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:43.580]
You know, so that was right along the edge there.

[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.760]
That bit right on the razor's edge.

[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:46.940]
Right, that's okay.

[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.080]
It has my squeal of approval.

[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.480]
Here's the appol so far.

[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:54.160]
I'm telling you, we might actually make it to 700 votes by two o'clock,

[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:54.400]
right?

[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:55.560]
Probably not.

[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.360]
Now, it's 602.

[02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.220]
Pretty, pretty weak.

[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.360]
Pretty weak, especially when we're not even asking for an opinion.

[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:01.160]
Maybe that's the reason.

[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:04.240]
Maybe if we said, what do you think about Neapolitan or

[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:07.140]
strawberry or vanilla chocolate or butter or a pecan?

[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.880]
Or maybe there's categories we left off like animals and machines.

[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:10.660]
Yeah.

[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.000]
Oh yeah, machines like that one guy.

[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:15.720]
Oh yeah.

[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:17.680]
It's a good machine, man.

[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:21.680]
Anyway, which of these applies to you?

[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:24.760]
I'm 100% heterosexual male with no-day experience.

[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:26.620]
It's been in 61, about 60%.

[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:31.760]
I'm a heterosexual male who's had at least one sexual experience with a male

[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:32.720]
84.

[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:35.260]
I couldn't get late in the horror house 62.

[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:36.780]
Yeah, we've met most of you guys.

[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.120]
I had a sexual female.

[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:40.560]
Located experience is 38.

[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:43.960]
So that's 6.8% of this audience is heterosexual female.

[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:45.160]
Okay?

[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.180]
Okay.

[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.220]
In fact, add that to the, uh, whatever.

[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.920]
I'm really a bisexual male.

[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:51.540]
You believe us?

[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.060]
16.

[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.120]
I'm a gay male who has had sex with a woman 11.

[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:58.300]
I'm a gay male who never had sex with a woman 10.

[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:00.660]
I'm really a bisexual female.

[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.160]
I'm a lesbian who's had sex with a man 5.

[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.680]
I'm a heterosexual female who's had lesbian sex 5.

[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.160]
And I'm a lesbian never had sex with a man 4.

[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:09.660]
Put that thing away.

[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:10.740]
Oh, here's the thing from Israel.

[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.100]
El too.

[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:13.100]
Most of the people who came to this protest

[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:17.000]
have only packed enough food, supplies, and water for a day.

[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.280]
We'll take off our silly caps.

[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:19.860]
Okay, you crazy bastards.

[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.720]
They're ordered from Ariel Shirondi, Israeli Prime Minister.

[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:23.920]
He has caught-

[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.120]
When in doubt, get the hell out.

[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.240]
Okay, go back where you belong already and cut the crap.

[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.140]
Oh, speak of the crazy people, the NRA.

[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:30.680]

[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.340]
Oh, yeah, my favorite, my favorite crazy people.

[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:36.260]
How come I got this in cranked-up so damn loud today?

[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.080]
Man, this is just a woman, can you tell?

[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:38.400]
Yeah.

[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:39.860]
Well, I like it.

[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:40.460]
Right.

[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:43.080]
The National Rifle Association say the S today

[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.860]
is pulling its 2007 National Convention out of Columbus, Ohio

[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.440]
because of that city's ban on assault weapons.

[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:53.620]
The city council passed a ban to lie 12 outlawing

[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:55.460]
the several possessive semi-automatic rifles

[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.860]
with pistol grips and detangible magazines.

[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:02.060]
The gun owners organization have planned to hold its annual

[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:04.780]
three-day event-expected draw as many as 16,000 people

[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:06.840]
at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.

[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:09.360]
Uh, Charlton Hester was supposed to show up pretty forgot.

[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.820]
The party is canceled because last week you said,

[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.620]
just can't stop thinking about him with a blue spandex

[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:20.020]
pants on and he would walk just shuffling away from life or more.

[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.560]
I just can't stop thinking of that scene.

[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:25.640]
The party is canceled because last week your city council

[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:28.420]
unanimously voted to revoke the constitutional rights of law

[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:29.580]
abiding citizens in Columbus,

[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.920]
by banning perfectly legal firearms,

[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.480]
NRA executive, as president,

[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.280]
the certifiable Wayne Lockheer said.

[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:37.900]
Hey Wayne, crazy person.

[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.220]
City officials said the NRA had been told there was a potential

[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:41.880]
for the ban.

[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.600]
Public policy decision, especially those affecting the safety

[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.300]
of our citizens, could not be influenced by any

[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.540]
narrow interest group that happens to visit.

[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:52.700]
Council president Matt Heybash and councilman Michael

[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:54.140]
Mantell said in the statement,

[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.500]
they both sound a little...

[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.560]
Oh, I made it.

[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:58.580]
Federal lawsuits have over two and two previously

[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.180]
attempts by Columbus to ban assault weapons.

[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:02.680]
The latest law attempts to avoid that by spelling out a

[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:05.640]
distinction between legal sporting weapons and military

[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:06.720]
style assault weapons.

[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.960]
The NRA also considered Portland or again on Reno

[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:10.860]
Nevada for the 2007 event.

[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.220]
See this whole idea about sporting uh, uh, weapons

[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:16.060]
uh, why?

[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.140]
Why, why, why, why do we need to do that?

[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:20.360]
Well, let's look at the points.

[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.840]
Can you put it out of those bad things?

[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:25.480]
And I stand with all this other sports shooting.

[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.840]
I mean, granted judge, Celia and the

[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:30.240]
tenure probably have to stay home more often, but nevertheless,

[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:33.800]
they'll probably both get special dispensation.

[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:37.340]
5670560, pound 562, we've arrived in

[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.160]
singular wireless line.

[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:40.940]
Don't forget we got 50 naked pictures of Katie Holmes

[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.160]
on the website today.

[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:42.900]
I'm beaty right.

[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:43.940]
Good with the pony.

[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:44.640]
Right.

[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:46.880]
How many QA and hello?

[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.560]
They're good today.

[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.780]
How many QA and hola?

[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:50.820]
My friend died.

[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:51.640]
Okay.

[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.620]
Probably happy about it.

[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:54.880]
How many QA and hello?

[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:57.700]
QA and?

[02:04:59.240 --> 02:04:59.740]
That's it.

[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:01.400]
That was a medley of our call.

[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.360]
How many QA and hello?

[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:03.340]
Jamba!

[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:08.340]
5670560, pound 562, we've arrived in

[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:09.220]
singular wireless line.

[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:10.420]
I should know it was almost one o'clock.

[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:11.720]
That's right.

[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:13.480]
And some of our near and dear friends, you know,

[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:15.980]
the first couple hours that were like we said,

[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.820]
some crap, but some really different crap.

[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:18.160]
It was.

[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:18.680]
It was great.

[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:20.460]
And now we got nothing.

[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.320]
There is absolutely nobody on there.

[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.680]
How many QA and hello?

[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:25.820]
Hey, Neil.

[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:26.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:27.740]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.680]
Can I tell you what America and Israel has in common?

[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:32.880]
How many?

[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.720]
They're both sitting on stolen land.

[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:35.900]
Yeah.

[02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:37.200]
That's awesome.

[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:38.580]
Okay, great.

[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:41.900]
Like I said, don't call us.

[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:42.500]
We'll call you.

[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:44.100]
Somebody QA and hello?

[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.600]
Hey, it's Valley.

[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:46.320]
Yeah.

[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:50.060]
Why don't you start 69 at Jamba, Jurgah?

[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:54.380]
And then him.

[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.520]
Now let me ask you something.

[02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:58.460]
In other words, that got out of the ear?

[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.420]
No, we heard it.

[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:02.800]
Mahogad and he heard it.

[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.420]
Oh, that's a very good question.

[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.320]
Scary question.

[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.700]
Yes, it's a scary question.

[02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:12.040]
It makes me wonder about this square little yellow button that I'm sitting here.

[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:14.240]
I mean, not that we don't have any, you know,

[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:17.520]
doubts about our technical capabilities here at QAAM.

[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:19.180]
I mean, that's possibly the anything,

[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.020]
you know, malfunction of the junction or her.

[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:24.000]
When I stop and think about all the times I've hit that thing.

[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:26.100]
So you might just both want to keep that in mind.

[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:26.920]
Okay.

[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.020]
Because I'm not sure that this thing is working.

[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.780]
I'll try a little bit during Geldy's show.

[02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:33.020]
I'll cater the few times.

[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:35.340]
And see what happens.

[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:37.620]
How else can that be if you heard it?

[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:38.580]
That's right.

[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:39.340]
We could test it.

[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:40.440]
Yeah.

[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:42.460]
And how are you going to hear the ear?

[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.160]
Well, I got this little video over here if the battery's having died.

[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:46.340]
No, get out of here.

[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.840]
That thing, that's, you crazy?

[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:48.700]
Yes.

[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:49.540]
That's some of the story.

[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:50.780]
So many QAAM, hello.

[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:51.780]
I'm here.

[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:52.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:56.240]
Yeah, I've been in Miami for six years and I'm sorry to say,

[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.380]
I only listened to you for the last ten years.

[02:06:58.880 --> 02:06:59.080]
Yeah.

[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.220]
You know, that's pretty good.

[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.980]
So I think to advise, I'm moving to

[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:04.860]
Strathburg, Pennsylvania,

[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:07.960]
which is equally distant between New York City and Philadelphia.

[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:08.640]
Right.

[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.780]
I don't want to know who I'm going to listen to when the radio.

[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.460]
Probably who's never on.

[02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:19.900]
I've always said before, whenever I'm going to go somewhere,

[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:21.420]
wherever I'm going to live, I always wonder,

[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.200]
who am I going to listen to on the radio?

[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:24.820]
Oh, God.

[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.260]
You sure in download your radio listening guy.

[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:28.380]
What is he trying to say?

[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.160]
I have no life.

[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.860]
As I was leaving, as you're going to be leaving town, sir,

[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:34.860]
why would you take your radio and flush it down the toilet?

[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.840]
Okay, put it in the bottom of a pool, whatever.

[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.480]
Who is he going to be listening to on the radio?

[02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:44.520]
Probably whoever you enjoy, or if you don't enjoy anybody,

[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:47.500]
probably nobody, or maybe both of you, but I have no idea.

[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:48.500]
And guess what?

[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:49.300]
And couldn't care less.

[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:51.300]
Does that...

[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:52.160]
Oh, look at this guy.

[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:53.340]
We're going to miss him off the next guy's family.

[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:53.700]
Oh, I know.

[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:54.000]
I know.

[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.280]
I shouldn't have come, God.

[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.580]
He's a better family.

[02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:59.160]
So one part of the solution is,

[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.780]
his mom's taking a very hard line against extremism.

[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:02.500]
Oh, his mama.

[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:04.960]
That's what they say in the Middle East, his mama.

[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:09.360]
Five, six, five, six, seven.

[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.680]
I'm telling you, man, I've been telling you this from the day one,

[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:13.680]
and I'm going to keep telling you,

[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:17.160]
and because nobody wants to say it, religious people are all crazy.

[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.360]
Thank God we're not fighting those tribal wars anymore,

[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.060]
like they used to do, like back in the early day,

[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.780]
and on back in the day, over pieces.

[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:23.540]
Scrubby, through.

[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:23.820]
Right.

[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.640]
Now that's what it's all about, tribal wars.

[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.360]
Mm-hmm.

[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:30.400]
You've got the tax doons and the cuckabooons and the, uh, oh, please.

[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:34.940]
It's just...

[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.300]
That's what it really is all about.

[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.300]
They don't want to grow up.

[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:38.420]
Can't have handled death.

[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.740]
And then now they're really going to have a duty about this thing

[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:43.120]
with the suicide bombers, again,

[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.900]
not that they've made a comeback and started up in Europe.

[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.280]
And then it's all about sex.

[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:49.880]
It's all about those 72 virgins.

[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:54.060]
So if we stop having so many horny young Muslims,

[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.940]
maybe we wouldn't have so many suicide bombers.

[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:58.300]
They're all just jones in for those 72 virgins

[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:00.800]
that they're going to be doing as soon as they get the reward in heaven.

[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.680]
And then they showed the, um, I don't know if you've seen the clips.

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:07.400]
I'm sure you have.

[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:10.640]
When they had these midrasses in Pakistan,

[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:13.380]
and they showed the little kids like five and six years old,

[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:14.360]
and they're...

[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.320]
You know how they, you know how they do with the, like, the Orthodox Jews,

[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:18.520]
they dove in and they got away.

[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:19.040]
Wait a minute.

[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.800]
And these kids are diving like, like they're on speed.

[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.320]
They're like, have a bouncing up in them.

[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.800]
They're like bouncing off the tables.

[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:25.240]
Okay.

[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:27.560]
The faster you dove in, the closer you get to God.

[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:28.520]
Is that what it is?

[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.160]
Or the quicker you get to 72 virgins, one or the other.

[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:35.040]
And of course, if you got 72, you probably have to do it faster too.

[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:39.860]
1241 at 560 WQM, the Gellie Wormov Sheriff on QAN.

[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:41.700]
The clip comes to an end here.

[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.580]
It's a blue light.

[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:44.180]
You're still light.

[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.060]
You're still in the names.

[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:45.640]

[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:47.020]
It's a blue light.

[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:51.220]
A tear of fantastic joy.

[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:52.020]
Oh, you're hot.

[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.400]
But thank you for you.

[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.520]
And I'm not afraid to cross.

[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:55.680]
Yes, it can seem sense.

[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.940]
Enormous pain or stars in.

[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.700]
Why is it called chicken by the spear in the scene?

[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.780]
Fantastic to which you can look at that breath.

[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:06.820]
And find the most erratic part of a woman needs to booby.

[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:07.780]
I've been looking at your breath.

[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.500]
I've got to put a wide load sign on those babies.

[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:11.840]
I sort of ordered you to get there.

[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.180]
Fantastic to ready to be cut.

[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:15.400]
They're a proven margin puzzle.

[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.020]
Pretty shocking, like I have the results of this poll.

[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.720]
So far only a little over 3% of this audience gave me.

[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.760]
I don't know why that is.

[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.120]
Why is that?

[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:24.420]
They all move here.

[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:25.740]
Who I say?

[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:28.000]
Well, there's 14% go pretty bad.

[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:28.440]
Those in there.

[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.060]
14% or what?

[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:30.660]
All right.

[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:32.280]
Look, we're not interested in your aim.

[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:33.980]
It's a reason I took the poll.

[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.540]
We've heard your cock amaming crap for long enough.

[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:36.960]
And I don't know.

[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:38.600]
Let's put them in a given stair lie.

[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:39.220]
And their opinion.

[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:39.980]
By the way, here it is.

[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.660]
Everybody agrees with me except the gay guys.

[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:42.540]
Right.

[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:43.880]
A Christian.

[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:47.580]
You know, of course they do because they're all going to see that.

[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.020]
That's at any rate.

[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:49.780]
My wife and father.

[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.740]
It's like being a dead horse.

[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:52.520]
There's a man who's an expert on something

[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:53.400]
that he knows nothing about.

[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:54.500]
OK.

[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:57.460]
A Christian adoption agency speaking of good old time religion

[02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:00.160]
that receives money from choose life license plates

[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:03.900]
said it doesn't place children with Roman Catholic couples

[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.140]
because they're religion conflicts

[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:07.160]
with the agency statement of faith.

[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:08.720]
Paul Bethany.

[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:10.460]
Are you pardon?

[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:13.960]
Just I was just taking it back by that.

[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:14.640]
I see.

[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:18.100]
Bethany Christian services stated the policy and led into a

[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:19.080]
Jackson couple this month.

[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.800]
And another message of a couple said it will rejected

[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:22.120]
for the same reason last year.

[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.920]
It's like good old time religion, baby.

[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:28.380]
It's been our understanding that Catholicism does not agree with our

[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:28.940]
statement of faith.

[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.940]
Bethany State Director Karen Stewart wrote.

[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:33.680]
Our practice not to accept applications from

[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:36.080]
Catholics was an effort to be good stewards of an adopted

[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:36.960]
applicant's time.

[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:38.520]
Money and emotional energy.

[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.900]
Sandy and Robert Stedman who learned of Bethany's

[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:43.720]
decision in New July, if let her said they're

[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:44.960]
pre-stolened in the faith statement,

[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.040]
did not conflict with Catholic teaching.

[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.900]
L'Oreal Williams of nearby Ridgeline said

[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:51.740]
that she and her husband West had a similar experience

[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:53.000]
when they started a pursuing adoption

[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.400]
September of last year.

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:57.540]
I can't believe an agency that's nationwide would act like this,

[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.220]
L'Oreal said.

[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:01.180]
There was an agency who was Christian based but wasn't willing to help people

[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:01.900]
across the board.

[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:06.580]
Bethany based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which by the way is a horrible place,

[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.040]
has 75 offices in 30 states,

[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.660]
not Jordan, man, including three orifices in Mississippi.

[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:15.380]
The orifices are independently incorporated or affiliated with various religions.

[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:17.760]
Folks from in John Van Backenberg said from

[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.060]
agency headquarters, he wouldn't say whether any work Catholic affiliated.

[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.380]
Jackson Opus is affiliated with Presbyterian Church of America.

[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:26.960]
Glenn Demott's president, Bethany, said on Friday that the

[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.600]
policies open into interpretation.

[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.640]
He said the National Office doesn't ban adoptions to Catholic families,

[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:35.020]
but does allow each branch to establish rules for the

[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.020]
placement of children based on the agency's statement of faith.

[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:43.400]
As the Savior, Jesus takes away the sins of the world of statement

[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:48.000]
servant part. Jesus is the one in whom we are called to put our hope, our only hope for forgiveness

[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.600]
of sin and for reconciliation of God and with one another.

[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.600]
Sandy said, and she was hurt and disappointed,

[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:57.340]
that Bethany received from the true life car license plates.

[02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.640]
I know a lot of Catholics who get those tags, she said,

[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:00.380]
soccer is,

[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.240]
yet if it's okay to accept money,

[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.280]
should be okay to open your home to us.

[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:06.200]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:08.060]
We're all surprised, Sandy.

[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:08.660]
We're out.

[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:10.000]
We're going to try to warn them.

[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.140]
I'm going to try to warn the Catholics that the fundamentalist hate them,

[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.060]
but you know, they're going to be like Bob Jones.

[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:16.560]
That's right.

[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:17.440]
I see.

[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:20.240]
What can this is, and I can't make it said,

[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:20.960]
Virgin Mary thing.

[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.840]
A few people would let go of the Virgin Mary and stop

[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:25.720]
rubbing them damn beads and put all them chascus down.

[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:28.340]
Maybe the fundamentalist Christians would've gotten to you,

[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:28.880]
but I doubt it.

[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:29.840]
Wouldn't be any fun.

[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.220]
No, and stop saying them,

[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:32.440]
Hail Mary is over and over again.

[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:38.820]
And I started on the thing before the break with the Madras.

[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:41.500]
There is a classic example.

[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:42.820]
Every time I see that,

[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.220]
that's what you need to know about religion.

[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.260]
This is what you are doing to your children.

[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:49.040]
Maybe not in exactly the same way,

[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:50.800]
but in some way, in some way,

[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:51.820]
or in that way,

[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.380]
in other ways,

[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:52.540]
in other ways,

[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.120]
just as insidious.

[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:55.640]
Because you don't slumping them out of church,

[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.660]
slumping them to shul,

[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.240]
sticking the bees on their heads,

[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:00.180]
forcing them to read a lot of mumbo jumbo,

[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:01.420]
but it's all manwritten crap.

[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:02.480]
A lot of written.

[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.860]
Of course, teaching them to hate anybody

[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:06.140]
who doesn't share their particular brand of crap.

[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:09.360]
I mean, when is the day coming?

[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:10.260]
We're going to start, you know,

[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.340]
the Frankl American crowd against the Shafoyard Ikroud.

[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.120]
You know, we don't like your kin to the pastis it,

[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:18.140]
therefore you must be, I think, least though.

[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:18.760]
You die here.

[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:19.620]
We're going to kill your ass

[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:22.380]
because you eat new on kind of canned crapola.

[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:25.240]
Well, it's all about your crapola anyway.

[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.760]
And they're dobbling and they're rocking.

[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:29.100]
And they're about to be put about.

[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.500]
They've got their magic carpet in there.

[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:31.780]
And by the time they're like,

[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.160]
eight, 19 years old,

[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:34.820]
no wonder they're doing the suicide bombings.

[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:35.820]
They're crazy.

[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:35.940]

[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:37.180]
They're a bedbug at that point.

[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.660]
They're going to see a bedbug in a fine carpet.

[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:41.580]
That lately.

[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.460]
For us, right in Iraqis,

[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:44.980]
we're actually, I've got a whole pile of stuff here.

[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:45.820]
I've been wasting my time.

[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.520]
Why didn't you tell me to stop with a stupid call?

[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:48.300]
I'm sorry.

[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.160]
Hey, so I'm going to be good though.

[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:50.760]
Q-A-M.

[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.100]
K-A-M-B-R.

[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.020]
Now you hit it.

[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:57.380]
Now you hit it.

[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.640]
He needs to be murdered.

[02:14:58.880 --> 02:14:59.360]
He really does.

[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.080]
We need to do away with that one.

[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.000]
He needs to be taken out as they say.

[02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:07.780]
Iraqis have begun burying themselves in their homes

[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:09.300]
and forming neighborhood militias

[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:10.280]
in an effort to end off

[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:11.520]
relentless suicide attacks.

[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:13.400]
Residents in the Capitol say yesterday.

[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.840]
Sounds like everything is fine.

[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.000]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:19.300]
The measures come amid waning confidence

[02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:21.460]
in the Iraqi police and other security forces.

[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.560]
As they struggle to get on top of the two-year-old in surgency.

[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:27.700]
In the latest attack, 98 people were killed by a suicide truck

[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:28.920]
bomb south of Baghdad Saturday.

[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:30.660]
Well, this is the latest.

[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:32.860]
That's before the ones that we talked about earlier in the show.

[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:35.100]
I mean, the latest is whatever happened five minutes ago.

[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:38.240]
A senior member of Iraq's parliament on Sunday

[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:40.120]
called for popular militias to be created

[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:41.400]
as an extra line of defense

[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.700]
against the militants and criticize the government

[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:45.400]
for failing to stop the bombs.

[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.500]
The plans of the Interior and Defense Ministry

[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.440]
to impose security in Iraq have failed.

[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:52.920]
Qadur al-Quza'i told parliament

[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:55.160]
during a heated session following the latest blast.

[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:57.020]
We need to bring back popular militias

[02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:57.820]
he said with understanding.

[02:15:58.100 --> 02:15:59.820]
Then the good tourist login for a Baghdad.

[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:01.240]
Visit Iraq. It's a blast.

[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.340]
While there was some backing for his proposal,

[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:05.980]
there are concerns militias formed along

[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.380]
Santorio lines to lead the country

[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:09.620]
even closer to civil war

[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:12.020]
with Shi'id and Sunni Air Force already involved in

[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:13.820]
tit for tat killings.

[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.080]
Despite that fear, you heard it.

[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.120]
Despite that fear, local militias already

[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:21.500]
have informed the civil Baghdad areas

[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.500]
and at least two Shi'id militant movements

[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:25.420]
have their own powerful private army.

[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:27.160]
Sounds like civil war to me.

[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:28.000]
But what do I know?

[02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:29.340]
Otherwise, there's no something here now.

[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:31.180]
I just see a machine that is passing.

[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:32.320]
No, no, glad to ask.

[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:32.680]
Fire?

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.200]
No.

[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:36.220]
It smells like an open link.

[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:37.060]
Subtit tank.

[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:38.020]
Really?

[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:38.440]

[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.740]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:41.660]
Oh, don't tell me,

[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:42.800]
Santorio came by again.

[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:44.760]
Like, you know, when the gas traffic

[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.700]
and your bathroom isn't working right?

[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:47.100]
Right.

[02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.040]
Yeah, like that.

[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:48.980]
Oh, don't tell me.

[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.020]
Maybe it's the spillage,

[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:51.040]
or maybe they're anticipating

[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:52.160]
the book will be from tomorrow.

[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:54.400]
Oh yeah, there's going to be a lot

[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.900]
of wild, diarrhea in that place.

[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.100]
It is going to be incredible.

[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:00.400]
I don't know.

[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:01.860]
You know, his Hank was kind of like,

[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:03.180]
like, why did I buy the mask?

[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:04.220]
I shouldn't have brought that up.

[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:05.400]
There was insensitive on my part.

[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:06.460]
And he could pull it out.

[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:07.300]
He could have a big jewel.

[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:07.880]
He could never know.

[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:08.440]
He could never know.

[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:09.700]
Are you a Hank people?

[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:10.800]
You better hop on it, man.

[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:12.200]
You better get over it.

[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:13.840]
And stuff like hanging a monster.

[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:16.000]
Of course, now that we got the basketball find the over,

[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:17.600]
we got that iron off there.

[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.840]
That certainly can only be a bonus.

[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:20.120]
Oh, God.

[02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:22.960]
Please, please, clearance.

[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:23.840]
Stop it already.

[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:25.780]
He needs to be kidnapped.

[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:26.480]
Clarence.

[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:29.240]
He needs to be taken away

[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:30.620]
so that the rest of us can be safe.

[02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:33.220]
639.

[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.300]
You think we're going to make 800?

[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:34.860]
What do you say?

[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:36.240]
Yeah, that's got to be our new goal.

[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.660]
We have to, like, down, down side.

[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.120]
You'll die.

[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:14.420]

[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:27.660]
Oh,�合 for sure, today's been put down here.

[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.700]
The song that the singer is terribly commanding.

[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:36.180]
It's probably an outstanding class tonight.

[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:36.900]
It's that broad.

[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:38.200]
It's that you know, punker.

[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.500]
Yeah, the, uh, what is school-lating school feature?

[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:41.320]
Whatever.

[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:42.540]
Yeah, the school feature.

[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:44.500]
You know, I've been up on the, uh, station.

[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.720]
There's our, uh, end of the year.

[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:50.100]
It's probably the way you're taking the show.

[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.000]
So, why don't we do that?

[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.620]
Yeah, so you're taking another place.

[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.500]
So, why don't we do our best?

[02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:02.660]
So, why don't we do our best?

[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:05.620]
How's that, I can't teach?

[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:08.540]
We've been down down to the stage.

[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:11.820]
Everybody knows who plays.

[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:15.440]
We all know us now, why don't we do our best?

[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.100]
How's what the best?

[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:18.880]
I love you.

[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:20.460]
I love you.

[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:24.020]
There's nobody around.

[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:30.140]
bit too easy to come when I take a foot in my bed.

[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:34.300]
People think I take their times.

[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:37.500]
But if yeah I was crying over there.

[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:48.640]
Wait till I'm ridden enough it's every minute I can.

[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:51.980]
The

[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.520]
no

[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:12.100]
Hello?

[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:18.740]
Yes, you are?

[02:20:33.780 --> 02:20:37.960]
We have these four?

[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.720]
Unfortunately, the signs have been copyrighted.

[02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:47.180]
��

[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:14.380]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380]

[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.660]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:17.480]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:18.720]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:48.580]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:21:48.720 --> 02:22:18.700]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:40.920]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:42.340]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.340]

[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.480]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:43.040]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.540]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:45.740]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.500]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:48.700]
I'm going to have to go.

[02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:49.400]
I'm going to do this.

[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:49.960]
out.

[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:52.480]
I'm going to do this.

[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:52.480]

[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:56.260]
Hello.

[02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:56.820]
Yeah.

[02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:59.360]
Your not on the AirGush for some reason.

[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:00.480]
How about now?

[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:01.660]
We have to reset, got back.

[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:02.140]
No, no.

[02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:02.240]
We have to reset, got back.

[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:02.400]
My bad.

[02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:05.160]
I have to reset or something.

[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:06.920]
The whole board would reset.

[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:08.820]
You call this a radio station

[02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:12.500]
You're gonna hit a spot. I don't know what time it is

[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:18.640]
But if it's time for the 12 after break we could just play that and I'll play the one spot that we need to play

[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.800]
Yeah, the break we missed I see

[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:25.600]
Well, it wouldn't you know what you don't have a clock in there. It's no heaven. We just reset

[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.540]
So it's right it clocks a zero. I'm not resetting

[02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:33.160]
I'm like my wife is pouring right along like it always does. It's one oh seven. It's poor. I'll write along

[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.640]
So in other words you want to incorporate that one minute in the yeah, whatever just take the break at 12 after and the only spot

[02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:43.620]
I really need to play is that one we missed so well good. I'll play in this fine

[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:49.960]
We're just fine. Of course that kind of like I was hoping for about maybe 140 right because I don't like to be an

[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:54.960]
Overworked with it. We didn't have no bogging today or Thursday and I like this being overworked two full days a week in the summer

[02:23:55.580 --> 02:24:00.140]
So we apologize for a few days, but our audience ought to be getting pretty used to it right right?

[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:06.120]
When you think I'm sure they are thanks to all those people I call and thanks in said you're off the air. Thank you very much

[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:07.400]
See first I thought it was like

[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:10.720]
And our line here between me and there

[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:14.820]
Right, well, we said that just doesn't happen there isn't a reason

[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:19.440]
I thought there's no reason. Huh? That's what I thought but we couldn't hear ourselves the I see

[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:21.760]
Okay, let me just move along

[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:27.600]
Tampa and of course we had the earlier surround this is never a safe ever never a safe

[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:29.080]
You will

[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:35.860]
Okay, a middle school reading teacher who's sexual liaisons of the 14 year old student made tan wood headlines broke off

[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:41.420]
Plenty of ocean with prosecutors and will claim insanity of this summer trial her journey. Save yesterday

[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:43.060]
Like that

[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:50.540]
Devil a fade 24 was under such emotional stress that she didn't know right from wrong when she had sex with a 14 year old

[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:55.900]
Student numerous time. Maybe that's what happened when I chicken or a gun. Wasn't it or better washing? What was her name?

[02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:58.860]
They're literally very close. She didn't know why from long

[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:07.820]
Deborah LaFade 24 was under such emotional stress that she didn't know right from wrong when she had sex with a 14 year old student numerous times in June

[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:13.120]
2004 attorney John Fitzgibbon said after a brief court hearing they December 5 trial date was set

[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:19.100]
Fitzgibbon said plea bargaining broke down because prosecutor has wanted too much prison time for LaFade who appeared in court Monday

[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:22.460]
But didn't speak and by the way those of us who watch guiding lighter

[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:26.240]
We supposed to just have amnesia all of a sudden and forget about Alan and what happened before you

[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:32.660]
It's about spirited away by what's it? What it's just I'm sorry. I can't handle it no more. I'm losing it

[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:40.040]
The place that attracted young man and now Philip is alive now which at any rate the place that attracted young woman

[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:45.780]
That kind of hellhole is like putting a piece of raw meat in with a lion said Fitzgibbon who wouldn't talk about details of the negotiations

[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:47.600]
I'm not sure Deborah would survive

[02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:54.140]
He said he had hoped to settle the case with a plea agreement not only for Debbie's sake, but for the young man's sake

[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:59.260]
She was crazy. She didn't know what she was doing. She'd know right from long

[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.720]
State attorneys office spoke from in Pam Bondi. I wonder she's keen to dig beyond the or viola Bondi

[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:09.820]
Also wouldn't disclose the chance of the negotiations that said prosecutors made every effort to resolve the case

here.

[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:47.760]
I'm surprised speaking of being off here.

[02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:51.840]
I'm surprised that Clarence and somebody didn't come rushing in there and in the

[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:54.200]
reprint in the middle of our broadcast there's just a couple of minutes ago.

[02:32:54.280 --> 02:32:54.780]

[02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:55.140]

[02:32:57.420 --> 02:32:59.440]
Big news from Dolphin Camp.

[02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:00.640]
Really.

[02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:04.720]
Ricky Williams is expected to report to the dolphins for the first day of training camp

[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.000]
going to NFL.com.

[02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:08.780]
Is this incredible or what?

[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:14.560]
For the number four official conversation for the new sounder at least.

[02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:15.220]
Yeah.

[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:17.780]
You have them there?

[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:19.580]
Do I have a walk there?

[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:20.380]
New sounders.

[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:20.960]
A beer.

[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:21.740]
A free chance.

[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:22.700]
They're a buyer.

[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:23.860]
Oh no, that's not it.

[02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:24.500]
What about this?

[02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:27.080]
This is CBS.

[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:32.020]
For the record official conversation regarding his reinstitent will take place in the sleep.

[02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:34.600]
But you want to be the yellow one.

[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:36.900]
From the polling news.

[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.740]
I got it.

[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.300]
I'm going to have to start over yet.

[02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:41.480]
Ricky Williams, baby.

[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:43.940]
And we can dig out all those old Ricky Williams bits again.

[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:45.700]
What a joke.

[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:47.320]
Well they're desperate.

[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:50.340]
You know, they got to welcome him back with open arms and legs up as they're desperate.

[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:51.920]
Plus he's got the good stuff, you know.

[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:53.180]
That's what we hear.

[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:55.360]
How would he go?

[02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:56.020]
Oh, to be fair.

[02:33:56.900 --> 02:34:00.400]
Ricky Williams is expected to report to the dolphins for the first day of training camp

[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:01.700]
going to NFL by chance.

[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:04.760]
According to the report, a social conversation regarding his reinstitent.

[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:08.440]
We'll take place later this week.

[02:34:09.700 --> 02:34:12.940]
But Williams is expected to be cleared by the NFL to report to training camp on Sunday

[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:16.600]
with the rest of his teammates in preparation for the first day of on field.

[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:20.660]
He'll drill the following day, two days from the one year anniversary that Williams abruptly retired.

[02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:24.360]
He turned his back on him just like a Shane Corson.

[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:26.080]
Partying.

[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:29.840]
The report also says, don't give me star with that hockey stuff now.

[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:33.400]
This is the week for hockey and isn't it appropriate we are going to gel the on today, huh?

[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:35.260]
He's just gagging on it.

[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:36.800]
It's worth it.

[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:40.520]
According to the telephotoial event he told her at the loss of.

[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:45.620]
Turning out, Randy, you think that's what that's the only one?

[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:46.340]
Sorry, what?

[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.640]
You see, we got to get some hockey going, man.

[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:52.180]
Let's book a hockey show.

[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.360]
As a three-time offender of the league's substance abuse policy,

[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:00.380]
Ricky Williams faces the one year suspension and he pails the Mrs. drug test.

[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:05.840]
The offense first year coach Nick Sabin is welcome in the return of Williams and his confident it won't be this reaction.

[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:11.460]
I think it's going to be up to the team not allowed to be a circus and the focus is on what we need to focus on as a team to be successful.

[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.940]
Sabin said during a week's interview with a local media, it will also only matter if we let it matter.

[02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:16.980]
Whatever that means.

[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:18.460]
It doesn't matter if you let it matter.

[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:20.580]
Okay, what is it about?

[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:21.900]
Nice going Nick, whatever you say.

[02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:24.600]
Boy, they're going to have a brutally year with it without Ricky Williams.

[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:28.600]
They may be better off the son of Ricky Tickley, at least he plays cheaper anyway.

[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:31.840]
Here's a low test story just in.

[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:35.780]
A lot of stuff going on today, although it doesn't always take a lot of those really good calls.

[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:40.940]
12-year-old Juro sexually assaulted an elevator at Universal Studios Resort in Orlando.

[02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:48.780]
A man followed a 12-year-old tourist onto an elevator at Universal Studios Resort and sexually assaulted her official today.

[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:53.640]
Orange County Sheriff Sergeant Richard Mankowicz, heavy assault happened 1130 last night.

[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:59.260]
After the suspect followed the girl who was alone looking for her mother from the parking lot into the enclave suites.

[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:00.400]
How did that happen, I wonder?

[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:03.080]
A key is required, how did what happened?

[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:05.300]
That she was alone and looking for her mother.

[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:06.960]
It's called incompetent parents.

[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:07.240]
Right.

[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.160]
A key is required to enter the hotel.

[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:13.880]
Mankowicz said the man followed the girl closely enough to enter after she unlocked the door.

[02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:21.240]
Once on the elevator, the attacker told the girl he wanted to have sex investigators said he then told her to remove her shirt and when she refused,

[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:23.580]
reached under her shirt and touched her stomach.

[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:27.600]
He also said that it's a good thing he didn't do that to what's her name on guiding light.

[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:28.240]
What's her name?

[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:29.680]
Diana.

[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.420]
Nothing to be finer than to find out that Diana ain't pregnant.

[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:33.580]
She's wearing a thing.

[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:36.380]
He also touched the girl's genitals over her shorts.

[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:41.040]
Mankowicz said it appeared the man who carefully chosen the girl because he saw an opportunity to be alone with her.

[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:45.620]
The girl told the investigator she bit the man after he put his hand over his mouth to suffer from screaming.

[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:50.260]
Mankowicz said the suspect did not allow the girl off on the thick floor where her room was.

[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.240]
At some point the girl pushed the elevator's emergency button and went out of the elevator when it stopped on the eighth floor.

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:03.000]
Detected Samara Mellage wouldn't release specific details about the girl accepting it from a brawn and her family recently arrived in the US and her mother's incompetent.

[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.140]
However, the girl had taken the stuff the fence course just to which police credited with helping her end the attack.

[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:09.300]
Always a good idea.

[02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:14.300]
All your foreigners out there before you come to the US take yourself to the fence course because it's a jungle out there.

[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:18.020]
She was extremely shaken. She was just trying to calm down Mellage said.

[02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:20.800]
She said the girl and her family intended to stand in the land of for up to two weeks.

[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:25.940]
She said the family wasn't fighting short the vacation because they wanted the state to help enforce them prosecute the man.

[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:31.740]
Investigated as distributed still photos captured from security cameras and the man leading the elevator.

[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:33.360]
No camera was in the elevator.

[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:36.160]
Universal Studios didn't take it over their mom to go far.

[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:36.560]
I understand.

[02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:43.620]
26 after one at five 60 WQM, the home of technical incompetence and insanity.

[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:45.280]
We got the phone working out.

[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:45.980]
I can see the clock.

[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:48.200]
I can see the phone lines on there like this.

[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:48.580]

[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:50.320]
A bigger phone?

[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:51.140]
I can see that.

[02:37:52.540 --> 02:37:55.340]
26 passed one at QAIM in the Gildi Warmer show.

[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:58.620]
Did you get a good night's sleep last night where you tossing and turning all night.

[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:00.000]
Time to that small cramp bed.

[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:05.400]
Well, if so, it's time to step up to a new cleaner king size bed from our good friends at Dala mattress.

[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:11.840]
When you call 1-800-MACROS, you'll choose from Florida's largest inventory of Queen and King size beds ready for same day delivery.

[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:13.660]

[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:18.380]
The date and time any day seven days away from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. once convenient for you.

[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:22.760]
Dala mattress carries the complete line of all the top names in the business which I've been selling about for years.

[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:23.580]
Seely.

[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:24.300]
Surta.

[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:24.560]
Simmons.

[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:25.140]
King Coral.

[02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:26.460]
Stearns have been antifastered too.

[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:29.120]
I bet you've been antifastered with cinnamon will really be good.

[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:32.220]
Their everyday low prices and deep stock make you shopping of breads.

[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:36.620]
When you call 1-800-MACROS, you know you're going to be talking with expert bed and consultant so listen to your needs.

[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.060]
Who will suggest a style and comfort level for you that's perfect because this is their only business mattresses.

[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:42.840]
They don't sell cinnamon.

[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:43.960]
They don't sell shoes.

[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:45.160]
Only do a sell mattresses.

[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.380]
Just about everybody here at QM seems like a baby on a Dala mattress venue ought to be doing the same.

[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:52.120]
Just do the easiest piece of shopping you could ever think of.

[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:53.060]
Make that one easy call.

[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:56.060]
1-800-MACROS or do it online mattress.com.

[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:59.360]
Dala mattress 1-800-MACROS.

[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:03.980]
Leave off the last S because it stands for stupendous, sensational savings.

[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:07.080]
I was sure as hell don't want to hear that CBS sweeper again doing.

[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.920]
My house is in the middle of the sea.

[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.440]
We have a business person now that I'm going to watch the news.

[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:17.320]
Who should you advise?

[02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:19.520]
G-Way-Yeah.

[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:20.520]
And stick it.

[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:36.560]
A young man turns 28 before the sweetest bag.

[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:38.920]
I'll come the next day.

[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:44.820]
It's too many seeds in your dime bag.

[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:49.760]
Getting to the party to minutes to late.

[02:39:50.940 --> 02:39:51.900]
Isn't it the chronic?

[02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:54.000]
I don't think so.

[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:54.640]
Don't you think?

[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:56.840]
It's last day.

[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:03.260]
When you left the holy break, the free bag.

[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:07.160]
But you're already late.

[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:09.200]
You could leave.

[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:12.920]
That you kept seeing in the day.

[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:17.280]
Who would have gone to jail?

[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:21.080]
I'm not drowning.

[02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:23.640]
That you already ate.

[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:25.120]
I know.

[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:27.200]
John is dying.

[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.780]
I love her, she's in pain.

[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:35.600]
It's like 10,000 joints when all you need is a light.

[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:38.460]
It's like having a feel of your pain.

[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.240]
And then finding out we trust in delight.

[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:44.380]
And isn't it the chronic?

[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:45.280]
Yes.

[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:45.420]
It's the chronic.

[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:47.160]
Don't you think?

[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:50.920]
A little too much for it.

[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:53.680]
Yeah, I really do think.

[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:55.300]
It's my brain.

[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:01.300]
When you left the holy break, the free bag.

[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:05.520]
When you're already late.

[02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:07.440]
You could leave.

[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:11.080]
That you kept seeing in the day.

[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:14.760]
Who would have gone to jail?

[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:19.060]
You got to travel 800 hosts on our survey.

[02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:20.220]
We got 724.

[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:21.680]
27 minutes to go.

[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:22.620]
Can we do it?

[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:24.040]
We can do it 800.

[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:27.900]
Pretty sad when we got to be shooting for 800, isn't it?

[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:28.220]
Oh well.

[02:41:28.420 --> 02:41:28.880]
That's just the summer.

[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:29.660]
Yeah.

[02:41:30.140 --> 02:41:30.920]
And we don't have a surprise.

[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:32.320]
It's going to be on our website.

[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:33.240]
No more naked pictures.

[02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:39.420]
A federal jury yesterday convicted Sandy goes new acting mayor and a city councilman

[02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:43.500]
of taking payouts from a strip club owner to help repair a no touching law at new clubs.

[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:46.160]
The latest blow to a city of Washington scandal.

[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:49.680]
Oh, they got problems.

[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:54.280]
Michael Zouquette, who became interim mayor over the weekend, was found fairly of conspiracy

[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:57.080]
extortion and fraud on his first day of business in office.

[02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.640]
He was immediately suspended from the position.

[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:05.180]
Councilman Raff in Nunza, who was convicted of the same charges, was also suspended, suspended

[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:05.820]
a sentence.

[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:10.560]
The jury also returned to early verdicts against former club candidate of the committee, Lance

[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.220]
Malone, who worked for strip club owner Michael Galardi to repeal Sandy, who was banned,

[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:17.940]
preventing new dances and payments from touching each other to repeal a hurt failed.

[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:20.300]
It is still unclear who will succeed.

[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:24.360]
Zouquette is commissionally the city rudderless of one of the most trouble points in his history.

[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.060]
Mayor Dick Murphy resigned left office Friday, a month into a second term cut short by mounting

[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:29.540]
problems.

[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.440]
It sounds like they're mounting a lot of things out there.

[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.840]
They have mounting problems.

[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.180]
And everyone, they're certain that people on our poll today also have the same thing.

[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:40.520]
They have mounting problems.

[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:45.780]
Eric Burman in the nation writes, first versus science.

[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.540]
That Bill Frissman, he walks out, anybody who's in the fristing, look out.

[02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:55.060]
Last night, the Republican nominee at House of Representatives voted to loosen President Bush's

[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.200]
limits on embryonic stem cell research, allowing scientists to study cells derived from

[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:01.560]
sooner-be-discorded embryos at fertility clinics.

[02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:05.180]
Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans could pass them over legislation as soon as this

[02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:05.380]
week.

[02:43:05.740 --> 02:43:10.160]
Could serve as realized they were opposing a popular policy that could be used against them as a

[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:13.300]
wedge issue in midterm elections next year and again in 2008.

[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:18.200]
So Senate Majority Leader Bill Fist has divided an alternative that undermines science

[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.420]
while scoring political points.

[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:24.660]
In 2001, Fist came out in support of embryonic research calling the science a promising,

[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:26.100]
an important line of inquiry.

[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:31.300]
But a month later under pressure from Christian conservatives, President Bush learned federal

[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:35.680]
funding to already existing stem cell lines, which are few and number often already contended,

[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:37.420]
that first quickly fell in line.

[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:42.640]
Now, his so-called alternative would bypass ethical constraints by obtaining stem cells without

[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:43.740]
destroying embryos.

[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:47.420]
Only this method remains entirely unproven and is yet to appear in a Major Scientific

[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:50.440]
Medical Journal or clearly peer review process.

[02:43:51.020 --> 02:43:55.200]
Even scientists exploring this approach call the choice between supporting the bipartisan

[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:59.520]
legislation co-sponsored by Tom Harkin, our own inspector and Fist alternative, an old

[02:43:59.520 --> 02:43:59.920]
brainer.

[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.420]
We need to pass the Harkin Spectre Bill, Robert Lanza, West President of Medical and

[02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:07.680]
Scientific Research for Advanced Health Technology, Fold the Senate.

[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:10.980]
I don't think we should keep the scientific community or the patient community waiting.

[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:15.120]
The House may not have enough votes over why President Bush is fed a veto, which would be

[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:16.560]
the first, the Senate might.

[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:21.700]
As the undergoes chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, Spectre says he's manner than hell,

[02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:26.440]
watching Republican scholars legislation that can help researchers discover an eventual cure for cancer,

[02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:28.540]
Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease.

[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.260]
For a few chemotherapy treatments and see how you feel, Spectre told the AP, dismissing

[02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:37.840]
opposition from the GOP's morning and Christian base, the potential for stem cells has been held in a

[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:39.060]
bandage much too long.

[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:41.160]
And for once he happens to be...

[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:46.240]
I mean, that single magic bull is there we didn't work all too good, but this one may have

[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:46.860]
a stomonet.

[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:47.300]
Finally.

[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.600]
You're not looking to good these days, are you?

[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:50.320]
No, I saw with that.

[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.060]
That hairy looks like a chemo with therapy patient or something.

[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:54.120]
That's because he is.

[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:54.600]
I see.

[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:55.380]
Oh.

[02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:57.900]
Quad City's morning, Harkin.

[02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:00.040]
Now this couldn't be an employee of Clear Channel, couldn't it?

[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:00.280]
Huh?

[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:00.700]
Absolutely.

[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:07.780]
J. Scott, who co-hosted the top read morning show at Clear Channel's country, WLR Quad City,

[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:08.700]
Iowa, Illinois.

[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:13.560]
His off the year following his arrest on the number of felony child sexual abuse charges,

[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:14.780]
the 50...

[02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:20.960]
The 50-70-year-old Scott, whose real name is Aubrey Starcher, turned himself into Scott County,

[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:22.800]
Iowa law enforcement officials last week.

[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:27.720]
He faces two felony counts of lacivious acts with a child, and misdemeanor counts of an

[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:30.860]
decentist portion of the exhibition of obscene material to a minor, according to the molding

[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:31.660]
Illinois Dispatch.

[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:36.620]
The child in question is described as a seven-year-old female relative.

[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:38.900]
Okay.

[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:43.920]
Scott apparently asked the station for leave last week to attend personal issues, whereas

[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:49.260]
Scott off-guarded and shocked as anybody else, WLR GM Larry Roman Rasmillo told the news

[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:53.760]
analyst, the morning show for WLR, the market's top rating station is being hosted by Starcher's

[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:54.920]
co-host, Danielle.

[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.780]
A seven-year-old relative, no less.

[02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:02.420]
I mean, you know, as you read each word, it became a little bit more grotesque.

[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:03.000]
Sure.

[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:05.540]
Well, maybe that's that radio pedophile ring we keep hearing about.

[02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:06.020]
I was out of it.

[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:06.240]
It is.

[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:08.220]
After call, bloody evidence, and find out.

[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:09.480]
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:10.000]
You're fair.

[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:10.980]
You're simple, didn't you?

[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:11.440]
You idiot.

[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:12.300]
You're quizzling.

[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:13.900]
What do we got?

[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:14.280]
Seven?

[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:15.840]
Seven thirty nine.

[02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:16.760]
I don't think we're going to make it.

[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:17.600]
We don't make anything.

[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:17.660]

[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:18.540]
We're going to be divorced by two o'clock.

[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:19.600]
I'm out the rest of the week.

[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:22.200]
Now, that's a promise.

[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:24.040]
I mean, because this isn't even a vote.

[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:26.780]
This isn't even asking to put your thinking cap on, like a census.

[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:28.260]
And it's just a census.

[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:28.980]
It's a survey.

[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.580]
Our survey says, think this don't care enough this into great birth.

[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.980]
Or best worst, whatever.

[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:37.160]
The land of indifference, man, one good thing about South Florida,

[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:38.780]
nothing ever changes and never will.

[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:39.940]
It's just the same.

[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:42.340]
Oh, man, look at 60 cycle tone.

[02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:44.380]
Mmm, like that.

[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:47.180]
It just ludes drones right on.

[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.620]
21 till, oh, the British emoms are seeking a, issuing a fat wall condemning the violence.

[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:55.140]
And I heard a fat wall heard about that.

[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:56.700]
Yeah, there's today fat wall.

[02:46:57.420 --> 02:46:57.920]
A fat wall.

[02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.660]
You better watch out when the issue that's fat wall.

[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:01.380]
I wish I had a fat one.

[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:02.520]
Yeah, but you do.

[02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:04.800]
I know some guys got it well.

[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.180]
21 till 2 at QA and check out the area.

[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:10.940]
If you got a bald one, if you got a big bald spot on top,

[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:12.700]
you had a big shiny, ugly bald spot.

[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.800]
Totally like to help you see good by the way forever.

[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:18.840]
Because Charles Alfieery's been helping the famous and even the infamous and everybody in between.

[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:21.380]
Look, they're best for over 30 long years now.

[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:22.340]
About 30, man.

[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.440]
You wouldn't recognize Charlie's work when you see it because it looks like real hair.

[02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:26.080]
That's the key.

[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:26.980]
You know the difference.

[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.700]
You see those guys with those awful look and muskwads, those Nazi look and pieces.

[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:34.220]
And you laugh your ass off at them and say that's the worst wig I ever saw in my life.

[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:37.900]
But Charlie's new skin like hair system is 100% undetectable.

[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:39.680]
They look like it's ruined right out of your scale.

[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:41.200]
And Charlie's work is guaranteed.

[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:44.640]
You've got nothing to lose with that shiny bald spot that makes you look so old.

[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:47.300]
You try Charlie's system for a month for about 30 days.

[02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:48.300]
About 30, man.

[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.440]
And after a month, if you don't love the way listen feels and smells,

[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.560]
if you're not getting just tons of action solicited and otherwise,

[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:54.940]

[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.640]
Damn, I'm so pretty about you.

[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:27.920]
I'm just being right here.

[02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:31.820]
Please, and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God.

[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:35.400]
I'm not trying to be rude under a shirt, I'm feeling you.

[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:37.260]
The way you do the things you do.

[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.060]
Just stay away from you.

[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:43.000]
Promise me that you never tell me videos and I won't tell you.

[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:46.220]
I was great space at the heat cause it showed to me.

[02:48:46.220 --> 02:48:47.260]
I'll give you that.

[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:48.980]
I'll thank you, man.

[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:53.140]
Well, it has to my front only for the evening.

[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:54.760]
So, it's not a story.

[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:57.160]
It's all for most action probation.

[02:48:57.640 --> 02:48:59.080]
Ain't no guilty, I'm a shame.

[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:00.840]
To the moon, it is a risk.

[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.340]
So I can keep my fridge and sit with my cloak and rug.

[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:06.160]
You saw for years it's not done.

[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:07.940]
Look out for a quick plea bottle.

[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.720]
So I can hide you so far.

[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:10.520]
Yeah.

[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:18.000]
16-2, 16-2, building.

[02:49:18.260 --> 02:49:20.300]
You know what he's going to do if you don't know he's for you today.

[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:21.840]
That's when I'm here and that's when we're on the building.

[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:22.960]
Okay.

[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:25.280]
That's when we're around the our neck of the woods.

[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:28.720]
Doug Thompson who writes the rant on capital Hill.blue.

[02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:30.280]
Your very favorite website.

[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:32.880]
Got a good article as usual.

[02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:34.860]
When I say capital Hill on blue.com,

[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:35.940]
is that what I say is either that.

[02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:36.960]
Yes, that's what I should have said.

[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:40.140]
More dishonesty from an dishonest president he writes today.

[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:43.720]
President George W. Bush got another chance Monday to prove he was his

[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:44.400]
bitters his word.

[02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:47.280]
Once again, he failed to keep a promise made to the American people.

[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:51.700]
In September 2003, Bush said he would fire anyone in the White House called

[02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:54.800]
linking the name of CIA operative Valerie Plain to the media.

[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:59.120]
He repeated the promise in June 2004 saying flat out that any administration

[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.960]
official founder will talk to the press about Plain will be dismissed immediately.

[02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.940]
That however was before his closest advisor, Carl Rove, got caught by the

[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:09.800]
mayor of giving the information to time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper,

[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:13.440]
who also identified vice president Richard Cheney's chief of staff as the

[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:14.680]
secondary source for the league.

[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:16.020]
Scooter Libby.

[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:20.400]
Now, dubiousing in a different tune, upping the stated by saying he'll

[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.380]
fire anyone convicted of a crime.

[02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:25.480]
Anyone who knows the devil's standard of justice in Washington knows there's

[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:28.080]
little chance he'd roped for anybody else in the administration getting

[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.820]
hauled into a courtroom much less convicted.

[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:34.220]
So, Bush who promised Americans the most ethical administration history gives

[02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:37.160]
Rove and the rest of his gang a walk for linking classified information to a

[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:40.440]
reporter as part of a Plain White House plot of revenge against a public

[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:41.280]
critic of the president.

[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:46.220]
It appears that the administration of came to office promising honesty and integrity

[02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:49.960]
and will avoid legalisms as not defining ethical standards downwards that

[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:53.200]
representative John Carmier's emission in his White House and currently no

[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:57.640]
able be fired or forced to resign unless and until the jail cell doors locked behind him.

[02:50:58.420 --> 02:51:02.020]
Bush has a long history of association with criminals from Enron Conman,

[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:05.340]
Kenny Lay, to scandal-widden House Majority Leader Tom Delay.

[02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:09.580]
His vice president still underinvestigates in Europe for bribery and payoffs while serving

[02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:12.920]
a CEO of Halliburton, the same Halliburton that's ripped off the U.S. government

[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:16.620]
with millions of dollars in overcharges through its no-big contracts in Iraq.

[02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:19.640]
Honesty is a foreign concept of Bush.

[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.540]
He lied to Congress and the American people to try to justify an illegal invasion of Iraq

[02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:27.560]
or to the Environmental Protection Agency if lied to New Yorkers about toxic substances

[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:30.820]
in the air after the Align Love of the Tax and lied again when he promised to

[02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:33.900]
not have any one card leaking information on the wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson,

[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:37.860]
a career diplomat whose only crime was looking objectively as the administration's

[02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:41.860]
high claims about a recruiting purchase in Africa and saying the president croaked the facts.

[02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:46.840]
A new poll for ABC News is only about 25% of the American people believe Bush is

[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:51.100]
being honest about the claim affair down from 50% when the investigation began.

[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:54.900]
Think of it. Only a quarter of Americans out there think the president of the United States

[02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:58.940]
is honest, then making three quarters of them know Bush for what he is, a liar.

[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:03.580]
I can't speak for the rest of you, but I don't much like the idea of a liar occupying the White House.

[02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:07.700]
I don't like the fact that a liar who did everything in his part to avoid serving his country in a war zone

[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:10.560]
now sends Americans to fight and die in a war based on lies.

[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:14.220]
It pushes not going to keep his word and fire Carl Roe for any other

[02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:17.160]
administration official caught him in a shameful, Valerie Plain affair.

[02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:21.660]
There's still one thing left he can do to serve the best interest of the American people, fire himself.

[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:24.460]
Holding your breath now, right? Everybody inhale.

[02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:26.160]
Funny. That's why I go say inhale.

[02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:29.500]
What's speaking of inhaling and van Haling?

[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:33.240]
Amsterdam police arrest the swimming burglar.

[02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:38.800]
Okay. Amsterdam police arrested a fugitive burglar after he attempted to escape by

[02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:40.980]
diving into a canal in the early hours of yesterday.

[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:41.880]
Oh man!

[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:46.960]
Woo! Talk about desperate. If you could see the water with those canals, their tails.

[02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:50.860]
I mean brown. There's only one thing in the world is brown well anyway.

[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.660]
Amsterdam's scenic canals are flushed nightly and not believed to harbor diseases,

[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:58.440]
but people are strongly discouraged from swimming in them.

[02:52:58.840 --> 02:53:02.060]
We go in the water if we absolutely have to, but we'd rather not,

[02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:05.100]
since spokesman Leo Dirtland in this case it wasn't necessary.

[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:09.320]
A paraplegic on patrol recognized the 21-year-old man whose name was that released on the street,

[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:13.640]
they were interviewing about an unserved prison sentence when he suddenly died in the canal.

[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:18.080]
He attempted to elude arrest by swimming underwater and surfacing in unexpected places

[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:21.440]
at one point he climbed out of the roof of a flower booth bordering the canal,

[02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:23.620]
then dive back into the water when police approached.

[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:27.620]
In the end, in the end, back home he surrendered a lot of self-to-be,

[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:29.160]
and he was placed out of the water.

[02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:33.780]
Wow, what a disgusting thought. Talk about subject time.

[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:37.600]
Maybe that's what that aroma is in the building. Is it still stink?

[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:39.600]
It seems to have passed.

[02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:45.340]
Oh, so to speak, no pun intended.

[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:48.360]
Fairfax Virginia, the woman who allegedly kept almost 500

[02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:50.040]
we had this story a few last week I think.

[02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:53.240]
The woman who allegedly kept nearly 500 cats in two Fairfax County houses,

[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:55.140]
agreed yesterday not to have any more pets.

[02:53:55.360 --> 02:54:00.100]
Oh, thank goodness. Ruth Canoven, 82, agreed to sign a quarter-order in district court yesterday

[02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:02.260]
that bands are promoting any animals.

[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:06.300]
Canoven spoke only once during the hearing, but she asked the judge to let her make a statement

[02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:09.280]
because criminal charges are pending the judge said, don't do it.

[02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:10.840]
She laid a decline to speak to reporters.

[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.780]
During raids this month, a convict's mother in a home

[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:16.780]
and her daughter's townhouse in Burke Fairfax County,

[02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:19.920]
police found 488 cats nearly half of them dead.

[02:54:20.220 --> 02:54:23.360]
Oh, that's a good news. The rest were so ill they had to be put to sleep.

[02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:24.860]
So we turned to court in October.

[02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:25.840]
I don't know, she...

[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:28.460]
Yeah, there's...

[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:31.140]
I'm gonna call Peter on her.

[02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:32.780]
Peter...

[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:35.320]
I'm gonna call Peter Boulger, they deserve him.

[02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:39.540]
After Colin Ferrell, the suey woman for allegedly trying to distribute and profit

[02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:43.120]
from a sex tape he says that she recorded with the agreement that they would never make it too big.

[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:45.800]
The lawsuit filed yesterday in Superior Court in LA,

[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:47.620]
she's general and compensatory damages,

[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:50.300]
as well as a temporary restraining order and injunction

[02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:52.760]
for herding the cell and exploitation of the videotape.

[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.260]
Ferrell 29 accuses Nicole Narein, a private distributor, to take through an intermediary,

[02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:59.620]
that she had an intimate relation two and a half years ago

[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:02.460]
and both agreed to 15 minutes tape that shows the couple having sex

[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:05.300]
would be jointly owned by them, would remain private, corner-to-soup.

[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:07.480]
Narein cannot be reached for comment.

[02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:10.460]
A call to a phone number listed for her revealed that number has been disconnected.

[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:11.380]
How unusual.

[02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:14.580]
A message was referrals attorney was named by a media to reach her Monday.

[02:55:15.460 --> 02:55:19.880]
The lawsuit also accused a 30-winner of working with the owner of Internet pornography business

[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:22.040]
and contacting the news media about the tape.

[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:25.800]
Defendants out of range of the time to capitalize on the celebrity of plaintiff Colin Ferrell

[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:27.840]
through their unauthorized commercial hospitalization

[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:33.040]
the highly private and confidential videotape exceeds all bonds of common human decency laws who have said it.

[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:37.900]
Ferrell who starred in SWAT, Alexander, decided to appear in the New World and Miami Vice

[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:41.880]
if the name were to be sexist men alive by people magazine and has a son with model Kim,

[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:44.200]
bored, bored and obv, is that her name?

[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:44.740]
I don't know.

[02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:46.480]
Bored a Kim, bored, or like that.

[02:55:47.220 --> 02:55:50.260]
He's been named more the sexist men alive by people magazine, which means he probably,

[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:52.140]
and he actually is, pretty or ugly.

[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:54.240]
And he can't act.

[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.340]
Other than that, he's dynamite, dynamite.

[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:02.740]
One of the best customers at the Chocolate Moose Restaurant in Farman, Indiana has never been inside the door.

[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:10.040]
Missy Joe, a 60-pound bulldog mess, comes with owner Tony Mills 51 of the restaurant for a daily treat of plain cheeseburgers

[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:11.780]
and vanilla milkshakes on the patio.

[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:15.600]
The tradition started seven years ago when Mills was moving his father's lawn,

[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:18.420]
noticed a barking dog nest during the town 50 miles east of Muncie.

[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:23.700]
Mills took a break and walked out of the restaurant, ordered a dog of cheeseburger and fed her over the fence, the barking stopped.

[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:27.500]
Eventually, Mills became acquainted with the dog's owners and for three years,

[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.640]
every time he moved his father's lawn or went over to visit, he took a cheeseburger along for Missy Joe.

[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:35.840]
In June, in 2001, the dog's owner's moved and couldn't take the dog to their new home,

[02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:37.920]
so Mills asked if he could have her and the owner's agreed.

[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:41.080]
All of the dog may like the special treats, and Mills vet doesn't approve.

[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.500]
He doesn't think it's the best idea in the world he said, but Missy Joe acts like she's just fine.

[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:46.420]
Oh, where far?

[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:48.940]
She has an oil clog in the arteries and just clops over dead.

[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:53.520]
So if there's a barking dog in the hood, just give it a cheeseburger.

[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:54.660]
Oh, I see that cheeseburger.

[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:56.600]
They screwed him up, but didn't we know there was a least?

[02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:57.040]
You see that?

[02:56:57.220 --> 02:56:57.640]
No, I did that.

[02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.840]
So not only did Vick and Herbs go the way to Lin.

[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:03.000]
But she's a herchiever, who wants you to know more?

[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:04.440]
Can you read there?

[02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:05.140]
No.

[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:06.040]
I've eaten the pound.

[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:07.100]
And?

[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:08.360]
It's good.

[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.240]
I got my picture on the wall.

[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:11.260]
It was good.

[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:12.000]
Yeah.

[02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:13.020]
Then have we known your least?

[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:13.940]
Did you hear what I just said?

[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:17.000]
I'll have to see, because there's one right there in Coralspring.

[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:17.920]
Oh, I'll be there.

[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.840]
Oh, maybe this is the one for Lauderdale.

[02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:20.680]
So maybe it's just one.

[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:21.540]
So lamenté, uno.

[02:57:22.540 --> 02:57:25.700]
Laud 52 at 5, 60 WDQM TV's got a new schedule.

[02:57:26.020 --> 02:57:26.260]
Yours.

[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.320]
The man is an exciting new feature that's been added to Comcast Digital Table, and you

[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:33.960]
can try today for only 29.99 a month for three months.

[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:36.940]
Comcast on demand puts TV on your terms.

[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.440]
Nighting shoes from the library shows with over 3,000 hours of free movies.

[02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:43.320]
TV shows, kids shows, sports, special interest programs.

[02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:48.020]
From a variety of TV shows and extra charts for a huge library of movies that you used to

[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:48.980]
pay forth at a video store.

[02:57:49.540 --> 02:57:51.860]
Comcast on demand will change the way you watch TV.

[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:56.100]
Plus you can start them whenever you like, whether it's 917 in the morning, 11.23 at night, whenever.

[02:57:56.100 --> 02:58:00.140]
Plus with HBO on demand, you can have an entire library of programming of HBO,

[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:04.840]
original series and movies, registered finger tips, all free with your subscription to HBO.

And don't forget about control with on demand.

[02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:10.740]
You can start, stop, pause, rewind, fast forward programs using that remote.

[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:13.700]
And if you only have basic cable of the dish, press me, you're missing out.

[02:58:14.100 --> 02:58:18.980]
So make them move to Comcast Digital Table with a part of on demand called 954 Comcast,

[02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:25.940]
or 305 Comcast today, and get yourself Comcast Digital Table on HBO for just 29.99 a month for three months.

[02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:32.500]
And certain restrictions apply call for details in Broward 9454 Comcast or, indeed, 305 Comcast.

[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:35.160]
7.604.

[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:36.280]
Leave your story.

[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:38.340]
Support for your bike's adventure.

[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:39.720]
It's ready.

[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:41.700]
Brad Pitt God.

[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:47.740]
I'm constantly stressed by a displacement with leaf, particularly late supply supply information.

[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:49.960]
And I want to know, I want to know the truth.

[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:53.500]
I want to see through it, get the truth to read.

[02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:58.280]
Now it seems to us that don't do just what he said.

[02:58:59.260 --> 02:59:01.420]
Words and not just words.

[02:59:01.820 --> 02:59:08.500]
When an agent might get killed Mr. President, will you do just what you said?

[02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:14.700]
And Bob Cobb, Comro, wrote for his reason, David.

[02:59:15.020 --> 02:59:17.720]
You said that podium and said, the Comro was not involved.

[02:59:18.200 --> 02:59:20.540]
We don't want to see Carl No more.

[02:59:20.540 --> 02:59:23.440]
We don't want the country to pay for him.

[02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:26.400]
We'll be sacred if you kick in the door.

[02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:28.460]
Wish you will make the White House more.

[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:32.180]
It's contrary to what you told the American people.

[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:36.740]
If you didn't keep talking about his life, they would be able to be trying to talk about this.

[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:38.500]
And now it's time to talk about it.

[02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:40.340]
By my mind!

[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:42.520]
Wait a minute, what the hell was that?

[02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:43.640]
Oh, that sounded like the exit.

[02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:45.240]
Huh?

[02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:46.580]
Ready to go?

[02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:48.000]
Ready to go what?

[02:59:48.520 --> 02:59:49.240]
Go away.

[02:59:51.460 --> 02:59:52.360]
That was it.

[02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:54.620]
Why do you always sit right in with the ambiance, you're everything?

[02:59:54.900 --> 02:59:58.600]
No, I was refreshing the thing there and I noticed we got a minute and a half,

[02:59:58.740 --> 02:59:59.840]
so we're not going to make our 800.

[03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:00.200]
No.

[03:00:01.500 --> 03:00:02.540]
And what do you go like that?

[03:00:02.620 --> 03:00:02.800]
No.

[03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:05.680]
Well, because I thought we were and I'm disappointed it worked out.

[03:00:05.680 --> 03:00:08.040]
7.78 and it's not even a poll!

[03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:09.400]
It's just a survey!

[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:12.840]
I think you've driven all those finds away, George.

[03:00:13.660 --> 03:00:14.520]
Look at that.

[03:00:14.700 --> 03:00:16.280]
They're trickling in one at a time.

[03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:16.940]
Why not so, okay?

[03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:20.680]
They're dribbling in just dribbling in on our sex survey.

[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:21.800]
Which of these applies to you?

[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:24.240]
I think generally speaking, it's like, come on, come on, come on, come on like that!

[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:25.760]
Very sad.

[03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:27.620]
How do mighty have fallen.

[03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:28.560]
Can you believe it?

[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:32.040]
Yeah, well, to the season.

[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:36.660]
And I got to say that another email about to be to curtain just now during that last break.

[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:39.520]
You know, I take to be to curtain and shove it in your head.

[03:00:39.580 --> 03:00:41.620]
In fact, maybe you got some of those evil love beads.

[03:00:41.660 --> 03:00:42.940]
Back home, but she's all hanging around.

[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:43.340]
Remember those?

[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:44.140]
I do the round the wall.

[03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:47.640]
There are some of those pistol-themed vibrators that your buddy used to hand out.

[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:49.980]
Get some help, boy, do please.

[03:00:50.100 --> 03:00:50.640]
I have no right.

[03:00:50.740 --> 03:00:51.320]
Beated curtain.

[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:52.500]
We can't do it no more.

[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:53.860]
Okay, that's the fascist USA.

[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:55.880]
That's the government you live under.

[03:00:55.940 --> 03:00:56.500]
I have no right.

[03:00:56.800 --> 03:00:57.300]
Get with it.

[03:00:57.600 --> 03:00:59.060]
Okay, we got Beldy coming along, man.

[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:01.880]
He's gonna do it, do it, do it, his way from 2 to 4.

[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:02.840]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:04.120]
What a chance to entertain.

[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.560]
It's Neil Rogers mid-days.

[03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:07.460]
What, what, what, what?

[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:08.680]
It's not really your body system.

[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:10.500]
Give it to QA and it's my image.

[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:11.180]
Fort Lauderdale.

[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:11.360]
Yeah!

[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:12.040]
Yeah!

[03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:12.760]
Yeah!

[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:13.180]
Yeah!

[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:15.600]
Toot toot toot toot.
