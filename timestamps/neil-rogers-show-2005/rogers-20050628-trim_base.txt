[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.540]
Time for a new agent, Neil or Laura.

[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.100]
I don't care.

[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.500]
I'm not getting a new agent because of what I got.

[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.520]
He's just tragic.

[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.300]
And you know, I don't care anymore.

[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.540]
I got this nice gig here.

[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.160]
What's the problem?

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:35.760]
Right.

[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.660]
If you don't like Joe Henry, don't listen to him.

[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]
I sure don't and wouldn't.

[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.420]
He was funny for about, I don't know, six months, long time ago.

[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.960]
Here's the uphold today.

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.380]
I like this pool.

[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.240]
And we haven't done exactly this one.

[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.300]
Now somebody will call and say, well, you didn't want to worry a similar

[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.480]
about three and a half years ago.

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.260]
We didn't know it was too bad.

[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.020]
We were talking before the show today about the winers and complainers.

[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.620]
Just like the Beacon Curtain, I gave you like two weeks advance notice on that.

[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.260]
I told you that as of June 23rd, no more beaten Curtain, no more nudied pictures, not

[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.380]
because we're too lazy to do it or we don't want to do it, but because we can't do it.

[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.500]
I don't think any of us really feels that it's worth going to jail or something like that

[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.040]
or getting into a big jackpot so that we can put some naked pictures on our stupid ass

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.480]
website.

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.780]
Okay.

[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:14.940]
It's just a worth a grief.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.400]
If you want to find naked pictures on the internet, you can't find it, but you need

[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.540]
some serious help.

[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.140]
But we got that element of the audience out there and we got the whole South Florida

[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:23.500]
syndrome.

[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.600]
And of course, after having been there for three and a half days last week, I can easily

[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.560]
understand why a lot of people are sour and bitter and make a lot of sounds.

[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.540]
If I had to say there, I'd be going like that all the time too.

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.340]
What a place.

[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.720]
There's one word to describe South Florida.

[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.400]
You know what it is?

[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.960]
Well, I got a few swamp.

[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:40.460]

[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:40.740]
Okay.

[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.980]
It's a big swamp.

[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.600]
For a minute, I got it.

[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.440]
It started pouring and thundering and lightning and dark.

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.340]
At three in the afternoon, it looked like about three in the morning.

[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.540]
It was a pitch black.

[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.480]
It was just nasty.

[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.940]
And it was that way for like most of the time I was there.

[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.260]
So you enjoy yourself.

[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:01.040]
Well, if the sun was shining here, by the way, as Christina would say, it's beautiful.

[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.540]
That would work on me.

[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.200]
I guarantee you.

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.340]
Here's the poll today.

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.600]
What singer or I can't believe the Josh Corte is doing like cold stone cream.

[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.460]
I just cannot.

[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.360]
I just they I just had a bad experience.

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:10.860]
That's all right.

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.220]
Well, go back and give it another shot.

[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:12.540]
Okay.

[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.340]
You're going to forget the calories.

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.540]
You don't have to worry about that now.

[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.780]
But I would go back and give it a try.

[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.640]
Because the other people are men who want to turn you into one of them.

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.820]
No, no, but why are you still can enjoy?

[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.680]
And I'm not saying go there and keep picking on every day, but you will be come addicted.

[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.220]
That's true.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.100]
Like I said, don't go there.

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.680]
Diabetes.

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.780]
They smush it all up right and funny.

[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.640]
I can't wait to show.

[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.940]
I will go over there next time to see it for myself.

[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.380]
Man, it is just.

[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.040]
Oh, just so rich.

[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.960]
What singer or group is the most overrated of all time?

[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.780]
We asked here's what we got so far 286 286 votes.

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.220]
Madonna is leading 50 M and M 40.

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.560]
Wait, it's just flip flops.

[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.040]
You see that?

[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.880]
Right in mid sentence of flip flop.

[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.180]
We got a flat footed tie M and M 52.

[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.740]
Madonna 42 52.

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.340]
Barbara Streisand 44.

[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.620]
Elvis 40.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.920]
Have you ever crossed eyes with Barbara?

[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:56.860]
No.

[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.040]
She can do it by herself.

[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:58.900]
Elvis 40.

[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.040]
Frank Sinatra 36.

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.520]
Doobie Doobie Doobie Doobie Doobie.

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.120]
George Lysette Park, The Doobie Doobie Park.

[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.600]
Bob Dylan 24 talking about whiners.

[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.660]
Stone's 15.

[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.840]
18 and 13.

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.240]
Hey.

[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:08.960]
They're out of gas.

[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.240]
Beatles 12 and Phil Collins has only seven.

[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.360]
I didn't even know we put him on there yet.

[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.240]
I was a little bit of a hit.

[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:13.720]
I came up with that.

[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.000]
And let's hear it for Judge Mo.

[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.460]
Oh.

[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.660]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:18.960]
You're mo.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.160]
Judge Mo.

[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.820]
You go, Mo.

[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.840]
Says, hey, you know, it's a July 1st.

[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.740]
And I think we've, the people voted on you idiots.

[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.540]
Here's a judge with a pair of balls.

[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.400]
Lys go on.

[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.260]
And July 1st, by the way, happens to be on Friday last time

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:30.580]
I checked.

[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:31.940]
Friday.

[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.260]
That's what the thing said.

[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:33.760]
People voted.

[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.340]
They said and proud.

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.100]
We want to slots.

[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.260]
We know exactly the ones we're voting on.

[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.260]
The Vegas style slots.

[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.640]
Not these phony, baloney slots.

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.600]
We want the real ones.

[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.460]
We say yes by a pretty big margin.

[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.400]
And the governor and legislature think they can keep

[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.680]
like sandbagging a public every time they have a vote.

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.340]
And a judge says, I don't think so.

[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.300]
So you just go ahead and do it.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.460]
And I'll, if the government doesn't want to do it,

[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.240]
I'll make up the rules.

[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.420]
I'll make the regulations nice.

[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:54.900]
Go on, Mo.

[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.760]
Do do do do do.

[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.980]
Do I tell you I always love Mo all the time?

[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.860]
Mo, Mo to man.

[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.480]
Now again, most overrated of all time,

[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.900]
we can have like 10,000 on here.

[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.900]
Oh, before we do that.

[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.440]
So I found this disc.

[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.080]
I was actually looking for something else

[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.040]
that I found several this with jingles.

[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.960]
That I mean, if you're like in the 60s or 70s,

[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.580]
you lived anywhere like in the Midwest.

[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.300]
Not just in Detroit, but in the Midwest,

[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.520]
you could hear CKLW with a big 50,000-what signal.

[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.380]
And they've got 80 million jingles on here

[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.380]
that Bokobryne sent me.

[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:22.680]
We're longer.

[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.260]
And the one that really just knocks me out

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.040]
is the new sound.

[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:25.720]

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.300]
Yeah.

[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:29.500]
Punchy.

[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.920]
Oh, that sounds important.

[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:38.600]
Yeah.

[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.660]
How do you like that?

[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.820]
So I got all the interspersed audio's at jingles.

[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:50.540]
From music CKLW.

[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.140]
我 cornered.

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.060]
I go cornered.

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.420]
Duffing, uh, the ever谢谢.

[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.180]
I believe I've been the sincerelyowe

[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:10.080]
and until I fall in.

[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.540]
CKLW

[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.040]
I'm not sure if I can play a good song after it next time.

[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.720]
Oh, come on.

[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.720]
It's great in a very amusing way in a humorous way.

[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.160]
Not as good as that.

[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.540]
I'm thinking again what that is, right?

[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.080]
I don't tell me we added another break already.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.900]
I don't want to get behind now because I'm out of practice a little bit this future.

[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.000]
And then we got another damn one of these shows on Thursday.

[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:39.600]
Jesus.

[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.880]
And there's a little bit too much here.

[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.460]
Kind of like the ease back into it, like maybe one a week.

[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.340]
26 past 10 and 5 60 WQM.

[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.420]
Don't forget we got the mole-mice.

[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.800]
That's the top of the stuff.

[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.120]
The man is going to rip George and ask these.

[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.040]
Got some of my guests on.

[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.060]
I think he's got Casey Stingel's great grandmother is going to be on.

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.160]
From the other side, he sure can get those guests, can he?

[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.360]
Get pushed.

[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.660]
Put the move.

[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.940]
People in Middle East must be assured that we will invest a good fall.

[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.040]
Now it seems to me that they know just what to say.

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.720]
That we will find out the truth.

[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.860]
Talking points not words.

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.560]
Can you make this garbage hell?

[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.120]
Now I swear to you if they didn't always stop this way.

[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.300]
Rebeating what's not real till we buy it baby.

[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.980]
They will know the truth just like the American citizens.

[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.980]
I don't want to be lied to no more.

[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.080]
I just want to be a patriot.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.300]
I don't want to fight another fine-win war.

[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.620]
I'll make my grandkids pay for it.

[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.160]
I don't want to be angry no more.

[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.780]
You know that we should never stand for the election.

[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.180]
When they tell us that it's true, don't be so sure.

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.600]
I don't want to be lied to anymore.

[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.960]
In my state of the Union, our state, my speech of the nation.

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.000]
I'm dying over here.

[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.000]
1032, Bozo will be on again tonight to tell us things are going just right.

[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.980]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.300]
We're really out of like, butch up a little bit in the hop-on board.

[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.960]
And we say no thanks.

[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.280]
It's exploding flowers in candy that they're throwing at us.

[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.360]
56670560, 0.560 in the Verizon Singular Revis line.

[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.400]
What's a singer or group most overweighted about time?

[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.120]
Now the question isn't just name a group or a singer that sucks.

[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.220]
Yes it is.

[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.340]
Well I see. Just name somebody.

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.660]
One person.

[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.740]
How many groups in Singular?

[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.820]
How about Huey the Anno Smith?

[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.840]
See, there's a good example.

[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.360]
But nobody ever rated him as a singer, a good or bad, just a funny guy.

[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.720]
So in other words, somebody that really is already rated very, very great.

[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.500]
And you think really not so great.

[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.480]
56670, I give that number out.

[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.660]
I don't think we can look at a lot of calls.

[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.140]
How are your calls been this so nice week?

[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:43.840]
Ah, you know.

[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:44.600]
Oh, I do.

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.080]
Come on.

[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.960]
I see.

[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.480]
WKYM, hello.

[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.560]
First one right out of the box.

[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.680]
Here it is.

[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.640]
He's waiting for the drone there.

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.920]
Oh, something happened here.

[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.500]
Oh, please don't tell us that this is the thing.

[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.020]
What do you mean by that?

[00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.120]
There's a procedure there.

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.360]
I guess we must have had a power out or something.

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.080]
Oh, so in other words, you've got to do rituals involved.

[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.960]
What is that doing there?

[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.920]
Test it now.

[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.580]
Try it now.

[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.400]
Try it now?

[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.260]
No, it's just making a funny symbol.

[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.480]
I never saw that symbol before.

[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.140]
What is that?

[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.160]
What is that?

[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.000]
It's something.

[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.620]
We must have had a power outage.

[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.400]
Get the seed.

[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.700]
Don't make it in the pool.

[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.320]
And the funky symbol.

[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.300]
And when I punch it up, is it doing it on your end too?

[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:19.740]
Yeah.

[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.200]
It's not going to go.

[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.060]
I can't punch them up either one.

[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.480]
It's doing this.

[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:25.480]

[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:25.480]

[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:25.780]
We have to do this.

[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.060]
Try it.

[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.440]
Punch it up.

[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.100]
Number six there.

[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.940]
See what I'm on your end.

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.620]
You punch it up.

[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.700]
See there you go.

[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.540]
QA and hello.

[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.960]
Hey Steve from Fusion here.

[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:32.800]
Yes Steve.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.560]
I'll get out of here.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.200]
Steve you're an idiot.

[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.040]
No, no, come on.

[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.460]
Listen up.

[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:35.920]
Go away.

[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200]
See this isn't controlling these.

[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.040]
These aren't working now.

[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.380]
No, we got to do something.

[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.440]
What does that mean?

[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.780]
Because the lines are going to be like this.

[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.600]
We said our photo over here and hope that it takes.

[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.460]
See every time I punch it up, it comes up with a mushroom thing.

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:48.580]
Right.

[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.640]
It looks like a little mushroom.

[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.000]
We got to reset it.

[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.040]
You sure that?

[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.800]
How do you know that?

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.060]
Because it's happened before.

[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:54.720]
It has?

[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.180]
Yeah.

[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.460]
I've never seen this before.

[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.920]
And interestingly enough, remember I had the problem last day

[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.800]
a week ago Friday and I couldn't punch up any calls.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.020]
And come to find out again it was on your end on there.

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.760]
I don't want to say.

[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.000]
Yeah.

[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.500]
During the break when we reset our unit, you should reset your computer

[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.920]
so that they talk to each other properly.

[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.900]
I see.

[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.420]
Well why don't you punch up one or two?

[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.740]
QA and hello.

[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.440]
Hey, what's up?

[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:15.940]
I'm good now.

[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:16.740]
Yes sir.

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.420]
How are you doing?

[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.560]
Greetings from all of Hasse.

[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.000]
Tallahassee.

[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.340]
Yeah I'm listening to you guys online.

[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.140]
All right.

[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:22.780]
What's up?

[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.360]
Hey, I got one for your poll.

[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.080]
Bond Jolve.

[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.980]
Bond Jolve.

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:26.400]
Okay.

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.680]
A lot of people hate him.

[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.740]
It like poison.

[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.200]
You're right.

[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.320]
And Jorge, I got a movie to recommend.

[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.140]
It's called, maybe you've seen it's called The Battle of Outyears.

[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.700]
No, it was the old movie of the movie of 1967.

[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.340]
But it's very profetical.

[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.600]
It's going on right now with the war.

[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.300]
It's kind of interesting.

[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.280]
Just guys check it out.

[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:43.700]
All right.

[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.200]
It didn't.

[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:44.700]
All right.

[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.400]
I get you guys.

[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.160]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.900]
See, and you're going to have to like drop muck as I can do it.

[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.240]
I'm misunderstanding.

[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.300]
Now you're sure that it's not a, I don't know.

[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.980]
It's happened before, so hopefully it'll...

[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.960]
You're positive about that.

[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:55.540]
Of course.

[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.120]
I don't remember seeing that shroom on there.

[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.560]
Looks like something from Amsterdam.

[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.020]
That's the phone thing.

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.640]
Happens all the time.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.740]
Well punch up another one.

[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.880]
Just for practice.

[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.300]
QA.

[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.220]
I want for the poll.

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.060]
Yes sir.

[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.520]
Josh Beckett.

[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:08.820]
Excellent.

[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.000]
Excellent.

[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.480]
Well he wanted to keep it in that sports stuff thing, you know.

[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.500]
QA.M.

[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:15.740]
Hello.

[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.680]
Punch somebody up please.

[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.340]
Punch him in a mouth.

[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.020]
QA.M.

[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:18.820]
Hi.

[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.940]
Tom Teddy sucks.

[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.460]
Okay, thanks.

[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.100]
You're welcome.

[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.260]
Hey Tom.

[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.440]
You fairly like that.

[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:25.980]
I didn't know that.

[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:26.760]
What?

[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:27.500]
Okay.

[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.280]
Punch your out.

[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:28.560]
Please.

[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.000]
I keep hitting this thing out.

[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.260]
I don't realize it's not doing anything.

[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.240]
Do you think if I rebooted it now that we're working, you've got to do it on your own.

[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.260]
I think we have to do both.

[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.900]
I see.

[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.180]
Very disconcerting.

[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.480]
Anyway, here's some, it was almost good news, but then again, wow.

[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]
But a beep bit of a beep bit of a bump.

[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.860]
In separate opinions yesterday, the Supreme Court signal that the permissibility of government's

[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.700]
response to displays of the Ten Commandments depends on the circumstances.

[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.000]
If the exhibit appears to have been erected with religious purpose, if it's a religious erection,

[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.180]
it violates the Bill of Rights establishment clause prohibition on government's

[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.640]
sponsorship of a religion to five justices to send the case from Kentucky.

[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.760]
But in another case, another majority of justices is allowed to display in text the same that a religious display that is also historical

[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.660]
and its impact is permissible whatever the purpose of those who erected it.

[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.460]
And of course, if it has to do with religion, how can it really be historical?

[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.300]
Right.

[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.420]
Obviously it's quite hysterical.

[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.920]
Yeah.

[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.220]
With these and further opinions, the Court concluded its current term.

[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.400]
Chief Justice Rankway's to be treated for thyroid cancer and looks to appears to be only moments from death did not

[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.540]
announce his resignation to someone speculating he might.

[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.220]
So there he is.

[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.380]
They said, oh, you can't put those up unless we say it is.

[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.400]
Always these exceptions.

[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.640]
I feel like we ought to take the break.

[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.860]
Good thing I'm wrong.

[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.000]
No, you're correct.

[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.340]
Because this poll today requires a lot of building, man.

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.540]
And of course, you know there's poll building.

[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.380]
No, you're right.

[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.620]
Terminal in Pondorus.

[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.220]
I almost want to play some jingles.

[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:43.640]
CKW.

[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.440]
The Motor Seed.

[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.020]
How come that keeps coming up every time I hear that?

[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.120]
You're getting the keys up and off.

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.060]
Because I got other great songs on this list too.

[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:57.740]
Another one of those.

[00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:58.940]
Obviously.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.380]
Just for words.

[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:03.960]
No, I swear.

[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.500]
Give that a cook.

[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.460]
Just one word.

[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.960]
That's all we ask.

[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.440]
Just for words.

[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:08.860]

[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:08.860]

[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:08.860]

[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:09.240]

[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.200]
And I don't know.

[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.780]
That's a great song.

[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.800]
I like the other one.

[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.340]
I'm going to say hi.

[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.080]
But, huh?

[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.040]
But she's going to say hi.

[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.760]
Is that a drug route?

[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.520]
Whatever happened to her?

[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.320]
I was just asking somebody this morning.

[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.200]
How's Doris drooling?

[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.880]
And they looked at me like he died during his career.

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.820]
Did she die?

[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.460]
I don't know.

[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.240]
Let's find out.

[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:25.740]
I'll look out.

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.020]
21 to 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.180]
We have a little technical to figure.

[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.440]
They're picking up right where we left off.

[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:30.920]
Which is good.

[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.860]
The audience is used to that.

[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.160]
We've got them potty trained on that.

[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.840]
They say, oh, they're all screwed up again over there.

[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.340]
Yeah, we are.

[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.900]
Me, you.

[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.160]
Yeah.

[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.160]
Batman.

[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.680]
It was a comic strip.

[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.760]
Then a comic book.

[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:43.640]
Then a movie.

[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.760]
Then another movie.

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.400]
And another.

[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.260]
And another.

[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.000]
And so.

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.220]
Batman is coming the Broadway.

[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.880]
You've got to wear tight.

[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.260]
And a mask and keep it nice.

[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600]
Now, you can see the masked crusader as never before.

[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.680]
An effeminate man who prances around the stage in full costume.

[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.460]
Singing.

[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.940]
Here's what they're saying about Batman of musical.

[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.720]
And I think that it made me want to fly down the backboard.

[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.800]
Batman of musical.

[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.420]
It's the musical for people who love comics.

[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.420]
Tomorrow will fight crime.

[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.640]
Tomorrow.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.140]
Tomorrow will fight crime.

[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.200]
Tomorrow will fight crime.

[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:35.580]
1043.

[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.400]
Okay, let's see if this is working out.

[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.000]
Can you reboot?

[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:38.680]
Sure, no.

[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.680]
Can I reboot it?

[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.340]
Oh, no.

[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.760]
And now it's doing something even different.

[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.540]
Funky or more bizarre than was before.

[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:43.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.600]
I hate Josh having to do a thing again.

[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.300]
Turn it up.

[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.440]
Wait, don't do it yet, Josh.

[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:47.920]
All right.

[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.060]
What do we have to do with thing?

[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.940]
He has to do a thing.

[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.540]
And what is that?

[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.060]
I didn't even punch that one up.

[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.120]
Look at line nine now.

[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.840]
Josh has punched it up.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.400]
Yeah.

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:56.960]
Not right.

[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.480]
It's definitely screwed up.

[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.220]
That's uh-uh.

[00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.300]

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.180]
I think it will happen.

[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.620]
Should I go tell the engineer?

[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.540]
Yes, you're good.

[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.880]
Are you kidding me?

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.840]
Look at that.

[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.220]
I was.

[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.280]
He's hooked out that mushroom, man.

[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.800]
Anyway, here's this fact.

[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.440]
It said, well, here's Alex says, cold stone creamery is the best.

[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.520]
You're absolutely correct, Alex.

[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.460]
It's the best in the world.

[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.460]
Now, even the gelato in Italy and Germany, all this other stuff that I love.

[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.120]
Even the, uh, all these flavors I raved about, not even close.

[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.380]
He says, every time I go there, I go what is called birthday cake remix.

[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.940]
It's vanilla frosting or cake flavor ice cream with sprinkles and chunks of brown sugar.

[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.460]
I don't know that Alex was a brownie on it.

[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.280]
It is so freaking good.

[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.420]
He says, you are.

[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.800]
Absolutely correct.

[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.200]
It is the best bite I've ever seen.

[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.820]
Now, let's see what happens when you punch up a line.

[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.680]
Let's just see if this is a-

[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.580]
Oh, there's a line here.

[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.260]
A few A.M. Hello.

[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.100]
Hello, Neil.

[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:40.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.060]
I'm calling from New York.

[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.440]
Can you tell you about Larry King?

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.380]
You met him.

[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.140]
What was he like?

[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.280]
What is happening?

[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.780]
I met him in what was he like?

[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.060]
I mean, do you ever meet his daughter, Kaya King?

[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:55.760]
No.

[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760]
Can I do my Larry King impersonations?

[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.240]
I'm a cigar on a tatus.

[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.120]
Don't be trusted.

[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.100]
Very good one.

[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.620]
I like that.

[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.200]
Don't be trusted.

[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.520]
I grew up a poor Jewish kid from Brooklyn.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.740]
I went to high school with Cindy Kofax.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.160]
I was a cigar on a tatus.

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.440]
Yeah.

[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.140]
Why don't we care about this?

[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.600]
It was a very ziggler.

[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.300]
I mean, Larry King.

[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:16.900]
Larry Ziggler.

[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.820]
His son worked in WS News when I was there.

[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.000]
You know, he told me he once met you.

[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.020]
You want to show with Sergeant Matt Lemitch.

[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.700]
Yeah.

[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]
And he'd Larry King.

[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.400]
How was that in the show a couple of times?

[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.960]
Yeah, well, like I talked to Larry about 200 times.

[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.340]
And he told me.

[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.040]
That is great radio.

[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.620]
He told me that you came out of the closet one night on his show.

[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.060]
No.

[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.080]
I had already come out on my show on KIT.

[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.420]
Well, whatever, but it was afterward that he had me on the show.

[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.540]
Well, he, that's what he told me.

[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.660]
And he looked at me and he said,

[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.280]
You're fairy.

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.400]
The pretzel was a little insensitive on his part.

[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.160]
Well, listen, it's been ice-talking to you, but you lost.

[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.660]
Anyway, let's quit.

[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.580]
Yeah, there is this guy.

[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.700]
I don't want to hear his life story.

[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.360]
He went to high school with Sandy.

[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.080]
Co-fax.

[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.500]
He went, what do I think, Larry King?

[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.480]
Jesus.

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.900]
Like I said, maybe the fact that the phone is screwed up.

[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.260]
Now, what, what do you, you tell me that you've seen this before?

[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:01.740]
I never saw you.

[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.080]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.800]
You might have to do something over there on your end now.

[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.700]
Can you actually reach your own big black box?

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.900]
My own big black box?

[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.320]
What's that?

[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.200]
What do you, what do you talk about?

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.520]
The actual phone unit, not your little remote operating thing,

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.000]
but the big black phone unit itself.

[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.640]
I don't have one of those here.

[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.700]
That doesn't exist here.

[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.520]
No, I do not.

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.080]
Okay.

[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600]
I don't think I do.

[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.020]
Well, let me see.

[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.380]
If you want me to start crawling around the floor, I can do it.

[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:23.860]
Yeah, that'll be fun.

[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:24.320]
Okay.

[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.300]
Well, what about here?

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:27.900]
In the meantime.

[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.560]
Hey, get up off the floor.

[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.420]
We got something else you can do.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.000]
Okay.

[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.160]
I don't have the big black box.

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.320]
My little phone finger is plugged around the computer.

[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.280]
This bypasses the black box.

[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.160]
There's no such thing here.

[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.340]
All right.

[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.760]
Well, then here's what you need to do.

[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.120]
Yes.

[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.460]
You get the mouse that controls your phone screening.

[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:11.880]
Right.

[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:12.460]
All right.

[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.760]
And you go up to configuration.

[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.780]
You click on the configuration tab.

[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:18.900]
Yeah.

[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.080]
It says desktop director.

[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.600]
Right.

[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.120]
Click on whatever it should say.

[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:24.900]
DVD1 is checked.

[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.700]
DVD1 is checked.

[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.260]
We're looking.

[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.260]
I want to go to DVD2.

[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.300]
Well, put the mouse over mode.

[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.420]
Okay.

[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.320]
Which one is checked.

[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.800]
Neither one, because it's one of those you can't check.

[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.900]
Right, but there should be a, they're dimmed, but one of them should indicate checked.

[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.800]
Producer is checked.

[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.800]
Producer is checked.

[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:41.360]
Right.

[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:41.860]
He's telling.

[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.860]
Well, how am I going to change that?

[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.700]
Because it's, you can't click either one of them there.

[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:45.840]
Right.

[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.840]
Configuration, DVD, whatever is, whatever is checked, DVD1 or DVD2, check the other.

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.160]
Okay.

[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:52.880]
All right.

[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.400]
All right.

[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.120]
Not yet.

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.100]
Still comes up to set.

[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.520]
Well, but now tell of these checks.

[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.020]
Okay.

[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:57.660]

[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.860]
And I'm punching it up.

[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.740]
And nothing's happening.

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.540]
We might have to reset another you've done that.

[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.200]
And all right.

[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.720]
Who you means us.

[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.560]
Well, let me do it too.

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.520]

[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.080]
Okay.

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.600]
Boy, is this place screwed up or what?

[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.200]
Huh?

[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.940]

[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.840]
And where he's, he's eating buttered popcorn.

[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:20.980]
Okay.

[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.000]

[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:23.800]
I'll reboot it.

[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.120]
It says the moment got a hell of an ass kicking.

[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.280]
And why did they leave you off the SunCendles Internet's Ford's page pool?

[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.680]
Probably because I don't do a sports show.

[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.000]
Don't bring any more back. Thank you. You don't bring it over back you soon

[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.680]
I don't know why you're so sorry. I think it's a great bumper sticker. What's wrong with that George? You don't use them in either do I?

[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.480]
What does that mean you don't use bumper stickers? Well, how many did you bring?

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.180]
About eight or ten. Oh, I see I saw maybe brought like a thousand or something. No, no, no

[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.920]
They're just all those stickers I brought out when Clinton lied nobody died. I like that

[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.580]
I like it a lot. I think I've been by 10 15,000. We distribute them all over town

[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.100]
Absolutely, then sometimes later this week I'll get them by by there again

[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.240]
Okay, and I can make sure it's on a day when I'm on the year not George because he's sour about this

[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.820]
Okay, tonight's the whole warmonger is on TV. It's gonna be like Kevin Bacon at the end of animal house

[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.660]
Okay, thanks a lot, pal. I the phone works

[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.360]
Now did we have engineering get their fingers involved in this award?

[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.580]
Sure, that was good that we had I liked the fact we did this on the air that our guarantee one place didn't ever did that

[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.000]
History of rock and gold. Oh, that's not it

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.340]
That's what I meant they never did that and it probably just as well for at least we're in the same format now that that pull really

[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.440]
I shouldn't let it bother me, but it just goes to show you that you clowns over there at the Sun Centrel

[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.820]
Just like we did that pull. What was the pull always about what's it rich waltz and we never did get the one about

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:49.680]
Roxy foxy never got that one so they put it on there that and isn't it interesting that the ticket is in bed with the the

[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.320]
Harold and Sun Centrel should be well aware of that and we actually occasionally say something nice about the Sun Centrel on this show

[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:01.920]
Not no mo not after they put a phony pull in there that get loaded up by those now how come I don't understand how come our people didn't like

[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.220]
Respond, you know nobody like roll over all that we do have speaking a carless and people do like to roll over

[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:14.500]
We didn't have anybody on the air over here telling anyone to why not apparently the message in the station was to ignore it

[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:21.480]
Why is that oh my god? We need a wartime console area clearance, you know, whatever we need to not nothing's

[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.900]
Wusses that we got in there man. We got two powder puffs running around in that place

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.500]
This one's gonna roll over us like I like a Mac truck while we lay. Oh, okay

[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:36.240]
We will just ignore it. Well, you know, if you see it's a psychological thing that people look at that thing in a newspaper thing

[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.220]
Look at that everybody's to end the other station now these guys are history man. They're ancient. They're old

[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.400]
Which that part of it of course is true

[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.960]
This is the Neil Roger show

[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.160]
I

[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:09.040]
Don't any questions I guess the salary rather than just the ordinary clear of something for us. What do you think of Monica?

[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.260]
You know, she is a wonderful level headed young woman with experience

[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.160]
And I have a lot of respect for her judgment. Okay Atlanta. Hello. Oh, hi Hillary

[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:25.020]
My question for you is is it true? You used to wake up at 5 a.m. Every day and have sex with Bill

[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.760]
Just to make sure you were the first lady. Yes

[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.140]
Yeah, I did Tampa Florida. Hello, Hillary. I know you're over the age of 40

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:37.540]
So I wanted to know do you get your prostate checked off and absolutely do I do a good man

[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.920]
So when is your next schedule of prostate exam next year say Joseph Missouri hello

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.180]
Hillary I was wondering how many other women has your husband didn't listen to been married

[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.620]
I can't even begin to tell you about half the country

[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:56.380]
Well, how many interns are still now in today? You know, I think there are two and he's having a great time doing it

[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.200]
We'll take a break on the back with Hillary Clinton you're watching Larry King live don't go away

[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.740]
But third man, it's the level of two and five sixty we got the phone working that's here time for celebration

[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.240]
To show you how bogus this pool is there was another page that you just fixed me which sports radio talks your host

[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:19.080]
You prefer in the four to seven p.m. Slot Jim man is 44 and a half percent damn labaster to 55 and a half percent

[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.080]
I mean is there anybody in the right mind who blows that? Yes, serious

[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:30.360]
Dan labaster my ass. He's a talk show host like like you're a brain surgeon, okay? He's a talk show host like

[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.620]
Todd Reck is a sales guy

[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.420]
Anyway, get back to that. Oh, I got a good pull for what they in my own Thursday. I'm not gonna say now all right

[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.220]
I do I got a really good one anyway. Here's what we got so far today

[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.720]
What's singer or group is the most overrated of all time for 133 votes?

[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.880]
M&M 79

[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.300]
Madonna 67 Barbara Streisand 65

[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:56.100]
Elvis 62 Frank Sinatra 46 Bobby Dylan 37 Beatles 20 Rolling Stones 19

[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.480]
Steely Dan 17 how come the Rolling Stones are getting a lot of votes? What's wrong? What is that all about?

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.560]
They think they're overrated well, they're not Phil Collins 16

[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.040]
Bon Jovi five and Tom Petty don't have any except that lady called and she was like wild

[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.580]
Pat Petti blouse

[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.880]
Or something like that she said here is the one from Michelle who says thought you might be interested in a pool channel

[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:21.640]
Ten is having about the 10 commandments issue the question is should monuments of the 10 commandments be allowed in government building

[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.360]
No, and on government property no and the obvious answer is oh, I thought you might be interested in the creeping the pool

[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.740]
Well, that's good if they're gonna creep the Sun central pool on us in the ticket. Let's creep the channel 10 pool

Line nine last call Q a.m. Hello wait. Maybe your station is not really Charlie on

[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.120]
Let's see now here is a local 10 dot com slash news

[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.020]
Whatever I think if you could just go to the channel 10 website which I can do it right now

[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:30.020]
I'm gonna P.L.G. Post dot com. Huh? Charlie's on the coast. I don't care. Well that guy did

[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.720]
In other words you're responding to it like it's a serious call or we are Charlie's a good guy

[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.300]
How do you know who's that who is it? He used to work over it. What do you call it?

[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.500]
Kiss I think he used to kiss it. Whatever I heard. Okay. Where's this pool?

[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.660]
Where's the channel 10 pull I'm all over their website like stink on Greg. I can't see it. Huh?

[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.340]
Looking for coupons

[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.860]
Kind of hard to free the pool when you can't find where it is on their damn website

[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.380]
Hey channel 10 you people need some serious help. Well, and then of course click here to download plugin

[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.300]
That's the one thing I hate about uh about

[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.700]
Firefox. That's the only thing I just like what you only have to do it worth. I don't want to be

[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.420]
I don't have time to mess with that. Okay, Michelle. We'll have free pit

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.640]
Okay, five six seven oh five sixty pound five. You realize this is a this was a great time killer the first hour for

[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:25.900]
Star in six minutes. I'm gonna pull the plug on something else. Think of how much time we can get out of that. That'd be a good idea. Like how about the transmitter?

[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.820]
That's a sensational idea. Of course they don't need me to do that. That'd be the QAM. Hello

[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.820]
Neil. Yes sir. I was on sent no dot com. I think it was two days ago when I saw that pool when I never

[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:44.320]
Vogue on them but it was you know I figured I might as well vote on this one. So I voted for mad dog of course like any sane human

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:51.740]
Danes and level turned at such a huge lead. Yeah, I know he himself was probably just sitting on that computer voting from

[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:57.680]
So I have five again. Thank you. Thank you, pal. Okay. See there's one of our and maybe all the people are over there

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.460]
We'll find out tomorrow. I guess I mean anybody that would listen to Dan La Bastard and uh OJ and toast and that

[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.280]
That's the swirl they got on here. Of course that's the sports nerd crowd. Maybe uh this this station out of

[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.600]
Discover just like when we had the wow I want to go into it. I don't want to go back into it. You can't undo the

[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:18.140]
Pass. You know if they just keep making mistake after mistake after mistake and then across it I talk about it. I'm a bad guy.

[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.380]
And do you tell me any information on what's going on and then they really hate you like poison even more than usual.

[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:28.140]
Right. So we're just a mind-of-home business. Keep our noses clean. Somebody QAM. Hello. Yeah. Yes sir.

[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.120]
Um the problem is a mess. Can someone just send a nuke down here?

[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.100]
And maybe coming. Maybe there's a new coming. What do you think? Hey do you hear about Catherine Harris by the way?

[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:45.560]
No, what about her? Oh and speaking of Catherine Harris. What did I tell you? Remember when I said bring her on please?

[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:53.440]
Oh yeah. They started taking polls on that thing. Her against Bill Nelson and Bill Nelson just absolutely demolishes Catherine Harris.

[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:00.120]
Plus if they if she did get the Republican nomination she brings back all of those horrible memories about that fixed 2000 election.

[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.180]
That's right. Right. That's a mention the citrus canker.

[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.660]
Oh the citrus canker were say wasted all that money and it absolutely meant nice $1 billion for you know.

[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.540]
Nice going fat ass.

[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.780]
Great thing our yard's costing.

[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.780]
Right. Thousands of dollars from this and we got a coupon for it.

[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:19.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. The phone is working now. We don't have a lot of calls on there because the audience is a little bit

[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.540]
unshithful afraid that they're going to get like you know cheesed off or something or sliced off.

[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the Verizon and Singular wireless lines.

[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.720]
So did you find that poll? No.

[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:36.020]
The PLG? Yeah. I'm I typed in the URL exactly as Michelle gave it to us.

[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.380]
Oh well I haven't had time to do that survey over here.

[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.720]
And well it's about Paul Addoul for Christ's sakes.

[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.320]
Oh it's not the right one. Maybe they changed it.

[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:44.740]
I know.

[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.140]
Nice time Michelle but maybe they changed it on this real fast or maybe that was from yesterday or maybe

[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.080]
you just had one of those bad mushrooms. They seem to be going around.

[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.380]
They're even invading our phone now.

[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.020]
W-D-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.100]
Jam-B-R-UH.

[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.380]
Yeah fat chance.

[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.980]
Talk about lifeless. You're right and see you encourage that.

[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.120]
Oh yeah yeah me.

[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.700]
Yeah that's one of your buddies probably.

[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.560]
Yeah go on for the new way.

[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.000]
We're close.

[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.500]
Probably given that flavor wave.

[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.280]
W-D-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.400]
Hey Neil. I'm going to send you city God.

[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.380]
I've been broke man. I'm going to fast you.

[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.320]
Don't believe it man. I'm going to send you city God.

[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.360]
I want you to watch it. That's one movie you've got to watch before you close.

[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.140]
Yeah faster.

[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.980]
See there's been a big change in town.

[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.260]
Not as there.

[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.100]
Yeah same old crab, same old comics with the same old nonsense.

[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.080]
Which is good. At least they're still with us.

[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.880]
They're not over there with those other guys.

[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.520]
W-D-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.240]
Here what's up?

[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:32.960]
Yes sir.

[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.780]
I'm not impressed with Stone Cold ice cream.

[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.620]
Oh get out of here.

[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.800]
Really? Are we on one up here?

[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.120]
You must be Stone Cold man.

[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.980]
No I don't know. I wasn't that impressed.

[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.860]
And listen do I know my ice cream or what?

[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.920]
I know my areas of expertise. I am the ice cream man.

[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.900]
Yeah. We're all out to give you another shot.

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.340]
Maybe you got the wrong flavor.

[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.660]
Maybe you had them put too many at marshmallow in your ice cream.

[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.700]
No, I went with the Oreo. The Oreo cookie.

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.340]
Oh. Who wants that anyway?

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.640]
Hey how come the QAnM has in print a Gobi and Roxy together as a power team come here?

[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.900]
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.600]
There they are.

[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.020]
What one has the tonic?

[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.560]
I just don't believe those two guys have jobs on radio.

[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.380]
Hey listen. We got Lenny Martes on here. What does that tell you?

[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.500]
Alright, Neal, I'm gonna head up to Stone Cold now, see what I can do.

[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.280]
Please, I'm telling you, it's Cold Stone Creamery, get it right.

[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.820]
Not, and Winnipeg, great to have them on the year.

[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.600]
Not, and maybe Berkeley can Cold Stone call them.

[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:28.120]
Ooh.

[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.000]
Winnipeg, good?

[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:29.740]
That'd be something.

[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.780]
In fact, she's out selling, she's Cold Calling Psychiatrist with the Tom Cruise Show.

[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.340]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.100]
Have permanent rents, friends.

[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.880]
And believe me, if anybody needs a good shrink, it's that sales department.

[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.920]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:41.920]
Hello?

[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:42.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:44.940]
Hello.

[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:45.160]

[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:45.780]
Hello.

[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.200]
Are you pardon?

[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.080]
Cold Stone.

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.080]

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.360]
Cold Stone.

[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.380]
Get out of here.

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:50.900]
Not to.

[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.100]
This is good, man.

[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.800]
George is really, he is attracted.

[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.320]
They always told me George had the intellectual colors, and it's obviously headed there right

[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:57.760]
I can't.

[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.300]
Now, seriously, you're like a maggot magnet.

[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:01.620]
Yeah.

[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.280]
It's amazing.

[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.540]
We just all come and hover around, like, coming birds.

[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.820]
One of the calls I had last week ripped me because I had nothing substantial to say,

[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.640]
even for all my intellectual efforts.

[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.140]
We've got plenty of this as an intellectual show, and if you don't believe me, go to Stone

[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:14.480]
Cold.

[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.340]
This is just killing four hours in the middle of a half of terminal boring, ponderous place.

[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.880]
They swamped the end of the world.

[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.920]
Those three and a half days I spent there last week with like three and a half years, dark

[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.940]
and pouring and nasty and thundering.

[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.400]
I mean, I thought Florida was about sunshine and fun.

[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.200]
What is it?

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.460]
Florida is about masochism.

[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.240]
You have to be a maniac to be there.

[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:34.880]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:35.400]
Hi.

[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:36.760]
Speaking.

[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:37.600]
Hey, Neil.

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.620]
How come no more dirty curtain goes?

[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:40.600]
What a time.

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.080]
WDQAM, I'm just ignoring.

[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.220]
OK, don't even dignify with a response.

[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.220]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.200]
Uncle Neil.

[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:46.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.520]
Ken Jennings, you idiot.

[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.240]
You're quizzling.

[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:49.840]
Idiot.

[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.000]
I hate you.

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:51.960]
I hope you get fired.

[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.180]
You fat ass idiot.

[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:53.920]
Thank you.

[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.000]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:55.740]
Hey, Neil.

[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:56.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.400]
How you doing, buddy?

[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.100]
OK.

[00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.460]
Hey, I just want to let you know.

[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.300]
Talk about Florida's Tuesday fun and the sun, ironing and boring.

[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.800]
I'm not sure I was doing it.

[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.300]
I'm going to listen to nothing.

[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.680]
I'm just playing leave it in about an hour and a half.

[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.220]
You can make it.

[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.440]
Providence after a long, we know it's boring.

[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.140]
We know it's pun.

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.800]
Listen to these people calling it.

[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:13.520]
They're desperate.

[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.500]
They're reaching out for a lifeline, man.

[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.200]
They're reaching out for anything.

[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.700]
Like their arms are like, like they're in a revival or something.

[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.200]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:21.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.420]
In fact, a lot of these people need to be revived.

[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.200]
Or maybe it was a bad idea that they were revived.

[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:25.660]
I don't know.

[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.700]
And that's a lot of suggestion for the pool day, which is fine with me,

[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.400]
because pool building is boring, you know what?

[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.480]
And I got a huge, a giant pile here, is what I would expect.

[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:33.840]

[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.020]
I'm going to do a little show prep on the morning on twice a week.

[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:36.560]
Yeah.

[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.560]
You got lots of time for that.

[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.600]
Providence after 11 and 5, 60, W.

[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.160]
Don't forget everybody's favorite.

[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.060]
The whole man.

[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.300]
That's the judge, Mo.

[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560]
Mo with the man.

[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.660]
Not our Mo, but judge Mo.

[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.460]
Nice going, judge.

[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.480]
A man with huge, gigantic balls.

[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.560]
Good life credit asked the question.

[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.060]
Do you know what's on your credit report?

[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.420]
If not, remember this number.

[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.500]
866-625-0444.

[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:01.580]
It's the fact that 80% of credit reports contain errors that affect your credit score.

[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.080]
And we all know the problems that come with a bad credit score.

[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.900]
If you've ever tried a contestant error that appears on your credit report,

[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.240]
you know what a pain that can be.

[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.540]
Good life credit is here to correct those errors for you.

So don't let somebody else's mistake cost you a high-quredit score.

[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.100]
Before you visit the dealership or call the Reader, do yourself a big favor

[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.080]
and call good life credit at 866-625-0444.

We are the authority.

[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.360]
Hope you find some hot solid, two-way in.

[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.560]
Thank you.

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:16.640]
Thank you.

[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.340]
You'll see she's not very smart.

[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.420]
You'll hear bad things for you might even see her go down.

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.300]
She will always be her threat.

[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.120]
Heaven needs a threat, possibly the fool around.

[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.860]
She just can't understand.

[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.240]
I want my handy care.

[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.080]
Made a hit show on TV.

[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.860]
Fair to lie, fair to lie.

[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:13.080]
Maybe you heard me with his full soul mind.

[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.820]
She'll keep on spreading her legs.

[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.080]
From heavy fair to lie, fair to lie.

[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.480]
Okay, so you may put a poor Michelle and she straighten me out.

[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.900]
In fact, there's the poll result right now on channel 10WPLG.com.

[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:28.620]
How do you like that?

[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:29.460]
I wouldn't vote it on it.

[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.060]
It's depressing.

[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.720]
There's only a few votes.

[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:32.940]
Give us a chance.

[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.820]
You are so negative.

[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.600]
What happened last week?

[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.080]
Did he get a poll of grits?

[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.380]
Yeah, only two votes.

[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.100]
There are so few votes.

[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.360]
130-142 votes by my count.

[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.140]
Nevertheless.

[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.460]
So far, here's how you get to it, folks.

[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.300]
You go to the channel 10 website and then there's the picture of the 10 Commandments there.

[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.200]
They're on their front page, the main page.

[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:58.720]
You click on the story.

[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.280]
The season may allow for a lot of data.

[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.060]
First, you click on the 10 Commandments story.

[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.180]
Then the title story.

[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.300]
The season may allow for a lot of other monuments to stand.

[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.120]
That's where it takes you to.

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.520]
Right under there is the poll.

[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.100]
That's all.

[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:09.920]
This one will click.

[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:10.520]
I'll do it.

[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.500]
The question is, Michelle, I'm sorry, George Rip you an ask.

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.680]
You should mind the monuments of the 10 Commandments be allowed in government buildings and on government property.

[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.980]
Yes, 84, no, 48.

[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.980]
Each case should be assigned individually 10.

[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.020]
That's only 142 votes.

[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.220]
So if you want to jeepers creepers, do a little creeper find it.

[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.060]
If not, that's okay too.

[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.100]
Maybe you have more important things to do, but I seriously doubted.

[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.480]
I've just done these calls so far.

[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.680]
566-70560.

[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.480]
Count 560 and if you rise them, singular wireless lines.

[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.160]
The one good thing I see about these calls so far that indicates something good is happening in Florida.

[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.680]
That is that it's the end of June and most people are not there.

[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.300]
Most people went in doubt.

[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.020]
They got the hell out.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.740]
And these are the people we have left.

[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.580]
Coming if you are in, hello.

[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.820]
Yeah, let's talk to you.

[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.280]
Yes sir, speaking.

[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:52.920]
Oh, damn.

[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.900]
Going to early tomorrow night for a wedding outside.

[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.500]
And then the rest goes to the room.

[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.280]
Yeah, there's a great McDonald's right by the Piazza Dollar Republica.

[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.020]
Any good restaurants in Rome?

[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.420]
No, they're all bad.

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:14.120]
Jesus Christ almighty, every truck to rear man, you'll be just going, you'll be doing the old manja dance.

[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.880]
Manga, manja, even without the gongja.

[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.280]
We have a great time.

[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.280]
Just enjoy the food, pal.

[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.860]
And get out my, get out of my life.

[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.700]
This is amazing.

[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:26.320]
This is like a synopsis of everything from like the last almost 30 years.

[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.240]
But 30 men.

[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.040]
And we'll go up into a ball of, you know what?

[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.460]
WQAM, hello.

[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.040]
Any, how are you?

[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:32.760]
Okay, sir.

[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.260]
Listen up for the poll Jennifer Lopez.

[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.280]
That bitch can't sing.

[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.360]
Yeah, but wait a minute.

[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:37.920]
No way, man.

[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.900]
See, that's exactly the opposite of what, because nobody said that she's a good singer.

[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:47.260]
Well, I'm rated would mean that a lot of people just fawn all over and think that the person is great.

[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.060]
Nobody says jail can sing.

[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.200]
Nobody has anything to sing.

[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.260]
And he has ears.

[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.240]
I have two quick points.

[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.600]
And then you guys said, you opened my eyes about religion and stuff.

[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.060]
So I think I hope you can help me.

[00:56:59.360 --> 00:56:59.560]
Yeah.

[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.200]
I think it's all silly, but didn't we pick on the right?

[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.120]
Well, it's not silly.

[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:04.720]
It's dangerous.

[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.860]
It's not silly.

[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.000]
It was like, you know, it was just so much like Grimm's fairy tales.

[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.780]
That would be one thing.

[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.820]
But people are killing each other every day over my god is better than your god.

[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.560]
I totally agree.

[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.160]
But didn't we pick of all the religions, the ones that these people truly believe?

[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.820]
Because I've learned all these Christians and all these days they want thing and they do another.

[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.260]
But these people at least they follow the silliness that they believe.

[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:29.780]
You understand?

[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.180]
No, they don't.

[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:31.720]
No, okay.

[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.220]
Well, I've never heard of other things.

[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.780]
Now, you think that they practice what they preach.

[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:36.740]
You really believe that?

[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.280]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.680]
They don't even make her and all these other fakers.

[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.000]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.340]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.360]
You mean swaggered?

[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.140]
No, no, no, no.

[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.080]
That's what they call another crotch.

[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.900]
No, no, no, you didn't understand.

[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:48.820]
I don't understand.

[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.000]
No, no, no, no.

[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:50.400]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:58.100]
Okay, the Christians are the ones who started the war are the ones that they say they believe one thing and they do another.

[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:58.740]
Yeah.

[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.420]
But the ones that were fighting, I think they follow what they say, you know.

[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.520]
Let's talk about the Muslims.

[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.320]
The Muslims.

[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:04.760]

[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.320]
Yeah.

[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.640]
Oh, they're a question to you.

[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.180]
They call them Islam.

[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.580]
Can we call these people Christianists?

[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.280]
Christianists and Jewishists is, get out of here.

[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.880]
See, what does this one say?

[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.900]
Overrate who, yeah, I saw this story.

[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.560]
Overrate who died, we're dying earlier.

[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.820]
Oh, it's a luxury page.

[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.660]
It's not one of those stupid stories.

[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.740]
Well, don't lose anyway.

[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.320]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:25.220]
It's nonsense.

[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.000]
Now, look at that.

[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.640]
We already got 84 to 69 now.

[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.540]
It's almost even Steven.

[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.920]
It's 51 to 52%.

[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.320]
And the 12 say each case should be a second.

[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.560]
See, it's starting in just a matter of moments.

[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.220]
See the hour that no, listen to me.

[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.040]
This is this.

[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.900]
I like to know who it was in that radio station that made that decision.

[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.480]
We should just ignore that pool in there.

[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.980]
It's all psychological, man.

[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.200]
It's, it's bad PR.

[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.680]
Bad PR to have a pool in a major newspaper.

[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.440]
We only got two thinking newspapers and believe me, they both do stink in that whole area

[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.780]
that anybody reads.

[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.020]
And there's a pool in there and it makes it appear like, oh, everybody in a sports crowd.

[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.140]
They're all going over to the ticket.

[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.220]
They're going to 790 because they got these great personality on here.

[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.540]
They got the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:49.460]
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:19.060]
the, the, theự pine was so awesome, produced, produced, produced, produced, produced, produced, produced, produced. he was amazing, he'd have him to let us go play some of it on set, the Holy

[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.420]
He could just try it and then tell me what you think or tell you where you think.

[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.420]
Now let's try this afternoon.

[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.060]
I'll give it a shot.

[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:25.900]
Alright man.

[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:26.300]
Okay.

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.660]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.780]
It never reminds me of that scene in Godfather III where Connie said, remember he brings

[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.740]
into bodyguards?

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.560]
Vincent, he brings in those two twins and she says, are they as good as they look?

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.320]
If I could tell you the number of times I've seen like, I know this sounds awfully, yeah.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.400]
But I see like a young couple in like a shopping mall or walking around and I want to

[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.620]
say to the girl, I want to say, is he as good as he looks?

[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.840]
Which of course it would be very annoying to both of them but I wouldn't do it.

[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.740]
It's just a thought that's crossed my mind.

[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.300]
Is that really as good as it looks?

[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.000]
Father what I'm saying?

[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.680]
Yeah, I get you.

[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.720]
And of course if she don't want to tell me maybe I can find out but I doubt it.

[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.340]
Yo yay!

[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:41.440]
And all you have left is sand, so long to end waiting for.

[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.140]
When you give it up for one night, yes of course.

[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.420]
Oh right.

[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.940]
The sexy is loving in the world.

[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.480]
In all creation, I love every part of her from lips to face.

[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.920]
She's a damn seeker, there are lots of more men.

[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.220]
We're not finding one new piece of the red knot shoes.

[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.760]
Carpenter is top of the world, remember that song?

[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:12.280]
Sure.

[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.180]
Hey you know that fact that I sent you about the overweight stuff?

[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:15.640]
Yes.

[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.800]
Mark apparently thinks that you need it again.

[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:18.720]
No Mark.

[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.140]
And again.

[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:19.880]
I already saw that.

[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.100]
I didn't need it even the first time because I saw the story.

[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:22.680]
I read it.

[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.380]
I've been there done that.

[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.400]
It's from the gardening which I read religiously.

[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.020]
And I, uh, schmit candid.

[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.260]
So Mark, no thanks.

[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.160]
Anyway, that song I was starting to say the Carpenter reminds me of.

[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.980]
It's in kind of like syrup, you know.

[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:35.740]
All right.

[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.860]
insulin shot.

[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.820]
We're seeing the sunshine.

[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.080]
Hey Elgarna, I think she's.

[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:44.880]
Oh my god.

[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.760]
What singer or group is the most overweighted of all time?

[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.040]
We don't have a large list there.

[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.120]
I'll tell you another one that needs to be on their rod steward.

[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:51.800]
Okay.

[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.420]
The scary thing is that there actually are people who think that he can sing including himself.

[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.160]
The fact that he thinks that he's sexy, that alone is scary.

[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.720]
But the fact that he thinks he can sing.

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.880]
Now the good news is we've already turned the poll around and we've only just begun speaking of the

[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.380]
propenders for that bagel around.

[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.840]
Ninety eight to eighty seven and fifteen say each patient be decided individually, which is okay.

[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.940]
I got a hundred and one.

[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:14.880]
You got what?

[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.260]
What do you know?

[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.440]
That's because you just went to it again.

[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:16.860]
Yes, I did.

[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.400]
See how we're pulling away in the stretch?

[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.660]
Nice going boys.

[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.020]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty me for rising singular wireless lines.

[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:25.920]
Georgia beyond tomorrow.

[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.780]
I'll be back for a Thursday Georgia beyond Friday and then that's where it goes.

[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.000]
And then week from Thursday we got a ballgame at twelve thirty.

[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.020]
So I'm going to have to go into training to be able to work that extra two and a half hours.

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.120]
Somebody Q I M?

[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:35.360]
Hello?

[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:36.880]
Q I M?

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.620]
Okay, ground's my favorite chronic.

[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.200]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:40.500]
Okay.

[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:41.460]
Okay.

[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:41.580]
Okay.

[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:41.860]

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:42.040]

[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:42.340]
Okay.

[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.100]
Okay.

[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:43.100]

[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:43.700]
Okay.

[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.360]
Okay.

[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:45.420]

[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:45.420]

[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.040]
Okay.

[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:46.420]
Okay.

[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:49.800]
Okay.

[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.920]
I never thought I'd have it a talk show with no host in a dark in a dark room somewhere in a dark padded room.

[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.500]
All of these people meet no padding.

[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.160]
Please spikes five.

[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.080]
They're padding something.

[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:00.620]
Welcome.

[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:01.900]
Somebody Q I M?

[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:02.160]
Hello?

[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.460]
Q I M?

[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.520]
Yeah, I need a, this is David.

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.120]
I got a name for your ball.

[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:08.920]
What do you got David?

[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.180]
I have Paul Anker.

[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.660]
Paul Anker who I think is okay.

[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.060]
He ain't never still afraid to train.

[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.920]
Okay, thanks, Valley.

[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.400]
Paul Anker once had a canker.

[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.220]
I just made that up, but it sounds good.

[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.780]
Now let's see, he's from what is he?

[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.460]
11 ease.

[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.720]
He's Canadian A.

[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.060]
Paul.

[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.500]
He's Canadian boy, but he's by way of somewhere in the Middle East.

[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.060]
I don't know.

[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.860]
I thought that was Casey Casey.

[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:27.400]
No.

[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.840]
So let's see him too.

[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.540]
Let's see head Diana.

[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.280]
Bad.

[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.080]
I overrated.

[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:32.780]
That was a good choice.

[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.240]
That's exactly what we're talking about.

[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.100]
Highly overrated.

[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:35.740]
Like you're great.

[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.840]
Yeah, he's okay.

[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.940]
Also he wrote, what great song did he write?

[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.820]
My way for Frank Sinatra, he wrote.

[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:41.340]
Okay.

[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.060]
Did you know that?

[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:42.340]
No.

[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.280]
See, you learn something that's not even new.

[01:04:44.280 --> 01:05:00.900]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.980]
Maybe! Hey,

[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:33.800]
Gilbert wannabe. Oh my God. Does that tell you how where he stands on the food chain?

[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.660]
That's in the bar high. W-Q-A-M, hello. Hey, you have Wayne Newton on the phone?

[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.840]
Wayne Newton, and there actually are people like my friend, the Humper.

[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:47.800]
I remember what time I was talking about the boat of a Wayne Newton concert in Vegas, remember that?

[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.020]
And how great it was and what a great showing puts on. Oh my goodness. So let's get Wayne Newton on there.

[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.560]
Hank is home sick today, maybe he'll vote on that. How's that poll coming on WDPLG.com?

[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.580]
Go for your click on the story where it says about the religion and the monuments and the

[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.380]
Supremes. I like his Supremes, okay? How come that thing isn't coming up on my,

[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.220]
why do I have to keep typing that in? I don't know. How come the URL isn't coming up on my

[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:14.360]
thing? They put up a different window. No, I don't want to. I don't want to open a window.

[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.600]
It's like 85 degrees outside. I want to open up a window. Windows is evil man. Bill Gates is the

[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.040]
anti-Christ. Big don't mistake about it. Nerd. A nerd with billions. It's not authentic.

[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:30.280]
87 to 111. What is it? 187. No, 111. The negatives are in the lead now. And pull it away, baby.

[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:35.320]
Or kick in some serious ass. Spread the word around town. Stick it in the shoe. That's right.

[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.660]
Oh, and by the way, while I was away, while I was on vacation, and I'm down there,

[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.300]
oh my goodness. Remember we had a story about our good friend Preston

[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.720]
being baker-racted from the swap shop a few weeks ago? Yeah. If anybody needs to be

[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.380]
baker-racted, it's your fat ass governor. This business with a Terry Shival and Michael Shival

[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:58.920]
thing. Really, he makes Tom Cruise seem sane. That's your fat ass governor. You people

[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.900]
are there to continue to support him for whatever reason. Maybe like fat ass crazy people,

[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.500]
whatever it might be. Wow. Holy moly. This baker-ract can put him away before it does

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:15.980]
any more damage. Please. WQIM. Hello. QAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. Q and a row. WQAM. Hello.

[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.140]
David half the whole stuff. Oh, yeah. He can really sing it, man. He can sing it and he can

[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.680]
bring it. And he can swing it is what I hear. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They love him in Germany. Not

[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:34.520]
ready for that. Oh, boy. Can he sing? No. Or what? WQAM. Hello. I've just my oxy content.

[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.300]
Oh, you know what? I was I was working on this to show you how much show prep I did for the show.

[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:50.240]
I was working on that. Where is it over there? The, uh, oh, it's number 15. Excuse me. Excuse me.

[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.560]
I'll play some way to do it while you're around. No, just a minute. Okay.

[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.100]
Oh, man.

[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:15.500]
How do you like that? Don't have a good way I'd like to when I'm working on it. Keep practicing, yeah.

[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:21.760]
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Here is a fact from Mason in Poppato Beach. He says from June 1 to 18,

[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.920]
I was in the Netherlands on business first time. They were wanting to write and share some of my

[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:29.420]
impressions. Oh, remember the impressions? Yeah. Curtis Mayfield. What do you hear? No. You were

[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.700]
right about at least one thing I've never seen. No, I've instead the impressions. I'd rather hear

[01:08:32.700 --> 01:09:02.660]
the emails. Okay. Ok. Oh.

[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.020]
kill some good time then before you know it will be noon already honey like that see that

[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.660]
you're learning from the master man how to kill some good time without doing a damn thing

[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.860]
when it comes to a good time it means heal Roger's heal Roger's meat tank

[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.540]
oh my god

[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.320]
who's ready to fight 16?

[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.740]
she's ready here

[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:32.700]
oh my god

[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.520]
I'm going to kill you my boy

[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.160]
ah

[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.520]
you're the meat

[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.840]
I'll be better

[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:43.700]
from it

[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.040]
you gotta create fun and fun for me to be the same

[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.660]
so I have to do it out and fight it me

[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.820]
when you're getting human

[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.360]
you can't have idle parties with people in it for you to know

[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.040]
it's better not to let them know you need a strength to keep them from you

[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.720]
and no fun in the bedroom

[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.420]
no fun in the bedroom

[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.020]
stay away from body joy

[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.560]
beating me ill

[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.260]
find the best of me

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.500]
and you should stop your fairies

[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.140]
heal good

[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.040]
I swear I'll throw you

[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.720]
out of all I hear about you all the TV news

[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.680]
so let me kind of throw you out of the room

[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.220]
you might break this into very current state of war

[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:30.020]
but if you want to stay on your own in a pile of holes

[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.740]
and no fun in the bedroom

[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.580]
is there another way?

[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.380]
no fun in the bedroom

[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.380]
can we talk about it?

[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.140]
stay away from body joy

[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.620]
beating me ill

[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.380]
find the best of me

[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.640]
and you should stop your fairies

[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.840]
heal good

[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.520]
I don't want to tell the woman

[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.640]
that no fun in the bedroom

[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.200]
don't worry

[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.260]
no fun in the bedroom

[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.540]
I bought them all the way

[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.040]
away from all the papers

[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.340]
give me a day

[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.560]
I bought my attention

[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.700]
you may have to sell

[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:02.980]
them all

[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.040]
there must be another way

[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:10.680]
you're fair

[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.980]
you're actually both got on you

[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:12.880]
or hey and Neil

[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.520]
about that

[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.440]
I'm honored

[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.500]
now let me just say this to you

[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.020]
this is a pretty peep-poor response

[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.100]
I'm going to tell you right now

[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.860]
I'm really disappointed in this crowd

[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.260]
all hundred of them

[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.240]
you see that the response on a channel 10 pull

[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.360]
about minements of the 10 commandments in the audio audience

[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.340]
yes 89 no 124

[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.520]
which that's fine

[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.160]
we turned it around

[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.260]
but that's only 230 votes

[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:34.740]
130 votes

[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.180]
which is less than 100 on there

[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.320]
since we've put start talking about half an hour ago

[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.580]
and it seems to be slowing down after that initial put

[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.480]
yeah after that initial

[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.960]
I mean Michelle went to all the trouble

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.360]
and there's see Jeepers creepers

[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.340]
could we be good creepers

[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.800]
maybe that's why we worsted out on that thing with the ticket

[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.340]
maybe that's why we didn't do it

[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.100]
we didn't want to be embarrassed

[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.340]
but in fact that our audience

[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.720]
is such a much as slackards

[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.280]
well see you don't have to be the curtain on there

[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.720]
anymore nobody's on your website

[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.080]
maybe that's a part of it too

[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.480]
you know what?

[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.460]
you go to jail for the pictures

[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.220]
how do you like that?

[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.620]
all these spineless cowards out there

[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.860]
what are you going to do for me?

[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:05.940]
what are you going to do for me?

[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.760]
every day we give you four hours of this crap for free

[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.380]
how do you like that?

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.580]
it doesn't cost you a dime

[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.240]
and the website we have all those stories that Josh

[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.720]
even as we speak probably is working feverishly

[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.920]
over getting those stories on there

[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.080]
no already did it thanks

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.200]
see already done it

[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.760]
he's on the way to Cold Stone Creamery

[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.840]
right now to get stoned

[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:22.900]
what?

[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.440]
what were you doing?

[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.660]
hey I got news for you

[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.940]
kid me that stuff

[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.600]
oh that was the greatest piece of luck

[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.100]
that was the night before I left

[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:30.920]
that I got out of there

[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.660]
oh man

[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.100]
because I know how to go on back

[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.700]
it's just worse than any of the

[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.020]
worse than crack cocaine man

[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:37.840]
worse than heroin

[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.460]
worse than just your regular azúcar

[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.600]
it's just the brutal

[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.520]
good stuff

[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.260]
so if you're away by the

[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.420]
if you look like you're about crane

[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.680]
if you need to gain about 50 pounds

[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.200]
believe me start today

[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:46.820]
and by the weekend

[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.100]
you'll be like a blimp

[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.200]
yeah Michelle went to the trouble of us

[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.280]
trying to free this pool

[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.020]
and you people all you got to do is go to the channel

[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.440]
www.plg.com

[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.960]
it just takes one click

[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.260]
one click and a vote

[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.440]
that's also two clicks

[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.020]
that's it

[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.560]
oh we can't do that

[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.100]
that's pretty obvious

[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.660]
boy this is the you see

[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.200]
these people need to be whipped in the shape

[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.740]
I'm just a guy to do it

[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.540]
I'm a whipper

[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.600]
you go to www.plg.com

[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.960]
you click on the second story there

[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.840]
first you got the sharks

[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.420]
and the drowning

[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.420]
and the biting and all that

[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.420]
and right underneath there

[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.900]
is the story about should the monuments

[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.840]
of the Ten Commandments

[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.220]
you ought to be out of your

[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.780]
and you click on that

[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.420]
and it'll take you right to that story there

[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.440]
about four lotter day on the

[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.540]
monument and right now

[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.900]
there's a poll you just click no

[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.680]
and you can keep going back

[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.800]
that's the interesting thing

[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.360]
we got about the 90 votes on there

[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.700]
and I voted three or four times

[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.600]
and you probably did two

[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.840]
so what does that mean

[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.880]
how many people do we actually

[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.800]
get off their ass to

[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.420]
creep this poll

[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.480]
but third man

[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.040]
lazy lazy

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.660]
shifless

[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.500]
there's a story about

[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.860]
John Walton there

[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.540]
John Boy

[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.420]
on CNN

[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.940]
when speaking to CNN

[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:43.860]
they're like a

[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.200]
they're having a big

[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.380]
fire sale I guess

[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.640]
they're blowing everybody out

[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.540]
I guess it cost them a lot of money

[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.680]
and he's feeding candy

[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.320]
Cali

[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.520]
let's get back to our poll

[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.660]
okay let's get back to us

[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:56.880]

what singer or group

[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.440]
is the most

[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.900]
overrated of all time

[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.480]
he asked

[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.080]
we got 567 votes

[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:03.980]
that's not too bad

[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.380]

borderline

[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.380]
feeder line

[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:09.920]
I'd like that

[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.980]
and what else did you do

[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.560]
not like nothing

[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.320]
live to tell is the only song

[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.080]
of hers that I like

[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.420]

[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.300]
in South Florida

[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.120]
because he's a whiner

[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.400]

M&M he's okay

[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.620]
and he did some good music

[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.680]
but you know

[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.860]
the genesis of all of this

[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:33.640]

that you people like Rod Stewart's music

[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.900]
and I use that term so loosely

[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.520]
and you criticize my taste in music

[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.320]
oh

[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.220]
I'd rather

[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.720]
be strapped speaking of that

[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.200]
bit we played

[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.340]
strapped to a chair and forth

[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.020]
here Hughie Piano is smithsing

[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:58.840]

[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.340]
for 400 days in a row

[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.240]
than here Rod Stewart's

[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:01.780]
sing one note

[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.340]
you think Rod Stewart is good

[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.980]
no I like the couple of his songs

[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:05.900]
a hundred years ago

[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.320]
but you know Maggie May

[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.920]
and yeah it was okay

[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.540]
it was like noisy

[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.140]
it was like no

[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.420]
but no point that he ever

[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.060]
have a good voice

[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:12.500]
you just know

[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.200]
what about Jon you don't like

[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]
Rod Stewart do you?

[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.200]
not really not

[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.820]
oh I've got to say

[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.600]
I never know what you are

[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.420]
I've always

[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.760]
kind of like breathless

[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.660]
like Jerry Lee Lewis

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.540]
would say breathless

[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.200]
and it's his

[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:23.940]
participation of a really

[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:24.500]
screwed up and

[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.380]
like the cold stone

[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.120]
creamers thing

[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.000]
well again I really

[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.720]
overdid it

[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.820]
I didn't realize they asked

[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.100]
see let me just say this to you

[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.420]
okay they know their crap

[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.400]
it's pretty obvious to me

[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.360]
from tasting two different

[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.720]
flavors which I've had

[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.920]
or my one was like a

[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.740]
a pre-leaning

[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.660]
it was just disgusting

[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.320]
it was so good

[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.800]
seriously it was like

[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.260]
take sex and multiply times a hundred

[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.080]
that was cold stone

[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.040]
creamers that's how good

[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:48.380]
that was

[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.480]
it's just the idea it goes

[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.460]
off the Richter scale

[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.020]
so just let them

[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:53.680]
they know what they're

[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.440]
doing they know their

[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.280]
crap don't try to

[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:55.380]
win the

[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.220]
the chick's fault she

[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.540]
like implied like you

[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.380]

[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.020]
she's like you want some

[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:00.200]
more

[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.100]
you want to do it

[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:01.580]
when you do it

[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.360]
you want some more

[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.240]
so maybe you could

[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.400]
put a little something

[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:05.920]

hours to get him on

Two fat boy. Sure. He does bring that copy. You know, you have to be kidding me.

[01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:50.810]
You got a whole bunch of new copy today. What do you think? I understand that. I'm not talking about that.

[01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:54.750]
For you mean for his massive number of account that he has on his show? Correct. Yeah.

[01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:59.450]
And don't get me started. See how? Why did you do that? I was in such a good lunch. I didn't bring him up.

[01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.170]
I have a crap. That piece of dirt. Anyway, here's this facts again.

[01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:06.950]
From June 1st, 18th, I was in Netherlands on business first time. They were wanted to write and share some mind

[01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:11.090]
questions. You were right about at least one thing. I've never seen so many beautiful younger people, both men and women.

[01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:15.130]
Did I actually say that? I said there were a lot of young people and there were a lot of, I don't know,

[01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:20.110]
can't even come close to Toronto. I stayed in Warden 20 miles out to Amsterdam where the

[01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:23.830]
company's office is out. We did manage to spend some time in Amsterdam, the Utrecht area and the

[01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:27.510]
Hague. My first night we had dinner at a restaurant down the street from my hotel and our waiter

[01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:30.910]
would give Tom Welling a run for his money. Some other in-person says waiter would give Tom

[01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:34.330]
Welling a run for his money. You're fair. Dining out is totally different experience. It's not

[01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:38.670]
just a place to go eat, but it's a social event. And it goes on about most of the news consists of

[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:42.890]
four to five courses last three hours. This man must have been smoking some heavy duty stuff man.

[01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:48.210]
He must have done a whole box full of magic mushrooms. A crate. I recommend the following places

[01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:51.590]
if you haven't eaten there. Here you go. If you're going to Amsterdam, Doryus is in the Crown

[01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:56.690]
Plaza Hotel in Amsterdam and then he's got places in the Hague and then Utrecht. Well nobody's

[01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:00.830]
going there. Not if they're smart. He said the ducks know how to drive. They'd better with all those

[01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:04.970]
one and a half lane roads and they kind of cause a bicyclist. The drivers license test is very tough.

[01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:08.310]
I'm told the failure rate is about 50%. I heard it was more like...

[01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:12.710]
Public schools require minimum four years of English French and German. It was funny when I'd

[01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:17.250]
approach a young person and say, spiff or engulfs, you speak English. Most would meekly say a

[01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:22.030]
little bit just to cover their ass. I also noticed that the Dutch TV station show American programs

[01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:25.990]
in spoken English with Dutch subtitles. Unlike the French and German stations, I got in my hotel

[01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:30.330]
the double American shows in their own language. Okay? Lots of things are expensive. American

[01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:33.790]
motorway shouldn't complain that gas and then... Oh, by the way, thanks Mr. President for those

[01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:39.170]
low gas prices. Yeah. 60 bucks a barrel for oil. How do you like that? Just the beginning.

[01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:43.930]
I rather start pouring olive oil in my tank. I also noticed that the... He said, lots of things are

[01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.710]
expensive. That's why I saw a grand total of seven bucks a gallon. He says, grand total of one SUV

[01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:53.390]
my entire time and my large percentage of the population uses bicycles and trains is the primary

[01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:58.370]
motor transportation and don't forget the tram too. Mason, you were right about things being more

[01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:01.970]
civilized over there and I can see why you stay there during the summer. Mason, guess what?

[01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:07.170]
He's just a little in the behind, don't you think? I haven't had... What is it? This is the second

[01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:11.850]
year in a row. I have not been in Amsterdam in a summertime because the apartment was not

[01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:16.710]
civilized because it was uncivilized. It was unsanitary. It was uninhabitable. It was unbelievable.

[01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:22.930]
Wow. Well, that's probably why you can't find any soap over there because most of the Dutch

[01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:26.910]
are afraid they're going to drop it. Somebody better tell them about that body wash. Oh, I found some

[01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:32.490]
new oil man. I don't want to go on about it. Body wash? Yeah. New brand? Yeah, I did. Well,

[01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.750]
it's not a new brand but it's a new flavor. I don't know what else you call them. More

[01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:40.630]
flavor. Okay. If you really get the price just sit back and drink it. Did I just... do we

[01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:49.990]
don't have a spot here right now? Do it because I just... Schmidt can't have any good luck. How

[01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.190]
good.

[01:20:55.070 --> 01:21:01.770]
When it comes to sports, we are the outdoors sports radio 560. She way yet.

[01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:10.910]
This mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M. I will see here. I ain't never said

[01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:46.910]
in any way.

[01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.870]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.070]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:25.530]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.130]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:30.790]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:31.290]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.910]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.950]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.310]

[01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.710]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:33.270]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:34.330]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:36.170]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.530]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:43.810]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:44.790]
Who could think they'd go?

[01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:46.530]
Exactly. So wait until you hear this.

[01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:47.390]
You ready for this?

[01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:48.710]
I don't know if I'm ready.

[01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.610]
Okay, you'll see.

[01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.810]
You've got the feeling of going.

[01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:59.750]
You've got the feeling of going.

[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:01.570]
You've got the feeling of going.

[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:06.690]
When you go wanting to try to block the ball.

[01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:08.250]
When you go wanting to try to block the ball.

[01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:11.030]
You've got the feeling of going.

[01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:14.210]
Okay, so we're on a sync.

[01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:15.730]
But I like it.

[01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.570]
Great. I'm going to get to it down to a science.

[01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.610]
I'm going to work on it feverishly all my spirit time.

[01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:22.110]
You've got to work with the very pitch of one of those units.

[01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.390]
Right. They're not a bad idea.

[01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:25.750]
Anyway, that's...

[01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:32.050]
You've got that feeling.

[01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:35.970]
Just for people like Josh Cortes who don't know what song it was written before 1990.

[01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.770]
5, 6, before 2000.

[01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:39.530]
Right.

[01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:41.070]
Just relax. Okay.

[01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:42.590]
Just enjoy your free lunch there in relax.

[01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:43.590]
It was a lot of pressure.

[01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:46.250]
I got to go to the ballpark tonight and goose day event.

[01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:47.190]
We're going up a little bit.

[01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.090]
Just because I haven't seen any movies from the 40s.

[01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:51.550]
Right. I'm not the one who's been watching movies.

[01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:52.470]
You're the 40s. That's George.

[01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:56.550]
So I'm looking desperately for one good movie in the 40s movie.

[01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.690]
It's a lot of life I would sucked out.

[01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:01.390]
I had to be smoking and drinking and walking and talking.

[01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:04.370]
I think the Shylock Holmes movies are the original ones in the early 40s.

[01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:05.930]
Those are the only ones I can think of.

[01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:08.130]
And how about the third man with Joseph Cotton?

[01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.410]
Never saw any one of them.

[01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.610]
In fact, just do a Google on Joseph Cotton and you'll find a lot of him.

[01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:14.750]
He was a very good actor.

[01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:17.090]
Underrated. Joseph Cotton Baton.

[01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:18.410]
Oh, it's speaking of overrated.

[01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:24.190]
The American Idol contestant who claims to have had an affair with Judge Paula Abdul was cited on a Mr. Meener battery charge

[01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:27.830]
after getting in a alleged food fight with his record company manager in the hotel.

[01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.590]
Sacramento police said yesterday.

[01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:31.150]
Cory Clark. Hey, Cory.

[01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:31.830]
You're fair.

[01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:36.250]
Cory Clark 24 was ordered to appear in Sacramento County Superior Court July 22.

[01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:40.230]
After police were called a Sacramento Sheraton Grand Hotel Saturday morning by guests,

[01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:43.110]
said police spokesman Sargent Justin Rizzley.

[01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:46.850]
Clark and the record company executive, Laura Cantlene Troy.

[01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:51.030]
What I mean keeps popping up a lot firstly at the door is Troy and this morning we had our sales guy.

[01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.570]
True.

[01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:54.510]
And now we got the record company executive, Laura Cantlene.

[01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.970]
True.

[01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:55.830]
And he liked that.

[01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.170]
Troy's popping up all over.

[01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:58.390]
That's what SCARAN said.

[01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:03.670]
Uh, we're having breakfast in one of the two rooms they rented when they began arguing over an incident from Clark's

[01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:06.250]
fighting a concert at Rayleigh Field in West Sacramento.

[01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.890]
It ended up as a food fight throwing dishes.

[01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:11.130]
The injuries were relatively minor, Rizzley said.

[01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:13.230]
I think it was mutual aid back in fourth kind of thing.

[01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:16.230]
Police found both Clark and Troy with scratches on their arms.

[01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:18.250]
And cited Clark for Mr. Meener battery.

[01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:21.990]
Troy 34 of LA was uncooperative to not want charges filed.

[01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:24.870]
It wasn't even clear they were in a dating relationship, Rizzley said.

[01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:26.890]
Yeah, she handles his business affairs.

[01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:28.830]
They happen to be having breakfast together.

[01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:29.910]
You think they were in a dating room?

[01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:30.410]
No.

[01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:34.030]
Well, by the way, we're like 297 votes on that poll now on Channel 10.

[01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:36.770]
We don't want to tell you how to vote about the money.

[01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.990]
No.

[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.650]
We don't want to get all any suggestions.

[01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:39.030]
No.

[01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:39.610]
No.

[01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:40.690]
You vote your conscience.

[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:42.310]
So there you go.

[01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.090]
And uh, Cory Clark.

[01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:45.190]
Another stiff.

[01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:46.690]
Wait till you have this story.

[01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.550]
All right.

[01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:53.290]
I'm going to go through a lot of my pile here because these calls are just, I mean, we got like the same seven people out there who couldn't get out of town.

[01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:54.650]
We like a lot of freight train.

[01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.110]
It's just pathetic.

[01:25:56.670 --> 01:26:04.890]
Scientists have created eerie zombie dogs reanimating the cane eyes after several hours of clinical death and attempts to develop suspended animation for human.

[01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:06.170]
I'm dying on the hear.

[01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:07.010]
Not so fast.

[01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:13.850]
US scientists have succeeded in reviving the dogs after three hours of clinical death paving the way for trials on humans within years.

[01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:17.070]
Pittsburgh's safer center for resuscitation research.

[01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:18.590]
I bet you didn't even know there was such a place.

[01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.870]
Did you?

[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.410]
No idea.

[01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:25.830]
It's safer there has developed a technique in which subjects veins are drained of blood and filled with an ice cold salt solution.

[01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.130]
Oh my god.

[01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:28.290]
It's time to drain it.

[01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:32.810]
The animals are considered scientifically dead as they stop breathing and have no heartbeat or brain activity.

[01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:37.550]
But three hours later, their blood is replaced and the zombie dogs are brought back to life with an electric shock.

[01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:39.430]
This is shocking.

[01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:43.770]
Plants to test a technique on humans to be realized within a year of clinical death safer center.

[01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:44.890]
It's safer that way.

[01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:45.250]
Yeah.

[01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:48.410]
In fact, let's all just go through that until Bush is out office.

[01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:49.330]
I got to leave the keeper.

[01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.610]
I'm a keeper.

[01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:58.110]
However, rather than sending people to sleep for years, then bringing back the life to benefit from medical advances, the buffens would be having to keep people in the stay for just a few hours.

[01:26:58.450 --> 01:26:58.970]
The buffens.

[01:26:59.210 --> 01:26:59.710]
What does that mean?

[01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.390]
I don't know.

[01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:01.690]
Does that like the doffens?

[01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:02.670]
I know buffens.

[01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:09.670]
But even this should be enough to save life such as battlefield casualties and victims of stabbing or gunshot wounds who have suffered huge blood loss.

[01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:14.030]
During a procedure, blood is replaced with a saline solution of a few degrees above zero.

[01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:19.130]
The dog's body temperature drops to only 7 degrees Celsius, which is 45.

[01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:23.030]
Compared with the usual 37 Celsius, which is like 100 and some.

[01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:25.610]
Inducing the state of hypothermia before death.

[01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:29.530]
Although the animals are clinically dead, their tissues and organs are perfectly preserved.

[01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:32.750]
Damaged blood vessels and tissues can then be repaired via surgery.

[01:27:33.150 --> 01:27:39.650]
The dogs are brought back to life by returning the blood to their bodies, giving them 100% oxygen and applying electric shocks to be treated.

[01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:40.590]
We start their hearts.

[01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:43.790]
Test shows they are perfectly normal with no brain damage.

[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.950]
The results are stunning.

[01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:52.630]
I think in 10 years it says here, we should be able to prevent death in a certain segment of those using this technology said one US battlefield doctor.

[01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:53.430]
How do you like that?

[01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:54.410]
We're going to live forever.

[01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:54.930]
What do you think?

[01:27:55.270 --> 01:28:00.030]
Oh, if you're in Florida, who'd run, who'd run, like make it to the end of the week when you come right down to it?

[01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.690]
No, don't think it.

[01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:03.990]
What singer or group is the most overrated of all time we asked?

[01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:08.150]
I thought we'd have a huge list here today, but everybody's out of town with that ever heard any music.

[01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:12.050]
Either that or they're on a way to cool stone creamery or they're voting on the channel 10 poll.

[01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.570]
Please.

[01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:14.250]
615 votes?

[01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:15.630]
That's not so bad, huh?

[01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:16.390]
No, sorry.

[01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:18.990]
Well, see, we got to figure out what the beaded curtain gun.

[01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:20.830]
You got a double whammy going on.

[01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:22.950]
Because number one, everybody's out of town.

[01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:24.110]
It's the end of June, number two.

[01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:26.370]
They beaded curtain just disappeared a week ago, Thursday.

[01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:30.170]
So as a result of that, our website is kind of like a illin a little bit, huh?

[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:32.250]
We've got a chillin, but the website is illin.

[01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:33.610]
See, we won't make all that bloody now.

[01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:34.230]
Yeah.

[01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:35.750]
What's poor Erica gonna do?

[01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:36.770]
He may lose some weight.

[01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:41.010]
Now they can't afford all those extra meals with a big bucks he makes off our website.

[01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.090]
It's a labor of love.

[01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.530]
M&M 113, highly overrated.

[01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:45.530]
Can he sing or what?

[01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:52.130]
Madonna 94, Elvis 84, or speaking of M&M, you know, we need to play?

[01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:53.690]
Oh, I got an idea.

[01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:55.190]
Okay, let me find it.

[01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:59.370]
Just a little.

[01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:00.730]
Just a touch.

[01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:01.870]
Not the right ear.

[01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:15.490]
I'm not sure if it's a good ear.

[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.490]

[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.490]

[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.490]

[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.490]

[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.510]

I said we put the end of the loop plate till midnight.

[01:30:36.850 --> 01:30:36.870]
I said we put the end of the loop plate till midnight.

She's just out cold stone.

[01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:35.030]
If she assails gal or what?

[01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:37.150]
Oh, can she really bring it to the table?

[01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:38.130]
Am I?

[01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:41.530]
What the hell?

[01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:42.950]
I don't want to catch how I want you.

[01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:44.330]
I don't want to.

[01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:45.490]
I don't want to.

[01:31:45.490 --> 01:31:48.270]
You've been in the news to watch lately I just want to.

[01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.730]
You.

[01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:50.990]
Why don't you do that?

[01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:52.050]
Make me sick.

[01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:53.250]
I'm here giving you an interview.

[01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:55.090]
Answering your questions.

[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:56.350]
You do something really nice?

[01:31:57.190 --> 01:31:57.750]
I'm here to.

[01:31:58.130 --> 01:31:58.810]
I'm here to.

[01:31:58.810 --> 01:31:58.870]
I'm here to.

[01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:00.630]
Honestly, you just left me.

[01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:01.130]
Yeah.

[01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:01.170]
Yeah.

[01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:06.370]
About 17 at QM, here's a good one for the pool.

[01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:08.210]
Barry Manelow says Irving and Boca.

[01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:11.050]
Hey Irving, happy Chavuas and three.

[01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:12.450]
Very Manelow, good choice.

[01:32:12.930 --> 01:32:13.070]
Sure.

[01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:14.770]
There are people who really think he can sing.

[01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.810]
Hey Barry.

[01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.510]
You fairy.

[01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:18.450]
And we're doing a decent job now.

[01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.750]
We're starting to pick it up a little bit on it.

[01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:21.270]
The free pen, the channel 10 pool.

[01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:22.030]
Yep.

[01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:23.050]
335.

[01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:24.690]
That's almost, what was it?

[01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:25.210]
142.

[01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:27.190]
That's almost 200 more votes in just an hour.

[01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:29.770]
When we started about 1115, that's not bad, right?

[01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:30.530]
We'll take it.

[01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:31.370]
I mean, they're busy out there.

[01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:35.150]
They're busy cranks calling us and voting on our poll and doing these things and feverishly

[01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.370]
looking for some porn on the internet.

[01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:39.210]
Now that we haven't got to beat it curtain in an ink coming back, okay?

[01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:40.310]
That's the law.

[01:32:40.670 --> 01:32:41.350]
That's repressive.

[01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:41.750]
USA.

[01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:44.710]
Maybe we should replace that with the freep of the day.

[01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:46.250]
That's not a bad idea.

[01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:48.510]
Of course, how are we going to find one of those every day?

[01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:50.170]
Oh, somebody will have to scour Chash.

[01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:51.830]
You know, all over the place.

[01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:53.490]
Oh yeah, like Chash has better do that.

[01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:56.670]
While he's busy putting those, there's a very important news stories on there.

[01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:57.590]
Those bedtime stories.

[01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:59.450]
I guess we'll have to wait for someone to call one in.

[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:00.630]
I don't know.

[01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:05.330]
Did I screw up over the weekend because I was up and I probably did I have on Sunday?

[01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:06.230]
Did I tell you I was?

[01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.530]
Huh?

[01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:07.250]
Yes, you did.

[01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:08.170]
No complaining, huh?

[01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:08.770]
That's all right, though.

[01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:11.390]
Oh, sorry.

[01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:14.150]
I thought to myself to you that I told George I was going to put him on for Sunday.

[01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:15.050]
You know, you're on a Sunday.

[01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:16.710]
I told Josh he probably forgot.

[01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:17.530]
That's just as well.

[01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:18.830]
Sunday's a week story day.

[01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:19.390]
That's right.

[01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:20.390]
Week story day, okay?

[01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:20.710]
All right.

[01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:21.750]
And he just showed it around.

[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:22.350]
What all happened?

[01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.650]
Nothing.

[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:26.630]
Should my immense of the 10 commandments be allowed in government buildings and on government property

[01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:28.470]
and channel 10s response so far?

[01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:31.130]
193 no and 121 yes.

[01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:35.690]
Each case should be decided individually 21 out of almost so we got almost 200 people

[01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:36.010]
on there.

[01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:40.670]
And it was very a very weak poll response before we'll butcher up these polls to get some

[01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:43.150]
real votes on there from our real live ass crowd.

[01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:45.730]
Oh, yeah, that's a real live wires out there.

[01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:50.630]
Speaking of wired, the American Psychiatry Association yesterday sharply criticized after Tom

[01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:50.910]
Cruz.

[01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:53.290]
If we hear any more about Tom Cruz, I'm going to vomit.

[01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.570]
Oh, you're not done yet.

[01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:55.150]
Hey Tom.

[01:33:55.150 --> 01:33:55.930]
You fairy.

[01:33:56.150 --> 01:34:00.690]
Go away for televisor Marx in which he called Psychiatry a pseudo science and is

[01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:02.510]
feeling the value of antidepressant drugs.

[01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:03.670]
He's an expert now.

[01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:04.170]
Right.

[01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:08.150]
He's an expert psychiatrist because he learned all of his crap from the Scientologists.

[01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:10.690]
Just ask Ron L. Ron Hubbub.

[01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:12.790]
He'll answer all your questions for you.

[01:34:13.290 --> 01:34:13.510]
It is here.

[01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:13.790]
It's fun.

[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:15.290]
Don't we have a bit about Scientology?

[01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:15.950]
Yes, we did.

[01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:17.030]
And it's called why?

[01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:18.010]
Diuretics.

[01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:20.830]
Diuretics with L. Ron Hubbub.

[01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:21.610]
Can we play it?

[01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:22.450]
Yes, cover.

[01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.830]
Diuretics.

[01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:29.250]
Is life an endless nightmare of confusion and chaos leading to nothingness?

[01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.830]
Or is it just me, PJ?

[01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:34.030]
Why do I have dreams about my mother in Sarama?

[01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:35.070]
Page 69.

[01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:40.550]
Why did I give my life savings to a bizarre cult religion founded by a bad science fiction writer?

[01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:41.650]
Page 1999.

[01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:45.950]
Am I worthy of seventh-level Zardos or am I a badhead?

[01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:46.870]
Page 25.

[01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:47.670]
Twenty-five.

[01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:49.450]
The book is discovered.

[01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.610]
Diuretics.

[01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:53.070]
Flushing questions from the mind.

[01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:54.530]
Behold of power.

[01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:55.710]
Behold of movement.

[01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:57.590]
Diuretics by L. Ron Hubbub.

[01:34:57.850 --> 01:34:59.050]
Over twenty million copies sold.

[01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:00.290]
Can you believe it?

[01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:03.870]
Remember that song by Zagre and Evans on the page 25-25, remember that?

[01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.150]
Yes.

[01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:09.150]
Anyway, the American psychiatric association is striking back at Tommy Cruz.

[01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:10.490]
Tommy, you're a jackass.

[01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.530]
And the word on the street, by the way, is that the movie sucks real bad.

[01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.090]
I'd understand why he and Kate Moss, who's been...

[01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:18.170]
She's like a prisoner now.

[01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:18.750]
Kate Holtz.

[01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:19.770]
Can I say Kate Moss?

[01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.270]
Well, she's easy to miss.

[01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:22.310]
Kate Holtz.

[01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:23.910]
Kate Jackson.

[01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.730]
A while ago.

[01:35:25.290 --> 01:35:26.510]
They got her in a broom closet.

[01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:30.910]
And she can't get out and speak to anybody unless the Scientologist personally escorted her.

[01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:35.650]
It is irresponsible for Mr. Cruz to use his movie publicity to promote his own ideological views,

[01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:38.410]
and to deter people with mental illness from getting the care they need.

[01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:41.630]
APA President Dr. Stephen Charlstein said in the statement,

[01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:45.590]
during interviews promoting his latest film, More of the World, which really sucks is what I'm here.

[01:35:45.810 --> 01:35:49.490]
Well, I do want to apologize because I read one bad review on the Batman movie,

[01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:52.330]
and now I see that overwhelmingly everybody says it was pretty good.

[01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.330]
I gave it a try.

[01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:54.550]
Why do you...

[01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:55.290]
I thought it was okay.

[01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:57.090]
I thought you said it was good.

[01:35:57.610 --> 01:35:58.570]
Yeah, it was pretty good.

[01:35:59.130 --> 01:35:59.790]
Like I said, you're just...

[01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:00.290]
You just...

[01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.450]
I don't know what it is.

[01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:02.030]
What?

[01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:02.890]
I don't...

[01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:03.610]
I'm argumentative.

[01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:06.990]
When I asked you, the day after you saw it, you said it was very good.

[01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:08.170]
I said very good.

[01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:11.270]
I told a review that I read and the Toronto Star was extremely negative,

[01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:13.410]
and just ripped it into the ass, and all the other reviews now,

[01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:16.570]
and the people I want to see it, like about 80% said it was damn good.

[01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:18.570]
Yeah, like I said, it was pretty good.

[01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:20.190]
They don't know no real Batman, you know?

[01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:21.910]
And there was no Robin character in the movie?

[01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:22.550]
No, no.

[01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:25.270]
Because it was Batman's beginning, so it's just the beginning of the story.

[01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.050]
Robin, yeah, comes later.

[01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:28.110]
Does he really?

[01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:28.810]
It's what I heard.

[01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:30.150]
Well, when do we get to see that?

[01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:31.010]
Part three.

[01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:34.330]
Oh, no.

[01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:36.670]
Where the hell is that Hank drop in?

[01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:37.910]
I can't find anything to that.

[01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:38.990]
He was just worried.

[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:40.050]
Not his pedophile.

[01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:40.530]
That's it.

[01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:41.550]
It was really worth the trouble.

[01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:42.950]
Hank, I'll be back tomorrow, we think.

[01:36:43.290 --> 01:36:43.570]
We hope.

[01:36:43.930 --> 01:36:44.890]
Not anything gets to big.

[01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:45.110]
Oh!

[01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:48.190]
Oh, please don't tell me he was on all morning from 5 to 10.

[01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:50.070]
He was on all morning from 5 to 10.

[01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.730]
Oh, no.

[01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:53.290]
Although, we had Ira, you know, to break it up.

[01:36:53.710 --> 01:36:54.230]
We had what?

[01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:55.010]
Are you right?

[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:56.290]
What do we had Ira for?

[01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:57.690]
I thought they were done.

[01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:58.870]
I thought the NBA...

[01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.390]
You have to be joking me, aren't you?

[01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:02.010]
Yes, I made it all up.

[01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:04.110]
If you're telling me the truth, I will...

[01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:05.370]
Didn't San Antonio win?

[01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:06.370]
Didn't they beat the Pistons?

[01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:07.710]
Like when the NBA championship?

[01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.850]
Yes, but I believe the NBA draft is today, so I'm sure they'll take a call.

[01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:12.610]
Oh, draft this, okay?

[01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:14.110]
Oh, my God.

[01:37:14.110 --> 01:37:16.190]
This Ira man, he just won't go away.

[01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:18.490]
He just keeps hanging on and hanging on.

[01:37:18.810 --> 01:37:20.310]
Holy moly, rat man.

[01:37:21.010 --> 01:37:22.910]
When the hell are we going to get him off the air already?

[01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:23.790]
Draft this!

[01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.590]
Oh!

[01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:25.330]
Yeah, amen.

[01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:26.350]
God.

[01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:28.850]
The Ira win bag show it never ends.

[01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:30.070]
The NBA never ends.

[01:37:30.130 --> 01:37:32.290]
Even though we don't have the heat games on his radio station.

[01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:35.790]
But we sure kill some damn bad time with that crap on the morning show.

[01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:38.650]
I think somebody's trying to sabotage the Goldberg show.

[01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:41.250]
You guys may be trying to stick it to the Humper.

[01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:41.990]
That was fun.

[01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.270]
Yeah.

[01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:45.290]
We'll find out tomorrow just how funny it was when those trends come out again.

[01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:48.210]
I sure if we don't want to go over it in another tutu, you know what?

[01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:51.450]
Anyway, during interviews promoting his latest film, More of the World,

[01:37:51.730 --> 01:37:56.910]
Kruz has discussed his deep skepticism of psychiatry to explain his belief in the teachings of the Church of Scientology

[01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:59.370]
thought it by science fiction writer Elrond Hubbub.

[01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:03.990]
In one section of the interview last Friday at NBC's Todaysia, which we've seen about 40,000 times now,

[01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:07.370]
Kruz was asked about his recent criticism of actress Brooke Shields

[01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:11.030]
for revealing that she had taken the anti-depressant Paxil to cope with postpartum depression.

[01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:12.890]
By the way, she responded and ripped him an ass.

[01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:13.610]
Yes, she did.

[01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:14.490]
Nice going, Brooke.

[01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:15.550]
All right, you're old, Ruphe Shio.

[01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:16.510]
I think we're second to.

[01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:16.770]
What?

[01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:18.750]
She said, mind your own freaking business, Tyrell.

[01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:22.490]
Yeah, she said, stick that plane aliens from some stupid science fiction remake.

[01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:24.470]
And I'll take care of my own life.

[01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:26.610]
She said, I'll grab you by the face and throw you to the ground shortly.

[01:38:26.710 --> 01:38:28.090]
She also said, do fairy.

[01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:31.710]
Before I was a Scientologist, I never agreed with psychiatry, Kruz said.

[01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:36.070]
And when I started studying the history of psychiatry, I understood more and more why I don't believe in psychology.

[01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:39.630]
And I know that psychiatry is a pseudo science.

[01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:40.710]
You're a pseudo human.

[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:41.350]
How do you like that?

[01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.890]
Hey, Tom.

[01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:42.370]
You're fair.

[01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.630]
Yeah.

[01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:44.230]
You're not fooling anybody anymore.

[01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:47.650]
And you notice now, even that conversation is out of the closet.

[01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:53.250]
Whereas before maybe I and like five other people in the country had the balls to say it out loud, that Tom is, you know, gay.

[01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.650]
Yeah.

[01:38:53.910 --> 01:39:00.830]
And that almost everybody else in that so-called church is like in a closet, like Lee Simmer repressally, and John Revolta, and many, many others,

[01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:02.170]
who all have that one thing in common.

[01:39:02.410 --> 01:39:02.410]

[01:39:02.690 --> 01:39:04.670]
And now they're like everybody's talking that.

[01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:09.270]
Like the thing with Kate Holmes Moss, the Schwartz, right?

[01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:09.890]
Right.

[01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:11.790]
They're all saying, oh, that's just a publicity stunt.

[01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:16.650]
And no matter who he claims to be hooked up with, now it's kind of like Michael Jackson saying these dating Brook Shields, speaking to her.

[01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.690]
Right?

[01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:19.630]
I'm serious.

[01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:21.270]
No, nobody's buying it anymore.

[01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:23.070]
When she was confronted about that, it was really good.

[01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:25.390]
I am so sick and tired of closet queens, man.

[01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:26.470]
It just makes me gag.

[01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:27.790]
I can't deal with it.

[01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:28.070]
Really?

[01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.750]
Yeah.

[01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:30.250]
I'm gagging on it.

[01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:34.310]
In fact, I think we ought to put our go-see stuff, maybe we'll put out a gag order.

[01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:36.830]
We come to entertainment.

[01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:39.750]
We've got to see a person in LA.

[01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:43.370]
We'll watch the sunset in Jesus' name.

[01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:45.230]
Our school will be a fight for the people.

[01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.790]
You will, yeah.

[01:39:48.370 --> 01:39:51.190]
You can unwrap all the slime all the time.

[01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:02.550]
WAP!

[01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:09.950]
Remember when nobody knew my name.

[01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:13.690]
But now I can remember each time.

[01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:16.770]
Just a phrase.

[01:40:17.770 --> 01:40:22.170]
I can make a wish, oh, yeah.

[01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:23.690]
Oh, baby.

[01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:28.690]
Take it for yourself, baby.

[01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:34.870]
Oh, I do it free like I'm inside.

[01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:42.010]
Don't run so close down the frame.

[01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:45.350]
Absolutely.

[01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:49.810]
I can't believe that you've gone so deep.

[01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:56.870]
My head just told me not to change.

[01:40:57.130 --> 01:40:59.050]
Oh, baby.

[01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:05.050]
Don't ask that people to tell me.

[01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:11.730]
You're not going to sound the same.

[01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:12.710]
Oh, baby.

[01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:19.090]
The sky is not yet like the bad one.

[01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:28.330]
I think the high is made the door no more.

[01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:33.470]
The sky is not like the sun.

[01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:34.910]
Yeah.

[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.110]
Absolutely.

[01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:40.370]
Uh-huh.

[01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:46.710]
So to make a long story short, somebody says,

[01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:48.350]
please consider Whitney Houston for your fault.

[01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.870]
Anyway, here's some good news.

[01:41:53.410 --> 01:41:55.490]
As Gabriel Header would say a hundred years ago,

[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.270]
there's good news.

[01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:57.810]
How do you like that?

[01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:59.570]
I bet you Josh, you remember as Gabriel Header?

[01:41:59.570 --> 01:42:00.390]
Oh, yeah.

[01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:03.550]
The number of Americans disapproving a president Bush's job performance

[01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.470]
has risen to the highest level of his presidency,

[01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:10.610]
according to a brand new CNN slash USA Today slash Gallup poll released yesterday.

[01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:13.710]
According to the poll, 53% of respondents said they disapproved

[01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:17.350]
Bush's performance compared with only 45% who approved.

[01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:19.890]
The margin of error was plus or minus three points.

[01:42:20.210 --> 01:42:24.670]
The 53% figure was the highest disapproval rating recorded in the CNN USA Today,

[01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:26.110]
Gallup poll since he became president.

[01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:30.070]
The approval percent is 45% max is a low point said in last March.

[01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:33.370]
The eight point gap between those who disapproved and approved was the largest record

[01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:36.810]
that sir has said during this time in there during all this pain.

[01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.470]
And thanks again for those little gas prices.

[01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:42.210]
Mr. President, Mr. Adoufiz-Bufiz, Alfred Yenuman, Jr.

[01:42:42.710 --> 01:42:45.410]
As Bush prepared to address the nation tonight to defend his Iraq policy,

[01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:48.990]
just 40% of those responded to the polls said the approve of his handling of the war.

[01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:54.610]
58% said they disapproved and were getting really worn out by that body count.

[01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:58.230]
And another poll, okay, not good for your president.

[01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:01.370]
Look at this, and they're showing that stuff on CNN right now.

[01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:07.270]
It's in blood. It is time, AIDS can see, for the administration to do some plain speaking on the war.

[01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:10.410]
Right. Kind of like, look at it like that, or maybe two or one or two.

[01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:11.650]
A blue guy of those two.

[01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:18.570]
Most Americans feel your president intentionally lied to the public to justify his invasion of a rack over and an overwhelming majority.

[01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:20.090]
Now, disapproved of his handling of the war.

[01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:25.670]
But the public not yet demitting it in a meet with draw according to an ABC News Watched and Post-Poll published yesterday.

[01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:30.410]
For the first time, a majority of Americans said the administration intentionally misled the public and going to war.

[01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:35.930]
Sounds like impeachment to me, and nearly 75% said it underestimated the challenges involved in the poll.

[01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:38.150]
That was a poll of a thousand four adults nationwide.

[01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:46.110]
On Iraq specifically, 56% said they disapproved of Bush's work, and 62% said the thought the U.S. had gotten bogged down in Iraq.

[01:43:46.550 --> 01:44:00.550]
The majority also rejected Vice President Cheney's claim that the Iraqi insurgency and his last throes, 53% said they thought the insurgency was holding steady in strength and 24% said they believe it was getting stronger every day like Chicago.

[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:04.290]
I might actually get that song out and play it, not getting stronger every day.

[01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:14.170]
I might actually play the until we blow up Pakistan, but though because, yes and good news, an undersea cable carrying data between Pakistan and the outside world has developed a serious fault,

[01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:18.570]
virtually crippling data feeds, including the Internet's telecommunications official said.

[01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:22.050]
Oh right! The system crashed late yesterday and we're still down this evening.

[01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:28.610]
Many offices across the country, Grinder Wohald, as people realize, there wasn't one of Pakistan's regular but usually brief technical glitches.

[01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:34.590]
Kind of like us here at QA, and we have very often but usually brief technical glitch. It's a bitch, but it's just a glitch.

[01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:40.630]
It's a worst case scenario. We are literally blank, said a senior foreign banker who declined to be identified.

[01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:48.470]
Oh God, what good news! The Pakis, okay? And now we find out that it was the Pakistanis. There were the ones that were peddling all that crap to everybody.

[01:44:48.630 --> 01:44:53.650]
North Korea, Iran, you name it. Pedalers of doom and gloom in Unabamba Grande. How do you like that?

[01:44:53.930 --> 01:45:03.070]
Mm-hmm. Pakis. We got to play that song over and over again. Then we go into Saudi Arabia, blow off the Mishmata heads, hook up our hose and our shoe, the oil fields and the screw them.

[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:13.730]
You know, they had their moment in the sunshine. They had all that money. $60 plus for a barrel of oil. Freason's going to be $60 plus for a gallon of gas. And thank you again.

[01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:19.650]
$687 votes on our pool kind of slowing down here. And you might wonder why, because they're not calling them with any more names.

[01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:29.430]
I know. What's up with that? They're all gone. Anybody with a brain. What's single or group is the most overrated of all time? M&M-128, Madonna 103, 1194.

[01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:37.010]
I've been pretty much stacked up that way. Barbara Streisand 85, synoptic 63, Bob Dylan 54, the Stone's 35, I'm PO'd.

[01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:48.390]
Beatles 32, Phil Collins 23, Steely Dan 21, Wayne Newton 18, Von Jovi 16, Michael Bolton the dozen, Ruts to her 5, Paul I could 2, Tom Pettie 1. Whitney Houston, very manllow.

[01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:56.610]
They got the big so far. How is that possible? Very manllow has got no votes yet. I don't think they consider him overrated. In other words, they're wrong.

[01:45:56.610 --> 01:46:02.610]
They're wrong. I know they think about hearing by them.

[01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:19.990]
My name is Barry. I write bands on the valve romance while I'm wearing Spanish pants.

[01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:32.730]
I'm just a little tease in there. Bring back those bad memories. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I'll probably get a few calls in between now and two o'clock. This show is just zooming by. I feel like it's getting away from me.

[01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:36.850]
I have lost contact with the audience. How's that channel 10 pull coming to take a look at that?

[01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:44.090]
Not lately. We have to forward with votes on there. I think you had a pretty good idea. The pool, at least it's something for them to do.

[01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:55.730]
The creep is your war. Keep them off the street. 129 to 219. How many total of votes? 129, yay. 219, nay. 22 people say.

[01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:05.150]
How come this is 370? What is it? The total is 370. That's not bad. Let me just vote no again real quick here so I can take a look and see what I got.

[01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:11.270]
371. See there's my vote on there. 222. We don't want to tell you how to vote. We freaked it out.

[01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:20.870]
No, but we can't have a few sublipical seeds in our mind. I mean, anybody out there understands the separation of chertian state and the state of all these gets keys trying to run our life and stick it in our face.

[01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:30.350]
Believe whatever you want. Just don't keep sticking in my face unless I ask you to. God. 220 no. 129. Yes. 22 say each case should be decided individual.

[01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:42.870]
Like whether we like it or not. WNQYM. Hello. Yeah. Sling Dion. I can't. Oh my God. What an excellent choice. Also Britney Spears. How can you leave her off?

[01:47:43.150 --> 01:47:59.710]
Because nobody considers her real singer. Okay. The trolling Dion. Good choice. Okay. Put your head. We're not asking for like 50 year favorite choices. Just one. What's your group is the most overweight of all time? Sling Dion. Oh, it makes me embarrassed to be in candidate almost. And then I think of the alternative. WNQYM. Hello.

[01:47:59.710 --> 01:48:14.770]
Yeah. Now. Yes, sir. Hey, I just saw one that you're right about Paul. I can use Lebanese. I was right about what that Paul? I could guy is Lebanese or any from Lebanese by way of Canada or the other way around. No, you're right on that. And he also wrote.

[01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:27.670]
Night show theme. That is absolutely correct. He's a pretty good talented guy. Yeah. He was on a start to last week. It's pretty good interview. He's pretty interesting. Thanks a lot, pal. Okay. Then you got a nail wonder if it was having howards baby five six seven

[01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:48.670]
Oh, five, 60. Not that Howard Tom five, 60 and even rising in singular wireless lines. Somebody Q a N. Hello. That's all I'm here. Q a N. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. We have a new diamond on the pole. Neil diamond. That's my one to change my phone. That is the one. Cracklin Rosie makes me puke.

[01:48:48.670 --> 01:48:49.310]
Yeah.

[01:48:52.830 --> 01:49:06.090]
Oh, Neil diamond. We just hit the jackpot. That's the winner. Hardly. Hardly. Hardly. The worst song ever. Which one? Heartlight. The one about ET. I don't even know what that song is. I think one of the guys was singing when he called it.

[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:18.650]
Third on your heart. All that. Yeah. Wow. I like this one better. Yeah. Back with the Iran. I may play the Neil diamond version.

[01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:23.610]
The same song. When it comes to a team. Neil Rogers. Neil Rogers.

[01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:26.530]
4th video. 5th.

[01:49:26.770 --> 01:49:27.410]
Yeah.

[01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:34.450]
Oh, Drudge back on. 27. 27. Here.

[01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:43.090]
You mean you sure you got 27. Yeah. I got 27. You know what I say. You have 28. Oh, yeah.

[01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:49.810]
I'm going to swim. That wasn't shit. What will it be back? I'll have to pound the mortadello. Yeah. And pound the Shive O's brain.

[01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:50.290]
Okay.

[01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:18.630]
It's a little. Oh, I don't think so.

[01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:48.250]
I think you're going to do it.

[01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:52.710]
I think you're going to do it.

[01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:18.230]
I think you're going to do it.

[01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:47.030]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:48.210]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:51:48.210 --> 01:51:48.210]

[01:51:48.210 --> 01:51:48.210]

[01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:50.310]
I'm going to do it.

[01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:58.910]
Speaking of the moment, you're a judge. Moe who we like a lot. He will laugh you on today, but the moment.

[01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:05.430]
The moment David will be on a two o'clock. He's got some fantastic guest coming up today too is what I heard. Right? Yeah.

[01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:14.690]
Bill scowren's great aunt. Gladys is going to be on between the two and four with the Moe and then the mad dog and then the ballgame and then 80K and all these things.

[01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:21.210]
I'm sure hope the Humper is back by Thursday morning. Kind of missed a little cross thing we do there across the S cross over.

[01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:30.090]
What's your network? A unanimous US Supreme Court rule yesterday that internet file trading networks can be held liable when their users copy music movies of the protected works without permission.

[01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:38.830]
Considering the case of MGM versus Groxter at all, the judges had to decide whether a piece of software can itself be held responsible for the parasy that's committed using it.

[01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:45.350]
In other words, if I give you the key to somebody down the street there, how do you go in and rob the houses in my fault of yours? The key makers fault.

[01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:55.890]
There you go. That's right. Let's play that jackass. The judges set aside US appeals court ruling that the peer to peer networks cannot be held liable for copyright infringement because they can be used for legitimate purposes as well.

[01:52:56.190 --> 01:53:07.410]
We hold it one who distributes the device with the object for promoting its use to infring copyright and shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster he would infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.

[01:53:07.410 --> 01:53:15.130]
Justice David Souter wrote for the court case was closely watched by the entertainment and technology industries as a test copy rate law on the computer era.

[01:53:15.230 --> 01:53:27.790]
It was considered the most important copy right case to reach the supreme is in more than two decades. The ability to sue file sharing firms is likely to be a far more effective deterrent against piracy for media organizations than going after individuals who download right protected material.

[01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:43.070]
The latter approach apart from being slow has led to high profile cases of young girls and boys receiving court summons diseases from teams of lawyers online networks like Roxtra and Morpheus allow millions of computer users to copy music and movies for free from each other's hard drives.

[01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:47.730]
How do you like that while you thieves out there you jifsy's trans and thieves.

[01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:59.970]
Yes, you groxed your you how's the environment going he better go zoom in up here is only one vote. Well, I will see a lot of us would change our vote. Thanks a lot, pal, if you call that in before we forgot about it. Thank you for that.

[01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:05.110]
Line nine is always spectacular to me Q. I. M. Hello Louis Delight there for president.

[01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:14.270]
You might miss something I was hoping you could explain it to me. Oh, there were missing something away and that must be the graph of New York again. I could tell by the action once was enough.

[01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:17.670]
Okay, Schmock loser. See in the June you ought to be out there enjoying the sunshine.

[01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:23.450]
Fry and getting good Carson Oma something a good melanova. Oh, God, what an inspiration that was. You know what?

[01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:28.930]
How long since I played that too, Lord? Oh, just a little bit. It's all the taste.

[01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:29.410]
Okay.

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.410]

[01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.470]

[01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.470]

[01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:31.090]
Oh.

[01:54:32.050 --> 01:54:32.610]
Oh.

[01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:40.390]
Okay.

[01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.390]

[01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:41.570]
Okay.

[01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:42.150]
Well, that's a good question.

[01:54:43.290 --> 01:54:44.210]
I can't.

[01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.710]
I want to call me Melanoma.

[01:54:46.930 --> 01:54:47.290]
Okay. Good.

[01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.810]
Congratulations.

[01:54:48.570 --> 01:54:51.310]
How about the share?

[01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:52.230]
For that money.

[01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:58.210]
Yeah, well nobody ever considered him a real singer, but in her case I think there might be one or two

[01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:06.590]
Sure, sure, I would agree with that. I mean they put out some music that was like I used the word music very loosely

[01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:10.470]
You know right? Yeah, I got you maybe some lame stuff

[01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:16.170]
But then of course you went out in the room and then it really got bad and then he went and one of skin is asked into a tree in the dive

[01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:20.810]
He died. He died. Little political sunny bono. What was he mayor of like that?

[01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:25.950]
Some tin block town or something like that right, but his big deal was he was a good fundraiser like

[01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:27.210]
I was a celebrity politician

[01:55:27.210 --> 01:55:33.110]
He was a good fundraiser for the right wing lunatics is what he was so he died. Yes, he probably not a bad thing five six seven

[01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:34.630]
O five sixty let me say it again

[01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:40.930]
I hope a lot of you people out there are really proud of yourselves that our fat ass governor your fat ass governor deserves to be

[01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:45.290]
Baker acted because he's crazy than a bed bug and he just will not let Terry or her

She go for crying out loud and of course, I'll president. They well that goes without saying mass murderer

[01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:54.550]
Took a nation to war based on a pack of lies, and they still know impeachment there going on

[01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:55.750]
How is that possible?

[01:55:56.110 --> 01:56:01.610]
Bob like there's a little hanky panky on the side with a very skanky fat cow anyway, and they're right away. Oh my god

[01:56:01.610 --> 01:56:03.770]
He lied about his sex like that right

[01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:12.130]
There here's a guy that's a mass murderer. He's responsible personally for the death of almost 2,000 innocent Americans plus over

[01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:14.570]
100,000 innocent Iraqis who we claim you know

[01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:17.890]

They must have spent a lot for the lead weights to keep that child on the ground my old friend Bob mayor

[01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:56.330]
Hey, Bob you must be pretty embarrassed about that routine. What is that all about?

[01:58:56.330 --> 01:59:01.290]
What is it with all these entertainer we need these these flavors these scramers these beautiful

[01:59:01.290 --> 01:59:03.190]

[01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:08.530]
What what is that things named is it have a name anyway click on where it says court the second story down on channel 10

[01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:11.830]
Quartz monumental decisions sends mixed message give it a click

[01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:19.410]
And then you scroll down when you get to that story and read the middle of the story is the survey should monuments of the 10 commandments be shown in

[01:59:19.410 --> 01:59:22.930]
Government buildings or be allowed in government buildings and a government property in the course

[01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:28.050]
No, and so far we got 397

Okay, if that's what it takes to get you people off your dead ass

[01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:41.390]
Now, let's see it was 142 when we started right that number six in my mind and that's 397 right at 156

[01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:43.750]
We more than double the total there on their very lame website

[01:59:44.250 --> 01:59:46.370]
So that that's what we can do for some people that don't get a lot

[01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:48.390]
I mean we've got like almost 800 votes on our poll

[01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.970]
Mm-hmm

[01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:52.670]
What's the difference between us and a powerful TV station like channel 10?

[01:59:52.670 --> 01:59:58.030]
We're just a little dinky radio station here. It's not a bad signal for Christ sakes. We're not on cable

[01:59:58.030 --> 02:00:02.690]
We're not like on everybody's TV said we're not like a part of your freaking life and in the meantime

[02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:05.670]
We got like almost 800 votes on our silly ass stupid music pool

[02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:14.170]
Exactly and they got like 397 and most of those are from our people of which 241 say absolutely not no

[02:00:14.170 --> 02:00:17.490]
134 yes each case should be decided individual 22

[02:00:17.490 --> 02:00:20.070]
See those are people who just don't have they're like this Supreme Court

[02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:25.250]
They don't have the balls to come out and say no, you know, I really support separation of church and state and get these far

[02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:30.010]

That'll explain to you why there ain't no more beaded curtain and you can't get your jolies by seeing they can chicks on our website

[02:03:45.250 --> 02:03:50.750]
Sorry, but that's America for you. We can't say this you can't see that you can't do nothing

[02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:55.930]
Is what it boils down to a third and more sophisticated test on the beef cow suspected of having mad cow disease

[02:03:55.930 --> 02:03:58.930]
Would have helped resolve conflicting results from two initial screenings

[02:03:58.930 --> 02:04:03.830]
But the US refused to perform it in November they just waited a few months like about the seven eight months

[02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:09.470]
And they said oh guess what you're in a good part of it is that that particular cow did not get in the food supply so they tell us

[02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:15.710]
That additional test ordered up by the agriculture departments internal watchdog ended up detecting mad cow a fighting that was

[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:19.810]
Curmed firm down Friday by the world's pre-eminent lab in England only 18 months ago

[02:04:19.810 --> 02:04:25.310]
The department to use the Western blood test to help uncover the first American case of the brain-wasting illness in cows

[02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:29.510]
And how many times did they do they show us the cow who's slipping and sliding in here and falling down

[02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:34.430]
You've seen that 80 made in times right? Yeah, that's the one with mad cow to one can't stand up

[02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:38.430]
The department is touching that from now on will conduct such testing on suspicious animals

[02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:41.710]
US officials in November had declared the cow to be free of the disease

[02:04:41.710 --> 02:04:48.350]
Even though one of two tests initial screening known as a rapid test indicated the presence of disease a more sophisticated

[02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:52.830]
Follow-up immunochemistry or IHC came back negative they had two

[02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:54.290]
diametrically opposed results which

[02:04:54.750 --> 02:05:02.110]
Pag to be which begged rather to be resolved said tall w brown a former scientist at the NIH who spent his career working on mad cow related issues

[02:05:02.110 --> 02:05:08.050]
If you had what they had you would immediately go to a western blood and get a third test method and see which one of the previous two was more accurate

[02:05:08.050 --> 02:05:12.250]
But they couldn't be bothered with that because the government is out there to protect us

[02:05:12.250 --> 02:05:16.890]
Okay, to save us to send us to a rat so they can kill us all of these things your government

[02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:23.350]

[02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:42.570]
When I come on the unit today, this is the greatest ice cream in the world

[02:06:42.570 --> 02:06:45.070]
I'm not just talking out of my ass, okay?

[02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:50.070]
I've heard that better than anything in this world one of the old air could place some things now. I can't plan no more

[02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:51.190]

It only takes forever. Yeah, go ahead do talk up. Oh, read a spot. Okay, it says you go there

[02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:20.290]
They let you taste the flavor with those tiny spoons. Then they ask you what size

[02:07:20.290 --> 02:07:26.250]
Uh, those are oh, I see like it love it or gotta have it those are the sizes is that real or is he just making it up?

[02:07:26.250 --> 02:07:30.250]
No, that's real and they're ridiculous too because I ordered like the the medium

[02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:34.570]
Whatever whatever that is and it was a joke. Yeah, it was on brought home these two containers

[02:07:34.570 --> 02:07:36.690]
And there was enough ice cream in there to sink a battleship

[02:07:36.690 --> 02:07:38.230]
Yeah, exactly. It's like kind of a

[02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:38.630]

Both of the containers after we had like both indulged and then like got toss it out

Just too much it said so when you do the ice cream pull throw them all out the window

[02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:52.550]
Let's just hope they're running October

[02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:55.670]
But if you need I can send it to you FedEx pack no thanks to our route

[02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:11.310]
Well, I'm positive there must be marble slab and or effect.

[02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:12.190]
That's what we're going to have to do.

[02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:14.550]
Let's have a, a, a taste off.

[02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.410]
Okay.

[02:18:15.510 --> 02:18:19.850]
Let's see a assignment for the audience and for you guys is to check out marble slab and

[02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:24.050]
cold stone creamery and see which one because it's got to be one of those two, man.

[02:18:24.050 --> 02:18:25.610]
And that's got to be the greatest ice cream in history.

[02:18:25.610 --> 02:18:30.470]
It would be a real shame if either or both of these just went down the old, you know, like

[02:18:30.470 --> 02:18:33.570]
so many good places of gone, Larry's over there in plantation was great.

[02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:34.010]
Poor guy.

[02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:37.590]
Here's a guy came down from New York, put his entire life savings opening up an ice cream

[02:18:37.590 --> 02:18:37.930]
store.

[02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:41.230]
Larry's right by the public's right across the street from the Windexy Plaza.

[02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:44.910]
There would not be like, Larry, right by public's lot of traffic, heavily trafficked area,

[02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.750]
and went out of business.

[02:18:46.330 --> 02:18:50.630]
The white mountain, whatever that place was called in the fountain shops.

[02:18:50.630 --> 02:18:54.670]
How come it is that everybody in their brother that goes into that shopping center, that

[02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:56.110]
little mall there, goes out of business?

[02:18:56.610 --> 02:18:58.130]
It's got a tucked away back there.

[02:18:58.210 --> 02:18:59.350]
Get out of here.

[02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:01.310]
Maybe the way they have it set up there.

[02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:03.670]
It's like, yeah, what the businesses are.

[02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:04.990]
They're like a little city in there.

[02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:06.710]
You know, the circus city got a real quick.

[02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:10.930]
And the white mountain ice cream was on that side over by where a circus city used to

[02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:11.010]
be.

[02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.950]
And that was out.

[02:19:12.130 --> 02:19:14.830]
Not as good as this stuff, mine, because nothing is as good as what we're talking

[02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:15.050]
about.

[02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.890]
But it was damn good.

[02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:17.130]
They had some really unique flavors.

[02:19:17.470 --> 02:19:18.830]
And they lasted about five minutes.

[02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.810]
Maybe more like.

[02:19:19.810 --> 02:19:20.710]
They thought third man.

[02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:21.750]
They went bust.

[02:19:22.430 --> 02:19:23.470]
I've said it at other places.

[02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:23.790]
It's great.

[02:19:23.850 --> 02:19:24.870]
And there's that two jays.

[02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:26.850]
Man, is that a good, I told you about that.

[02:19:26.850 --> 02:19:27.290]
Do you go there?

[02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:27.590]
No.

[02:19:27.930 --> 02:19:28.250]
Why not?

[02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:29.630]
Because they didn't hear me.

[02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:30.290]
Why did you go there?

[02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:31.430]
It's the one near me.

[02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:32.110]
Okay.

[02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:35.770]
And it also Omaha Stakes is in there too and that little place.

[02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.930]
But I could tell you something.

[02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:40.370]
Remind me for the show on Thursday to tell you something about that.

[02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:41.230]
Not on the year though.

[02:19:41.370 --> 02:19:41.510]
All right.

[02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:42.970]
Because I love Omaha Stakes.

[02:19:43.050 --> 02:19:43.230]
Of course.

[02:19:43.710 --> 02:19:49.730]
Anyway, the in founding Scientology in 1951, Elrond Hubbub, we've got 464 votes.

[02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:53.850]
That channel 10, pull 36 to go or else before 2 o'clock.

[02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:55.030]
Think we can do it?

[02:19:55.170 --> 02:19:55.390]
Sure.

[02:19:55.650 --> 02:19:56.630]
That's like falling off a log.

[02:19:57.310 --> 02:20:01.150]
In founding Scientology in 1951, Elrond Hubbub carved out a special place for artists which

[02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:05.250]
led to the creation of the lavish Scientology Celebrity Centers, which now make up 11 of

[02:20:05.250 --> 02:20:06.290]
5100 churches.

[02:20:06.810 --> 02:20:10.870]
A culture is only as great as its dreams and its dreams are dreamed by artists, Hubbub

[02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:11.110]
said.

[02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:12.010]
In other words, gay.

[02:20:12.430 --> 02:20:16.210]
A website for the massive spiritual retreat in Hollywood explains by example and through

[02:20:16.210 --> 02:20:17.690]
their art, they communicate to millions.

[02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:21.410]
Thus by improving the lives of artists, great progress can be achieved in better

[02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:25.150]
condition in society for any artist with an increase in building a communicate who

[02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:29.010]
is drug-free and has high moral standards in parts of positive influence on many others.

[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:32.730]
Cruises that I guess I don't qualify there, especially in the high moral standards.

[02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:36.110]
Cruises the Scientologist poster boy at the moment for several reasons.

[02:20:36.570 --> 02:20:40.710]
He recently dismissed his long time publicist Pat Kingsley, turning to his Scientologist

[02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:42.690]
sister, Lee-Ann DeVette instead.

[02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:43.950]
I like DeVette.

[02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:45.190]
In fact, I like both of my vets.

[02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:49.190]
He famously brought Scientologist ministers onto the set of war of the world.

[02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:49.930]
Oh, good.

[02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:50.530]
Did you know that?

[02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:51.970]
Yeah, I've talked about it.

[02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:55.830]
Oh, and there's our parallel between the science fiction flicking some of his religions

[02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:57.730]
teaching his sister, the celebrity press.

[02:20:57.930 --> 02:21:02.330]
The cruises in good company in Hollywood where he taught Scientology and its related programs

[02:21:02.330 --> 02:21:07.450]
Narcanon for treating drug dependency, criminon for indecrimal behavior and applied scholastics.

[02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:13.630]
Others on the roster include John Travolta, musicians to Korea, Lisa Marie Pressley, and

[02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:16.890]
Beck, who was reared as a Scientologist.

[02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:17.850]
Beck, though, me like that.

[02:21:17.970 --> 02:21:19.270]
I understand he's pretty sore about it still.

[02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:23.650]
As well as that fat tub of crap, Kirsty Alley who credits Narcanon for ending her cocaine

[02:21:23.650 --> 02:21:24.130]
addiction.

[02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:25.610]
Yeah, it didn't cure her food today.

[02:21:25.690 --> 02:21:28.350]
Well, I'm going to ask you, if she had a cocaine addiction, how did I know she'd

[02:21:28.350 --> 02:21:29.110]
pick it out so bad?

[02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:32.110]
Obviously, she beat the cocaine addiction with a food.

[02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:33.490]
She just replaced it with food, exactly.

[02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:35.690]
Narcanon is not related to narcotics anonymous, yet.

[02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:37.150]
She sometimes called Narcanon.

[02:21:37.450 --> 02:21:38.910]
This is like all in word.

[02:21:39.310 --> 02:21:43.090]
And observers say the lesser known ranks of Hollywood producers, acting coaches, writers,

[02:21:43.090 --> 02:21:47.450]
and many an aspiring actor are filled with Scientologists attracted both by the spiritual

[02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:50.890]
prospects as well as the networking possibilities and, of course, the closet.

[02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:54.770]
The church says the growth among Hollywood's luminauty is simply testimony to the spiritual

[02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:58.730]
and personal growth to using the tools that Scientology gave them.

[02:21:59.610 --> 02:22:00.870]
Oh my God.

[02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:02.570]
So Tom is using the tools.

[02:22:02.970 --> 02:22:06.610]
Yeah, I talked about it a while back how he pitched a Scientology tent there on the set

[02:22:06.610 --> 02:22:07.330]
of War of the World.

[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:07.930]
He pitched a tent?

[02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.430]
Sure did.

[02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:09.450]
Scientology tent.

[02:22:09.730 --> 02:22:10.330]
I'll be damned.

[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:12.030]
I made a deal for everyone to visit.

[02:22:12.430 --> 02:22:15.090]
It was his gift to the staff, and the crew.

[02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:15.770]
I'm sick.

[02:22:16.310 --> 02:22:18.770]
I'm having a snack at that lucky witness believe.

[02:22:19.290 --> 02:22:20.030]
Damned as Americans.

[02:22:20.470 --> 02:22:22.090]
Now they have me hooked on their snack foods.

[02:22:22.470 --> 02:22:24.330]
I hope this machine takes ten hours.

[02:22:24.810 --> 02:22:25.130]
Let's see.

[02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:26.110]
Let's see.

[02:22:26.650 --> 02:22:27.110]
Fourteen.

[02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:28.030]
All right.

[02:22:28.290 --> 02:22:28.930]
Come on, Adagos.

[02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:30.490]
I got my American snacks.

[02:22:30.930 --> 02:22:32.310]
I'll take you like I took away.

[02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:34.270]
I'll make me come in there.

[02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:35.650]
Oh.

[02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:38.410]
Oh, this is rest that we're in the spiral.

[02:22:38.410 --> 02:22:39.390]
Oh, burritos.

[02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:40.770]
Not so easy to say.

[02:22:41.170 --> 02:22:43.170]
Not so easy to say that big Chris.

[02:22:43.850 --> 02:22:44.910]
Nothing even shows close.

[02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:47.330]
Hey, what are you talking about?

[02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:48.990]
Gotta get the burritos.

[02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.750]
Take the numbers.

[02:22:50.010 --> 02:22:50.410]
Take the numbers.

[02:22:50.410 --> 02:22:51.230]
Now bring it.

[02:22:52.350 --> 02:22:54.630]
I must make me wonder what Sodom is having for dinner.

[02:22:54.890 --> 02:22:55.110]
You know what?

[02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.510]
But not quite.

[02:22:56.250 --> 02:22:59.210]
What singer or group is the most overrated of all time our full question?

[02:22:59.350 --> 02:22:59.590]
They didn't.

[02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:03.030]
I thought we get like thousands of these names called in and thank God we didn't.

[02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:04.350]
We would have wasted a lot of bad time.

[02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:05.850]
Eight hundred sixteen votes though.

[02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.930]
That's not bad.

[02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:08.950]
You know, considering how many people are in town right now.

[02:23:08.970 --> 02:23:09.930]
About thirty, man.

[02:23:10.430 --> 02:23:11.770]
And what do we got so far?

[02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:14.670]
I'm wasting my time because my mouse is like trapped.

[02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:16.050]
Come on.

[02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.770]
You can do it.

[02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:18.150]
Why is that not working, man?

[02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:21.210]
It's just fits with the ambiance of the whole thing.

[02:23:21.310 --> 02:23:22.170]
But let's share it for us.

[02:23:22.470 --> 02:23:24.250]
Who was it that came in there and got our phone?

[02:23:24.370 --> 02:23:25.450]
I'll give you the instructions on it.

[02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.990]
George Corso.

[02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:27.430]
George Corso.

[02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.830]
Holy moly.

[02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:31.250]
See, he's the only one that knows anything about this whole setup.

[02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:33.310]
So he won't let him go on vacation ever again.

[02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:36.130]
What singer or group is the most overrated of all time?

[02:23:36.130 --> 02:23:39.710]
Eminem 146 Madonna 113, 111.

[02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:47.290]
Barbara Streisand 92, Frank Sinatra 73, Bob Dylan 59, Rolling Stones 59 or 4038.

[02:23:47.470 --> 02:23:53.050]
What I just say, Beatles 35, Wayne Newton 27, The Humber Loved Him in Vegas, Phil Collins 26,

[02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:55.350]
Michael Bolton 23, nauseous.

[02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:57.190]
We didn't ever put Gloria Stefan down here.

[02:23:57.330 --> 02:23:57.490]
Did we?

[02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.950]
Did we?

[02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.570]
Why not?

[02:23:58.770 --> 02:23:59.190]
I don't know.

[02:23:59.370 --> 02:24:00.170]
Why not, Josh?

[02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:01.550]
Well, she's going on now.

[02:24:01.970 --> 02:24:03.330]
Gloria Stefan put her on here.

[02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:04.270]
Everybody else ahead.

[02:24:04.270 --> 02:24:04.570]
Let's get started.

[02:24:04.970 --> 02:24:09.030]
Steely Dan 21, Bond Jobin 19, Saline Dion 13, Olu.

[02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:14.050]
Rod Stewart 8 Neil Diamond 7, Shera 6 Whitney Houston 4, Barry Manolo 3, Hey Barry.

[02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:14.690]
You're fair.

[02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:17.950]
Paul I could too, and Tom Petty's got a pair, 818 votes.

[02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:21.130]
You know, if we don't really push world, we could have got 1000 votes today, you know what?

[02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:24.730]
We really pushed it and shoved it, but we had bigger fish to fry.

[02:24:24.850 --> 02:24:26.930]
I think we already got our 500 on the channel 10 poll.

[02:24:27.370 --> 02:24:30.030]
I haven't taken a peek, but it was 477 last time I looked.

[02:24:30.270 --> 02:24:30.910]
I took a gander.

[02:24:31.450 --> 02:24:31.730]
I'm looking.

[02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:36.890]
And don't feel just when we get to the 500 like, you know, courts, monumental decision sends

[02:24:36.890 --> 02:24:37.450]
mixed message.

[02:24:37.470 --> 02:24:38.230]
Click on that.

[02:24:38.390 --> 02:24:41.370]
It'll take the story about courts about the four-letter deal thing.

[02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:43.670]
It's got a picture that's slab, a Marvel slab.

[02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:45.030]
But it got ice cream there.

[02:24:45.450 --> 02:24:46.190]
And then click on no.

[02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:49.370]
I mean, click on whatever your answer is about the 10 commandments, all this other religious

[02:24:49.370 --> 02:24:51.150]
crap and the click on whatever you want.

[02:24:51.370 --> 02:24:52.130]
And it's coming up.

[02:24:52.310 --> 02:24:52.730]
It's coming up.

[02:24:53.730 --> 02:24:54.110]
491.

[02:24:54.330 --> 02:24:56.230]
Like I said, we still got a tiny bit of work to do.

[02:24:56.350 --> 02:24:56.550]
Okay.

[02:24:57.210 --> 02:24:57.890]
491 vote.

[02:24:58.290 --> 02:24:59.330]
No 318.

[02:24:59.330 --> 02:25:01.110]
Oh, yes, 143.

[02:25:01.410 --> 02:25:02.790]
And each case should be decided individually.

[02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:03.710]
Look what that's got.

[02:25:04.050 --> 02:25:04.670]
530, man.

[02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:05.190]
And like that.

[02:25:06.010 --> 02:25:07.970]
So we'll get it like phone off a ride.

[02:25:08.170 --> 02:25:09.070]
It took a lot of work, man.

[02:25:09.210 --> 02:25:12.850]
It took a lot of perspicacious perseverance on my part, didn't it?

[02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:13.250]
Yes, it did.

[02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:15.250]
He banged it, banged it, banged it.

[02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:19.190]
Anyway, Dr. Thompson and the rant from the Capitol Hill blew a great website that George

[02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:20.290]
still holds a grudge against.

[02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:22.370]
You know, you know, do you only bad think about that website?

[02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:23.210]
What's that?

[02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:24.550]
It's like a Fudge report.

[02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:29.770]
If you're like doing an Internet Explorer, which of course you shouldn't be doing.

[02:25:29.930 --> 02:25:34.570]
But if you are, more pop-up ads will come up on those websites and the whole rest of

[02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:35.350]
your life put together.

[02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:37.170]
The Fudge report and Capitol Hill.

[02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:38.390]
I don't know why that is.

[02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:43.350]
I wouldn't even if you're using Firefox, you'll see it like, you know, fending off all

[02:25:43.350 --> 02:25:44.830]
the would be crap.

[02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:48.170]
I usually get one pop-up when I do the Capitol Hill blue.

[02:25:48.970 --> 02:25:49.770]
Only one.

[02:25:50.130 --> 02:25:50.750]
Solomente Uno.

[02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:52.470]
Uno Espina.

[02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.870]
See.

[02:25:52.970 --> 02:25:53.850]
From the stories you sent me.

[02:25:53.850 --> 02:25:54.950]
Yeah, you always get a pop-up.

[02:25:55.170 --> 02:25:56.070]
Yeah, it's annoying.

[02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:59.250]
Anyway, lies, dam lies, and the fools don't believe them right, Stug Thompson.

[02:25:59.610 --> 02:26:03.070]
A bumper sticker on a car outside of coffee shop in the tiny southwestern Virginia Mountain

[02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:04.990]
town of Floyd, Virginia says it all.

[02:26:05.250 --> 02:26:07.110]
We're making enemies faster than we can kill them.

[02:26:07.530 --> 02:26:10.810]
You didn't use to see such bumper stickers in a conservative town like Floyd where American

[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:14.530]
flags fly from every light pole on holidays and adorn most pickup trucks on the road.

[02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:16.130]
Now they seem to pop up everywhere.

[02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:18.210]
These colors don't run.

[02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:20.230]
The rest of the world proclaims an other sticker.

[02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:23.590]
My wife is fond of the one that says, born just fine the first time.

[02:26:24.570 --> 02:26:25.230]
That's great.

[02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:27.270]
Yeah, we got that in the studio here.

[02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:31.170]
At the town's Friday night, jamboree, a weekly gathering of bluegrass fans from all over

[02:26:31.170 --> 02:26:34.830]
the world, a 70-ish fiddle player opened his set with, let's have a moment of silence

[02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:37.650]
for all the Americans who have died in George W. Bush's illegal war.

[02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:39.130]
Nobody butter got upset.

[02:26:39.450 --> 02:26:43.110]
They stood silent for 60 seconds, then cheered and clapped wildly when the music started.

[02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:47.150]
If I'm positioned to Bush's lies back to invasion of Iraq and appear openly in a traditional,

[02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:51.330]
flag-waving, blueridge mountain community like Floyd, you can be sure it runs rampant

[02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:52.730]
in other larger places in America.

[02:26:53.250 --> 02:26:56.950]
Pole show Bush's job of pruring, dropping fashion than General Motors stuck, while

[02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:58.590]
American opposition to his war climbs.

[02:26:58.970 --> 02:27:02.570]
Most Americans now oppose the war in Iraq and question both Bush's honesty and his

[02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:03.930]
reasons for invading another country.

[02:27:04.410 --> 02:27:08.990]
And the numbers of brain dead partisan lemmings who continue to support W's madness decline

[02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.490]
daily.

[02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:13.890]
Only those who continue to think in some barbaric way that wore styles problems back in

[02:27:13.890 --> 02:27:14.990]
this mad mad's actions.

[02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:19.630]
They're mostly partisan political hacks, who claim to the outdated notion that America should

[02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:23.230]
impose its will throughout a world that either embraces nor needs our way of life.

[02:27:23.490 --> 02:27:27.430]
Sadly, the idiots who continue to embrace Bush's armageddon-driven policies are an

[02:27:27.430 --> 02:27:31.990]
aim political polemics who find political lies justified, torture suspects is acceptable,

[02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:35.530]
and the rights of the Constitution expendable and overhiked war against terrorism.

[02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:39.790]
One of those non-nuts tried to convince me that Bush's illegal war is part of that war

[02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:43.950]
against terrorism, but all he succeeded in doing was showcasing his ignorance of both facts

[02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:44.510]
and politics.

[02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:48.550]
Like too many of the more mongering partisans who backbushed his dirty little war, he

[02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:52.070]
driven by the insane notion that American imperialism has answered the world's woes.

[02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.730]
It is not.

[02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:56.750]
Bush lied to the American people to Congress and the world to justify his war, and now

[02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:58.010]
his lies have come back to haunt him.

[02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:02.550]
He has the blood of 1700 plus Americans on his hands, and at the rate he's going, his

[02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:06.770]
war will too soon have killed more Americans than the terrorist attacks of September 11th.

[02:28:06.810 --> 02:28:10.150]
If those Americans in Iraq died for nothing and a war that had nothing to do with payback

[02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.750]
for 9-11.

[02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:14.590]
As the proof increases that Bush planned this war before the first plane signed in the

[02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:17.650]
first hour of the World Trade Center, only those who checked their brains at the door

[02:28:17.650 --> 02:28:18.950]
continue to support his lies.

[02:28:19.450 --> 02:28:23.190]
Osama Yamama remains at large because American troops are too busy with the war in Iraq that

[02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:25.950]
has nothing to do with tracking down the mastermind of 9-11.

[02:28:26.290 --> 02:28:29.750]
He and his henchmen are free to plan more attacks because while Bush continues to lie,

[02:28:29.890 --> 02:28:33.890]
Americans continue to die, and the President's reckless actions continue to create more enemies

[02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:35.230]
of and hatred for America.

[02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:39.590]
As the bumper sticker says, we're creating enemies faster than we can kill them, and those

[02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:43.730]
we haven't killed are killing us, more than 1700 in Iraq and a war based on lies and

[02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:44.610]
driven by deceit.

[02:28:44.890 --> 02:28:48.070]
And the blood of every single one of those American states, not only the hands of George

[02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:51.730]
W. Bush, but the hands of any fool who supports him and his insane war.

[02:28:52.050 --> 02:28:55.590]
For the disguised good man, he writes it even better than I can read it.

[02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:57.610]
Which isn't saying much.

[02:28:58.050 --> 02:28:58.410]
Let's see.

[02:28:58.530 --> 02:28:59.790]
Oh, here's an excellent fast.

[02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.750]
Thank you so much.

[02:29:00.750 --> 02:29:01.530]
Yeah, oh man.

[02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:03.530]
See, we were talking about sunny bono.

[02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:04.370]
We're proud about mono.

[02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:05.610]
But what do we know?

[02:29:06.010 --> 02:29:06.490]
You too.

[02:29:06.490 --> 02:29:08.970]
All the way to the state of West, you too.

[02:29:09.210 --> 02:29:09.450]
Wow.

[02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:10.090]
Yeah.

[02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.390]
21-2 at QAM.

[02:29:18.250 --> 02:29:22.710]
Now it seems to me, they'll be going their separate ways.

[02:29:23.470 --> 02:29:29.070]
K, homes and Tom Cruise, trying to promote them safe things.

[02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:30.710]
She publicity.

[02:29:31.090 --> 02:29:33.610]
There were rumors Tom was gay.

[02:29:35.490 --> 02:29:37.530]
Relationships not real.

[02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:39.710]
Tom Spenakton Clinton.

[02:29:41.950 --> 02:29:44.750]
She and Tom will be lonely no more.

[02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:47.070]
And they'll have a three week marriage.

[02:29:47.170 --> 02:29:51.030]
Oh, then they'll have a select right dea for a special.

[02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:53.210]
Become a silent Tom Vajay.

[02:29:53.610 --> 02:29:55.910]
I don't wanna hear about some no more.

[02:30:04.850 --> 02:30:09.810]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:30:09.810 --> 02:30:09.810]

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.670]

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.670]

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.670]

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.670]

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.670]

[02:31:48.690 --> 02:31:49.790]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:49.850 --> 02:31:50.790]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:50.890 --> 02:31:51.650]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:52.330]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:52.390 --> 02:31:54.010]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:54.390 --> 02:31:55.050]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:55.050 --> 02:31:55.450]
You've heard about the same thing.

[02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:57.330]
What's his name?

[02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:58.910]
What's his name?

[02:31:59.290 --> 02:31:59.590]
What's his name?

[02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:02.010]
What's his name?

[02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.510]
What's his name?

[02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.510]

[02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.950]
What's his name?

[02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.130]
What's his name?

[02:32:03.430 --> 02:32:03.430]

[02:32:03.430 --> 02:32:03.430]

[02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:03.810]
What's his name?

[02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:04.350]
What's his name?

[02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:04.390]
What's his name?

[02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.550]
What's his name?

[02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:06.150]
What's his name?

[02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:06.530]

[02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:06.590]
What's his name?

[02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.810]
What's his name?

[02:32:07.390 --> 02:32:08.210]
What's his name?

[02:32:08.470 --> 02:32:08.950]
What's his name?

[02:32:09.370 --> 02:32:09.890]
What's his name?

[02:32:10.270 --> 02:32:10.990]
What's his name?

[02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.610]
What's his name?

[02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:13.490]
What's his name?

[02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:14.730]
What's his name?

[02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:16.030]
What's his name?

[02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.590]
What's his name?

[02:32:24.910 --> 02:32:25.430]
What's his name?

[02:32:25.430 --> 02:32:27.470]
The memory is fresh and Reagan's son, Ron Jr.,

[02:32:27.470 --> 02:32:28.210]
People remember the funeral.

[02:32:28.210 --> 02:32:30.690]
I'm sure he'd be very honored to be in the company of all these great gentlemen.

[02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:34.310]
The rest of the top five, again, the greatest American of all time.

[02:32:34.350 --> 02:32:35.290]
And they pick Ronald Reagan?

[02:32:35.930 --> 02:32:37.570]
I mean, how about the slickest terror?

[02:32:37.650 --> 02:32:38.670]
I would certainly vote for that.

[02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.710]
Dipity do done.

[02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:44.590]
The rest of the top five were civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington, and Ben Franklin.

[02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:49.190]
Ronald Reagan was a man of courage said, John Washington, and Cestral nephew of George Washington.

[02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:53.130]
These are all distinguished men, but Ronald Reagan, I think, he deserves his place here at the top of the list.

[02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.970]
Oh, God.

[02:32:53.970 --> 02:32:59.730]
The second half of the top 10 already, oh, oh, no, I am going to vomit right here.

[02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.930]
It's the first I've never actually, oh, no.

[02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:03.270]
Well, they said it was an AOL poll.

[02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:08.950]
The second half of the top 10 already established from voting in previous weeks had guess it was number six.

[02:33:09.430 --> 02:33:10.270]
Let me give you a clue.

[02:33:10.650 --> 02:33:10.970]
Abu Gharrab.

[02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:13.050]
Al-Presidente Maximov.

[02:33:13.650 --> 02:33:18.070]
Followed by Bill Clinton, Elvis Presley, Oprah Winfrey, and Franklin Roosevelt.

[02:33:21.010 --> 02:33:22.950]
Oprah just edging out FDR.

[02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:24.450]
Look, it was an AOL poll.

[02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:26.770]
Oh, my God.

[02:33:27.090 --> 02:33:29.150]
Oprah Winfrey, my ass.

[02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:32.690]
Holy moly, in fact, she's even bigger than my ass.

[02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:34.290]
That is just, anyway.

[02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:37.730]
The public defender's office on Monday in Caldwell, I like it.

[02:33:37.730 --> 02:33:40.510]
Called for a state investigation into a Brown County judges courtroom comments.

[02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:42.530]
They say, demean minorities and poor people.

[02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:46.110]
But County judge Leonard Feiner said his statements are being blown out of her portion.

[02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:48.150]
And there's nothing racist or a leetist about what he said.

[02:33:48.430 --> 02:33:50.670]
Thursday morning to a courthouse cleaning supervisor.

[02:33:50.670 --> 02:34:01.330]
Feiner demanded that custodial supervisor Nadine Koch appear in his courtroom after discovering someone had left his bench in disarray, pushing aside desk supplies, his phone and coffee mugs.

[02:34:01.810 --> 02:34:07.570]
When Feiner began questioning Koch whether the custodial staff was responsible for the mess, the courtroom recording system was turned off.

[02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:11.950]
But midway through the conversation, the recording system came back on a court transcript shows.

[02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:15.890]
They may live in huffles where they live, but they don't leave places.

[02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:18.230]
They work looking like a dump finder said.

[02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:19.590]
Koch asked they live where?

[02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:25.690]
Finer answered I said people that that they hire me live in huffles, but they don't have to leave courtrooms in the places they work looking like a slum.

[02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:27.870]
Koch said huffles and slums.

[02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:28.190]
Okay.

[02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:36.210]
Chief assistant public defender Catherine Coothin said it's common knowledge that the courthouses custodial staff at night is primarily Haitian Americans.

[02:34:36.970 --> 02:34:40.650]
The public defender's office male to complete yesterday, the judicial qualifications commission.

[02:34:40.930 --> 02:34:47.530]
The state agency that oversees judges because finders comments were not only racially insensitive, but showed content for the poor Coothin said.

[02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:52.790]
She said the leader was signed by public defender Howard Finkelstein and all 10 of his chief assistant public defenders.

[02:34:53.210 --> 02:34:54.790]
Ask Howard Howard the.

[02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.810]
Thore dole dole dole.

[02:34:55.970 --> 02:34:56.410]
Finkelstein.

[02:34:56.750 --> 02:35:00.970]
We found these comments to be outrageous and discriminatory, and they should be the subject of discipline.

[02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:06.810]
Coothin said finders said yesterday that no idea what the racial makeup is of the courthouses nighttime custodial staff.

[02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:11.610]
There are nothing racist ability said anyone can construe anything they want to say of a motiver agenda.

[02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:15.410]
It wasn't racist because as far as I know, I don't know who these people are.

[02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:19.870]
The comment also had nothing to do with class. He said it has to do with the fact that this is how they left the courtroom.

[02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:21.450]
Change, you can't say anything anymore.

[02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:24.010]
You know, can't say nothing no more.

[02:35:24.350 --> 02:35:24.950]
What about them?

[02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.390]
Who?

[02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:27.010]
Fakes.

[02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:27.870]
Oh them, then people.

[02:35:28.770 --> 02:35:33.810]
The poor people and the Haitian people, the dark people and the white people and the yellow people and the brown people.

[02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:35.650]
You can still rip Arabs and fags though.

[02:35:35.970 --> 02:35:36.390]
I see.

[02:35:36.770 --> 02:35:37.170]
Hey Tom.

[02:35:37.350 --> 02:35:37.750]
You're fair.

[02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:38.010]
Okay.

[02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:39.090]
Let's see.

[02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:46.950]
Military helicopter crash in Afghanistan and there was another terrorist, a suicide bomb in a hospital in a bagged ass.

[02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:49.430]
You can't even keep up with it no more.

[02:35:49.890 --> 02:35:49.890]

[02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.690]
But I'll present.

[02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:52.350]
He's going to come on there tonight, which I'll miss.

[02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.950]
Acciduously.

[02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:55.210]
I'll make a damn great effort to miss it.

[02:35:55.230 --> 02:35:55.610]
And I will.

[02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:57.150]
And he's going to give you a solid answer.

[02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:58.950]
But I mean, but I'm out the old show.

[02:35:59.130 --> 02:36:00.190]
We were talking about the bag of the podium.

[02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:01.710]
And he's going to move his hand.

[02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:02.470]
We were attacked.

[02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:03.050]
I'll let it lay.

[02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:03.870]
You know something.

[02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.990]
You just look at him.

[02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.150]
Not.

[02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:07.130]
I mean, this has been for a long time now.

[02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:08.510]
But but now more than ever.

[02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:09.750]
You just look at him.

[02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:12.850]
And you see the stupidity dripping from that face of his.

[02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.990]
The.

[02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:13.270]
The.

[02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:13.330]

[02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:16.510]
The deer in the headlights, whimsical, quizzical look.

[02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:20.270]
And then of course, when he starts speaking and says it in a very pedantic way, like you.

[02:36:20.450 --> 02:36:20.610]
I told you.

[02:36:20.610 --> 02:36:23.670]
Aren't you proud of me that I can make these words with more than three words.

[02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.670]

[02:36:23.810 --> 02:36:24.030]
No.

[02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:25.630]
I don't really believe me.

[02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:26.990]
Oh, brother.

[02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.650]
Like the art.

[02:36:27.810 --> 02:36:28.230]
That art.

[02:36:28.290 --> 02:36:32.030]
By Doug Thompson, man, that should be brand on everybody's head and their ass too.

[02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:33.030]
You know, that was good.

[02:36:33.430 --> 02:36:38.050]
I like your guy that didn't put on the punches, you know, which is why we need some serious.

[02:36:38.250 --> 02:36:39.770]
We need to get the shrink.

[02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:42.990]
We need to get group shrink in there and teach these people to butcher up a little bit.

[02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:45.450]
I may actually I don't think I'll be listening.

[02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:47.210]
I'll be a plunger my guts out tomorrow morning.

[02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:52.130]
But be sure and facts me the important stuff from the trends tomorrow.

[02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:54.110]
Because this is two thirds of the spring book.

[02:36:54.310 --> 02:36:55.450]
This is heavy duty, baby.

[02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.810]
And I just want to see.

[02:36:56.990 --> 02:37:00.830]
I mean, if these people think that winning the contest is rolling over and playing, then just.

[02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:03.490]
Just being oblivious to what's going on around us.

[02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:05.670]
They got a real surprise coming, you know what?

[02:37:05.850 --> 02:37:07.150]
They got a big, fat surprise.

[02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:08.610]
I'll play that too by Chicago.

[02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:09.690]
Maybe you want a big surprise.

[02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.290]
Okay.

[02:37:10.490 --> 02:37:10.670]
Okay.

[02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.810]
Okay.

[02:37:10.970 --> 02:37:11.930]
The push.

[02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:13.270]
Press the mouth.

[02:37:16.210 --> 02:37:17.070]
Go back.

[02:37:20.050 --> 02:37:20.810]
Go back.

[02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:21.730]
Go back.

[02:37:21.730 --> 02:37:22.190]
Go back.

[02:37:22.270 --> 02:37:22.270]

[02:37:22.330 --> 02:37:22.330]

[02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:22.530]

[02:37:23.650 --> 02:37:24.170]
Go back.

[02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:24.170]

[02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:25.250]
Oh, the hard burn.

[02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.210]
No.

[02:37:26.730 --> 02:37:27.350]
Go back.

[02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:30.430]
Every time I see.

[02:37:31.450 --> 02:37:33.870]
I'm so full of love.

[02:37:34.170 --> 02:37:35.650]
That's pretty hard.

[02:37:35.770 --> 02:37:36.430]
It can't win.

[02:37:38.010 --> 02:37:38.530]
Go back.

[02:37:38.930 --> 02:37:39.110]
Go back.

[02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:39.370]
Go back.

[02:37:39.730 --> 02:37:41.370]
Oh, TV.

[02:37:42.370 --> 02:37:44.950]
And he's president of the ****.

[02:37:45.970 --> 02:37:47.490]
Republican muscle.

[02:37:47.850 --> 02:37:50.450]
And in our ticket and idiot.

[02:37:51.210 --> 02:37:52.650]
I don't know why.

[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:55.110]
They were one just young.

[02:37:55.450 --> 02:37:59.350]
But now he's the third person in the next four years.

[02:37:59.350 --> 02:38:00.070]
Absolutely.

[02:38:00.490 --> 02:38:01.710]
President of the ****.

[02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:05.350]
Republican ****.

[02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:09.010]
Oh, what I get to.

[02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:11.370]
Now vote for small.

[02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:16.530]
And get to win your vote at home.

[02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:21.690]
If you want this.

[02:38:22.350 --> 02:38:24.090]
If you want this.

[02:38:24.090 --> 02:38:29.330]
If you want this.

[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:29.330]

[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:31.610]
Find this wrong.

[02:38:31.850 --> 02:38:32.310]
Get rich.

[02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:32.630]
