[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.840]
Why do I have to be forward, bring a kneel, don't forget high school football tonight.

[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.840]
Tom Beach Gardens in Deerfield is tomorrow Lakeland and St. Thomas Aquinas tonight and

[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.560]
those games being played at the stadium for me known as Derravi.

[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.940]
If you get a chance to go out and watch these kids play for the state championships, an exciting

[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.640]
time for them.

[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.940]
There won't be people there.

[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.180]
Hello.

[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.980]
Yeah.

[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.620]
I got an email here that I'm carrying that stuff.

[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.440]
Are we going to be broadcasting high school football?

[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800]
Not that I know of.

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.640]
Oh, damn it.

[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.100]
But, you know, Friday night football used to be a great tradition here in town.

[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.820]
Yeah, so in the right time you're talking about.

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.140]
Yep.

[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.920]
This didn't pass.

[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.040]
But state championship games are pretty important to those kids.

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.140]
No.

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.040]
So anyway, you got an email that said what?

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.300]
I got an email here that said that this is from a guy named Larry Rudolph.

[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.160]
Larry says, who the runs?

[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.840]
Basically when he says that when they cry about their past losses, they're including all

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.620]
payroll earned and not paid.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.980]
When they compute their yearly payroll, they include the cash paid and already earned in

[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.340]
that total there, double dealing.

[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.020]
Never pay attention to any annual payroll figures or annual losses unless you see their records.

[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.160]
Secondly, reducing the payroll from 65 made to 13 is not a market correction but a market crash.

[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.780]
Right.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.280]
They are embarrassing to franchise so Major League Baseball or the City of County can bail them out.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.160]
It happened in Montreal and worked for them so they're trying it again.

[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.680]
It's classless but probably a smart move.

[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.440]
Oh, it's not a smart move.

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.360]
It's a stupid move because they're going to alienate what little they got of the fan base that they developed is going to evaporate immediately

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.120]
and they're going to get all kinds of they're going to get class section lawsuit.

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.600]
See, they force people to buy a scene.

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.560]
I'm going to tell you something. They're not going to get a class section lawsuit because there's no grounds for it.

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.280]
I know it failed the first time but they'll still, you know, it may fail.

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.240]
I'm not saying it's going to succeed but they'll still have it.

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.220]
Well, you know what? Some guy, some lawyer will take advantage of a bunch of unsuspecting people to file one of those suits.

[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.160]
There you go, Norma. That's why I suggested for Norma.

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.200]
Can't be the most shot of winning that suit.

[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.960]
Well, so what difference does it make? Give it a shot.

[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.600]
Just a separate lawyer will put a $1.00.

[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.560]
You're going to stick it that way.

[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.060]
We're going to aggravate you. We're going to make you spend a lot of money on legal fees.

[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.640]
Not me.

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680]
Well, I'm just talking to you. That's the way to do it.

[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.260]
They're wasting money.

[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.700]
They're wasting money.

[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.580]
That then they're getting your money twice.

[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.740]
People are getting a sick entirety here and all this whining.

[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.100]
And I'm going to tell you another area that people are not too happy about.

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.800]
Or at least I'm not.

[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.340]
And that is the per mutual people, including some of my friends, you know.

[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.820]
These people don't understand where they are. They just don't get it.

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.480]
How long do you have to be in a place before you realize it's a miracle that A,

[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.900]
it ever got on the ballot in the first place and B, the Broward got any slot machines.

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060]
You know, when you've been around as long as the market is we have,

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.940]
you realize that they were just swimming upstream.

[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.540]
They were fighting against all the insurmountable odds.

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700]
The governor and the legislature shafted them.

[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.740]
That's what happened.

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.280]

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.940]
That's correct.

[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.360]
And there is a feeling among some of the per mutual people that they'd be better off

[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.920]
than taking another shot when his governor's gone.

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520]
What have you been taking another shot?

[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.280]
And getting a deal done so that they can at least make something with it.

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.580]
It's going to be very hard for them to make money with the money.

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.880]
They don't make money and take money.

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.940]
Believe me, they'll make money.

[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.840]
It won't be what they thought.

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.360]
And I know they had grandiose plans and they were going to do this.

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.880]
I mean, they just don't understand where they are.

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.060]
They don't get the lay of the land.

[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.540]
For example, the people at Gulfstream have invested all this money in a new facility

[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.300]
and they've got these grandiose plans for what they want to do with that property and whatnot.

[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.540]
And the money they're going to get out of slots is not going to pay for all that.

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.400]
Do you remember Garden State Park in New Jersey?

[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.260]
Sure.

[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.760]
For the truck I ever went to.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.400]
It was built with the same concept that it was going to be,

[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.500]
and they had all the glitzy lights inside.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.800]
It looked like a casino already.

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.920]
And that's what they had in mind.

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.080]
This is going to be a casino.

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.000]
Did it ever happen?

[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.340]

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.820]
Unfortunately for Garden State Park, Atlantic City opened about a half an hour away.

[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.640]
Well, I'm just talking.

[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.660]
It's just they put plus they never got the right to it anyway.

[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.200]
So the Garden State is history.

[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.340]
There's no more Garden State.

[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.460]
No.

[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.220]
It conveniently burned down.

[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.760]
Yeah.

[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.240]
Oh, it's always good to have one of those convenience fires, man.

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.600]
Yeah.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.700]
Remember on, ten years ago, the ash are new.

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.940]
It came back booming.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.900]
We got a new plant.

[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.800]
Well, I understand that they sign you sure of the racing industry now.

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.880]
To the what?

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.560]
That was Phil Jargev's word for John Henry.

[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.680]
He's the sign you sure of the racing world.

[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.980]
Phil Jargev, he was a suit.

[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.980]
He should be on our pool today, but nobody knows who he is.

[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.680]
He's super intellectual.

[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.760]
I mean, when you look at the cross section of people at a racetrack,

[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.820]
you're not going to be appealing to suits.

[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.780]
I mean, after there aren't some wealthy people and some cultured people up in the clubhouse,

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.420]
eating their check up rion and drinking fine wine.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.100]
But the general average racetrack, or is a slob like us, you know?

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.200]
No, I'm up in that clubhouse with the shats up rion and the firewood.

[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.620]
Well, that's because you get teased for free.

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.020]
So, in me too, it popped in a park.

[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.540]
That's right.

[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.760]
So, I don't, you know, I feel bad for these guys that they had all these wonderful plans,

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.200]
but you can't, when you understand where you are,

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.180]
and as far as the idea of, well, take a chance with somebody else,

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300]
who's going to be the governor?

[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.840]
Who are they going to get in that's going to be a friend of gambling God forbid?

[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.220]
The only gambling the governor likes is the lame ass lottery.

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.540]
That's all he likes.

[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.160]
The worst bet in the history of mankind.

[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.480]
Oh, one other thing.

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.900]
Caller will be open for simulcasting.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.280]
They'll make that an assman today.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.520]
So, Gulfstream will be opening and you'll be able to bet that caller.

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.380]
Well, that's wonderful news.

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.300]
I mean, you don't ever have to go to Gulfstream again.

[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.080]
That is correct.

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.880]
Boy, I don't know what you're going to be.

[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.280]
Of course, Pompano Park is open,

[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.100]
and I'm racing tonight.

[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.860]
Poker Room opens at noon in the car room.

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.620]
I just mentioned that.

[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.340]
I got some spots today, so I give him a little pre-plugged.

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.740]
Because I see Dick Fimbres quoted in this column here today.

[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.780]
He's upsetting the people in Alec Apri,

[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.260]
because simulers are upset, the guy at Gulfstream is upset,

[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.900]
and Dan Atkins and Hollywood Greyhoundza.

[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.820]
Let me say it again.

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.740]
You people don't realize where you are.

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.660]
Okay, you just don't get it.

[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.820]
You got to kiss the ground that you got anything.

[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.440]
And then they quote your fat ass governor,

[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.760]
oh, I just, it's not going to be a happy thing.

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.420]
I will sign the bill, but it's not going to be a happy thing

[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.000]
envisioning slots in Broward County.

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.740]
Like the world is going to come to an end.

[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.840]
Like if someone I'd surf in is going to like come,

[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.860]
you know, and then just blow everybody away.

[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.280]
Well, they can have Fox in this case,

[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.460]
because the state, which didn't want it in the first place,

[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.180]
but the people voted for it.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.020]
The people who got the chef, other people who voted for it.

[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.140]
The people who voted for it.

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.200]
The people who don't say about anything.

[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.820]
You know that.

[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.080]
Right.

[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.680]
And so what happens is, so the,

[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.580]
and I understand their point,

[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.900]
it was voted on.

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.160]
They thought they were going to get it.

[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.900]
It didn't happen.

[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.840]
And now they got it the states way.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.440]
So that they can minimize whatever the positive effect

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.800]
is going to be in the real deal.

[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.040]
And they're also damn lucky that they got the class three,

[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.680]
because, you know, they could have gone ahead and got hung up on that thing,

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.400]
because they don't know.

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.940]
It's a, it never said that.

[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.780]
And that's because they failed to put that in the wording.

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.280]
They would have had to go to the courts.

[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.220]
But, you know, they always,

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.860]
because they didn't put it in the wording.

[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.920]
It wouldn't have been a separate issue,

[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.800]
it would just clarify the central issue.

[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.180]
Yeah, they would have passed through this line.

[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.740]
And, you know, they were obsessed with the idea of doing it

[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.660]
in the name of education,

[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.540]
so that they, they thought that would be their ticket to get it done.

[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.740]
And then after a year goes by,

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.880]
or two years, then they'll say,

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.740]
oh, you see, it's not bringing in 500 million,

[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.480]
it's going to bring in 200 or 300 million a year,

[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.520]
and it's not with a promise to pick it up,

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.360]
and let's have another,

[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.280]
let's have another election to change this, you know,

[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.540]
to change the law and get rid of it and close them down.

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.000]
And that's what they're going to try to do.

[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.540]
You know that.

[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.320]
Hey, this state is dog fetch.

[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.280]
So, how's Gellie doing?

[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.760]
He puts up a little bit last night or not?

[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.940]
I didn't hear the game last night.

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.480]
No, I didn't either.

[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.460]
I watched a little bit before.

[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.480]
They were all speaking to me.

[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.640]
I could have come in here and listened to some of it,

[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.280]
but I want to give you a press before I went to bed.

[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.640]
Yeah, if I'm going to stay up late,

[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.900]
it's not going to be a listen to that.

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.900]
Well, why not?

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.340]
Because they're a better thing.

[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.620]
We love the panthers.

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.920]
They're really great.

[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.100]
Come on, let's get with it.

[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.560]
It was only 62.

[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.740]
What's wrong with that?

[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.680]
You want to highlight?

[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.600]
No.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.820]
Don't start with that again.

[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.320]
That was bad.

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240]
I just, I still can't go,

[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.620]
but I don't think I'll ever recover from that.

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.980]
I'll never be the same person again.

[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.960]
I'm playing the Panther in.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.880]
With Kelsey in behind the net.

[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.260]
It's going out in front of the store.

[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.720]
I can't stand able to jam at home.

[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.940]
I don't, I'm not going to comment.

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.720]
I've gotten to hear this thing.

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.200]
That's unusual.

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.040]
No, I just don't want to say.

[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.040]
I mean, because then I'll get a cue.

[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.120]
Oh, you rip everybody.

[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.300]
I tried to give them some support there in the beginning.

[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.520]
I heard little clips that I thought he was doing a good job,

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.940]
but he just, he doesn't get it.

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.660]
He doesn't understand.

[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.900]
He's not listening to other people.

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.560]
He doesn't understand how there's a way you broadcast

[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.920]
any kind of a sporting event,

[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.460]
and he doesn't understand it.

[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.580]
This business of putting Jimmy Cifalus on to do the dolphin game

[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.000]
is totally unqualified and putting Geldey on here.

[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.580]
It's like, it's like we're in kindergarten.

[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.000]
Soundflore is the kindergarten market of the universe.

[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.680]
And we're too old to be in kindergarten.

[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.780]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.140]
This is true.

[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.640]
Although I'll take the money though.

[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.440]
Today is payday.

[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.220]
Thanks, parents.

[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:14.820]
You're doing it.

[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.640]
Oh, and by the way, whatever you do,

[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.320]
and don't talk about the **** that.

[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.320]
Okay.

[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.080]
I get a call at $2.50 from Clarence yesterday.

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.120]
Seriously, between Clarence and Duff and Grey,

[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.700]
there isn't a psychiatric unit in the country

[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.020]
big enough to handle their problems.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.060]
I mean, just a mental mess.

[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.800]
Nothing that he couldn't have told me this morning

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.760]
when he came in, which he did about a half hour ago.

[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.020]
But I made a bet about the hour.

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.360]
And again, getting involved in something

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.120]
I have nothing to do with anyway, but that's okay.

[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.980]
Not that we want to talk about it.

[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.980]
No, we won't discuss it.

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.680]
Which thing is this?

[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]
We can discuss it.

[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.600]
Huh?

[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.100]
I don't want to lead you into anything.

[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.260]
No, you won't.

[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.460]
No.

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.420]
No, because you're the one that's there.

[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.120]
I'm not even there.

[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.480]
So.

[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.920]
I don't know.

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.440]
That's what you were told not to talk about yesterday.

[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.120]
See, I like throwing a sense of the number.

[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.640]
Oh, I know what I was told not to be there.

[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.040]
But I'm going to talk about **** see that.

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.740]
Or, and certainly you don't talk about ****.

[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.620]
And don't say **** and enjoy some good upset if you say.

[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.920]
So just dummy up.

[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.640]
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.100]
No, I'm not saying anything.

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.480]
No, I wish I may happy dinner a holiday.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.580]
Let's not get through it away.

[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.840]
Okay, the Goyam are already out of control.

[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.140]
Do you think that'd be a good seller?

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.780]
I got my DVD series come out.

[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.080]
Goyam gone wild.

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.580]
I think it's going to be a big seller.

[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.620]
The timing couldn't be better.

[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.280]
I like that.

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:32.900]
Yeah.

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.140]
All this crap about oh, they're trying to take.

[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.180]
Yeah, all this is diversionary tactics.

[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.200]
You know, to take it all this other crap is going on.

[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.920]
All these Republicans being indicted now.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.980]
And the war is like going to hell on a hand basket.

[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.900]
And oh, no, let's forget the fund.

[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.160]
These all worked up into a friends.

[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.420]
You know, they tried to take away our Christmas for much.

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.180]
Now, all right.

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.820]
Just to say it.

[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.600]
Rumsfeld says they're going to bring 20,000 troops home.

[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.780]
Oh, and I forgot to tell George.

[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.980]
You see the article.

[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.480]
The rumors now about Rumsfeld is going to be stepping down.

[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.560]
And you see who's poised to step in?

[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.960]
Julie Bremen.

[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.500]
Oi.

[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.740]
Is that pathetic or what?

[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.260]
That's why he's been sucking up so much.

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.180]
Because he wants to be the next secretary of the France.

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.760]
Yeah.

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.580]
He's going to have all the Orthodox Jews over there throwing

[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.120]
much of alls at the insurgents.

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.160]
Still ones.

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.320]
Still much of alls.

[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.340]
I don't know if that would happen.

[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:26.680]
Leave it.

[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.840]
You think we remain as a front runner for that job or front?

[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.440]
That's the rumor.

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.180]
That's what it says.

[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.260]
That's what he wants.

[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.200]
He's got his head way up somebody.

[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.780]
That's the mud.

[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.380]
I'll tell you that.

[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.920]
Well, listen, you have a great weekend.

[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.920]
It don't lose too much.

[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.020]
I had a good day yesterday.

[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.180]
Did you?

[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:42.720]
That's good.

[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.140]
I'm planning on a good day tomorrow morning.

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.060]
I'm going to go bright and early.

[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.440]
I've got about a half inch of snow overnight here.

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.500]
But it's going to be long gone.

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.100]
The sun is shining now by this afternoon.

[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.740]
It'll be melted.

[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.060]
There won't be a flake on the ground.

[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.440]
And then the rest of the North East is getting like a foot of snow.

[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.240]
Well, haven't we?

[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]
Not God would, boy.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:57.920]
We're lucky.

[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.380]
Yep.

[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.020]
I have to go to Atlanta.

[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.540]
So I'll be talking to you from Atlanta on Monday.

[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.380]
Excellent.

[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.520]
Well, I'm cracking.

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.080]
Don't tell the other.

[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.400]
It's crackers your last name, though.

[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.780]
No.

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.000]
They don't, they don't tend to archive to Atlanta.

[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.660]
I, uh, I once got a ticket.

[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.920]
I was at Fort Benning.

[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.620]
To be in Jewish?

[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.400]
Well, I was driving.

[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.160]
I was, yeah, basically.

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.400]
I was driving from Atlanta back to Fort Benning.

[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.540]
It was a DWJ driving while Jewish.

[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.800]
And I, I tried to be friendly to the guy.

[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.960]
You know, I got out of the car and I said, oh, I see you with the Shiloh police.

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.100]
And he said, I am the Shiloh Polines.

[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.600]
All right.

[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.980]
And I thought, my name is Wayne Stevenson.

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.460]
Very nice to meet you.

[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:41.840]
Right.

[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.400]
Now, I'm on my way back to Fort Benning.

[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.920]
Joe Smith, praises.

[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.020]
You're a serving art country.

[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:47.780]
Yeah.

[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.000]
Oh, beauty.

[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.420]
I had gone to a great, I'd never have been in a real-life-game.

[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:51.660]

[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.440]
You think Sandy even covered at 14 points?

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.500]
I'm not interested in that.

[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.440]
Not going to touch that, Kim.

[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.020]
You're not interested.

[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.720]
Not interested.

[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.020]
What about the, uh, Justin Abil, the, uh, uh, the building of Patriots?

[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.200]
I like the Patriots.

[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.640]
Well, thank God for that.

[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.320]
Yeah.

[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:15.660]
I think the Patriots are going to start to build a little, a little mo, a little, uh, a little mo, uh, but the good kind of mo.

[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.540]
Absolutely.

[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.360]
Excellent.

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.580]
Is there any other kind?

[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.880]
Well, there's a positive mo.

[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.160]
There's a negative mo.

[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.020]
Have a safe trip.

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.640]
Say goodbye.

[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.920]
Mo can go either way.

[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.440]
Don't say that.

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.440]
Christmas.

[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.580]
See ya.

[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.100]
See ya.

[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.180]
All right.

One branch and ready to help serve you?

[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.540]
If you want a free cruise, don't call them.

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.240]
If you want it, terrain on a sunny day, don't call them.

[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.820]
If you don't want the pay closing costs, don't call them.

[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.260]
If you want great rates, and you want to be...

[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.020]
God, call them.

If you can't be an INFS site, you can do step out of the camera chair.

[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.660]
And spread the legs of Joyce around you.

My mummy helps with paddy-pulls and ice, and comb ice and rub.

And make a murder, and hope that he makes a mistake.

[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.700]
I'm not that sure.

[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.800]
You should go for it.

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.840]
You should go for it.

[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.280]
Go for it.

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.240]
Go for it.

[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.500]
I can do it around.

[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.940]
The Hanukkah boys are getting high on a high holy day.

[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.540]
You better stay home.

[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:06.940]
Let's help this stuff.

[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.000]
My soul not go.

[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.660]
I don't touch a high call.

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.440]
Go for it.

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.980]
Go for it.

[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]
Go for it.

[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.120]
Go for it.

[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.100]
Go for it.

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.100]
Oh, I don't touch a ball.

[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.080]
Go for it.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.040]
Go for it.

[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.000]
Go for it.

[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.540]
Go for it.

[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.400]
Go for it.

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.620]
Go for it.

[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.400]
Go for it.

[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.560]
Go for it.

[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.000]
Go for it.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.240]
Go for it.

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.760]
Go for it.

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.840]
Go for it.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.020]
Excuse me, but I do believe that stuff is.

[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.600]
10-14, 5-60 WDQ-A-M.

[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.340]
10-14.

[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.020]
Wow.

[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.000]
So Josh Corners finally showed up.

[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.480]
I see it.

[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.740]
That's good.

[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.180]
No.

[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.620]
Well, who's putting the stories on there then?

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.340]
There.

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.520]
That's the Eric.

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.820]
Eric has put the stories on.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.280]
I thought you said he was coming in this morning.

[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.840]
I don't say that.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.780]
That's when my girl told me.

[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:22.780]
He better be.

[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.620]
He better not pout.

[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.040]
I think he's busy getting his tetanus shots for his trip to a Seattle.

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:30.840]
Yeah.

[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.980]
Do we have to get shots now?

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.740]
Like the bird flu shot, the tetanus shot, and the swine flu shot.

[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.400]
Maybe just get shots.

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.200]
That would be good.

[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.660]
14 past 10 at QM.

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.880]
So we got Miguel and there was very, what's the word?

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:42.840]
Confrontational.

[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:43.780]
Confrontational.

[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.800]
That's the word around the building.

[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.040]
What about silly people there?

[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.780]
It's so good not to see some of them.

[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.200]

This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62 A.M.

[00:17:49.980 --> 00:18:03.280]
The rebuilding of this football team, we will be pointing at December 4, 2005 and say that was the day this core group of players learned how to win football games.

[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:09.540]
The next dogs in the end is news 40 cents, which renews Prime Six and she can't.

[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.680]
It's day.

[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:20.200]
Oh oh, you play any town at 5.60 WQA.

[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.820]
The grandma got run over at the Walmart.

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.180]
Trap rolled under shoppers, breeding feeds. Get out of my way you pervert.

[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.680]
It was Sunday after Thanksgiving.

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.740]
Oh, the poor grandma didn't even know she'd be dead to meet.

[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.720]
Every year we now retract all she wanted was a player.

[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.860]
Congratulations. You ruined Christmas.

[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.880]
More the DVD she owned.

[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.060]
Merry Christmas, Christmas.

[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:57.680]
But when those faithful doors swung open, the Walmart she was stepped on and begged up straight to the bone.

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.840]
Grandma's now white out of action.

[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.840]
In a hospital she sits.

[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.280]
After her body is in traction and she even needs a nurse to take us.

[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.900]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart.

[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.880]
Trap rolled under shoppers, breeding feeds.

[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.740]
It was Sunday after Thanksgiving.

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.760]
Poor grandma didn't know she'd be dead to meet.

[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.860]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart.

[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.740]
Trap rolled under shoppers, breeding feeds.

[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.800]
It was Sunday after Thanksgiving.

[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.640]
Poor grandma didn't know she'd be dead to meet.

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.040]
No, operator, give me the number for 9-1-1.

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.360]
Merry Christmas, everybody. Love your ass.

[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.620]
10-19-5-60-4-gramma.

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.580]
She must have been the one that got the trampled when the Xbox came on.

[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.460]
So what's the story with Josh there?

[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.280]
I think we're having like Desi Woll over again.

[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.440]
What do you mean?

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.740]
Remember his predecessor?

[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.760]
I was given money to do the website and then it turned out I was like funding his problem.

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.500]
I think I checked it a couple days ago.

[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.260]
Somebody went out and got blitzed last night.

[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.160]
They probably in the bag.

[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.420]
They bought a big bag of crack with it.

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.240]
Well, some bag is something.

[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.460]
I see those stories are coming up very slowly on the website.

[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.080]
Those bedtime stories are going on there long time ago.

[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.040]
So he's still out there?

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:31.840]
No.

[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.720]
Well, where is he that the story that they're going to go up there?

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.300]
I told there it to start putting them on there.

[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.100]
Oh, I see.

[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.140]
So in other words, this is a mystery.

[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.040]
He didn't say where he was or why he was going to be there before the show.

[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.360]
Now it's 20 after 10.

[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.520]
I didn't talk to him, Miguel did.

[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.340]
Yeah, well Miguel's too confrontational to tell us the truth.

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.740]
What's the story? Is he in the bag?

[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.980]
No, he worked late last night and I guess he worked late last night doing what?

[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:55.700]
A promotion.

[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.380]
A promotion?

[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:58.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.220]
You're putting the promotion in his casket is what you're doing.

[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:04.720]
I don't know.

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.920]
A promotion for what?

[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.040]
He went on a bit of gig last night.

[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.360]
Of what?

[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.180]
He was out at the fan bar.

[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.340]
Don't tell me this is another one that was mobile mic deals.

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.960]
No, metamobile mic deal.

[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.200]
Isn't it nice that we got Miguel with us briefly today?

[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.720]
He can tell us all about mobile mic.

[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.580]
Anyway, somebody faxes and says pink for a Floyd for the poll.

[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:32.420]
Back in the early 70s when Dark Side of the Moon came out, I was 12 and taken by a weird boyfriend of my sister, I see.

[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.580]
It's from Jim, so I wanted to be a weird boyfriend.

[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.600]
A boyfriend of my sister to a quadrasonic plane of this.

[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.220]
In attendance, just a bunch of pseudo intellectuals, the Floyd as these folks like to call them, have moved on to it but not much.

[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.800]
The Floyd.

[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.220]
Is that like the Donald?

[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.780]
I agree with this.

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920]
I know you're going to get all surly.

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.420]
I don't like that.

[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.600]
I put it on there for you.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.440]
Good.

[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.780]
I'm not your paper gym.

[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.200]
I'm not this is my idea.

[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.660]
And yeah, of course I disagree and so does most people.

[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.480]
But never the most here.

[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.960]
So the most people about steely then, I still don't care.

[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.200]
Like I told yesterday, I know what I like.

[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.640]
I'm never going to like something because it's popular to do or because it's somebody tells me it's supposed to like this.

[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.160]
It's not the point.

[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.700]
Like I'm an individual.

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.700]
See what I know is bad.

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.120]
That's the someone who's bad as being a secular humanist.

[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.040]
Sudo intellectual doesn't mean stuff you don't like.

[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.660]
Maybe for this or another poll, people who watch the crappiest of reality shows and tell you it's for educational purposes.

[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.140]
I know someone who's a student of psychology and that's her excuse for watching all this will.

[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.720]
Oh yeah, she's right.

[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.480]
Like a story.

[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.160]
I couldn't find, you know, I can't find MTV no more.

[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.100]
I don't understand that.

[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.440]
I found where the music channels are.

[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.180]
I got much music and much more music and much less and much show this and hip hop that.

[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.140]
I don't find it.

[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.840]
I can't believe that.

[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.740]
Anyway, here's the deal.

[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.760]
Before we do anything else, some more good news from Iraq.

[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:51.820]
A statement signed by an Iraqi insurgent group says in an internet posting that killed a kidnapped US security consultant.

[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.800]
The White House said it couldn't confirm the death.

[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.360]
They're waiting to find some body parts, I guess.

[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.520]
The statement posted on an Islamic militant web forum didn't identify the hostage and provided no pictures.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.380]
Video or other evidence he'd been killed.

[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.500]
It said pictures of the slang would be released later.

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.220]
The US embassy said it had no information to confirm the claim.

[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.840]
Although this is from the Toronto star and it's on the news here and it's on the news on the BBC.

[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.880]
And on publications from like civilized places.

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.920]
But in America, they're still checking it out.

[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.340]
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said he couldn't confirm that that city had no additional information.

[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.260]
At any time there's an American that's taken hostage and say priority for the administration.

[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.600]
And their safety turns a priority for the MSPY.

[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.280]
All the usual BS, all the usual propaganda.

[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.300]
Okay, here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.320]
What's America's most shameful event?

[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.480]
1492.

[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.520]
And we're not talking about Columbus.

[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.520]
That's the total of votes I cut it off right at that point.

[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]
After that was a nice total of new.

[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.960]
1492.

[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:45.420]
Huy thing.

[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.620]
Each being on American.

[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.380]
Slavery, 340.

[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.240]
Shameful.

[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.900]
Massacre of the Indians, 292.

[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.000]
I don't blame them for sawing those cancer sticks.

[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.520]
Fixed 2000 election, 274.

[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.680]
Invasion of Iraq, 249.

[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.620]
And then it's those four.

[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.820]
Those were the big four yesterday and into big four right now.

[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.540]
Way down.

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.780]
Clinton in peach from 76.

[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.940]
Vietnam, more 55.

[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.380]
Segregation 52.

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.960]
Civil War 32.

[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.400]
Now how come that wasn't much higher?

[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.000]
Civil War.

[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.880]
They forgot about it.

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.720]
You know, it was long ago.

[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.880]
They have peace be asked, go ahead, only.

[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.920]
About 30, man.

[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.740]
Like I said, if this would have been WQA, QBA, man, or man,

[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.980]
it had like 30,000.

[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.480]
That's just 30.

[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.040]
All the old green tooth people would be like spitting at their radios.

[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.400]
They have paid that Kennedy son of a, you know.

[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.020]
Japanese internment camps, 22, the McCarthy witch hunts, 22.

[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.620]

[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:38.860]
Watergate, 12.

[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.860]
Invasion of Haiti, 8 months.

[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.100]
Other Haitians don't say that, do they?

[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.500]
Yeah, man.

[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.700]
I don't know.

[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.020]
Well, what do you mean you don't know?

[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.940]
I get into the Jamaican thing.

[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.240]
I get to know that a Haitian thing, is it?

[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.880]
That you know more Haitians than I do.

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.380]
I don't know any Haitians.

[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.040]
There you go.

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.740]
Well, I know some Jamaicans.

[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.320]
I know some Jamaicans.

[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.480]
I know some Jamaicans.

[00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.480]

[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.080]
Oh, he doesn't count.

[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.160]
You know what kind of car they drive?

[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.880]
A good machine?

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:03.820]
A good machine.

[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.500]
No, you got to say, well, a good machine, mine.

[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.240]
It's a good machine.

[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.680]
Santa Mutscher, 7, A Ryan Contra, 6.

[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.380]
Invasion of Grenada, had only two.

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.120]
An invasion of Panama.

[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.380]
Somebody finally voted for it.

[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:12.860]
One.

[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.100]
They don't want to get involved with Norega.

[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.840]
They're afraid they'll catch that zip thing he's got.

[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.680]
Now, today's poll.

[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.100]
Let's see, I already got the one for tomorrow.

[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.240]
I got just pools all over the world.

[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:24.880]
For the weekend.

[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.240]

[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.680]
The one that replaces this.

[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.600]
I don't know.

[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.820]
Is this one staying on all weekend?

[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.000]
What we got on, I don't think so.

[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.480]
794 votes, though.

[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.340]
I think we'll make a thousand.

[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.380]
They even with the no-jobs court is there today.

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.820]
Well, this is I see.

[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.400]
So in other words, he's at home now.

[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.040]
That must be the deal.

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.880]
He's probably still cat napping, yeah.

[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.660]
Well, no, because he's, oh, that's right.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.140]
He said, Eric's putting the stories on there.

[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.260]
See, see, that's the bad deal.

[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.300]
The other side, it's like, if you pay somebody for something before they do the work,

[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.360]
don't ever do that, okay?

[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.540]
Don't ever pay anybody anything until the job is complete.

[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.380]
Because then all of a sudden they start slacking off.

[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.400]
That's exactly what happened.

[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.140]
He got that check.

[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.900]
He touched it.

[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.380]
He went out and got trashed.

[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.020]
Where did he go for this thing last night?

[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:09.760]
Is there some bar?

[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.820]
Is there some flusy bar?

[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.300]
Yes.

[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:12.700]
Really?

[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.880]
You know, you're interfering with our show, Mr. McGill.

[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.280]
I mean, not only are you confrontational on the year, but also off the year.

[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.020]
You're interfering with one of our very important people on this show.

[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.920]
Hey, he wanted to go.

[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.320]
He wanted to go where?

[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.800]
Where was this in the group?

[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.960]
Where, what, does it have a name?

[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.560]
Van Bar.

[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.360]
I said that right.

[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:29.800]
Oh.

[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.260]
Sending him to a bar is like taking a, taking a five-year-old kid with a loaded gun and putting him

[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.220]
in the middle of elementary and in the middle of kindergarten.

[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.760]
Name somebody or something strictly for pseudo-intellectuals.

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.440]
That's our poll today.

[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.760]
Not strictly for girls.

[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.240]
Strictly for pseudo-intellectuals.

[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.200]
794.

[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.080]
Kabala.

[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.740]
How do you say that?

[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.240]
Kabala?

[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.020]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:52.720]
132.

[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.200]
It's, it rhymes with halva.

[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.160]
How do you say that?

[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.140]
That's how you say Kabala.

[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.340]
Kabala.

[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.840]
That is another one, 21.

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.680]
Maybe he'll take up Kabala or maybe the very least Scientology.

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.200]
Poetry 75, Polo 74.

[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.140]

[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.020]
Wonder if Bobby Fisher is still trying to blow up America, you think?

[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.140]
Suitshi 41, Paris 36th, Jeopardy 32, Bakarah 28.

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.300]
I used to call Bakarat.

[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.500]
It says I'm an old slob.

[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.360]
Bakarah.

[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.200]
I never knew.

[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:25.600]
28th.

[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.940]
Dave Matthews Band 27.

[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.660]
They suck.

[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.920]
Oh, you can't say that.

[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.180]
All the young punks are in them.

[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.920]
No, no, no.

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.340]
I don't know who is.

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.060]
I hope not.

[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.620]
Bridge 16, Pulp Fiction 9, wine 8.

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.800]
Try the wine?

[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.320]
I never drink wine.

[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.640]
Where would Project 8, 2001, a Space Odyssey 7, you'll love the dialogue.

[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.060]
Man, even the gilker understand it.

[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.580]
Any language?

[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.060]
Steely Dan 3, Pink Floyd already is on earth.

[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.280]
Already has got a pair.

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.160]
This.

[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.040]
How do you like that?

[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:52.820]
New Roger.

[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.840]
New Syncco.

[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.700]
No 516, QA.

[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.680]
Oh, you bastard.

[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.880]
Hey, how the hell are you?

[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.840]
Welcome to Jack in the box.

[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.960]
I'm Jack.

[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.600]
Can I be happy to fill your order if you know what I mean?

[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.260]
Uh, it's like a Jack Burger in a large fris.

[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.340]
Sorry, pal.

[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.040]
We're cleaning the grease fryer.

[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.340]
We don't have any French fries today.

[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.200]
Oh, okay.

[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.320]
Uh, they just give me a small order of fries, please.

[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.380]
Love chief.

[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.840]
Maybe you didn't hear me.

[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.140]
I said we don't have any f***ing fries today.

[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.780]
So how about something else?

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:38.780]
Oh, okay.

[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.100]
Then, uh, just get an order of fries.

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.000]
Listen up, pal.

[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.180]
I hope with the straw and straw berry.

[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.720]
Make sure you do that, right?

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.760]
Make sure you did.

[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.560]
Who put the 8-8-4-5?

[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.380]
Make sure that it's right.

[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.280]
Make sure you did.

[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.580]
Now, listen carefully.

[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.340]
Who put the freaking French fries?

[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.280]
Uh, there is no freaking French fries.

[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.020]
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.720]
But, breath, there ain't no freaking French fries.

[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.080]
Now, get out of my sight before I shove your teeth so far down your f***ing throat.

[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.520]
You'll have to sit on the Jack Burger to eat it.

[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.480]
Oh, have a nice day.

[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.120]
And happy holidays to you.

[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.880]
Happy generic holidays.

[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.520]
I played that cause there were playing all the oldie and moldy stuff

[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.220]
between the end of the year, right?

[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:22.860]
Right.

[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.140]
As much as I really can't stand it anymore, it was all the first time.

[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.100]
And then, like the next 4,000 times it was mildly amusing.

[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.660]
And last 40,000 times it's lost its lust, right?

[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.800]
It's like Jack himself.

[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:34.540]
Yeah.

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.460]
1032, like here is Johnny, like that horrible movie, The Shining, which uh,

[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.680]
where's the nut on there?

[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:41.540]
What?

[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.500]
That qualifies?

[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960]
You think so for the poll today?

[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:44.400]
I do.

[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.700]
Okay, The Shining.

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.320]
Anybody that tells me that that was a good movie.

[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.480]
That was a red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum.

[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.040]
And that was the most exciting part of the movie when it killed a red rum.

[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.940]
It was a crap.

[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.960]
And, you know, again, suspension of this belief or the other way around,

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.460]
this belief of suspension.

[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.180]
And he sit there at the typewriter and I come to find out the whole time

[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.480]
he's been there, he's been typing the same crap over and over again.

[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.560]
Now is the time for everybody to turn this off and watch something good.

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.080]
I think he was trying to warn us.

[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.760]
The Shining.

[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.000]
We got Shined with that.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.760]
Anybody that paid to see that, you got Shined.

[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.900]
Legislators said 50% tax rate is 6000 slot machines approved for

[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.480]
Howard and we can only hope that there'll be good machines, man.

[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.120]
As the parametrile people got hoesed again, which is very sad, but what did

[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.140]
you expect, guys?

[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.580]
What did you guys expect?

[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.180]
You're in a redneck Yahoo Bible thumping hypocrite state, an addition of which a lot

[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.180]
of these guys are getting smeared out of the table by certain, uh, certain

[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.480]
people with a conflict of interest.

[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.300]
I don't want to mention no names, but they're getting slipped to Mickey, you see what I'm

[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.460]
saying?

[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.520]
And that's why there are no casinos in Florida right there.

[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.260]
You got the cruise ships to nowhere, you got the Bahamas and then of course we got this whole

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.420]
Indian situation now.

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.260]
And out of this thing past, you do realize that no matter how much show your fat ass

[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.000]
governor protests, the Indians have been putting in a full-fledged casinos there pretty soon.

[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.600]
So all the way around, the firm reaches are going to get the hoesed on this deal.

[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.520]
Because now that they've got clastery machines, it means they can put in clastery gaming

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:23.180]
and that means they're put in like poker and, uh, want a blackjack and cracks and all that

[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.680]
stuff.

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.220]
Broward paramutrials yesterday won a long-awaited legislative go ahead to install Las Vegas

[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:34.480]
Dowslots, but their joy was muted by prevent projections at a high tash rate and their

[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.200]
profits would, would stifle plans to build a glittering entertainment hotel complex as they

[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.680]
hoped for.

[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.520]
I imagine we'll have to go back to the drawing board said Dick Feinberg, General Manager

[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.660]
Pompadopar, Carter Streck, and by the way, Dick, people are talking about those Hawaiian

[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.240]
shirts, which is owned by the Alec Capricacino as the higher the tax, the more difficult it is

[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240]
to justify an investment.

[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.540]
Well, this is what they got.

[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.480]
They got hoes, man.

[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.420]
And finally, passing the slots of the legislation exactly nine months after Broward voters demanded,

[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.920]
legislators said a 50% tax rate, one of the highest in the country, combined with requirements

[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.680]
for the paramutrials and over some of their profits to the county and local cities, as well as

[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.440]
horse and dog readers and owners, some officials said the actual tax and profits would be close

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.920]
to the 65%.

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.220]
I think it's setting them up for failure, more incendators, Steve Gallard, Democrat, and

[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.220]
Hallendale Beach, one of the legislators, legislature's vocal gambling proponents.

[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.340]
I believe they're doing this so the governor can lead a repeal campaign and say, see, I took

[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.960]
a look what they have, instead of those nice facilities you were promised.

[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.460]
The regulations approved by the House 110 to wait and then the Senate 23 to 14, a lot of

[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.660]
counties for per mutual suites installed to 1,500 machines, mine.

[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.680]
Owners of the areas highlight front-on and three race tracks had planned to renovate their aging

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.660]
facilities once they were allowed to install slots, adding restaurants, nightclubs, entertainment

[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.220]
stages, hotels, convention centers, all of these things.

[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.000]
But those plans were based on legislators agreeing to a lower tax rate and more machines, mine.

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.880]
Finders, Pompe and O'Park had envisioned a $150 million complex that included two hotels, restaurants,

[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.180]
$157,000 square foot casino, and even a water park, a casino mine.

[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.680]
Plans unveiled in the spray product with Greyhound called for a Martigraf theme with one or 200

[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.340]
entertainment stages, at least three themed bars, a restaurant, a summer cast theater, and a casino.

[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:24.800]
On Thursday, Dan Atkins, vice president of Hollywood Greyhound said he would now likely spend 35 to 45 million

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.960]
to be among them existing building.

[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.320]
The grand plans I have for expansion I still have, and if I can make a work out of this tax rate and

[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.080]
an environment to compete with the Indian tribes, then I'll have to decide later whether to go ahead said Atkins.

[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.180]
The leader of the drive to get slots approved by voters statewide then in Broward.

[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.120]
Broward County Commissioner Eileen Lieberman who backed the slots referendum in the spring said it's unfortunate that

[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.000]
the legislature has once again tormented the world of the voters, but imposing such a high tax rate they guarantee

[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.140]
that less money will be raised for education than promised by the constitutional amendment.

[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:59.740]
Still, the legislative compromise expected to raise $200 million from public schools by the 2007-8 school year,

[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.060]
but it would have been like a 500 million, half a billion if they wouldn't have like stifled and

[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.000]
what is crap that they're doing.

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.600]
But that's your state.

[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.300]
You know, you people choose to live there, nobody's holding their hostage.

[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.200]
It is what it is.

[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.600]
It's a backwater horse ball, redneck Yahoo Bush league town, and it always will be.

[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:15.780]
The whole state.

[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.860]
It's La La Land.

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.120]
It's a place where old people go to die and it's a place where illegal aliens come on rubber rafts,

[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.440]
and it's a place where nobody knows from freedom or anything.

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:31.540]
Elections are meaningless, whether it's the presidential election in 2000, whether it's elections on a bullet train,

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.040]
or whether it's election about class size amendment, or election about the slot machines in Broward,

[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.300]
it means nothing because they do whatever they'll, there's redneck, want to do anyway.

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.680]
Speaking of slime ball politicians, this Jew Lieberman man, he really frosted my fat old smelly ass.

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.580]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:46.920]
Yeah.

[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.800]
He just pisses me off.

[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.240]
He uttered.

[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.100]
Matthew Rothschild in the progressive, it's on our website because thanks Eric for abandoning.

[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.280]
I was the judge there yet or not.

[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:55.680]
No.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.720]
What's the story? Has anybody heard from him?

[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.580]
I just thought to him.

[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.520]
And what do you say?

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.600]
He's, he's, he's, he's heard.

[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.740]
It's 1038 in the sunshine state.

[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.680]
Well, you really are missing of our people.

[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:10.700]
What?

[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.940]
Next thing we got taken Georgia out this weekend and buy them drugs.

[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.140]
Well, you won't be buying them.

[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.880]
A new low for Lieberman.

[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.700]
There are fewer and fewer people around.

[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.540]
How is that, what's his name, Zoltan doing, by the way?

[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.060]
I heard he needs some more eggnog for the holidays, George.

[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.440]
George.

[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.500]
What?

[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.060]
There are fewer and fewer people around for a bush to call on to make his case on a rack.

[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.560]
So he's put himself, Cheney Rumsfeld and Connellese, a rice on a propaganda miracle round.

[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.620]
But there is one other person he's been calling on, the executable, I don't even know what that means.

[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.480]
ZXECRABABLE, executable.

[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.660]
The obnoxious Joe Lieberman, who is discredited while a little remade of his Democratic bonafide

[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.960]
is by parroting the bush line.

[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.620]
You just can't get more upsequacious than Joe Lieberman who wrote in the Wall Street Journal on November 29th.

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.580]
The administration's recent use of the banner, Clear Hold and Build, accurately describes the strategies I saw

[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.720]
being implemented in Iraq.

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.180]
And when you start praising the propaganda slogans, you know you're deep in the bush pocket.

[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.060]
And that's exactly where Lieberman wants to be as he tries to warm his way into a position as a possible successor to Donnie Rumsfeld

[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.880]
if and when bush finally makes the Donald take a hike.

[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.200]
Lieberman is so much of a service to the Bush administration that the Prince of Darkness himself, Dick Cheney,

[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.340]
bestowed praise upon him in his speech on December 6th to another gathering of troops.

[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:35.960]
As some of you know, when I first ran for Vice President five years ago, my Democratic opponent was to find you a senator named Joe Lieberman Cheney said,

[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.380]
we disagree on some issues, but we stand together on this war.

[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.200]
And then Cheney proceeded to quote approving Lieberman's Wall Street Journal article.

[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.440]
At the same time, Cheney was speaking, Lieberman was ingratiating himself even further.

[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.820]
It's time he said for Democrats who distressed President Bush to acknowledge he'll be commander-in-chief for three more years.

[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.180]
Unless Joe, he's impeached to which valor rights he should be.

[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.120]
But even if Bush is there for a full three more years, no one sees what a mess Bush is making in Iraq.

[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.060]
No one who sees that has to start trusting him and backing him.

[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.400]
Lieberman went there, though, saying essentially that harsh criticism of Bush jeopardizes America,

[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.740]
we undermine the President's credibility at our nation's peril, he said.

[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.320]
What a... oh, God.

[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.580]
How is it possible you don't spit blood when you just hear his name?

[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.760]
I do not know.

[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.960]
Oh, brother.

[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.340]
We undermine the President's credibility our nation's peril.

[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.280]
Excuse me, but I do believe that, sir.

[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.180]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.560]
Leaving aside the fact that Bush has done a fine job of undermining his own credibility,

[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.260]
who is Lieberman to take off the muzzle and try to gag Bush's critics,

[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.340]
who has heated you in Fox News team that turns dissent into treason?

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.540]
We're supposed to be a democracy where the citizens have the presence to serve us

[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:46.060]
to equate the President's credibility with the nation's securities a monarchy-old notion.

[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.520]
As citizens were not obliged to salute the commander-in-chief,

[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.220]
and when Bush discredits this country with an illegal war and with torture,

[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.500]
there is no reason whatsoever to salute him.

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.180]
Hey, salude, Don Corleyon.

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.360]
For what's the story with Josh's, he's on his way or what?

[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.260]
And I don't know if it's a big deal.

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.260]
I mean, if he wants to turn around and go back home, I'm sure McGill would like to be in confrontational till two o'clock.

[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:07.360]
Always.

[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.880]
He's got nothing much going on there.

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.340]
Here's the schedule for next week.

[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.280]
Let's see if it's right.

[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.000]
Comporate Atlanta?

[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.340]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.220]
Kimba on Tuesday.

[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.240]
Well, that's really something.

[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.540]
I'd like to follow that, George.

[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.600]
All right.

[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.800]
I think Josh is working on Tuesday.

[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.000]
And Josh is going to be in Seattle on vacation all this week.

[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.160]
I think he's just practicing up for vacation next week.

[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.240]
Always a good idea to get a history.

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.440]
This is 5.60 Q.A.

[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.040]
Rock and roll historians digging in the childhood home of Jim Morrison.

[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.800]
Recently uncovered tapes of the legendary singer, no one knew existed.

[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.620]
And now you can experience a Jim Morrison Christmas.

[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:11.580]
Here's the chance to lift your spirits in this joyous season with the melancholy sounds of one of the most depressing artists in rock history.

[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.960]
Yeah, the chestnut roasts.

[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.060]
All the family's co-synths.

[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.720]
We're not a high-earser guy.

[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.680]
And the family's fine.

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.200]
It's the lizard king at his most festival, a Jim Morrison Christmas.

[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.580]
I hate him.

[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.040]
Please don't give one to me.

[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.520]
They're all one knowing when they can see out.

[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.420]
A Jim Morrison Christmas.

[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.260]
It's the CD that proves the Yolteide season is still alive.

[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.020]
1047.

[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:43.700]
He's alive.

[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.720]
He's got a little fancy buildup.

[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.620]
He's just fine.

[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.000]
We've got 800 and some on votes on the poll already.

[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.540]
We're going to have a thousand before you even know it.

[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.640]
Before Josh shows up.

[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:53.860]
870.

[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.080]
Okay.

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.420]
Now somebody says, let's see.

[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.020]
Well, in fact, we got two on these foreign language movies.

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:00.600]
Did you add that?

[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.220]
I put four in films on there.

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.420]
Four in films.

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.720]
Somebody says today's poll would be incomplete without including the New Yorker magazine.

[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.960]
While there may occasionally be good art on there,

[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.360]
I dare anyone who actually pick up the magazine and attempt to read it.

[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.080]
If this magazine is on your coffee table, you're a sued.

[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.600]
And they also say,

[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.920]
NPR, which George would say, great exception to that.

[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.420]
They have a good point.

[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.620]
I mean, I listened to the news in the morning,

[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.400]
but the rest of their programming is for us all about jazz.

[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.000]
Really, McCain?

[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.460]
Oh, be damned.

[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.240]
Know the bad stuff.

[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.100]
They let him out yet.

[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.720]
NPR, okay, let's get that on.

[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.280]
Our PBS, no question about it.

[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.540]
They got a couple of good things on here.

[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.340]
But generally speaking, it's Kaka, man.

[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.600]
Aren't they kind of the same entity?

[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.100]
Can we just put NPR slash PBS since one is TV and radio?

[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:41.760]
No.

[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.340]
Okay.

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.520]
Volvos.

[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.760]
Well, see, the more selections you put on there,

[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.980]
the more these people feel they got to choose from, okay?

[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.780]
And the more they sit and scratch their heads kind of like a Dalima, see?

[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.280]
Curb your enthusiasm.

[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.060]
I haven't ever seen it, so I don't, I can't comment.

[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.460]
Anybody seen it?

[00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.600]
I've seen it.

[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.260]
It can be funny, but it's a little bit reachy.

[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.100]
Okay, Brian watches it.

[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.020]
Mike Reachy?

[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.220]
Well, what a schnauz.

[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.120]
You would not like it.

[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.920]
Oh, because it's the co-producer of the Seinfeld Show is the guy.

[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.740]
Oh my god, well, in that case.

[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.440]
In case you want to see him cranks, fat.

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.400]
870 votes, and we already got the four in films, and we already got three.

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.920]
New Yorker magazine's already gone.

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.440]
And the shining doesn't have any, because probably this audience liked the shining.

[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.240]
Oh, you guys just didn't understand, and it was a great movie.

[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.940]
And acting in there was just, yeah.

[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.240]
There was a couple things to like, but it was, yeah.

[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.940]
Here is Johnny.

[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:33.960]
That's a bit much.

[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.740]
It was a dollar.

[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.840]
It had some suitism in it.

[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:37.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.760]
I guess, because it must have been way over my stupid ass, so I'll say that.

[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.200]
5670560 might take a few calls today.

[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.160]
Maybe not.

[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.400]
Pound 562, they've arrived in Singular Wireless Line.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.560]
Nobody QAM, hello?

[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.320]
Hey, man, good morning.

[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.540]
Yes, sir, one is Diaz.

[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.900]
How about William Buckley for the poll?

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.500]
William F. Buckley is a magnificent choice.

[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.820]
He's still alive, what a shame.

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.520]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.520]
I can put you up there.

[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.880]
Okay, give me a new phone.

[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.860]
William F. Buckley, Jr., he is still alive.

[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.020]
Although we don't see him too much anymore, so there's something to be thankful for during the holidays,

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.600]
is that we don't see too much of William F.

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.900]
I don't want the else to be in for him.

[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:15.780]
William Buckley.

[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.360]
Ever you're for him?

[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.280]
I said, I hope I spelled it right.

[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.560]
How would you spell it?

[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.740]
B-U-C-K-L-E-Y.

[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.980]
How else would you spell Buckley?

[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.360]
Just like that.

[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.280]
I see.

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.760]
Maybe you put the F in the wrong place.

[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.780]
That would be your style.

[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.560]
Yeah, I was thinking that.

[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.140]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound-5-60, the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440]
We loved the Panther.

[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.980]
They lost 62 out of the course last night who were sleeping and he missed the broadcast.

[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.220]
I'm sure it was a scintillating broadcast again here on Q-I-M.

[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.900]
I'll say one more thing to about those clips that we keep playing with Goliath.

[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.020]
I don't know who's engineering those games, but it sounds like he's in a broom closet.

[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.720]
The crowd noise is not...

[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.820]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:38.940]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.460]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:41.460]

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:41.460]

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:41.460]

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.340]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:42.440]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.820]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.940]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.700]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.780]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:01.980]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.000]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.000]

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.000]

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.400]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:02.700]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.980]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:04.980]

[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.300]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.020]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.400]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.300]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.320]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.720]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.020]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.120]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.200]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.900]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:27.640]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:27.640]

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:27.640]

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:27.640]

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.140]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.300]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:28.940]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.200]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.680]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.300]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.060]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.160]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.420]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.760]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.840]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.120]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.180]
I don't know who's engineering those games.

[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.760]
So, but anyway.

[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.180]
And so, what was his response?

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.200]
What was his response?

[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.380]
I'll tell you what. He was pretty cool about it.

[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.880]
I must say he said, you know, there's more important things to worry about.

[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.560]
Like, looking at yourself in the mirror in the morning and doing just still there.

[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.560]
You know, but you really didn't let him get under a skin.

[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.860]
I was like, look for you all of them all.

[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.400]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:07.920]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.020]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:08.220]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.520]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:18.380]
I told you it's the holiday season and the moment is the season.

[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.960]
That's really great. That's pretty good cake

[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.860]
Didn't start this thing till seven o'clock last night

[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.720]
There's probably some other suits of the shining. There's never any votes

[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.560]
I think we pissed them off with that not that I care, but I think they like the shining

[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.820]
Because they like Jack Nierhels and so much you know something that's a good pull for someday

[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.080]
Well

[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:03.300]
Movie you convinced yourself you like because one of your favorite actors or actresses within it

[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.580]
Even though the movie sucked that that's kind of a lot. That's kind of a long question

[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.980]
But you see where I'm going with that. Yeah

[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:18.120]
But movie that you convinced yourself was really good because you love Jack Nicholson or you love filling the blank where it is and the movie sucked

[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.120]
That's it. That's a prime example

[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.660]
I'm trying to think of any examples

[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.620]
I

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.980]
Mean I know movies I like because some chick gets naked in the movies. Well, what's wrong with that?

[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.940]
Like a monster's balls all that happened to be a very good movie with a lot

[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:38.920]
I know I'm acceptable ending but it was a good movie. No like something like blue lagoon even though that wasn't really her

[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.460]
Well blue lagoon it was not really broke

[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.200]
No, but it was the other one was in there. Don't was the one in pair paradise

[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:52.660]
Mila Jovovich me. No, no, no, no paradise. I'm sorry. I think of blue lagoon two paradise with Phoebe Kate's oh excuse me Phoebe Kate

[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.240]
She was kind of boy. Hi, Joey which was really her

[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.200]
It was her and here's the trivia because they offered to like tape her hair down on a

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.300]
Large your breast and she did what is it on on in that movie?

[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.780]
They offered to tape Phoebe Kate's hair down over her boobs so that the wind wouldn't blow out of the way

[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.600]
She's yeah, get out of here with that

[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:19.240]
So you go Phoebe we appreciate that I see what did he just say the wind would want when he's a singer? He said hi Josh

[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:26.460]
Oh Josh did I showed up huh he did well I'll be damned now. You were my consensual big deal about it. I told you he'd be there

[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.380]
How does he look hungover?

[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.680]
He always looks hungover

[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.880]
He always is

[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.120]
Friday you

[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:10.420]
Oh

[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.400]
the

[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.880]
Heaven

[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:49.220]
It is an evidence, where the true

[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:55.000]
And when you hear the wind, you hear the wind,

[01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:05.740]
And when you hear the wind, you hear the wind,

[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.940]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:14.220]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.240]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:23.160]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.560]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:39.220]
And when you hear the wind,

[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.120]
Oh, whoever put in there put a nice tip cue in that knot,

[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.160]
But that's okay, it was a nice pregnant pause, wasn't it?

[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:44.920]
It was fine.

[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.440]
Twenty past eleven, it kind of fit in with the ambiance of the whole thing.

[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.400]
I got another one for the poll that we could not possibly have left off this long.

[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:51.840]
Opera.

[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.200]
Oh yeah, the opera.

[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.140]
You were thinking the other night.

[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.020]
Opera.

[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]
Let's go to the opera.

[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.180]
What kind of people go to the opera?

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.240]
I guess they're sick.

[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:03.640]
Really?

[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.040]
Yeah.

[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.100]
I see.

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.960]
Well, welcome to Josh where I showed up today.

[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.340]
It's only eleven points not too bad.

[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.240]
Yeah, I missed the first hour, you know.

[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.620]
Yeah, but I think it's too much.

[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.080]
Nothing, nothing exciting happened.

[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.360]
We go in there ripping you an ass.

[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.040]
Mm-hmm.

[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.520]
Offer your course.

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.260]
But nevertheless, that's okay.

[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.760]
You went out and got drunk last night and what's the bulletin' about that?

[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.320]
It's just life is a punk, you know.

[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.440]
You have to get this out of your system.

[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.940]
Another ten, fifteen years, no problem.

[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.420]
Well, I have a promotion.

[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.400]
Then I got drunk.

[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:31.720]
I see.

[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.160]
Oh, in other words, not an ethnic promotion, after the promotion.

[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.700]
Well, I don't drink while I work.

[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.620]
Oh, I see.

[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.240]
Well, that's a...

[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.340]
Doug Thompson, who writes the rant for the Capitol Hill Blue, he's the founder and publisher

[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.120]
of one of the best websites you'll ever read.

[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.360]
Bush, on the Constitution, it's just a GD piece of paper.

[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.780]
I got to do more substitution of words in this thing because he's just a pottymouth, and that's why I like him.

[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.800]
Tells it like it is old Doug.

[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.540]
He says, last month, Republican Congressional leaders filled a file into the Oval Office to meet with President Bush

[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.880]
and talk about renewing the controversial USA Patriot Act.

[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.400]
Several provisions of the Act passed in the shell-shock period immediately following 9-11, causing enough anger that

[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:17.040]
liberal groups like the ACLU had joined forces with prominent conservatives like Phyllis Shuflye and Bob Barr to oppose renewal.

[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.380]
GOP leaders told Bush that his hard-core push to renew the more honorless provisions of the Act could further alienate conservatives,

[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.300]
still mad at the President from his box to attempt to nominate one-house counsel Harry Admeyer to be Supreme Court.

[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.900]
I don't give a GD, Bush returned.

[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.080]
I'm the President and the Commander-in-Chief, do it my way.

[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.280]
Mr. President, one aid in the meeting said there is a valid case that the provisions of this law undermine the Constitution.

[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.180]
Stop throwing a Constitution in my Facebook screen back, it's just a GD piece of paper.

[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.480]
I've talked to three people present for the meeting med.

[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.060]
They all confirm that the President of the U.S. called the Constitution a GD piece of paper.

[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.840]
And to the Bush administration, the Constitution of the United States is a little more than toilet paper,

[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.700]
stained from all the schmit that this group of power-made disputes have dumped on the freedoms that GD piece of paper used to guarantee.

[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.420]
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, while still White House counsel, wrote that the Constitution is an outdated document.

[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.620]
Put aside for a moment, political affiliation or personal beliefs, it doesn't matter if you Democrat or public or independent,

[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:22.280]
it doesn't matter if you support the invasion of Iraq or not, despite our differences, the Constitution is stood for two centuries as the defining document of our government,

[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.100]
the final source to determine in the end if something is legal or right.

[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:31.820]
Every federal official, including the President, takes an oath of office, swears to uphold and defend the Constitution of the U.S.A.

[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:37.780]
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says even he cringes, even when he got to go to him and not see like him,

[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.820]
he cringes when someone calls the Constitution a living document.

[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.960]
Oh, how I hate the phrase we have a living document Scalia says, we now have a Constitution that means whatever we want it to mean.

[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.660]
The Constitution is not a living organism for Pete's sake.

[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.480]
As it judge Scalia says, I don't have to prove that the Constitution is perfect, I just have to prove that it's better than anything else.

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.020]
President Bush has proposed seven amendments to the Constitution over the last five years, including a controversial amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:11.040]
Members of Congress have proposed some 11,000 amendments over the last decade, ranging from repeal of the right to bear arms to a constitutional ban on abortion.

[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.780]
Scalia says that the danger of tinkering with the Constitution comes from a loss of rights.

[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:19.080]
We can take away rights just as we grant new ones he warns, don't think it's a one-way street.

[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.800]
And don't buy the White House hype that the USA Patriot Act is a necessary tool to fight terrorism.

[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:32.140]
It's a dangerous law that infringes on the rights of every American citizen and is one brave eight-fold president Bush, something that undermines the Constitution of the United States.

[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.740]
But why should Bush care after all the Constitution is just a G.D. piece of paper?

[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.740]
How do you like that, huh? G.D. is in...

[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.780]
Right, gosh dang. I'll be damned. And I'm sure I will be.

[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.600]
5670560.560.4.

[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.700]
Why is it in the singular? Why are the sline? How about those Panthers? Let's see, the Panthers plan again this weekend as you're hoping not.

[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.980]
Oh yeah, they've... oh, oh, tomorrow night at the LA Kings, that could be ugly.

[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.800]
About these suddenly be Juvenated this season, LA Kings.

[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.140]
962, I told you it would be over a thousand by noon today on a Friday, no less.

[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.460]
Wouldn't you think that a lot of people already are like off to the races for the holidays?

[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.540]
That's getting that way. I don't think so.

[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.800]
I know Josh is bailing out on this for Seattle.

[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:22.760]
Well deserved. We thought maybe it took that trek and you blew it all to the Indian... on the sloths. On the sloths last night, yeah.

[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.220]
Not? Oh no, I got a good line for that, but you're supposed to get very upset.

[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.540]
5670560.560.4.

[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.400]
Wierless line. WQAM, hello.

[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.100]
Hey, Neil, I got one for your poll, sir.

[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.220]
Yeah. Inside the actor studio with the pompous James Lipton.

[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.680]
Okay, thank you.

[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.880]
Inside the actor studio. Have you ever seen that?

[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.880]
Yeah, I saw one. He's a real sued. James Lipton. All the way to his iced tea.

[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.260]
Got some right here.

[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.560]
Do you remember? Yeah.

[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.540]
Good to wash down. Did you leave any of the... Josh probably is not needing mood anyway, one thing.

[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.020]
We did not eat his food.

[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.440]
Well, why not? White boogers in it.

[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.040]
Fine, he might enjoy that. It might be a favorite episode, especially when you can't tell him the chili.

[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.240]
You really can't tell the chili. Maybe in the beans in that ground meat.

[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:12.240]
He got BLTs where the bee stands for bogees.

[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.680]
I see. Bogey? Don't bogey that joint now.

[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.220]
965 on a poll like I said, we're going to... just phenomenal numbers on this thing.

[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.020]
And Joel Feinberg is tearing his guts out, tearing out his kichis.

[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.640]
I guess the publicity stunt didn't work, okay?

[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.440]
Maybe we'll have to have Sid walk out again only this time, not come back.

[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:37.080]
This is Neil Rogers, what solid myth is 5.69 AF.

[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:43.200]
The high standards of broadcasters in the tradition of Edward and the Rose scene at now.

[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.800]
560 WQAM presents now see here with Mohawi David.

[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.740]
I was more out of David.

[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.100]
Now see here.

[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.980]
Got a new gig in here.

[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:58.520]
And if I had so choose to stay, I will change the face of whatever that is told.

[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.400]
Now see here. Who did more for radio?

[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.240]
Neil Rogers or Hoeyboss Garandasant?

[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:04.860]
Ha ha.

[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.760]
Now again. Here's my last view.

[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.040]
Are you guys all praying?

[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.980]
I say Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:18.980]
That's who?

[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.520]
The one thing, he was the mayor of Boarding-Madian.

[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.680]
And I pipe smoke a hear no mayor.

[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.300]
Why Hoeyboss Garandasant sang nice song?

[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.180]
Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.840]
Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.360]
And you obviously will soon come up not in the name.

[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:38.480]
Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.460]
Why sure?

[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.220]
That there that's a Neil singing in the discharging songs about their going to not in the name.

[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.060]
And then a fat guy going to hear he writes them in the Neil's Singsum.

[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.500]
Now you know he's queer.

[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.300]
Because real men don't sing.

[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.900]
Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.060]
And another name. Hoeyboss Garandasant.

[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.740]
Well the last fat of the Neil too.

[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.860]
That there is what made them their best names.

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.760]
On the next installment of,

[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.600]
I'll see here.

[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.140]
Who made a better cup of coffee?

[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.100]
Mrs. Olsen or Jackie Robinson.

[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.140]
Damn I...

[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.140]
Now see me here next time for more indignants.

[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.300]
Now see here.

[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.680]
Not there over here.

[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.060]
Don't forget to o'clock this afternoon.

[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.780]
Well continues his ongoing battle with his never ending fight with human race.

[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.760]
11.32 a.m.

[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.640]
Let's see what we got here.

[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.300]
Team of scientists maps out 99% of dog genome.

[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.380]
See if there was a god,

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.200]
I'll tell you right now dogs would live the same lifespan as humans.

[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:31.640]
Yeah.

[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.160]
Do you agree with that?

[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.520]
I do it's a damn shame.

[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:40.140]
I mean you know you get a dog and you get attached to it and you raise it and you train it and you potty it up break it hopefully

[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.000]
and all these things and you get attached to it and then dies.

[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:43.680]
Right.

[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.860]
And we have to have it put to sleep even worse.

[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.300]
And parrots live for like over a hundred years those...

[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:48.780]
Parrots live?

[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.160]
Parrots live?

[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.420]
Well your parents sometimes them too.

[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.940]
Now I don't mind parents the both live too long.

[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.160]
90 and 91.

[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.260]
Oh geez.

[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.280]
Parrots live for a hundred years?

[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.720]
Yeah some of them those big like macaws and stuff.

[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.820]
And I figure how does that happen?

[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.120]
I thought small animals had you know short lifespans in that general way of it.

[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.340]
You would think so.

[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:09.740]
Right.

[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:10.520]
But no no.

[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.160]
Because small animals they have like little tiny hearts that beat real fast and of course went it down and wears right out.

[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:16.600]
Right.

[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.540]
That wouldn't thing with dogs.

[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.880]
Although I guess not really because no that's not true because little dogs live a lot longer than big dogs.

[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200]
I know so I don't get it.

[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.000]
I see.

[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.200]
Maybe small is good.

[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.760]
I'll keep saying that.

[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:37.420]
Scientists have finished a sophisticated map of a dog's genes providing new insights into the deep links between humans and one of their most treasured animals

[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:42.920]
as well as creating a unique tool for studying a range of diseases from cancer to blindness that affects people and their dogs.

[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:44.960]
Now let's see.

[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.120]
Where's the thing that there's a line in here?

[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:47.680]
I see.

[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.120]
Now get to it.

[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.420]
About evolution.

[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.740]
It won't get in fact.

[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.940]
Oh no you're not going to do that evolution thing.

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.520]
You're going to be not going to tell you design again.

[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.160]
You bastard.

[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:57.120]
Yeah ignore design.

[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:04.720]
A team of scientists led by the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT determined virtually the entire genetic code or genome of the dog

[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.000]
making the achievements that came on equivalent of a completion two years ago the human genome project.

[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:19.040]
The scientists said yesterday rough drafts of the dog genome have been released over the past several years but the new work represents the first highly accurate version and also includes for the first time a detailed library of

[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.180]
common genetic variation seen in dogs making possible new generation of fast accurate genetic studies of diseases and other traits.

[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:31.700]
Biologists have taken up the genetics of many animals but the dog is uniquely interesting and useful to scientists and because of its history.

[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.660]
The modern dog including several hundred breeds is the product of thousands of years of careful breeding ended throwing out specific behavior such as the obsessive

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.460]
hurting of the border quality or appearances such as the hairless Chinese crested.

[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.380]
I don't think ever saw one of these.

[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.300]
Did you know that I know we could always look it up Chinese are hairless though.

[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:57.740]
By applying the modern tools of genetics to these breeds it's now easy to find the smallest genetic variation responsible for the differences with applications from dog breeding the human

[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:05.280]
psychiatry. The genetic map of the dog announced yesterday should also accelerate the search for the genetic causes of diseases that take certain breeds perhaps

[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.040]
leaning curious for dog and man alike.

[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:14.220]
It's a historic day in the relationship between men and dogs that Eric Landr at a press conference as a pug and an a

[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:19.700]
key to a tussled in the back of the room at the base side exposition center where a dog was dog show was being set up.

[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.540]
Landr was the record the broad and two-toned or two golden retrievers. Oh man with excellent taste.

[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:32.080]
Scientists said the dog also stands as a testament to the power of evolution and its importance at a time when some are challenging its teaching in public schools.

[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.020]
Yeah, but let me read this paragraph again.

[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:44.200]
Scientists said the dog also stands as testament to the power of evolution and its importance at a time when some are challenging its teaching in public schools looking for the genetic causes of human disease.

[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:53.260]
And dogs make sense only of humans and dogs are close evolutionary relatives that share a common ancestor of fact that is strongly supported by the genetic map that Landr and his colleagues found.

[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:58.880]
Biomedical research today depends on evolution said Landr it's hard to say that evolution is just a theory.

[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.920]
How do you like that? I like it a lot under the dog.

[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.500]
Oh, and look at this.

[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.020]
What did you like with that?

[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.540]
Look at me. Look at this.

[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.020]
Oh man.

[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.400]
Sorry, Shana.

[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.020]
Let's see if it's toasty whether it got to like 28 or not.

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.340]
Sorry, Shana. That snow is melting. What a shame. What a good break.

[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.020]
I ain't seen that. I don't know what it's talking about.

[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.760]
What's minus three? What is that like 28?

[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.040]
I'll take your word.

[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:25.660]
26.

[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.700]
26 and zoom in on up there.

[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.860]
Man, it's going to be really toasty to a high of zero today.

[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.080]
The big 32 Fahrenheit.

[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.600]
What's not to like?

[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.960]
A University of Kansas professor who do criticism for emails he wrote to you writing Christian fundamentalist over creation.

[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:40.960]
Remember we talked about him?

[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:41.940]
Mama Recky?

[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.100]
As resigned as chairman of the Department of Religious Studies.

[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.800]
Paul Recky stepped aside on recommendation of his colleagues according to Barbara Ramzek,

[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:53.300]
Interim Dean of College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Kansas.

[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.220]
Contacted by the AP, Recky declined to comment about this.

[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.120]
This isn't only saying he was still a member of the University faculty and trying to continue teaching.

[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.800]
Recky had finally teach a course in the spring that examined creationism and intelligent design.

[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.740]
After the State Board of Education adopted science standards teaching evolution is a flawed theory.

[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.140]
It's a Kame Pinko conspiracy, okay, to try to like, uh,

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.120]
identify the Lord.

[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.600]
It's an anti-Christian movement.

[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.000]
I had one of those this morning's matter of fact.

[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:21.720]
I had two.

[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:27.220]
Originally called Special Topics in Religion and Intelligence Design Creationism and other religious methodologies.

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.640]
The course was canceled last week at Marquee's request.

[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.000]
Part of the reason, of course, he was getting death threats.

[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.460]
A recent, isn't this a guy, is this the one that got beat up or is that another one?

[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:35.960]
Different.

[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.580]
Oh, no, this is, no, this is a guy.

[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.020]
It is?

[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:38.460]
Oh.

[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.520]
A recent email from Marquee to members of a student organization referred to religious conservatives as fundees.

[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:48.420]
And said, of course, describing intelligent design as mythology would be a nice slap in their big fat face.

[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.180]
Marquee apologized for those comments.

[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.540]
Later, other emails written by Marquee that surface redeemed repugnant and vile by Chancellor Robert Hemmanway

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.680]
for their views toward Catholics and other Christians.

[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:04.980]
On Monday, Marquee was treated at Lawrence Hospital for head injuries after he said he was beaten by two men on a country road.

[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.160]
He said the two men referred to the Christianism course.

[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.300]
Law enforcement officials are still investigating.

[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:14.360]
Marquee joined the University in 89 as an expert in ancient Mediterranean cultures, languages and religions.

[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.060]
They all had their 30 tales all throughout history.

[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.400]
Every culture, they all made up their own stories, their own bubble mice, these men.

[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.840]
And the God did this and my God is better than your God, all of a sudden, the crap.

[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.700]
And you people are still supporting it, man.

[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.320]
Here we are to your 2005 and we're alive.

[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.460]
And you people are still a bit like a stone age.

[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.500]
Just look at Charster. He's in the stone age.

[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.180]
What are we going to do? Who's going to get you that liver when you need it?

[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:39.980]
What do you mean?

[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.580]
I drink responsibly.

[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.540]
I mean, come on.

[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:43.660]
I mean, come on.

[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.920]
I mean, responsibly, you said you got drunk after your appearance last day.

[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.440]
You said you got pie-faced drunk.

[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.360]
You said you got bags under your eyes bigger than Maria Bartero-Mo.

[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.440]
I probably do, but last time I checked, I'm going to do it.

[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.080]
Oh, nobody could have bags under my eyes bigger than Maria Bartero-Mo.

[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:57.780]
The Pope?

[01:19:58.700 --> 01:19:59.500]
Nah, the Pope.

[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:00.860]
Yeah, all of a sudden.

[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.520]
He is really a bag.

[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.980]
The Pope, the Nazi Pope.

[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.620]
The Pope says, by the way, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep.

[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:06.940]
Yeah.

[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.080]
This is how the Vatican Bank are going.

[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.260]
That's what he says.

[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:12.360]
985 votes.

[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:17.400]
We'll slide past 1000 before the big hand hits a little hand like a knife through butter.

[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.960]
As somebody we know would say.

[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.540]
You know who says that?

[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.180]
Butter.

[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:21.960]
Yeah.

[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960]
Boy, she, a boy, talk about luck, sugar.

[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.480]
Sugar and luck.

[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.200]
And butter and luck.

[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:27.900]
Sugar and butter.

[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:28.500]
And...

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:28.880]
Peta.

[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.620]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.180]
Oh.

[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.120]
I don't know if I can tell this story or not.

[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:36.720]
I guess I can.

[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360]
Because that was his name.

[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.320]
When I was a program director in Sarasota, WSPB, which is now something else, of course,

[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.980]
like everything else on AM, 70-03.

[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.040]
And we had a guy in the year.

[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.340]
His name was Peter Johns.

[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.500]
Talk about a pseudonym intellectual with a very deep voice.

[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.340]
And he was the ultimate pseud.

[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:54.640]
Peter Johns.

[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:56.140]
Okay.

[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.760]
And we had a guy in the midday who was in the afternoon, whose name was Laurel Shoemaker.

[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.920]
We called him the old turkey buzzard because he looked like one.

[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:03.840]
He was a funny guy.

[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.260]
Good guy.

[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.340]
He had one of those necks.

[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.760]
And he was always burdened stuff out on the year.

[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.160]
There was like right on the edge.

[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.940]
And he said, he was promoing the lineup like we do.

[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.600]
You know, like Stale Neal and Mismet.

[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.100]
And he was promoting Peter Johns in the morning.

[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:19.320]
Next morning, he said, you know, Peter Johns, 6 to 10, Peter Johnson,

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.680]
you're in the morning and fever all night.

[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.080]
Cute.

[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.180]
Yeah.

[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.380]
Well, this was 1973.

[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.060]
Oh, wow.

[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.560]
You just don't dance and even go there.

[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.380]
You mean in those days when you could say stuff?

[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.300]
Peggy, yeah.

[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.280]
You can just say that.

[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.660]
And Peggy Lee would have an irrespective.

[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.660]
And our general manager was Stookie Lanson.

[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:39.800]
Stookie.

[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.320]
His name was Cliff Lanson.

[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.600]
And we used to call him Stookie Lanson.

[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.200]
Well, you don't know your hit parade, Mr.

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.720]
You don't know your old time TV.

[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.900]
Why don't you get your buddy, Boca Chiconeck, Brian?

[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.060]
He's like, huh?

[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.220]
He spent our last encounter explaining Herboss Granderson to me

[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.440]
so that I could appreciate that bit.

[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:24.420]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.800]
That's good, that's weird.

[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.220]
including the two of you guys.

[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:33.780]
Well, of course we got Josh is getting a big raise and I think when he comes back from

[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.900]
Seattle he's got that surprise that TV for you.

[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:36.540]
Is that right?

[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.040]
You don't have that?

[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:38.800]
I'll set for George.

[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.120]
I heard he's got a picture of a Samsung 52-inch that'll knock your eyes out.

[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.780]
This is not the set for your picture.

[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:50.340]
This is 5.16 QA.

[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.140]
The USA cut me in my slider hole.

[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.840]
Now they call me over to a rag he come through.

[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:06.960]
But if the Americans don't keep me safe, ready to understand the day one more great in

[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.300]
Iraq.

[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.200]
Yeah, here in Iraq.

[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.300]
As all that they put me in the back, I will drop in the jail as Iraq.

[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.740]
My people can hardly wait to make me pay.

[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.600]
Just like they did with the day and who's there.

[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.640]
Only one way to try and over my post.

[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.000]
Call Johnny Cagran or Mark Geregos to Iraq.

[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.720]
Yes, they come to Iraq.

[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.900]
Johnny's unanswered is for me by the way.

[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.180]
He hit myself at home to stay alive.

[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.860]
Do they get through the jail as Iraq?

[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.400]
Maybe if I'm lucky I can stop a bleed.

[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.060]
Maybe I can even leave in San City.

[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.140]
I must have been crazy to get into this war.

[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.820]
It's like trying to steal donut from Michael Moore in Iraq.

[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.620]
Yeah, here is Iraq.

[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:02.780]
My head will soon be on the black and I will die in the jail as Iraq.

[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.540]
Die in the jail as Iraq.

[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:06.700]
Oh, right.

[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.580]
Die in the jail as Iraq.

[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:14.240]
1147 at 5.50 W.A.M. named something or someone strictly for pseudo intellectuals.

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.860]
1147 at this poll before we did.

[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:16.840]
No, it didn't.

[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]
A thousand in Yine.

[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.980]
A thousand in Yine, aren't you impressed?

[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:21.840]
Even went out to josh there this morning.

[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.440]
Maybe that's because you weren't there.

[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.760]
And thank you all to thank Eric personally for getting those saved in Berlin.

[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.480]
You ran out and getting those stories on this morning.

[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.000]
What are you talking about?

[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.020]
Eric didn't put the stories up?

[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.000]
No, I did.

[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.740]
Well, see there's Miguel again with that being the Ojampra Valkyrie Tour.

[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.260]
He said that Eric puts the stories up.

[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.900]
Well, if he did, they're on there twice.

[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.280]
Well, let me take a puket that.

[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.740]
Let's just take a puket.

[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.560]
I don't know if Miguel said that.

[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.320]
I told you I told Eric to check to see if they were up.

[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.280]
Oh, I see.

[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.840]
Well, how did you do that in the little chat box?

[01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.900]
No, I'm not talking about that.

[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:00.540]
I'm talking to Josh.

[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.820]
How did you put the stories up?

[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.980]
I put them up this morning before you left for work.

[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:05.760]
Correct.

[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:06.900]
I see.

[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.580]
That's what delayed.

[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.820]
In the fact, if I wouldn't put so many damn stories on there,

[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.600]
he'd have been in them probably right on time.

[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:13.680]
Not.

[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:14.700]
Yeah, that's where it was.

[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:16.000]
No, that must be what it is.

[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.840]
But all the stupid bedtime stories on there for crying out loud.

[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.360]
New low for Lieberman's got 77 reads already.

[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.020]
Well, I'll be them.

[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.260]
So I got that wrong.

[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:24.420]
Yes.

[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.340]
So Eric, this regard, what I said about thank you for whether you're doing whatever you did.

[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.380]
Well, you can start thinking about it because he's going to be doing it all next week, isn't it?

[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.300]
You give him the heads up and the heads down and the insides.

[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.620]
I will be talking to him today.

[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:36.020]

[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.080]
Because he said he hasn't had a good job at all.

[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.540]
I mean, I don't want to cry today.

[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.400]
So it's Friday.

[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.340]
So I'd call him now.

[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.920]
He's got to do a couple of days for me next week.

[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.380]
He can handle it.

[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.560]
In fact, it'll probably help him lose an ounce.

[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.820]
Science is developing invisible diet.

[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:54.580]
Well, what a segue.

[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.100]
It's just amazing.

[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.040]
I am amazed myself.

[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.340]
I'm always falling into a bucket of stuff.

[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.620]
And then you've got to use a lot of that body wash.

[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.200]
I don't know.

[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:05.600]
I just, I like body wash.

[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.600]
I never would go off of it.

[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.460]
But I need something new and exciting.

[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.520]
I think what I'm going to do this week is to get a little bit more into the body wash.

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:09.520]

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:09.520]

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:09.520]

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:09.520]

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:09.520]

[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.260]
We can just shop for body wash flavors.

[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.080]
All right.

[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.800]
Hey, make up your own recipe.

[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.060]
Any suggestion?

[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.720]
I got so many of them in there.

[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.900]
You know, maybe that's a bad idea.

[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:19.440]
Chocolate.

[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.460]
I got this whipped silk.

[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.000]
It's the same eyes, you know, the same chocolate that makes to be one you like the apricot.

[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:25.540]
Uh-huh.

[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.300]
Whipped silk.

[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.320]
And it's like purple.

[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.200]
And it looks like a play-doh.

[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.500]
You know, the best part about the same eyes.

[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.320]
It looks like a play-doh.

[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.020]
I understand.

[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.720]
And in other words, in schmere and play-doh on your body, it's what Socrates said.

[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.060]
Other brands have this and, uh,

[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.540]
besides saying eyes, but not all of them do.

[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.160]
The flat top so that when it gets down to the end, you can turn it upside down and have it all run down, you know.

[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.520]
So you don't waste it.

[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.540]
The flat top.

[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:48.360]
Yeah.

[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.680]
So you can turn the bottle upside down and leave it there on a ledge.

[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.140]
Oh, I see what you're saying.

[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.040]
Not any, because otherwise the, uh, the, uh, zest has got that.

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:55.780]
Zest has got it.

[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.740]
I don't think you're going to get all of it.

[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:59.760]
I'm just going to get real adventurous and buy the pink one.

[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.400]
I could find my image, but who cares?

[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.140]
Especially here.

[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:07.160]
Well, the beast says you should use warm vanilla sugar from Bath & Body Works.

[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.940]
Yeah, you know, a, uh, a little fat rotund diabetic like him really needs something with sugar.

[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.000]
And that's probably why he uses it.

[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.360]
He's probably got real sugar in it.

[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.400]
Probably gets the sugar rush right there in the shower.

[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.280]
A little bit from the body and a little bit from the mouth.

[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.920]
He's probably drinking it.

[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.440]
He probably puts a straw in it.

[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.220]
God, what a cow.

[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.680]
This is his picture on our website.

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.640]
I hope I think it's in there.

[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:29.820]
Oh, man.

[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.160]
But I hope it's like not just the head all of that.

[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.620]
Oh, I guess in the dining, mommy beach police department right now.

[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.320]
Give me 40 guesses.

[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:37.700]
Yeah, this is a good guess.

[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.480]
Yeah, that's all that.

[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.180]
Yeah, and he said we don't want it to go to his head.

[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.040]
And the best part of it is he's doing it for $1.

[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.160]
Oh, man, what a, what a guy, huh?

[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.720]
He's doing it for no pay $1.

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.220]
Because he wants to, and last guy like that was Elvis.

[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.380]
Remember Elvis wanted to be in the FBI and Nixon, uh, kind of human in there for one.

[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.000]
Actually gave him like the, the, uh, Batman badge and the whole day like that.

[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:58.660]
Uh, no.

[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.140]
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of crazy people out there.

[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:01.820]
I think they're Batman.

[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.420]
Researchers are working a highway, uh, high tech way to trick people into desiring less fat with out dangerous side effects.

[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.300]
In an effort to curb obesity, they would inject the body with manufactured non particles designed to fool the brain.

[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.160]
You could call it an invisible diet said biologist Tim Gilbert's interview to us at university.

[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.020]
It's really simple.

[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.400]
This technology will help people to feel satisfied with the small serving of food instead of a large helping.

[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.960]
Are we going to play that Elvis clause?

[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:30.220]
Yes, you do.

[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.420]
Gilbert's since team is engineering molecule size nano particles made of the same fat molecules that occur naturally in your body.

[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.660]
The nano particles would be geared, oh, maybe that guy will come and go nano nano, like that.

[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.000]
Manor, manor, maybe you want to say peanut butter and anter sandwich.

[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:49.900]
The nano particles and the geared to fool specific cells inside you that communicate with the brain about fat intake.

[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.680]
We're trying to trick receptors into thinking they have fat when it's actually not there.

[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:03.380]
He's explained it researches in its early stages, but Gilbert's and said that he was a Gilbert or a Gilbert's and he's encouraged by Hitler by preliminary tests.

[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:09.200]
And he points out that nano particle treatments are already used to battle cancer and cardiovascular disease.

[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:18.820]
Our bodies are taste buds are training help us get to nutrients we need Gilbert's and said for instance our ability to taste sweet things like I shouldn't tell you what I had yesterday.

[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.940]
Because I admit that I actually have a developed a taste for it. That's bad.

[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.860]
See when you start liking things that you didn't like before that were bad for you?

[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:27.740]
Yeah, that's bad.

[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.500]
Hagen does. Now they didn't have my little market. They didn't have any banana nut.

[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.660]
But they had bouchi de laixi, laixi.

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:40.460]
Oh, that stuff actually is good. You owe that flavor to apology.

[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.520]
Yeah, I want to apologize, man.

[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.560]
But when I had this a little watery, but not too bad. That's the Hagen does thing.

[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.680]
And the flavor is fine. So Hagen does makes all the rest of the little watery.

[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.440]
Just like that chili, it's skyline chili.

[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:53.560]
Well, maybe they're just trying to save you time for the microwave. Is that it?

[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.580]
No, it's still the same 99 seconds.

[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.940]
But that's not bad stuff, man. Do see the what is it? Do she the LHA?

[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.120]
Anyway, he says for instance our ability to taste sweet things helps us identify foods with carbohydrates.

[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:13.060]
Our salty taste helps us find minerals. And our general aversion to bitter foods helps us avoid ingesting poisonous substances.

[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.180]
Oh, it's bitter.

[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:19.300]
There's been little research on whether we taste fat. However, gibberkins research says we do,

[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.700]
but the ability is not confined to specific taste buds as it is with sweets and salt.

[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:29.660]
Oh, you know something? How about if a new which taste buds identify with sweets, they could just scrape them off.

[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.800]
Would that be good? Like fingerprints. All right?

[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.080]
Now a good idea? That is a good idea.

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.680]
Scrape off my sweet taste buds. I mean that ice cream and candy and all that stuff.

[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.800]
You can get that electric needle like what they do with electrolysis.

[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.920]
Right. And zap your buds.

[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:46.120]
Just, yeah. Zap your bud.

[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.040]
We've probably been 90% of taste buds can detect fat, but instead having a specific taste,

[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.040]
we believe it's main role is enhancing the existing flavors of gibberkins. Like an ice cream, for example.

[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.500]
Like in Ben and Jerry's, it's a very heavy, high fat content.

[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.380]
Fat-maste sweet foods taste more sweet and salty food, more salty.

[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.680]
Importantly, these fat receptors aren't just on the tongue, but exist throughout the body, including in the small intestine.

[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.520]
Oh my God, they're right there in your kishkis.

[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:10.800]
Wow.

[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.860]
When you eat fat, these receptors and signals to the brain.

[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.880]
In some people gibberkins found the fat receptors are not as sensitive, so they eat more fatty foods than other people.

[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:24.440]
The research now is focusing on developing fat substitutes that trick specific sites without harming the rest of the body.

[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:30.220]
Nanoparticles, which are small enough to slip through to some membranes, could deliver drugs that would cause certain cells to release and say,

[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.200]
more, I've got my filafad hormones to the brain.

[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:34.800]
A person would then presumably seek lower fat foods.

[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.000]
Oh, see, this is why they wish by tempering it.

[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.740]
This is the myth of the fatty foods causing you to be fat. That's cock-on, man.

[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.440]
Oh, gee, probably he's getting funding from general mills or something like that.

[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.940]
Because if you've got a lot of Cheerios, you know, make your cholesterol go down.

[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:51.680]
How can they put that on the ear?

[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.220]
They just lie and they lie.

[01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.040]
Huh? It's all part of the plot. Cheerios cause your cholesterol to go down.

[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.800]
Me and Mama, you're crazy people.

[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.360]
So I'm going to get some cheerio flavored body wash this weekend.

[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.140]
Just smear yourself with it.

[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.980]
And you get clean while your cholesterol goes down to end of taste grade.

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.420]
I kind of believe you like cheerio. Did you?

[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.520]
You know, it depends on what you put on it.

[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.920]
We never did that poll. Did we your favorite breakfast cereal?

[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.540]
No, let's do that tomorrow.

[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.420]
Why? That's like paper or plastic.

[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.480]
Captain Crunch.

[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.480]
Frosted flakes.

[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:29.860]
Oh, man.

[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:30.840]
What about John?

[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.420]
I like Cheerios. I do.

[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:33.840]
You do like Cheerios.

[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.820]
You got to put a lot of sugar on those though.

[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:38.500]
No, I don't know. I like them the way they are honestly.

[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.280]
It's weird.

[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.720]
In other words, I have a little box.

[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.800]
No, like, throw them into milk.

[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.000]
Well, who the hell wants that?

[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.700]
Frosted flakes. You don't need no milk.

[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:48.400]
How's milk is poisoned, man?

[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.140]
I like that. For you.

[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.140]
I also like golden grains.

[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.720]
Oh, yeah. Just give yourself one of those big industrial sized boxes

[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.260]
like alcohol.

[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.820]
It's the news to get a frosted place.

[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.360]
And just much more out of the box.

[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.960]
No milk. No bowl.

[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:00.600]
Oh, for me.

[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.100]
I ain't got it.

[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:04.860]
Oh, brother.

[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.840]
He is a real piece of work.

[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.060]
You don't have the real piece anymore though.

[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:10.440]
Anymo.

[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:14.000]
I ask quite a accomplishment that two people Steve Ziggler and Mo

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.920]
that I embarrassed them to toss their pieces.

[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.240]
That was good. Good work.

[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.300]
Nothing worse than some clown walking around the silly trail.

[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.240]
How many people are doing that?

[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:21.780]
Huh?

[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:22.960]
Like Johnny Apple seed.

[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.580]
You could be Johnny Anti-Weve.

[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.080]
Yeah. Anti-Weve.

[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.880]
It's been an antineal.

[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:34.040]
11.56 of QA and Pompadopark racing and poker's got the gambling action you want.

[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.140]
We're sorry, Dick, that you think it was you guys wanted.

[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.860]
We really feel bad about that and also bad actions and everybody else.

[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.780]
But you're in Florida.

[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.720]
What can I tell you, man?

[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:43.400]
Look around and sniff the daffodils.

[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:43.960]
You're in Florida.

[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.920]
That means you're going to get the hose.

[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.220]
Anyway, Pompadopark features live harness racing in the great poker card room every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:54.780]
Like today.

[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.820]
In fact, the poker room opens in three minutes.

[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.380]
And best of all, I've mentioned in parking always free at Pompadopark.

[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.240]
Cameroon, homeowner from the rail, we're in Joy Poker in the smoke-free card room with tournaments every day.

[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.260]
They say, hey, Wally, how's it going, A?

[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.460]
Also, you'll find harness, thermobrit, highlight, islamacasting action every day,

[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:15.060]
seven days a week from tracks all across the nation, all across North America like woodbind, baby.

[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.600]
Post time is 7.25, like I said tonight.

[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.300]
And the card room opens at noon in just two and a half minutes.

[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.820]
And also, come enjoy fine dining on the six floor top of the park restaurant every Wednesday is Dalvin night at Pompadopark.

[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:28.620]
With draft beer hot dogs, sodas and lots more, only a bucket piece.

[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.580]
Pompadopark, a blocked south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:38.120]
For more information called 9549722000, or you can take a peek at their website, Pompadopark.com.

[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.740]
Card room was open like momentarily, any second now, go in and punch your guts out,

[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.740]
and racing tonight and tomorrow at 7.25pm, live racing at Pompadopark.

[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:52.420]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.69pm.

[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:02.020]
Where are it beaded 12 to 1 hour on WQA?

[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.000]
All right.

[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:10.200]
All new daddy's, everybody looking new daddy's,

[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.800]
Lord and all new looking new daddy's, down in the waiting room.

[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.000]
He's a racing wind, wakes around in the car that is,

[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.860]
the race driver that never wins, down in the waiting room.

[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:29.280]
Now she here on your hits, they call this Mr. Reef.

[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:33.320]
Oh, one thing she will not win on Reef, is not rocket, ad.

[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:38.200]
Oh, well, hey baby, you should have found it in.

[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.380]
Oh, oh, Mr. Reef, you win the race.

[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.560]
Oh, well, I came in and pulled a bit, please.

[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.920]
Well, you heard yourself the rhythm of the race.

[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.980]
Well, get that on it and how about a date?

[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:51.300]
Aint gonna date that chance, that you keep calling it last.

[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.500]
That's why you don't go out with me.

[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.820]
You ain't get snow, you can't go out with me.

[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.160]
Well, I may be slow on the street, but I shall be fast on my feet.

[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.980]
You fall of a land with a snack in your pocket.

[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:12.580]
Oh, you ain't get snow, you can't go out with me.

[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:20.680]
Oh, well, hey baby, you can't go out with me.

[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.820]
You ain't get it snows!

[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.280]
They call him Mr. Green.

[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:32.480]
Oh!

[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:33.960]
Turbo to a QAM.

[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.940]
We got the Mole Master at 2, Mad Dog at Hooters to Round 4.

[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.480]
The big ol' like Barakuda.

[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.300]
Maybe I just need to go over there and get drunk before we go to his own vacation for a week.

[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.240]
Seven o'clock, right?

[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:44.980]
80k at 10.

[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.460]
We got 1,000 and 42 votes on a pool.

[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.100]
Our rating's only just barely afternoon.

[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:53.440]
The big hand is just the little one is just sitting there.

[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.440]
Name something or someone strictly for pseudo-intellectuals, Kabbalah,

[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.600]
another bogus religion, like all of the rest of them, 153.

[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.020]
And you also have to know what it is.

[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.660]
I've done those articles on Madonna this and this one.

[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:07.960]
I know that.

[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.720]
You don't want to hear it because it's a Jew thing.

[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.460]
What do you think about it?

[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.640]
I think it's a croc.

[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.160]
It's a croc, a croc?

[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.220]
How about Ray Croc?

[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.440]
He may start at McDonald's.

[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.900]
Ray Croc, boy, he's for a lift to her a lot of money.

[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.240]
And then I think she died too.

[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.980]
Dennis Miller, 151, classical music 88.

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.780]
Poetry, 87.

[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:31.420]
How about a nice poem to put you in a good weekend mood?

[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:32.760]
Nice poem, man.

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:33.540]
Let's talk it.

[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:42.580]
Polo 85, jazz 74, chest 52, Suchi 49, Greg 49, say Suchi's for Sudes.

[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:48.080]
Jeopardy 40, Paris 39, Bacarot 34.

[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.420]
What is Bacarot?

[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.040]
Is that a card game?

[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.440]
I know it's a gambling thing in the year, Casinos, but is it a...

[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:53.760]
What is it?

[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.400]
I don't know.

[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.480]
Well, maybe somebody called an Asplansis if I were taking a game which I would call...

[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.980]
I would call it Bacarot.

[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:00.500]
What is it?

[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.800]
In fact, if you take Kabbalah and Bacarot and you mix them together, then you got Halibah.

[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:07.980]
That truck with Halibah.

[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.920]
Especially the sugar-free, that makes you run to the room.

[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.180]
Dave Matthews, band 34.

[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:14.800]
That's right under Bacarot.

[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.080]
Line 18, four in film 17, bridge 17.

[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.500]
Where you met Buckley 13, the ultimate Sude, Mensa 12.

[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:27.400]
Boy, talk about people with a swell head.

[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.940]
Mensa, I wouldn't be surprised if...

[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.380]
A rat!

[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:32.500]
Not him, him.

[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.060]
It's a member of Mensa.

[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:42.420]
12, fiction 12, NPR 11, the New Yorker magazine 9, 2001, a Space Odyssey 8, Blair Witch Project 8, opera 7.

[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.120]
Let's go to the opera.

[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.780]
Let's see what's the name of an opera?

[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:46.840]
Fan of the opera?

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.080]
No, is that an opera?

[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:49.740]
Yeah, sure.

[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.180]
It's a movie.

[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.620]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.240]
Madam Butterfly.

[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:55.960]
There you go, very good.

[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.200]
Kirby Enthusiasm 6, Pink Floyd 5.

[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.620]
What was the opera at the Godfather at Anthony was a singer-in-en?

[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:03.060]
What was that?

[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.340]
It was a Ruggiero or something.

[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:09.000]
Over there.

[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.240]
Yeah, that's all I know.

[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.240]
Kirby Enthusiasm 6, Pink Floyd 5, Stevie Dan 5.

[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:21.300]
Inside the actor studio with James Lipton 4, Art Show is 4, Volvos 2, and a nun for PBS or the Shining.

[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.960]
Well, I would be surprised if PBS airs the Shining this weekend and honor that.

[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.820]
That's out of 1047 and they like the Shining a lot.

[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Palm 5, 60, and the Verizon Singular Wireless Lines.

[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:35.480]
WDQYM, hello?

[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.060]
Yeah, it's a canoe?

[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:37.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.960]
Okay, I got one for your fall.

[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:41.580]
How far is the sand?

[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.340]
What is it?

[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:44.900]
The sand.

[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:46.560]
The Zen Buddhism.

[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.120]
The Zen something.

[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.080]
Yeah, okay.

[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.300]
I mean, you could take most religions, you know, I was in the traditional mainline ones, right?

[01:39:59.440 --> 01:39:59.860]
We could.

[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.560]
Like Scientologists, but that's not the question.

[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.760]
It's not an answer thing, you know.

[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.460]
That's a big, big thing.

[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:06.160]
Right.

[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:07.100]
I Scientology.

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.500]
That's for Fag.

[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.500]
I'm for a gay, right?

[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:12.640]
Somebody QYM, hello?

[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:15.840]
QYM, hello?

[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.100]
Yeah, the number one choice is yoga.

[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:27.040]
Those people that got all this collected craft in their apartment, you think they've got a higher level of thinking and all that.

[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:28.840]
Yeah, they're on a higher plane.

[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.420]
I sure wasn't the one in midway.

[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.260]
Okay, and I like that.

[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:32.560]
Yoga.

[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.080]
All right.

[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.060]
I'll put yogurt on there.

[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.220]
Yoga, Vera.

[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:40.800]
By the way, Yogi will not do any more spots with the Aflite Drugs if he's going to catch them.

[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.540]
By the way, background looks really weird.

[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.400]
I just read.

[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.420]
You Google it?

[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.660]
Yeah, I mean, I don't really get it.

[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.480]
Well, I'm sure somebody will explain it to us.

[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:50.880]
Is it cards?

[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:51.920]
Yeah, it's cards.

[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.220]
It's just a little...

[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:54.740]
I mean, I'll tell you what it says.

[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:59.560]
The objective of background is to draw a two or three card hand that totals closer to nine than the banker.

[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.940]
A 10 Jack King Queen count as a hero.

[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:06.260]
Ace is one and all other cards are face value.

[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.020]
If your total is more than 10, you drop the 10, blah, blah, blah.

[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:10.720]
So I don't know.

[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.680]
Ooh, it's very strange.

[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.860]
I've got a headache thinking about that.

[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:13.080]

[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:14.860]
So say something about it.

[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.580]
If you wind up with more than 11, you wind up doing a doose.

[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.100]
Or is it an ace?

[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.080]
I don't know what it is.

[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.540]
I'm at card games to me or boring.

[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.660]
That's why when people denigrate slot players, I say, well, maybe you like sitting there with your cards

[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.980]
and you know, a scratch in the table.

[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:33.660]
I'll crack this.

[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.880]
I like hitting that button, man.

[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:38.220]
I watch them, weedle spin around.

[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.080]
Oh, I speak of that.

[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:39.760]
Wait till you hear this.

[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.540]
Wait till you hear this.

[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:42.480]
Austin, Texas.

[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:48.480]
A $25,000 lottery ticket was easy money for Mike Sargent until he lost it.

[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:56.060]
Then it meant days of searching fields and ditches even sitting through a trash bin before help arrive from an unexpected source.

[01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:01.680]
Sargent scratched off the winning wheel of fortune ticket of November 15th and a convenience store counter.

[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:04.540]
I don't even know they had a, I guess that's maybe a Texas thing.

[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.980]
It is hometown of Alvarado about 25 miles south of Fort Worth.

[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.480]
He signed the ticket and filled in his name and address as he called his wife and said he was bringing her the best Christmas gift ever.

[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.580]
By the time he got home, however, the ticket was gone.

[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.660]
I was thinking that God just took it out of my hand, Sargent said.

[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:26.660]
He and a friend from church spent the rest of the night searching the fields along US Highway 67.

[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:30.360]
He even called 911 asked firefighters to shine lights on the search area.

[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:30.960]
They declined.

[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.040]
They said they had bigger fish to fry.

[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:33.400]
I'm sure.

[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.460]
Later, friends combed the fields and roadside ditches while Sargent and his neighbor sifted through all the garbage in the convenience store as trash bin.

[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.680]
Sargent's posted a, he posted signs all over town, even called a radio station offering a $2,000 reward.

[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.640]
Finally, five days after he lost it to get, Sargent got a call from Jeff.

[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:57.420]
Gerardo Oruís, a water meter reader from a Midlothian who found out while working five houses down from the store, a water meter reader.

[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:02.700]
Ruiz hadn't seen the signs of her Sargent on the radio and at first I wasn't going to give the ticket back.

[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.300]
I went home and showed my wife and I said, look Jesus just gave us a $25,000 ticket Ruiz, we call it.

[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.380]
Well, I tell you God and Jesus are sure mixed up in that gambling big time.

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.440]
How can your fat ass go to be against it when the Lord and Jesus are all into it?

[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:16.820]
Right?

[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:21.620]
He said, when you better call that guy, maybe you can get a reward because God is going to punish you if you don't return it.

[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.040]
This is all the Godís stuff.

[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:30.940]
Sargent gave Ruiz $2,500, immediately wrote a $17,50 check to his own church but had to wait a little longer for his payoff.

[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:35.980]
His signature had been partially scratched off the ticket, Ruiz speculates it happened when he stepped on it.

[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.720]
So a lot of it, he attacks his officials and conducting forensic tests to ensure Sargentís win is legit.

[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:46.140]
Sargent is hoping it gets the money in time for Christmas but he is his wife who founded a prison ministry.

[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.260]
I could have bought each other extravagant gifts instead.

[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.900]
Theyíll plan to help a prisoner to get a paralegal certificate and use the rest to pay off their credit card debt.

[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.620]
And Sargent is taking his lost and found Sargent and signed a stop to stop just and a lot of God.

[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.440]
Heís taking his lost and found Sargent and assigned to stop playing the lottery.

[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:07.900]
I think God was telling me that I need to be dependent on him and not on a lot of reasons and jobs and anything else he said.

[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:11.980]
Oh, God.

[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.340]
Everything is with God. Everything is with Jesus and as an American man you can have it.

[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.440]
You can have it. I donít want it. Itís too far-bisoned for me.

[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.320]
Remember that song? Sure. I might have it here somewhere.

[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.360]
Somebody QAAM Hello? Yes, Neil. Yes sir. Whatís up?

[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:37.300]
What are you got? I want to know if thereís still one in a Spanish language commercial on...

[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:43.360]
Okay, great. Because I had boy-totted manages shows for that. I couldnít believe it.

[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:48.360]
Yeah. Whatís he got to do with it? Why would you blame him? Well, I donít know.

[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:53.360]
It was only since we wanted during his show. No, we handed it on the show.

[01:44:53.960 --> 01:45:01.340]
It wasnít really. No more. No more. No more. No more. Donít be picking on that dog. Heís helping. Heís done against that labaster, man.

[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.620]
Heís done against that real stiff competition. It will be on the stiff part.

[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:11.040]
Stubots and labastered. Wow. Are they broadcasted or what?

[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.420]
Somebody QAAM Hello? I'm bipolar.

[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:18.460]
Somebody QAAM Hello? Oh, heís bipolar, yeah.

[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:23.920]
Oh, I see. And heís also bare. Heís bipolar bare.

[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.660]
Yeah, Ron, man, oh man. We got some plans for you. Youíre on for the new year. You just wait.

[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.800]
Letís turn them on a flight to where was that guy coming from? Caracas. Caracas, yeah.

[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:40.600]
Yeah, letís alert the authorities at the time that thereís a lunatic going to be on as a plane.

[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:45.680]
Yeah, and now we got the witnesses saying that he never said I have a bomb and this one says this.

[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:53.100]
Like we said the other day, we donít want to sound insensitive or crap like that, but people who have mental problems

[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:58.360]
and arenít taking their medication shouldnít be on planes. Theyíre flying like 37,000 feet in the sky

[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.940]
and would like in danger of the peopleís life. They shouldnít be out of the house.

[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:09.460]
They shouldnít be out of the institution. Okay. I'm telling you right now, it should be an institution.

[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.280]
Behind a tall wall. In fact, we got people right there in that building who ought to be institutionalized.

[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:17.440]
Make no mistake about that. I donít want to mention no names.

[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8. We want some backer route. Weíre here on the Stale Roger show.

[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.480]
We got these scintillating momas through it too. I wonder why he was supposed to be off today.

[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.660]
All these people are allÖ I donít get a typo.

[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.760]
Is this a typo? Yes.

[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.600]
Thatís the clearance man. He canít even make out a sketch of what I get like all bowled around.

[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.180]
Okay. Quit wasting your time calling me and bugging me with nonsense clearance.

[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:46.200]
And of course you know he didnít do it on his own and Greg is like, ìOh, call up Neor. Call up Roger.

[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:52.000]
Make sure he doesnít screw this up for us this year. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever you say Greg, everything is always everybody elseís fault.

[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.840]
Heís like the George Busher radio, you know? The buck stops someplace else.

[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.860]
Iíll make that hard for real. Iíll make that hard for me.

[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.640]
Letís put Stern on here and see how many fines we can get from the FCC.

[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.540]
And Iíll look at a next weekís schedule. Iím going over with a fine tooth comb baby.

[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.500]
And I donít seeÖ it looks like itís not too bad.

[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.080]
We got mad dog on it all next week. Curtis and Troy at Hooters on Friday next week.

[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:21.480]
Mark these down. Joe. Who the hell is Joe? At Smokey Boy and Joe Rose coming back?

[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.000]
Who is Joe? Joe Z. I would haveÖ

[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.420]
Oh no! On the Jim Mandage show. Joe Zagaki is going to be on while people are awake.

[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:33.860]
Teresa Gagaki struck the plane.

[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:38.300]
Oh, come man. If we didnít lose our license for the other crab, I think that will put us under the bottom.

[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.440]
Pro 13 at QAM. Boy, itís just Joe Zagaki on a Hurricanes and Jimmy Stiflus on the dolphins

[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:51.320]
and Gullyís weekendís way to success with those Panthers. Man! Whatís happening to the market?

[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:56.720]
You know, an insunny in the market? Right, it looks like that place has had it.

[01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:59.680]
I donít want to say I got out just in time. I just donít want to have a way of doing that.

[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.000]
Just like if W. Stoos had got out of there just in time too.

[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.460]
Always seem to have one step ahead.

[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:09.900]
Hey, itís that most wonderful time of the year unless, of course, you are doing the wrong spot.

[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.380]
When they beat Bandit, are we doing the wrong spot?

[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.340]
Yeah, that would be wrong somehow.

[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.920]
Well, I better get the right copy out because this is notÖ

[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.760]
Well, weíll begin with that one eventually for Dalai Mahatras, our good friends over there.

[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:22.380]
But itís not on right now.

[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:26.860]
Is today actually Friday? Thank God.

[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.560]
No, no, seriously. They does not feel like Friday. Thatís fan.

[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:35.440]
I donít think I got that piece of copy. I think maybe I lost it.

[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.640]
I ate it. Maybe I ate it.

[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:39.580]
Oh, there it is right there. Let me tell you what I just did.

[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.640]
This goes to show you how efficient I am.

[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.820]
Such a thing is being too efficient. Right?

[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:49.260]
I had the copy in front of me and then I reached over and I took the next one and put it on top of it.

[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.600]
Hey, if you do that three more times, weíll be out of here.

[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:40.740]

You were scared.

[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:44.380]
You were scared.

[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:44.380]

[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.840]

You were scared.

[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:52.940]

[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:52.940]

[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:52.940]

[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:52.960]

[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:52.960]

[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:52.960]

[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:52.960]

[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:14.240]

[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:14.920]

[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:15.660]

[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:17.600]

[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:17.600]

[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:17.840]
You were scared.

[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:17.840]

[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:17.900]
You were scared.

[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:17.900]

[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:17.900]

[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:18.280]
You were scared.

[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:18.440]
You were scared.

[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:18.460]
You were scared.

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.120]

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.120]

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.120]

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.240]
You were scared.

[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:21.900]
You were scared.

[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:21.900]

[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:22.800]

[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:22.920]
You were scared.

[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.800]
You were scared.

[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.000]
You were scared.

[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.500]
Your shoes are fallen.

[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.680]
Your shoes were fallen.

[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:55.820]
But you couldn't care less.

[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:03.960]
When you're with nobody, you've been everything for free.

[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:05.860]
Himalayan.

[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:11.540]
Rob 21, do we find out who's got those Rolex watches yet, by the way?

[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.640]
No, you know, I've been looking around, but I don't really know what one looks like.

[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.720]
Yeah, look up a picture, you know.

[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.900]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, we want to take a take a look on the internet.

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.340]
How come I can no cause about Baccarom, man?

[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:26.640]
You think that with the DeGeneric Ambers we got on this crowd,

[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:29.520]
we can like, the phones will be ringing off, they'll be jumping around.

[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.120]
Maybe it's so erudite.

[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:33.600]
Does that nobody knows anything about it?

[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.800]
Certainly not, and a little bit too suedy for our crowd.

[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:42.320]
56070560, Tom 560 and we've arrived in Singularonus lines.

[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:43.700]
WQIM, hello.

[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:45.260]
How you doing?

[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:45.880]
Okay.

[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.640]
Good, can I talk to Neil?

[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.300]
Speaking.

[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:51.780]
Oh, I'm on the air.

[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:55.020]
Sounds exactly like you or your identical twin.

[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:56.760]
What's that?

[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.940]
I said it's you, yes, it's you, what do you got?

[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:03.640]
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that I think that you're a real breath of fish here.

[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.660]
I've been stuck here from California since last January,

[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:11.860]
and it's listening to all this bush-loving, god-loving dumbass this year.

[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:12.480]
Yeah.

[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.480]
It's really nice to hear somebody who has a different point of view.

[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.440]
So, someone who requests my point of view as well.

[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:19.900]
Thank you.

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:20.740]
And I have a request, man.

[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:21.740]
Thank god for us.

[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.240]
Absolutely, and I have a quick explanation of that.

[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:24.480]
Absolutely.

[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:29.420]
If you want to know it, basically you either bet against the house or the dealer,

[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:34.620]
and they have to try to get nine, and if you can bet either that you get nine or...

[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:34.820]
Nine.

[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.060]
Nine are closest to nine.

[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:38.800]
Probably good.

[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:43.420]
And the ace's count is like, if you have an ace in the sixth, then you have seven.

[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:48.280]
If you get a face card, then you still have seven, because a face card counts as zero.

[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:49.180]
Oh, man.

[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.180]
Too complicated for me.

[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.300]
I'll stick for my slot machines.

[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.160]
Thanks a lot, Kelly.

[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:52.980]
Good luck, keep going.

[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:53.300]
See you.

[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.020]
Hope you get out.

[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:56.880]
Hope you get out and get back to California or somewhere like civilization.

[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.020]
We did not Florida.

[01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:58.420]
What's that?

[01:53:58.460 --> 01:53:58.840]
What was that?

[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:02.960]
Oh, that's the irreversible spinning around music, because that's what my head's doing during the...

[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.940]
Oh, you mean from the explainer's point of view?

[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:04.720]
Yeah, rocker-rock?

[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:05.860]
Well, it's a stewed game.

[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.600]
That's why it's not our pool and doing very well by the way.

[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:08.160]
I'll pass though.

[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:09.680]
I'll stick with jacks.

[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:10.820]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:12.060]
I stick with old maid, you know?

[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.160]
How many QAM, hello?

[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.000]
Two.

[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:16.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:19.440]
Oh, for your phone today.

[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:20.640]
For the first three of your phone.

[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.000]
A phone shway.

[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.360]
Phone shway.

[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.100]
Okay, you know how to spell it?

[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.580]
Check with your voice if you can see what you can say that, okay?

[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.980]
Okay, and seconded Josh, cast it, check it.

[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.080]
Believe me, he casted.

[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:37.580]
He would never have come in at 11.15 this morning if he wouldn't have come.

[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.120]
He was probably at the bank this morning.

[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.520]
At McAfield's rich.

[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.180]
Maybe if he'll rich now?

[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:45.760]
Yeah, like Mrs. Katzenthal said to me many moons ago.

[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.420]
Oh, Neon, you feel rich now at 225 bucks a week.

[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:53.060]
Boy, oh boy, she's pushing up these, you cola.

[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.080]
You heard the uncolour, she was the you cola.

[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:59.780]
What is that thing, the new, what is that new deal now?

[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:00.280]
Is it Coke?

[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.700]
The Coke nothing.

[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:03.860]
What is it called?

[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:04.900]
Zero, I think.

[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:05.520]
Yeah.

[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:06.920]
What is that?

[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.340]
I don't know.

[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.360]
Coke zero.

[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:11.840]
What?

[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.140]
See, that's what I keep.

[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:13.420]
No comment.

[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.980]
It's like the Chef Boyard E thing and the same with Gillette.

[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:22.900]
If you take the same product and you put it in like different shapes and sizes and colors

[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:26.800]
and whatever, and instead I have a one product here like 50 products on the shelf, then you're

[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.380]
going to sell 50 times as much of it.

[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:35.740]
And it's the same thing when I was like you're lime Pepsi or they took the lime and lemon

[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:36.020]
out.

[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.440]
Right, what I heard.

[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.440]
Then you hear that from Bokobryon, yeah?

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.380]
But you got your caffeine free and your wood caffeine with extra caffeine like Jolte

[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:47.600]
Cola, you got your all his crap, all of these.

[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.700]
Oh, look at that snow in New England, man.

[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:51.300]
Pretty potent storm system.

[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.220]
Right now, a lot of Boston corridor.

[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:54.680]
Look at that.

[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.720]
What I tell you about Boston, man, God has really tipped off it.

[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:58.520]
There's Kennedys.

[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.640]
He's still pissed off about Mary Jo Kepekney, man.

[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.480]
That chap aquatic.

[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:08.000]
And that's why he's like heaving it on Providence in Boston and all over New England, man.

[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.360]
It is just covered with, are you looking at that now?

[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:11.240]
No.

[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:14.160]
Chad Sky Miles, I will never see me.

[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:18.160]
Germany backs bigger brothels to fight World Cup sex explosion.

[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:23.680]
It's only a shirt bus ride from Germany's main World Cup stadium in a post-day Turkish

[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.900]
bath, two sounders, two cinemas, and up to 100 prostitutes offering round the clock

[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:28.260]
sex.

[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:33.660]
Europe's biggest brothel, which opened in Berlin only two months ago, is Germany's latest

[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:36.880]
answer to the invasion of sex workers who are expected to flood the country next year

[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:39.000]
to cater to the male soccer fans.

[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:41.840]
If you like her, soccer.

[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:46.980]
Tradition suggests that up to three million fans will visit a prostitute at least once

[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:47.740]
during the World Cup.

[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:49.440]
Oh my God, we might have an earthquake.

[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.260]
The events organizers are expecting at least 40,000 prostitutes to descend on Germany from

[01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.380]
throughout Europe to meet the demand.

[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:02.460]
Up to three million fans will visit a prostitute at least once during the World Cup.

[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:09.080]
Our team is the four-story brothel located in Milan and half of Berlin's Olympic stadium

[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.180]
is an attempt to bring the sex trade explosion under control in a country where prostitution

[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:14.580]
is both legal and widespread.

[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:16.360]
Do you think their last thing is a little plan?

[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:17.480]
Where's their cute widespread?

[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:18.440]
They'll cure it.

[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:27.560]
From the outside, a five million euro establishment resembles a luxury hotel tucked away

[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:28.420]
on an industrial estate.

[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.580]
They have close up the decorative balloon flank from the roof turns out to be a giant

[01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:32.140]
phallus.

[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:37.140]
Inside, a handful of middle aged punters were last week paying 40 euros each for a locker,

[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:42.080]
a bathrobe, and access to the brothels, bars, world pools, massage parlors.

[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:46.680]
Cinemas and 46-suite stick that with mox zebra skinbed covers, mirrors, and back and

[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.340]
alien pictures.

[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.220]
Yet the sex itself crossed extra.

[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:53.620]
You pay the 40-year-olds for all of these things.

[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.480]
And the sex is more.

[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.080]
Norman Jacob.

[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.640]
Remember I was asking the other day how Jacob is doing?

[01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.320]
Yes, you did.

[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:00.580]
Here's the answer.

[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:04.780]
Norman Jacob, a lawyer in Scotland for our MSS, the brothel cuts the out prostitute's

[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:08.500]
traditional reliance on pimps and virtually eliminates the chances of illegal Eastern European

[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.160]
sex slaves being employed on the premises.

[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:14.560]
All of the girls here have to provide a tax number and a permit of permission to work

[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:14.980]
in the EU.

[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:19.020]
He said, proof, they pay a 70-year-old entrance fee, but they're free to negotiate the cost

[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:22.020]
of their services with each client, which allows them to keep all the profits.

[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.180]
Zenia, one of the prostitutes, said the system worked in her favor.

[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:28.440]
I used to pay between 20 and 50 percent of my taken to my organizer.

[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:29.620]
Here I can keep the lot.

[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.600]
So once we get, you know, we start with a slot machines man with a different kind of slot.

[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:38.580]
Once we get legalized prostitution in Florida, then there'll be taxing like 110 percent.

[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:42.620]
Because it's only the Fedass governor's family that can be able to have all kinds of illicit

[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:46.240]
and grow test-gained crawling around and bumping and stuff like that.

[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:52.320]
Thank God we got a bunch of good Christians in the White House and in the State House.

[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.820]
This is Neil Roger.

[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.080]

[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:47.280]

[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:50.200]
5.670560, that's what Greg always says,

[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:55.420]
0560 in the Verizon singular wireless line, and by the way George, whatever you do, don't talk about a f***ing

[02:00:55.420 --> 02:01:02.200]
not a call on the board, I can't put it, what's going on here all of a sudden, like we fell off the face of the earth since like all the rest of the U.S.

[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:08.640]
since the Bushmeister and his Nazi regime came in, the whole American thing is like falling off the globe

[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.640]
and I think that's what's happening to us too, I think it was because Josh didn't come in on time this morning, the audience is out of sorts

[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:20.860]
I don't blame me, it's your fault, and I bet you did cast that tattoo didn't you?

[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.500]
No, but I'll be cashing immediately after the show, oh wait, I gotta go make a call

[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:33.760]
I'll don't do that, yeah I already touched it, just to be on the safe side, I better go make a call

[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.060]
WKYM, hello, good afternoon Neil, good afternoon sir

[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:47.920]
I wanted to ask you today in Miami Beach there's actually a thing called the New Pearl Harbor 911 Truth Tour and it's actually in Miami Beach this evening

[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:54.760]
and for the four people in your audience who probably care to find out a little more information about what happened on 9-11

[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:58.260]
I just wanted to say it's at the Lincoln Theater tonight in Miami Beach

[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:08.620]
okay and could I give the box office number? Absolutely, it's 305, 673, 3330

[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.480]
and excellent theater only three road to Miami Beach, okay

[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:20.680]
and they're gonna have it's all investigators and researchers just that have been looking closer into the 9-11 phenomenon

[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:27.680]
they actually were out in Tampa on they were in Tampa the last three days and they're actually coming over to Miami

[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:35.920]
just for one night tonight so it's a three to four hour event and it should be pretty interesting for anybody who's interested in finding out some more

[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:42.480]
okay, thank you, thank you, there you go for people who really inquiry minds of one or all of course people probably got like my zone

[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:45.500]
tournaments maybe we want to go and play a little biker ride over the Indians or whatever

[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:51.240]
they probably don't have time to be learning about stuff like that WKYM, hello

[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.880]
yes sir? K-O? Yeah? Hey, I, let me ask you a question

[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.320]
do you think that yes there'll be a woman president before a black president?

[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:07.480]
How about a black president, a black woman, a black woman, a kind of a loser?

[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:14.860]
Stop and think about that huh? No thank you. I'm making a point? Yes

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.260]
when I'll let me ask you this what black under the encounter, Lisa, he's all over the place

[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:27.200]
other than Conner, Lisa, who's certainly got no chance but what other black politicians and Barack

[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.140]
Obama now we're talking although what did he piss us off about? Oh yeah he was like

[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:36.960]
realizing about the authority words and moving up you know all these politicians is all the same

[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.580]
they got all their handlers and their advisors and their focus, focus, focus groups and all

[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:46.440]
other crap, I'm tired of them you know what just live your life and enjoy the best you can

[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:53.020]
and that's my philosophy in life, yeah I do the best I can that's it and it's supposed to like

[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:57.280]
banging your head up against the wall like I did for all of those years, tub being a babysitter to

[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:03.720]
everybody everybody over the age of a hundred hello Neil hello Dr. yeah that's crap I want to

[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:10.280]
apologize again for the swell those garbage shows that I did over and over again talk about

[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:18.380]
stale that was stale or at last year's Mata good god hello Dr. I got blue lips stocked done what should

[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:23.120]
be done Dr. done you're done honey you're only good thing about all those scholars they're all

[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:30.600]
pushing up daisies now they're all pushing up daffy deals speaking of daffy McCallum just did do

[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:34.320]
the best you can you're not gonna change the world as a business that's why that movie was so good

[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.660]
that scene alone is worth the price of the emission, Sasha's probably asleep already by the time

[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:47.220]
that happened the mid-baby scene in the IT and T boardroom no no I mean I saw the movie I

[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:51.900]
the world is a business Mr. Beale that there is more truth in that one that's about a four five

[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:55.340]
minutes scene there's more truth in that scene than most of you folks ever been exposed to when

[02:04:55.340 --> 02:05:01.180]
you're freaking lives the world is a business it's got nothing to do with us in Russia and China

[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:07.780]
and this one that the world is a stinking business that's why about the polar ice caps are melting

[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:11.660]
if there was anybody left around to write the history of the human race where's there won't be

[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:16.700]
they would write about all of these things all of these things because big business comes first in

[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.060]
fact we had the article on our website which I'm sure Josh worked feverishly to get on there

[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:24.380]
about how the Kyoto protocols you know the US works feverishly to make sure we get the brits

[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:28.880]
and everybody else off of that deal that's right so that our buddies and big business can continue

[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:36.480]
polluting the environment at your expense and the public is like like like that dumb not smart like

[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:40.940]
afraid of dumb I think we ought to take a lot of people out fishing what do you say and be sure

[02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:02.820]
themselves before there there's one there's one jackass at the casino line who crosses himself

[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:10.320]

away their ability to think and that that's what the religions do and that's what your parents do

[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:10.380]
I'm dying out of it now.

[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:15.920]
I'm dying out of it now.

[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.920]
Jorah is born, she's great.

[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:22.760]
Everybody on there is great except Chakka Khan.

[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:24.440]
Hey, Chakka Khan and Gaseer.

[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:27.080]
Merkin Company, you see what I mean?

[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.720]
I was just saying before they don't give a crap about you, the world is a business.

[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:32.360]
It's not, see, just stop and think about this.

[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:37.600]
If the purpose of the medical profession was to make everybody 100% healthy and eliminate

[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.120]
all disease, then all these people would be out of business.

[02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:42.040]
Absolutely.

[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:45.340]
And there'd be space for commercials for other things on your evening news every night,

[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.140]
beside pharmaceutical or prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, all of these

[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:51.000]
all is poisoned.

[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.040]
Oh my God.

[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:56.460]
Merkin Company with health information about heart problems suffered by patients taking

[02:12:56.460 --> 02:13:00.120]
in company's painkiller of viox from the manuscript of a journal article published

[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.980]
in 2000, the New England Journal of Medicine said yesterday.

[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:07.560]
The journals said pertinent information about the problems have been deleted from the manuscript

[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.760]
and the articles authors who included two Merkin employees failed to disclose information

[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:15.120]
about three heart attacks, until they knew about the incidents at least four and a half

[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.260]
months before the publication.

[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:20.460]
Had the data been reported to the study, which was sponsored by Merk, would have shown

[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:24.860]
that the risk of heart attack for people taking viox was five times higher than for those

[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:28.780]
using an approximate another painkiller, the journal reported an online expression of concern.

[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:29.340]
Oh my God.

[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.900]
Expression of concern, my ass.

[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.640]
Viox became a blockbuster drug that Merk did not pull from the market till four years

[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.420]
later, and another study showed long-term use increased the risk of heart attacks and

[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:39.800]
strokes.

[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:43.900]
The drug is now the subject of thousands of lawsuits and the problems with the journal article

[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:45.420]
revealed during a deposition.

[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:48.340]
In fact, the dead people are even suing.

[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:50.480]
The journal has asked the authors for a correction.

[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:53.780]
Besides the two Merkin employees, there were eleven other authors, all of whom were academic

[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:57.180]
scientists who had financial ties to the company.

[02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.280]
Got that?

[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:00.180]
Got it.

[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.620]
So how was your experience?

[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:03.360]
Oh, rewarding.

[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:04.400]
Was it a moving experience?

[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:05.120]
It was.

[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:05.700]
Good.

[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:07.740]
Card United Vanline.

[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:08.220]
It was loud.

It's called a father and son Jewish emovers.

[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:13.980]

[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:37.320]
Right.

[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:40.200]

[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:44.660]
We're going to have something here today.

[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:44.920]
Aren't we?

[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.840]
Like maybe 13 ever votes again during the show?

[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:47.220]
Wow.

[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:48.580]
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:50.460]
Pretty impressive.

[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.660]
Joel Feinberg gets very upset when I say those things.

[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:56.680]
So that gives him the impression that we have like a whole zillion of people listening

[02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:57.280]
and he doesn't.

[02:14:57.620 --> 02:14:58.280]
Ain't nozzy doesn't.

[02:14:58.580 --> 02:14:59.380]
You got nobody Joel.

[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:00.020]
You got squat.

[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:00.800]
Squatsky.

[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:02.060]
Now let's see.

[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:05.040]
Don, the dolphins are playing at San Diego this weekend, right?

[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:05.800]
Oh man.

[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:06.880]
Yeah.

[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:07.440]
It's going to be bad.

[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:09.100]
That could be ugly.

[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.320]
Now, we never really thought the bills game would be argument.

[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:13.640]
It was for one quarter actually for the three quarters.

[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:18.840]
And then the bill showed the true colors because they suck and they fold it up like an accordion not to take any credit away

[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.520]
They hung right in there. You know the old saying Rarararasa Spumba. Although guess who's gonna start?

[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:29.440]
This week for the dolphins. It's that sage. No, he's not starting. Oh, he's not. No

[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:35.040]
You would have thought when you when you think it I would have thought it after he bailed their sorry ass out last week

[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:41.220]
Wouldn't you have thought that anybody with a brain? But we're talking next saven here not somebody with a brain and as a result we got

[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:42.220]
Gus Farad

[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:48.440]
You think it was sage, but it's not instead it's Farad. Oh boy

Instead I wasted that two and a half hours watching this swill but they liked it because it's got no votes

Absolutely correct Christian fundamentalist right wing Christian legal groups and most of the Fox news channels prime time crew are echoing variations on the same thing

[02:22:57.260 --> 02:22:59.400]
Liberals are once again out to destroy Christmas

[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:05.740]
Instead of the ancient cry that the Jews killed Christ fundamentalist Christians and their conservative allies are accusing liberals

[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:10.020]
Which in those circles is often read Jews for trying to remove Christmas from the public square

[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.000]
Last year the Revenue Revolverment Cicularist hate Christ and want to steal Christmas from America

[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.580]

Hanukkah and Kwanzae have turned the words Christmas season into holiday season Walmart apologized for the misstep of course

[02:23:54.060 --> 02:24:01.700]
The Scottsdale Arizona based alliance to defense fund a Christian legal group announced that 800 attorneys agreed to voluntarily handle without fee complaints about

[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:05.700]
In proper attempts to censor the celebration of Christmas in schools and on public property

[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:09.100]
These Seattle Post intelligence are Georgia's favorite newspaper recently reported

John Gibson the host of Fox News channels the big story has penned a new book called the war on Christmas how the liberal plot to ban the sacred Christian holiday is

[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:30.300]
Worst and you thought which is devoted to controversy

[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.880]
What a title for a not great title that John Gibson all right? He's on my list. You know, he's right

[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:52.520]
By the way, I score and Joel with that big oh to paraphrase

[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:58.940]
SES John Mowell and the most immoralizing form of violence that could visit a Christian writer leaders such as Falwell is the violence of not being noticed

[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.240]
Well, nowhere near being the prominent fundamentalist figure

[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:05.480]
He was during a housey on days of the moral majority more than decade ago

[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:12.220]
Falwell can still command media attention more over unlike the Reverend Pat Robertson whose awkward commentaries have become so common that they become boring

[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:14.340]
Falwell picks his targets a bit more carefully

[02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:21.640]
These days he's last time to a doozy of a controversy in a recent addition to Falwell confidential the online insider weekly newsletter

[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.560]
The moral majority coalition and the liberty alliance. He maintained that Christmas is under attack

[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:31.000]
Christians follow advice should draw a line in the sand and resist bullying tactics by the ACLU

[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:38.840]
Americans united for separation of church and state and American atheist another leftist organizations then intimidate school and government officials by spreading misinformation about

[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:39.360]
Christmas

[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:42.740]
Celebrating Christmas Falwell declared is constitutional

[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:46.060]
Coincidentally organization points out that

[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:51.020]
Fallen the organizations Falwell points out as responsible for attacking Christmas are several of the same groups

[02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:54.960]
He blamed for the 9 11 terrorist attacks. He later issued a rather understated apology

[02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:01.680]
Tarting left wing grins is tried to drive Christmas out of the public square Falwell wrote in many public venues and in our schools and workplaces

[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:07.460]
Many Americans have discovered that they're not permitted to erect Christmas decorations exchange Christmas cards are St. Christmas carols

[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:13.140]
To combat the Christmas bash is Falwell's Thomas Robat the Church the Church East pasted for almost 50 years

[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:16.860]
It's sponsoring local newspaper ads promoting its save Christmas campaign

[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.800]
The genesis of the campaign is rooted in last year's effort that included a pro Christmas ad campaign

[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:24.400]
Organized by Dr. Jerry Privo or is that pervo?

[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:27.440]
Thanks to the anchorage back to temple Alaska's largest church

[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:33.820]
Dr. Privo chairman of Falwell Liberty's University Board of Trustees thought the ads were necessary in this age of political correctness

[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:37.740]
There's convinced many of our fellow Americans that Christmas is a dirty word follow a road

[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:41.700]
Well, I guess what Mary how you like that? We don't want to get Joyce Ben on a shape

[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:48.560]
Dr. Privo worked closely with the Orlando based Liberty Council a nonprofit litigation education and policy organization

[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:54.340]
Dedicated with advancing religious freedom the sanctity of human life and the traditional family and anti-Semitism by the way

[02:26:54.340 --> 02:27:00.160]
According to its website the formalite the language of the edge which are part of Liberty Council's friend or faux Christmas campaign

[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:05.260]
The friend or faux campaign aims to prevent blatant religious discrimination during religious holidays

[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:11.680]
In 2003 the Liberty Council organized a campaign called don't let the Grinch read that liberal steel as Christmas

[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.500]
Matthew the Stabler Liberty Council president general counsel laid out his rationale for that campaign

[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:22.200]
Our country was founded in Judeo Christian principles if we separate these fundamental principles from our civic life

[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.820]
We destroy our government in the process our founding fathers believed that religion and morality were necessary to our success as a nation

[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:33.360]
President Washington once said that anyone would attempt to remove religion and morality from our country cannot be considered a true patriot

[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.400]
He also predicted a rising national immorality if we exclude religious principles

[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.420]
In mid-December

[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:46.360]
2004 on Fox News the Liberty's counsel staver then the former Florida mayor was hostile to Christianity because he was apparently Jewish

[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:52.480]
On the Fox News channel writing about liberals out to destroy Christmas as ubiquitous and inaccurate as the stations

[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.940]
Fear and balance credo

[02:27:53.940 --> 02:28:00.340]
Last year recorded the medium matters for America website in a talking post memo to avoid it to how Martin Luther King would view things today

[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:06.400]
Or I may say the King would be appalled by the secular culture and by the attacks on Christmas and the demonizing of Christianity

[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:12.480]
In addition to plugging Gibson's book or Riley recently landed about the anti-Christmas practices of two major retailers

[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.840]
Sears came art and calls and as the Reverend I broadcast he told his audience here's what we found out

[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:20.360]
Sears came our wouldn't answer our questions

[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.480]
It's both a crisp breakaway simply duck the issue their website banners which will call it a 2005

[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:27.600]
They were the worst we had to deal with okay

Sears came art JC Penney says its catalog is always called Christmas catalog federated department stores

It may file in Lord and Taylor Marshall fields, but calls

[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:46.560]
Refused to define how that company will deal with Christmas villains. However, we'll use these slogan discover Christmas

[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:52.560]
Discover Dylan. So there you go shop where you like the atmosphere just remember calls and Sears came art basically not all right

[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.380]
Maybe she said not far right enough

[02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:57.640]
right

[02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:07.940]
John Gibson who claims he is a non-practicing Christian recently said that his Jewish son researched the book

[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:13.620]
The Seattle Post Intelligence are reported Gibson maintained that those leading the fight against Christians are primarily

[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:18.520]
Secular as so-called humanist trial or as cultural relativist and liberal guilt rack Christians

[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:24.300]
Liberal guilt racked Christians and strong Hannity the anxious one of co-hosted foxes

Sean Hannity weave the Christmas controversy in the recent segment discussing the nomination judge Sam Alito of the Supreme Court

[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.580]
According to the news-hound website and their their model was we watch Fox you don't have to

[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:52.880]
Hannity introduced the statement on leader by saying that his most controversial decision may have involved the defensive Christmas

[02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:58.840]
Hannity pointed out that judge a leader will apply the law and upheld common sense by law in Jersey City, New Jersey to put up a

[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:04.240]
Christmas display and so it goes on and on you really ought to read it and find out what he's crazy going up to again

Other mouth, okay

[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:38.640]
If you want to explore a really strange new world of Christmas listen to what William Shadner does to Jaiol St. Nicholas

[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:41.040]

[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:04.380]
I'm sad man, huh?

[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:04.880]
Who?

[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:10.020]
And by another couple hours all that snow is going to be long gone and meanwhile the northeast is just very under

[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:16.560]
Especially Buffalo and El Maira and Rochester and Syracuse and Ithaca and Binghamton and Johnstown and

[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:21.280]
Barley these days they're just a drone to see a snow and Boston and Provinceton

[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:23.740]
Well, see guys pissed off at Provinceton, he's got bad aim

[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.300]
When you think he's a little PO to P town just a tad bit

[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.300]
Okay, we got like over 12-liter votes on a pool. We got a shot at 1300 here

[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:37.360]
Really will drive some people very up the wall 12-16. That's not so good. It was 12-16 like a minute ago

[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:40.740]
See you've had to keep beating these people over there. How long have I been telling you that?

[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:46.640]
12-18 see that I just say and they can't even hear it yet because we haven't caught up to the five-minute delay yet

[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:52.360]
12-18 to get to 13 every 82 votes in 41 minutes. That's only that's exactly two a minute

[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:59.020]
Even even Joe could do that. Oh, if they like it's the whole audience over there voted they can get 82 votes right?

[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:00.380]
Easy

[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:02.600]
72 a.m. Hello

[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:06.480]
Hello, you I'm a black man. Well good for you

[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:08.680]
72 a.m. Hello

[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:11.100]
I'm Goneo. Yes, sir

[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:17.920]
First and foremost happy holidays to you Jorge Josh and like the whole crew and back to you

[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:19.600]
Happy January holidays

[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:25.980]
Like I'm the food you let call a few months ago remember I kind of caused a little bit of a cynicism when I said that

[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:29.300]
I and I still believe this that at least 50% of

[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:36.800]
The Neil Rogers audience or Julio's remember no chance. No chance. No chance. No. No. I was listening earlier like a

[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:42.840]
930 12 it was like one stick after the other. Yeah, well, that was a stick hour

[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:52.340]
Yeah, but anyway happy holidays on Coneo. You're still okay. A police and Navidad and on the own waveo and up yours. See you

[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:52.940]
bye

[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:58.980]
Okay, see he's in a dream. I wish that we had like a lot more Julio's and Julietta's and

[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:04.600]
Whatever we'll take anybody anybody's got a radio or you do know you'll never do but you'll never admit it

[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:06.560]
We don't just look at the

[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:12.820]
We did not get them to break out the Hispanic thing from the summer book where we did so great. I don't know did you?

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:15.280]
Yes, and maybe we're on vacation that we

[02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:18.140]
was

[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:23.460]
It sure as I wasn't no 50% of our audience you show was fifth among like what 20 30 stations

[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.020]
Yeah, and that's bad

[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:30.140]
I didn't say it was bad. I just said it's not like what this guy says

[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:34.960]
Which I only wish you told all of me my whole friend will be a hundred percent and maybe they might listen

[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:40.000]
And of course in addition to which those who do listen with many of them it's a closet experience anyway

[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:44.400]
It's like Tom cruise all over again in the Scientologist. It's a closet experience

[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:47.940]
So while they remember the poll we did about people denying things yeah

[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:51.760]
And let's say they're showing being one of them we got a lot of votes and there are obvious reasons

[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.560]
There are many people who do listen, but they don't want to admit it. Oh, you know listen to that fact

[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.680]
I could do it that to Tommy Pinkle left wing or whatever you know fill in the blank whatever they whatever the reason being or maybe it's a combination

[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:02.920]
all of these things

[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:07.640]
That make people not want to admit they listen, but oh they they sneak a lot

[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.420]
I hate everything you say in fact the other day you said, you know, I like that and they quote you chapter in verse

[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:20.580]
Yadi yadi yadi and like you said there's 80s Indian stations out there and other is a serious satellite and an XM and FM and PM and AM

[02:38:21.180 --> 02:38:22.020]
right right

[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:27.700]
I'd say to thank you to ABC by the way for all the religious training on United the nightly news

[02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:31.380]
I'm so glad the assembly right to Brian Williams. They put those two bozos on their own

[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:38.340]
They just have a death wish. I think Disney is like trying I don't know what they're trying to maybe ice news trying to avoid going to hell

[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:40.440]
Maybe you got religion

[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:42.620]
72 a.m. Hello

[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:46.480]

[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:02.360]
You're not full me sweetheart. You mean so for me so you can tell by the that little kind of nasal playing

[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:07.300]
Five or maybe it was just these snap of the suspenders five or the snap of the bag

[02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:09.900]
The opium bag

[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:14.260]
Five six seven that'd be good pull to take who's your favorite broadcaster who wears a bag

[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.460]
All right, I can only think of two at the moment

[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:27.560]
WQ a.m. Hello. Hi. Yes, sir. I'm trying to see if you could explain something to me

[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:48.040]
Now he always goes off at nine different question is

[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:51.800]
I'm trying to figure out when you do like the flute thing and stuff like that

[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:57.460]
I miss says more stuff than it is down belief and you're just like a gone like

[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:02.160]
Easy money don't don't do anything anymore. Is there a reason?

[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:06.440]
Do you believe me we don't do anything what does that mean compared to what he used to do

[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.740]
Yeah, because we can't say anything that's right because we got

[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:13.460]
You know we have a need for a paycheck every two weeks

[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:16.500]
Okay, that's the only because we work for a bunch of Nazis

[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:21.720]
That's all who jeopardize the license and now we got this bitch over there in the Naples and we can't you're right

[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.820]
We can't do a tentable. We were still kicking ass. I don't like that

[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.480]

No, I was a show to a couple of things I played that I forgot had a one had a GD or whatever

[02:41:04.060 --> 02:41:10.360]
Just a lot of silly stuff and of course the fart sounds. I mean, Josh is gonna hurt inside the blow up if one of those gets on a year

[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:16.060]
Like the morning that month was sitting and everyone's turned into the whole show on farting that one and then we're playing music

[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:19.920]
Practically doing the whole show because God forbid that one of students fart's got on a year

[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:23.560]

See in this guy's tell me that I miss his on it

[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:48.040]
This is the boy right what's better than a live radio show every morning on TV well just about anything

[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:53.560]
But that hasn't stopped him snbc from teeming up with radio's original bad boy who now looks like a nasty old lady

[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.040]
Listen Bernie I miss tell that internist copy

[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:01.540]
Every morning see I miss listen to a tape of other people's county this why bomb the air

[02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:04.500]
I need a hammer to bite into those mucous somebody to pass the question plate

[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:07.240]
His wild behind the scenes at it

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:12.100]
I have a high-end high-end you are the wallers cook cook it soon now get me some fresh coffee or your fire

[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:17.400]
I miss he's irreverent. So I want to deal with the ball. He's topical. So I want to deal with his water game

[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:19.700]
He's in coherent. I'll tell you what that

[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:21.040]
Is a government president?

[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:29.880]
Rehears I miss and he's going and he's only on msnbc a people channel nobody watches and a bunch of a m radio stations

[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.440]
Go but he listens to and somebody gets some fresh jingle it's iris

[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:39.000]
I will say this mark so and this is not I'm not to take him back what I said a minute ago because it's a real pain in the grass

[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:39.340]
but

[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:43.980]
The this whole concept of shock radio and shock jocs on

[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:49.180]
Everything has been done. Okay. I mean everything has been said that you could possibly say

[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:52.800]
and get away with and there's no more shock. I did anything

[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:57.420]
So the idea that in order to do a show in fact there are some people out of one mention no names

[02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:00.760]
But there are some people that if you take that stuff away they can't do a show

[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:02.140]
That's all they got

[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:08.120]
I don't want to mention any names because god forbid I should do that the wrath of somebody would come down on me, you know

[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:14.420]
238 votes. We need 62 votes in 34 minutes. That should be a piece of cake. I'm not sure this rummisfil

[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.500]
Think there might be something in this for the ass-end you know that the potty mouth guitar man. So give me warning all right

[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:33.760]
I think he might say

[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:36.280]
He's the guy

[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:42.760]
He likes to think he's known the one

[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:47.060]
Oh

[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:00.640]
Rock solid

[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:06.500]
He plays the songs that make you see me

[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:11.380]
He steals material from you

[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:17.060]
He gives the time and the weather's looking fine

[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:20.660]
His jobs have played the song again

[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:21.740]
blah

[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:27.360]
He's bigger than the post-blowbell

[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.480]
His eyes are the most

[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:37.680]
The biggest man in radio's and then

[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:44.880]
Let's make the son our sister station

[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:49.200]
No and bring the blob in here today

[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:55.400]
If the clap man could use another kid

[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:58.860]
He'd have more boring songs to play

[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:00.140]
blah

[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:03.380]
Oh

[02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:05.740]
He's bigger than the post-blowbell

[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:09.840]
His eyes are the most

[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:15.740]
The biggest man in radio's and then

[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:17.880]
Absolutely

[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:30.120]
The

[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:31.880]
Shining finally got two votes by the way

[02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:41.860]
Said talk there was no potty mouth stuff and they're not good term any wouldn't do none like that

[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:43.080]
Not him

[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:50.460]
Prove 151 votes on a poll we need 49 for 13 under we got like 26 minutes to do that should be able to do it get with it

[02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.780]
Anyway, the reason I played that and you'll never believe this

[02:47:52.780 --> 02:47:56.280]
This is a true story to show about my psychic powers. I haven't thought about this slab

[02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:00.100]
I mean this guy for a long time. No, I've been out in something my mentioned on here

[02:48:00.900 --> 02:48:05.120]
But this morning in the shower no less. What a horrible place to it. I shouldn't know that

[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:11.020]
But I was just thinking about different things and for whatever reason it popped into my mind about as you went and blob blessed her

[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:12.460]
I don't know why

[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.500]
So it's got to be my psychic gig I get the heavey jibby just thinking about it

[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:21.980]
Now we get this fact from david lakeland where they bob laseter update. Do you believe that?

[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:25.660]
No, I don't believe it. Did you read it? I read it wow

[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:29.860]
Now I could pretend that I'm saddened by this, but that would be a lie

[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.460]
Are you saddened by it? No, not really

[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:39.560]
Here's the facts. It says I ran across bob laseter's web blog online yesterday

[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.360]
bloglaseter.com it seems bob is in pretty bad shape

[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.860]
He had part of a foot amputated and is going blind

[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:50.000]
He says the vision loss has been slowed by treatment. It will be completely gone in three to four years

[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.860]
But he doesn't expect to live that long

[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:56.180]
He is pretty much confined to the house playing poker online all day

[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:03.460]
Very sad. I know you hated WSU end, but to me was the greatest station what a lineup you had says david lakeland

[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:06.160]
What a lineup we had what lineup was that?

[02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:15.060]
I don't know. I remember that and I got him hired out of the cornfields in iowa after he was out of the business

[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:20.520]
And he got booted out of fla or walked out and some kind of dispute was he was always having and I get them to hire him to

[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:26.840]
FLA to do morning or s u n right and he we go there to do a week shows because are we doing the studios in Miami and iod

[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:31.860]
And so we go over to Tampa to do a week's worth of shows over there and he glad hands is in it eats all of our food

[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:33.680]
But remember all the food we had going in that place

[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:38.180]
Oh, put me yeah, well guess what now he's paying the price for a hop at all that food up

[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:44.040]
And then goes on the air like badmosses and ripses and ass and I didn't even understand that because like

[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:49.120]
There wasn't even any kind of Neil Rogers joking going on like you weren't even throwing any shots in

[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.460]
Of course not, but I'm gonna want to cut him in there

[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:55.080]
This was gonna be the big thing. We're gonna like hit Tampa like it's on a brix in the beginning

[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:58.940]
We did we had an appearance at a mall there and the first that we had two of them the first one

[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:00.880]
We had like five thousand people show up

[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:04.440]
We had radio people tell us that they never seen anything like it in Tampa

[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:08.240]
Five thousand people showed up at a shopping mall to see Randy and

[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.280]
Phil and me and Rick and Scott whoever was on it didn't even make any sense to the his attack

[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.500]
It was like he was possessed by the devil or something. No, right

[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:18.760]
And I think it was because in ego you know when you're big and fat

[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:21.260]
That's the big fat size you're

[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:28.460]
And so the fact that all these people showed up and actually liked this in the beginning then I'll turn around and then start the attacks on everybody

[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:30.300]
At least it wasn't only me it was everybody. That's right

[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:38.100]
And that's fine. That's up to him. I mean we need it as you went like we need it as the french say a walking cup. We didn't need him right

[02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:43.300]
But anyway, so now he's and certainly when somebody's that gigantic

[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:45.500]
He must have diabetes which goes along with his foot

[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:50.120]
Admitation and losing the eyesight. I'm telling you right now if you're diabetic go feed nice

[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:53.720]
Broom and a lot of carbohydrates and get your blood sugar up there responsibly, okay? Yeah

[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:56.540]
Do it responsibly like I do right?

[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:02.520]
Let me say it again my blood sugar day after I had that abhorrent day and I admit that was an active lunacy

[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:04.420]
half a gallon of Nestle's

[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:05.980]
What was it heavily hash?

[02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:11.280]
Listen because I took an extra half a pill or extra pill whatever now was the next day my blood sugar was like

[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:14.980]
What was it on 80 90 whatever was every fat man?

[02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:20.220]
I've ever buried and I'm up to three now. Yeah, I always said the same thing right up to the day they died

[02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:24.980]
Yeah, they were lying. Well, would I make up my blood sugar? How would I do that? No, you wouldn't make up your blood sugar

[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.460]
But it's like the gamblers, you know, you only talk about your good days. I

[02:51:29.460 --> 02:51:31.520]
Have had plenty of bad days not recently though

[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.940]
Not recently. I'm on the straight. I mean the gay and narrow path

[02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:38.720]
And after reading that about blah bow you just watch you see today

[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:41.420]
I'm gonna like I got some real Parmesan and the refrigerator

[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:45.260]
That's it. Just think of how much you'll be able to eat if you only eat the right things

[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:51.160]
This this is a guy. Yeah, this is a guy who this morning

[02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:58.720]
Eight more food than most people eat in a lifetime, okay, and that's just before noon before Josh. Yeah, you had a bowl of chili

[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.440]
You ate your food. Yeah, get out of here. You had all the sandwiches and chili and like every day

[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:07.240]
You're popping up these bacon and hoagies and very light lunch every day

[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:20.520]
Why Joshua was a good for me now who's in denial mister? I have Josh. I eat one sandwich or a bowl of chili or a Greek salad or two slices of pizza

[02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:23.300]
Yeah, I'm the one that's throwing it down over there Josh is

[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:27.800]
And I'm gonna tell you between the beer and Alex food man

[02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:32.040]
You're gonna be a tub. You'll hit his limit active. I'm active

[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:38.560]
I got news for it at old a Humpey bumpy that you're doing at that's I gotta wear off all the calories, okay?

[02:52:38.700 --> 02:52:45.200]
I used to be active too then I got married now that's so that's one and debris not doing much anymore

[02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:48.960]
Especially after he hopefully learned his lesson the last time

[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:52.440]
I'm in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the last time

[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:54.780]
This is Neil Rogers

[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:56.560]
And we can hear him anyway

[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:01.080]
Uh-560

[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:02.560]
100 gigant

[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:12.340]
My uh, you know the producer is at a young republicans clan rally you and by now I guess he's just uh hanging around

[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:17.180]
I

[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:23.280]
And meanwhile I'm stuck with this kid over here. Huh. I know most every big shot bought off in the city. Who the hell are you?

[02:53:23.660 --> 02:53:23.880]
Josh?

[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:27.960]
Well you listen to me my young celery and coin friend

[02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:33.740]
I'm on the payroll. Well you listen to me my celery but inexperienced friend

[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:38.940]

I'm 27. Well you listen to me my old enough to be my younger sister friend

[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:50.080]
Not gay. You might away something. You know that how old Jay Stone died

[02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:55.360]
Who? Well you listen to me my unenformed child like friend

[02:53:55.360 --> 02:53:58.900]
Oh no. Oh no

[02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:01.660]
Not again. Not again

[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:02.640]
All right

[02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:04.940]
There's motions in my tent

[02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:08.800]
And out of the little great jingle bells

[02:54:10.180 --> 02:54:10.660]
Oh

[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:26.880]
You're just done I mean that uh, dingalberry rhymes with you fairy like that you know it does

[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:28.800]
So what about that last or the thing?

[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:33.440]
I was actually thinking about old blob of this morning briefly. I'm not saying I was like in deep uh, you know

[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:37.020]
That's something that you were thinking about. Yeah. I

[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:42.020]
Loose for you when when you cross me you wind up dead. I agree to you that I don't want to start like uh, mr

[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:45.300]
Yeah karma if you cross me you will die

[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:49.700]
miserable to a miserable cuss. That is correct. You'll come to a wicked end

[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:51.080]
You're on sand?

[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:56.020]
Oh speaking of people coming to a wicked end the uh, Harold was all obsessed with his story

[02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:59.340]
Which I kind of like laid off I was a little bit suspicious too

[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:03.760]
Archdiocese school death list was actually a birthday list

[02:55:04.380 --> 02:55:07.980]
Did you see this story earlier this week? They were like all over this like stick on great

[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:14.560]
The infamous death list written by a student that a pop it obiates Catholic school is turned out to be a birthday list

[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:19.600]
According to the Archdiocese of Miami or maybe it was just a list of a prospective altar boys

[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:25.280]
The BSO however will not confirm the intent of the student who wrote the list until its investigation concludes

[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.460]
Lave this afternoon Sheriff's office spokesman who grafts says

[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:34.500]
Earlier this week parents who children in tend these state Elizabeth of hungry school in Pompano Beach

[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:39.960]
A K through eight school were furious when they learned these schools were almost really to inform them that a

[02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:42.620]
Death list with 12 students names on it was found

[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:47.800]
A BSO investigation began after the publisher of a local community newspaper contact

[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:54.420]
Contacted BS on Tuesday later that day school official send letter to parents confirming that such a list existed

[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:56.640]
BS

[02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:02.540]
Detectives have concluded their investigation of determining that the list was in fact a birthday list

[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:09.180]
Said Mary Ross Augusta communicating director of the Archdiocese of Miami. We said you receive confirmation from the BS this morning

[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:13.460]
The name of the seventh grader hasn't been released and the student will not face any display charges

[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:17.940]
Well, I mean if you put together a birthday list got only knows what you're gonna do those people under birthday right?

[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:22.900]
Especially if it's a Catholic school the birthday list conclusion was one of the many rumors circulated by parents on Thursday

[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:25.860]
Who wrote these school to pick up their kids? It's a birthday list

[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:30.500]
And that's why I'm not concerned said a woman named a net was picking up her three kids at the school yesterday and the hair

[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:32.600]
Can rotten hells you said your mama

[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:39.180]
So socks and hell so what about that blob? Oh thing now that ties in with this other story that I want to give in here today

[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:44.940]
And if you quit overeating and you know getting all that great gray hair. I'll try to cut down

[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:49.020]
After a century of nearly uninterrupted medical improvements in longer lives

[02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:51.680]
It looks like the baby boomers could screw things up blob oh

[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:57.340]
A new government study shows deaths from hearted heart disease cancer and stroke continued to drop

[02:56:57.340 --> 02:57:05.760]
But it also shows that half of American ages 55 to 64 including the oldest of the baby boomers have high blood pressure and two and five are obese

[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:12.340]
That's made high blood pressure and obese although not in blob was category now did you ever encounter him?

[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:19.000]
Yeah, remember I drove up there. I was there at that appearance. Oh, you were there. Yeah, so you saw a monster in the you

[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.780]
I saw the business the much reduced according to you

[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:25.940]
Blod lesser. Oh, well, I would only hear I must say he must have ballooned up again

[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:34.820]
Anyway, it says this means that this large group of aging Americans is in worse shape in some respects than those born a decade earlier when they were the same age

[02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:39.120]
Medical improvements to come years might offset these problems before they affect life expectancy

[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:45.560]
But there are no promises how provincial said blob the late 50s early 60s are a crucial time to focus on disease prevention

[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:50.380]
said dr. Julie Geburting directly the yada yada the CDC in Atlanta

[02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:55.600]
It's never related to adopt the healthy lifestyle to enjoy a longer healthier life here that I hear Josh

[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:04.420]
I'd like to relate to in adopt a healthier lifestyle which does not mean getting drunk and puking your gut side every night doesn't mean

[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:06.100]
Carousin around with every

[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.920]
Anyway, tell me if he couldn't do that. He he'd want to be dead

[02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:12.600]
That's right. Well, I can see that

[02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:21.200]
With the drinking or the carousing both both right spack it among the findings deaths from heart disease cancer and stroke

[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:26.680]

You know, it's almost the end of the week. I know and this this lung kid

[02:58:57.300 --> 02:59:02.100]
Deaths from heart disease cancer and stroke the nation's three leading killers all dropped in 2003

[02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:06.380]
They were down between two and five percent America's life expectancy all see this

[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:09.920]
This is supposed to be the thrust of the article after they've worn all of us baby boomers

[02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:12.200]
You're gonna die well. Yeah sooner or later

[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:15.460]
Americans life expectancy increased again

[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:21.040]
That must be because of those fantastic prescription drugs that we're seeing advertised on the news every night for hours and hours

[02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:25.400]

77 60 and point six years on average up from 77.3 year before in 1990

[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:44.100]
Life expectancy was 75.4 years, but there was an interesting thing about that. I found in a story that uh

[02:59:45.060 --> 02:59:46.580]
Uh, where the hell is it?

[02:59:47.620 --> 02:59:53.040]

[02:59:53.860 --> 02:59:56.920]
That you're gonna get to you're gonna lift 82 is the average

[02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:02.480]
So I guess I guess the deal is in other words if you made it this far right and now I can't find that

[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:06.360]
I know it's here in the story because I think I put that we put this on the line and I can't find it

[03:00:07.280 --> 03:00:09.200]
