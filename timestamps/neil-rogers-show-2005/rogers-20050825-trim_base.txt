[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700]
9.50 a year on QA and wrap it up. Can I get to this Marlon's Batboy story?

[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.520]
Please.

[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.960]
So on a dare from Dodger's picture Brad Penny, what a mature guy he is.

[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.060]
Don't don't don't don't.

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.060]
No, he wasn't a mom. He dared to Marlon's Batboy to drink a gallon of milk

[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.400]
in under an hour and not throw up.

[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.680]
Penny offered a Batboy 500 bucks if he could do it.

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.740]
Penny told to Miami Herald that the boy drank the milk and didn't throw up

[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.420]
but didn't finish the gallon in the allotted time.

[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.540]
By the way, once the milk is out for like 40 minutes, I ain't drinking it anymore.

[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.120]
And the kid gets a six game suspension from the Marlins for doing this.

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.420]
I don't know why. And Brad Penny is a great quote.

[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.620]
You get 10 games for steroids and six games for milk.

[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.320]
Where's Alapta?

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600]
Thank you. I was expecting Wilson. It wasn't real.

[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420]
I once challenged Clint Hurdle but he was afraid the milk would curdle.

[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.620]
Pretty hurt. Yeah, that's bad.

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.260]
Well, don't get the rain done now. It's going to be really, really bad.

[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.180]
Sonny here ain't going to be 79 today like paradise.

[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.800]
Really?

[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.440]
You know, the eye of the storm is due east of Boka right now. You know who lives in Boka?

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.220]
That's not good.

[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.420]
But he's gotten on the good thing for him though.

[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.380]
We got a ball game today at 130, the pregame and again tomorrow.

[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.500]
Yeah, there's no one.

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.760]
How do you like that?

[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.180]
I won't have to get the ores out and float all the way down from Boka.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.840]
No midday program. The next couple does.

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.680]
No, I'll be damned.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.320]
And you got a little time off today. Only a half an hour.

[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.340]
Yeah.

[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.640]
I'm 30 pregame. Thank goodness they're playing in Milwaukee.

[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.880]
Because if they were playing in South Florida, I don't think you'd have no ball games.

[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.660]
It's good point. You have to work the extra half hour.

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.380]
I don't want to be nervous.

[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.140]
But I'd start, I get home real nice and early if I were you because they keep talking about tonight and tomorrow.

[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.000]
And they're full of crap because it's only 45 miles east of landfall.

[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.800]
Yeah, but it's going really slow.

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.920]
Eight miles an hour.

[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.080]
Well, you do the math, mister.

[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.520]
Yeah, eight times five and a half hours sounds like to me.

[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.700]
Well, what is it now? 10? So that's like 3.30.

[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.180]
Yeah, that's what I was going to say right around there.

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.900]
I was actually going to say that, but you beat me.

[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.880]
I'm going to pitch those down a little bit more than that.

[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.480]
It's like late afternoon.

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.140]
Yeah, we got some miserable. It's going to be so dynamic.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.920]
You know, they close everything already too.

[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.840]
One more reason not to be in South Florida.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.920]
I don't want to rub it in or anything like that before.

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280]
This is, and this is only end of August.

[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.920]
Wow.

[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.640]
You're not doing nothing yet.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.260]
It's still worth it though.

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.640]
A couple rainy days for all the nights.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.260]
Whether we have.

[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.360]
Yeah, like when I got caught down here last year in late September,

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.280]
in the middle of those 18 hurricanes in a row,

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.340]
I couldn't get there a lot of there.

[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.960]
That was kind of a weird stretch though, right?

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]
That's not the norm, is it?

[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.720]
Yeah, a weird stretch.

[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.780]
It's a big stretch.

[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.800]
Well, I'm looking forward to not working tomorrow in the morning.

[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.340]
So that's right.

[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.640]
You got a tomorrow night.

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.720]

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.520]
Part of the day off tomorrow.

[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.280]
But tomorrow night you got Carolina ale house at seven o'clock.

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.900]
Everybody swim out there to see a Jolie at the Carolina ale house at seven o'clock.

[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.620]
Yeah, get on your raft.

[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.800]
I'm sure you'll have a big turn out for that.

[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.940]
Well, I mean, we hope that it clears up by then.

[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.680]
And we can do the show because as you know, Neil,

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.080]
there's a little fee attached to be going there.

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.460]
Yeah.

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.880]
So I hope that's a little bit to fee as long as you can get there.

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.680]
That's all I can get.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.080]
I can get anything I can.

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.780]
Wait, so you're saying.

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.580]
And if you keep the transmitter on here, that's the real thing.

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.940]
That's the big one.

[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.440]
So you're saying if I get there,

[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.900]
even if we can't get on the air, I should still get paid.

[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.000]
No.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.120]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.700]
Okay.

[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.600]
Just Tom, give me the check and you know, I'll see you.

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.240]
So when I put in free, can you initial it?

[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.280]
Put your initials next to it.

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.920]
I'll put a I'll put a Greg weed squiggle on the viper here.

[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.640]
Okay.

[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.080]
Requests.

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.980]
No, I appreciate that.

[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.880]
The squiggle is always good.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.260]
All right.

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.840]
That way, how about I wanted to ask you a loongo.

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.920]
It turns down five mill.

[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.340]
Pretty, uh, pretty nice offer by the team, though.

[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.980]
Yeah.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.900]
I mean, how can you turn down five mill here?

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.840]
I'm really an agent's an idiot.

[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.120]
His agent's a dumb frog.

[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.320]
What's with that guy?

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.740]
I just told you.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.080]
Five mill in a year.

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.140]

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.920]
He's a proffane disease.

[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.600]
Dumb frog.

[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.200]
You know, that's nice and then he's not a dumb guy.

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.700]
Yeah.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.600]
Puffin's sharp.

[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.540]
You should lose so long.

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.720]
He's a sharp as a marble.

[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.600]
Are you kidding me?

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.660]
Get out of here.

[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.980]
I'm like, why do you do that?

[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.500]
I want to know.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.240]
Because I like that.

[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.340]
You know, you don't.

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.520]
If I do, I'll tell you all the time.

[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.660]
I should be telling you like, Rimmer.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.360]
No, I don't have to see Rimmer anymore.

[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.420]
Oh, yeah, you do.

[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.280]
They're coming down there.

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.720]
Yeah, what?

[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.540]
Yeah, Rimmer's a knife.

[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.440]
Rimmer's a good knife.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.920]
Just a little stingy.

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.340]
Just a little stingy an agent.

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.460]
Otherwise, we'd be guy.

[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.960]

[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.440]
He's a big mouth.

[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.760]
Right.

[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.260]
He's a stingy an agent.

[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.600]
But he's not a bad.

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.740]
Rimmer's always been a knife.

[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.720]
He's a straighter, by the way.

[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.240]
He's the Eric Reed, a hockey.

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.200]
I just thought I mentioned that.

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.700]
He's going to be your counterpart to him in the TV.

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.060]
He's a very nice guy.

[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.260]
Red Wing guy and the ESPN guy.

[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.380]
And he does a good job of Chef.

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.400]
He talks to his teeth, which I just, I can't stand like Eric Reed.

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.180]
I'm like, our jazz courtists used to do that.

[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.220]
And every now and then, the lapses back into that.

[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.080]
Talks to his teeth.

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.580]
Really?

[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.140]
Yeah.

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.440]
I never actually caught that.

[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.940]
Huh?

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.240]
I never actually caught that.

[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.060]
I didn't realize that.

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.980]
Man, you better share this little more carefully.

[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.240]
I'm trying to do that now.

[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.460]
I had a little...

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.820]
No, I had a little...

[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.900]
You got a fantastic couple of new bits today.

[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280]
I thought you were going to see...

[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.520]
Right at the start, which I think you'll enjoy tremendously knowing how much you hate.

[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.380]
That's it.

[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.140]
You see, what do I always tell you about hate?

[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.260]
Dispies.

[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.720]
That's a very, very strong word.

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.360]
Re-vile.

[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.260]
Oh, come on.

[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.720]
Yeah.

[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.420]
Go ahead.

[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.600]
Oh, that's fine.

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800]
I got no problem with that.

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.720]
Come on, Gellie.

[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.460]
One doing.

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.200]
Come on, just say it.

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.240]
I will not do it.

[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.380]
Doi.

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.460]
Doi.

[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.220]
Doi.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.600]
Doi.

[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.820]
Doi.

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.180]
Oh, right.

[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.340]

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.600]
Actually...

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.240]
Have a nice day.

[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.720]
I got to swim.

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.080]
You redeemed yourself.

[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.420]

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.400]
Have a safe swim.

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.900]

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.780]
Don't play the open.

[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.540]
Kill us.

[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.600]
For a very, very long time.

[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.060]
They're also reminding people that once the storm has us be careful of standing water.

[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.480]
It could be filled with anchor-taminated with bacteria, broken glass.

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.680]
Even hidden power lines.

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.620]
There have been tragedies in the past.

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.540]
And maybe the boogie man might be in there too.

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]
There's Susan Candy-Odi.

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.340]
She's the only person that see it and we like.

[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.400]
She's a sweetheart.

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.340]
Don't we like her a lot?

[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.880]
We do.

[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.140]
Just to go to show you that nothing is perfect on the other side of the screen.

[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.300]
They got Mrs. Werslinbaw.

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.700]
Florida.

[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.760]
Oh, brother.

[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.760]
Look at that bitch.

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.420]
I just actually like her a little bit.

[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.260]
I thought she was okay.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360]
She never stole a freight train.

[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.620]
I thought she was kind of like a milligmin as a whole.

[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.660]
I mean, the benign.

[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.420]
Now she's tainted.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.520]
Now she ought to tainted.

[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.560]
She's not so much wind damage, but again, too worldly to say.

[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.140]
All right.

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.580]
You see, now the same storm expected a short tonight or early tomorrow.

[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.380]
Meanwhile, at the Sky Miles, the other either weather guy,

[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.940]
whatever his name is, Chad Miles.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.460]
There he is.

[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.180]
Bad good Monday.

[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.840]
I want to get psychositis hope she's in a building.

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.960]
Not holding a couple.

[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.380]
Oh, he's playing.

[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.900]
We should start a fun to get weight.

[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.560]
Yes, you can.

[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.020]
Let's get up.

[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.040]

[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.560]
I like the little how you touch them.

[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.000]
I see.

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.300]
He was already saying that you better watch out and you better not talk.

[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.000]
Because it's not going to be tonight and early tomorrow.

[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.880]
The thing is 45 miles east of the eye is like do east of I would say a

[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.060]
deer field right now.

[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.340]
But you know something he's right.

[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.820]
It is making kind of like a wobble and it could go to the south.

[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.600]
This one of the strangest things I've ever seen.

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.400]
But anyway, here's the deal.

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.200]
Katrina slowly getting better organized as moves westward towards south

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.920]
eastern Florida.

[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.240]
Oh, and I never played the well, I'll play it a minute.

[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.800]
Okay.

[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.360]
What?

[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.500]
I never played the bitzer.

[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.040]

[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.300]

Alright, now Diane can leave.

[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.520]
Okay, thanks.

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.260]
All right, guys.

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.260]

[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:25.700]

[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:25.700]

[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.340]
I'm going to die!

[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.360]
I'm going to die!

[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.940]

I'm going to die!

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:42.860]

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:42.860]

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.060]
I'm going to die!

[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.540]
I'm going to die!

[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.500]

[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.620]
I'm going to die!

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.240]

Doline,,

[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:57.700]

[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.320]
The Da-Doo Asyl tele

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.320]

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.020]
hahah

[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.040]
Doline,,

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.080]
was a dad a dad?

[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:03.880]
I'm going to die?

[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.580]
Okay, here's Jarge's pull from yesterday. I wish I could change 835 votes, which obviously

[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.700]
you'd have had a lot more stuff for the fact that you weren't competent.

[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.060]
No, I only mentioned it.

[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.360]
Why?

[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.160]
He had other things going on like this. Silly asked pull, we're taking today.

[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.280]
I'm not going to like you. I get all our goal for the pull today is 100 votes.

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.840]
I wish I could change my weight to 152. My member size 187, well, I feel better because

[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.760]
that was my vote and I had a lot of company, obviously.

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.420]
What? You're talking about weight, right?

[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:54.980]
No. My hair 85, my height 77, my address 65, especially now I'm thinking, well, folks,

[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.060]
you're wondering, how come I'm here? You know, what a tropical swamp.

[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:07.700]
My marital status 57, my face 37, my parents 22, my gender 17, my nationality 17, my skin

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.280]
color 10 and my boob size 9.

[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.380]
That's because we don't have a lot of women listening. We forgot age.

[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.520]
Someone said an email saying, you know, that would be good. That would be excellent.

[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.080]
In fact, I vote for that. My age and member size or just super size.

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.860]
Sounds good. Super size.

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.320]
12 minutes after 10, we'll keep you posted on what's happening with this.

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.420]
It's a whole hurricane, a hazard, it's not a hurricane yet, but it's headed over those

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.880]
real warm tropical waters, you know what I'm saying? And it's going to start picking up

[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.180]
steam.

[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.440]
What about you like that? As if you're not used to it. Okay, a lot of rain and some winds,

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.580]
not heavy winds though. This isn't one of those kind of things. So no reason to like

[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.700]
extra panic. I would put the panic level at about a four and a half on a scale of 10.

[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.820]
Would you say? Okay, I'll say as opposed to like a, man, the sky's falling, the world

[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.580]
is coming to end kind of thing. Just calmly, bicell batteries. That's right.

[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.020]
Bicell batteries go out there and get your plywood. You don't have to put the plywood

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.040]
up just to drift around on it. Yeah, you may have to float around on it. And of course

[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.040]
some of the people out there can float already.

[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:08.980]
Neon God.

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.180]
Ah, thank you.

[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.840]
Excellent.

[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.640]
Now she's a son, famous naked people

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.160]
There's carbon barrels coming

[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.800]
Famous naked people

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.300]
Our care I would like them young

[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.160]
Look what they do, making these days to revive

[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.060]
All their crappy careers

[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.460]
Everyone leans, they're bumping underneath

[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.060]
And when you think that it just would not kill any words

[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.940]
Here comes redders, famous naked people

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.000]
Oh my god, in homemade videos

[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.240]
Famous naked people

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.560]
We spade put on some clothes

[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.140]
Shame on you for sure off your worst, redders

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.140]
1018 and 560 WQA

[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.060]
And we got 179 votes on today's pool

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.140]
Which is not very important

[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.100]
It's the Pat Robertson, you know, it followed over that

[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.020]
It's flowed from it

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.360]
Which religious nut?

[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.240]
I beg your pardon?

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.120]
It was thinking of religious nuts

[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.860]
And here in Idaho

[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.060]
It's worth it

[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.140]
A mom named Tammy through it

[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.840]
Not mean to do it

[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.980]
179 votes, which religious nut you hate the most

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.980]
And you just heard his voice, George W. Bush, whose famous line

[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.240]
Well, the book is, will live for all time

[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.380]
74 votes, Louis Veracon 23 is not going to catch the Bushmeister

[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.240]
Here you go, pick it on those dark folks again

[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.700]
Here you fall about 20

[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.800]
Pat Robertson's only got 17 in spite of his call or assessment

[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.880]
Hugo Chavez

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.440]
Jesse Jackson 11

[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.780]
There you go, pick it on

[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.920]
Al Sharpton 8

[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.540]
There you go

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.740]
Jimmy Swagrid 8 James Dobson 7

[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.760]
From Hocus Pocus Focus on your family

[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.720]
The Pope 7, he got my vote

[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.120]
Dr. D. James Kennedy III

[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.440]
From the Courage Presbyterian Church of Hating Anti-Semitism

[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.680]
And none of them, I'm religious nut one

[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.320]
We got one religious nut out there, okay?

[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.580]
Who's going, little little and I'm sure I know who that is

[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.600]
And anyway, speaking of that, at any rate, conservative religious broadcaster

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.160]
And we better talk fast, George, because we got a ballgame

[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.820]
Pregame of one way, Marlon's on deck, Rondon's at the Brewer's

[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.640]
They lost in the Lockheed again last night, 6 to 4

[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.500]
Am I right, Josh?

[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.060]
That's right

[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.000]
That's not good

[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.680]
No, it's not

[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.560]
And I'm going to tell you, do you think that Ira Winderman is boring?

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.140]
Mike Buradino makes under Ira Winderman seem like a Mexican jumping bean and heat

[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.320]
That's how terminal he is

[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.900]
Oh my God, that 8 to 9 hour, you're welcome Joe Rose, by the way, we handed right over to you

[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.880]
Here, just put it on a silver platter

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.580]
I'm a handy and tariff sports audience, the sports nerd audience right over to Joe

[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.940]
In fact, that's the ticket

[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:11.540]
8 to 9 hour, I mean, this clearance and anybody else who participated in that madness

[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.100]
Oh my goodness, I don't want to start, you know, giving my opinion about anything

[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.160]
What do you know?

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.880]
For that is will

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.080]
Well, that's because I got a chance to hear a little bit of that this morning

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.580]
Which I hear every now and then when like kids are out of school, like they are right now

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.980]
And so George comes in a little bit later than usual, so I get to your Hank where this morning Jodie and her is oh my goodness

[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.840]
Wow, maybe I did say that, and he's just a liar, you're a crazy person and there's two million

[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.540]
Lemons following this maniac sending them their money

[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.700]
Well, you know, that diamond mine thing didn't work out real well in Africa

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.000]
And then the gold mining in Liberia didn't work out well with his buddy Charles Taylor

[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.960]
So he's got to make the big bucks from these two million old coots out there, the old coots

[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.840]
Conservative religious broadcaster Pat Robertson apologized for calling for the assassination of

[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.160]
The wait on President Hugo Chavez during Monday's broadcast of a 700 club program

[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.140]
Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I apologize for that statement

[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.060]
He said in a written statement earlier here's the best part earlier Robertson

[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.540]
Of course, we've all you saw the clip right? Yeah, yeah, how many times we all see you?

[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:44.540]
About first meeting on the radio earlier Robertson said as remarks about Chavez were taken out a contest that he never called for the killing of the Latin American leader

[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:51.420]
I didn't say assassination. I said our special forces should take him out and take him out can be a number of things including kidnapping

[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.440]
There were a number of ways to take out a dictator from power besides killing him

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.720]
I was misinterpreted by the associated press but that happens all the time Robertson said on the 700 club

[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.860]
And then of course, we've all seen the clip and then he had a later retract because somebody said hey, they're all sorry

[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.460]
He said oh

[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.260]
Here's the exact quote if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him

[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.260]
I think we really ought to go ahead and do it do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war

[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.100]
Assasinate that was the war we ought to go into we have the ability to take him out

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.920]
And I think that the time has come that we exercise that ability Robertson said

[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.720]
We don't need another $200 billion dollar warranty we're the one strong armed dictator

[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.780]
It's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with

[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.320]
Take him out assassinate maybe that's taken out to dinner

[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:43.160]
Yeah, take him out for a meal, take him out of the ice bath and a hot shower and then shave it and then slit his throat

[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.220]
Man, so the poll today is what religious nut you hate the most

[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.960]
Hate the most nuts so why we're doing it because he's crazy and there are a lot of you know the whole religious thing just

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.800]
It's the bane of my existence the fact that there are so many including a lot of youth folks out there

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.740]
I know you can't help it because you were brainwashed very very thoroughly and very well by your parents when you were young

[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.740]
And by the religion off these so you just can't help yourself because they took away that party of brain

[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.760]
Which allows you to realize what a pile of crap at all isn't a bunch of manmade BS because basically people are afraid to die

[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.740]
They're afraid to say I'm dying out there

[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.620]
And so therefore whether it's the Muslims or the Jews or the goyam or whoever it is

[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.620]
Oh yeah, you're gonna like live in heaven you're gonna be up there with God

[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.620]
You're gonna be up there with a virgin's yeah right you're gonna be riding in a box and that's it

[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.740]
So enjoy yourself right now and cut the crap and stuff acting like some kind of

[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:38.000]
Most people are emotional cripples you know oh yeah in fact I'm thinking of somebody who was in there this morning

[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.440]
Who's a nice guy but he's a fair emotional cripple I was thinking about him when I was shaving this morning

[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.840]
Fendon I don't want to go into the details when I was thinking about but just emotional cripple you know

[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.560]
Sorry I had the volume up on the TV

[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.960]
Fendon is well in present in Hugo Chavez popular with the poor at home offered yesterday

[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.900]
The two day they helped media Americans with cheap supplies of gas

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.900]
We want to sell gasoline the heating fuel directly to poor communities in the US they popularly told reporters to be in the visit to communist run Cuba

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.700]
Chavez didn't say how Venezuela would go about providing gasoline to poor communities

[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.200]
Venezuela's women's state oil company PDVSA owned SITCO which has 14,000 gas stations in the USA

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.920]
And I guarantee that Pat Robertson ain't sticking O SITCO gas in his thing

[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.080]
The offer may sound attracted to Americans feeling pinched by soaring prices at the pump

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.980]
But not to the US government which sees Chavez as a left-wing problem make a relied America

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.800]
Let's take him out

[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.280]
Gasoline is cheaper than mineral water and oil producing Venezuela where consumers can fill their tanks for less than two bucks

[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.200]
Your paying almost three bucks a gallon and they can fill a whole tank for less than two bucks

[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:44.920]
Average gas prices have risen to 261 a gallon in the US that's for like regular like low-test for like half water down

[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:52.620]
Chavez said Venezuela could supply gasoline to Americans that have to price they now pay if intermediaries who speculated and exploited consumers were cut out

[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.640]
Venezuela supplies Cuba with generously financed oil and plants to help Caribbean nations put their oil bills

[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:04.300]
Chavez and Cuba to attend the graduation of Cuban trained doctors from 28 countries was seen off at the airport by Cuban President Fidel Castro

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.460]
Washington accused the two leaders of being a destabilizing influence in South America so we better take him both out

[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.960]
Chavez and Castro offered to give poor mayor hands free healthcare and trained doctors free of charge

[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.560]
All of those terrible things

[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:23.120]
Now guess who were the first ones to sign on to Venezuela's oil plan for the Caribbean after Fidel of course

[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.540]
Of course, let me give you a clue mine Chavez

[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:32.140]
Jamaica became the first Caribbean nation to finalize an agreement with NFW on a new plan for the South American nation

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.820]
Is to fly all the countries throughout the region under below market terms

[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:42.120]
Prime Minister PJ Carlisimo of PJ Patterson emerged from a private meeting with Venezuela and President Hugo Chavez

[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:51.120]
Laitu's data were now to details of Jamaica's participation in the Petro Caribe initiative a plan to offer oil at flexible terms to 13 Caribbean nations

[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:59.480]
Under the agreement with Jamaica then is available to provide oil at a discounted rate of $40 a barrel compared with a more than 60 to about 66

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.100]
That now cost on the world market

[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.800]
How do you like that?

[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.880]
So we've been told Jamaicans mine they're getting a good deal and here we are getting the short end of the shoot

[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.980]
How about that?

[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.840]
Yeah, we're getting the long end of it. I don't want to take it where we're getting it.

[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.580]
Raccoon. That's where we're getting it. Thank you again, Mr. President, before I forget for those low bargain basement gas prices

[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:22.860]
If we could find that pump that called that data was like, you know, back during the campaign last year for the presidential election

[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.620]
Or was it maybe it was longer ago than that? Maybe it was right after the Iraq attack

[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.180]
Right. The illegal amount of radius and butchress and slaughtering a rack attack based on a pile of lies

[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.620]
I think it was right back then and it pumped calls in. Oh, thank you Mr. President for those low-gates assuming of course that we're going to stick our

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:47.240]
Here up there was to the oil refineries and Iraq yeah, surprise even their standing online for two three hours to get gas in Iraq

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.440]
Because of the fact it's all screwed up and because the insurgents keep like setting the pipelines on fire all of these minor things

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.980]
We've got to fight them terrorists because the country's in the chaos

[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.080]
27 after 10 so we got to Marlon pregame in one no more today what a good break he catches

[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:07.300]
It looks like the eye of the storm is right off of his house as a matter of fact right by his place and you want to know why because God is

[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.380]
P.O. to certain people

Marlon's at the brewer is a 205 pregame at 130 thank the Lord Curtis Stevenson follows the baseball game

[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.700]

[00:25:51.900 --> 00:26:00.960]
You know when a history of the human race is written they'll discover that the USA had impeachment proceedings against the president for lying about his sexual

[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:09.460]
And we got a president who's got more blood on his hands than Carter's got pills and but it would put about in life goes on it's worth it

[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:16.540]
It's well worth it because you know this peanut business the project for new American centuries certainly anybody out there with an IQ larger than their thumbnail

[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:23.080]
You got like read up on it a little bit I know we've been talking about that for years but maybe right now you'd find out that long before there was any 9-11

[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.940]
They already had all these plans to do all these things they be a party yeah

[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.900]
And of course one of the things that they said in order to get the public to go along with their plans would be to have kind of like a pro harbor like catastrophe

[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.220]
Yeah you know me like 9-11 do you have a book oh my god

[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.060]
Wow and then you rate probably take a call or two today and I'm sure that we're not going to get dead you

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:49.260]
We're going to get dead you with rain in fact I'm looking at that Doppler radar right now and it's looking like blobby baby

[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:57.820]
Bobby said it's looking blobby all along the east coast look at that another reason not to be in that tropical swamp big blob up there by

[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.500]
Um, Pomano Beach like there's a big blob right over the racetrack right now

[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.880]
Now I guess it would be a bad taste to say who it might be because he's no longer with us but nevertheless you know I'm saying what he said

[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.180]
My big blob friend that used to be at Pomano Park all the time oh yeah that would be said miss him already good guy

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.360]
Big blob over Miami and where you are there's it's it's coming it's coming

[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.540]
It's really and sooner rather than later I want to just repeat that again because this business about well overnight

[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:33.140]
I'm starting ready for like some stuff like 0-4 5 6 o'clock this afternoon I mean what the hell could I possibly know sitting up here looking out the window with that beautiful sunshine

And about 72 degrees right now what could I possibly know that any Q.A.M. Hello

[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.820]
Q.A.M.

[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:47.380]
Hi Neil yes sir you know after the first attack on most trade center in 93 they had threatened to come back

[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:55.740]
We were too busy with teen escape to keep up with these update so that's why just said how many Q.A.M. Hello

[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.740]
Hey, it's on Pally.

[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:07.680]
Okay, Pally what's up two things we're all like on a technology cutting edge here but if they would have had this technology back in the 50s and 60s and things

[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:17.680]
It's just all relative Neil I'm in a farming related industry and this is going to whatever happens is going to go back into the Gulf reform and produce nationwide to distributors

[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:24.420]
And you know they're on pins and needles trying to make sure they're going to have product and they don't even know if they're going to have product

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:31.100]
But everybody has this top of the radar now it's just amazing and yeah that's 10 years old I have a friend in the military

[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:39.160]
He says they every 10 years are released up to the they had this 10 years ago in the government but we have this technology now thanks for taking a call

[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:45.000]
Okay, I have a great tip. I like that they had it 10 years ago but in the meantime but it'd be a bit of a bit about well they do whatever they want you know

[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:56.120]
Your government lies they cheat they steal they rape you they take your they take your money they take your property with that eminent domain crev whatever they want they just go ahead and do it

[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:12.520]
And you're like powerless and if you want to speak out now what's a part of time it could speak out and if you speak out now like Cindy she and then they shmere you man it's new shmere game they shmere and they dump all over you and then they immediately bring out a bunch of other like like the you know the carry shmere job they did what is what do they call that group the

[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:24.500]
The vote veterans vote for bison right wing liar yeah, they're almost as honest as Pat Robertson but not quite oh he didn't say anything about assassinate line nine it's always good for a hoot Q.a.m. Hello

[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.240]
Like I said line nine I think we ought to like take off the phone don't you?

[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.680]
Uh-huh, that's probably a good idea. Just just mention it in passing. Somebody Q.a.m. Hello. It's my birthday.

[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.900]
Well what a shame huh I know there was some other reason beside the storm to hold your head down being great this may w.a.m. Hello.

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.640]
Like I said there gonna be a lot of good calls today because these people today are saying one thing basically I have no right.

[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.600]
The first couple were all right like human being first kind of repeated back to me when I just got to your saying w.a.m. Hello.

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.940]
Hey you think of me rough between this will come faster.

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:11.340]
Oh I'll get out and try. Yeah I think I'm hitting that. Now I'm not I'm sorry man but I want to have penny nants in your pants.

[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:18.260]
Yeah you better watch it you're going to get penny from heaven two or three anyway. So I'm looking at that top of a radar and looking at Hollywood.

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:25.260]
I bet you lay tub and Hollywood is going to be doing much of a business today and they're probably relieved about it because it seems like they don't want to be doing a lot of business.

[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.920]
You know what? Get the trying to get all those people to go over there be those rave reviews about.

[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.260]
And then we got those facts and just dump it all over them which they ought to be pleased about that.

[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.360]
They ought to be very happy because they don't want to like too much business.

[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.480]
Did we ever fight out if they're still making those cheaper goods or never did?

[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.820]
No I'll be damned. So swim over there today and they'll fight out for us.

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.800]

[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:23.280]
Yeah. Well you got lucky on Monday man with a pregame show at 12 30 and just to show that they don't want to overdo it for you.

[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:33.860]
They pregame tomorrow is at 12 145. So you only get a 15 minute reprieve and that clarity is to me well you know with all the stuff of course he was only he was winking at George but I think he had other things in mind when he was winking at you.

[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:41.020]
But oh yeah how about doing a show tomorrow in the oil you know the fact I'll be here nice and dry and out of the harm's way etc.

[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.400]
And some of you people won't you know you have to like swim to work and I said to bad.

[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:53.740]
Yeah I said the answer is no yeah as lovely as I could and he just kept winking at George which got to a little bit unsettled.

[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.360]
I'm sorry Pauling. Get ready for the wildest girls gone wild ever.

[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.760]
It's girls gone wild about girls gone wild.

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.840]
Hey baby.

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.440]
I'm not going to teach you to treat us like sex objects.

[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.340]
You've never seen a girls gone wild what T-shirt contest like this.

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.980]
I'm going to spray you with his own and I'm going to spray you with bullets.

[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.800]
Nothing makes girls go wild quite like the whole idea behind girls gone wild.

[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.240]
Hey let's do some hot girl on girl action.

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.640]
We're not your girl on girl action.

[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.240]
Try it.

[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:37.700]
To order girls gone wild about girls gone wild to go 1-800-show a shirt.

[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.060]
Show us your one.

[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.440]
10.45 at 5.60.

[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.420]
Is that what you're about to say?

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.760]
Yes. Something like that.

[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.400]
I got to 11 o'clock advisory.

[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.580]
See I'm on top of this stuff you know like always.

[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.400]
How many of these things have we been through already?

[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.560]
About 30,000.

[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.780]
About 30,000 of these hurricanes.

[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.340]
Another reason to get that out of South Florida while you're still alive.

[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.800]
Okay while you still have a chance while you still have your life, life and limb and whatever.

[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:02.960]
Right? Right.

[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.240]
Contrary to gradually strengthening is it moved slowly westward across the Florida straights towards South East Florida?

[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:08.960]
Oh my God.

[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.960]
A hurricane warning remains in effect for the South East Florida coast from Peril Beach, South Florida, Florida city including Lake Okeechobee.

[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.780]
A tropical storm warning remains in effect for the Grand Bahama Island, Bimini and the Berry Islands in the Northwest Bahamas.

[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.640]
The warning has been discontinued for the remainder of the Northwest Bahamas.

[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.900]
So you want to swim out there and check the casinos out.

[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.580]
The hotel's there or at any rate.

[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.400]
A tropical I don't want to talk about the Bahamas.

[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.980]
Everything smells like wet dog.

[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:46.540]
A tropical storm watch remains in effect for the East Central Florida coast from North of Eero Beach, Northward to Titusville including Allermar at Island and for the middle and upper Florida Keys from the west end of the seven mile bridge northward to the south of Florida city.

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.240]
A tropical storm watch also is in effect for the Florida West coast from Florida City to Anglewood including Florida Bay.

[00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:03.560]
And 11 o'clock this morning the center of tropical storm Katrina was located near latitude 26.2 north longitude 79.3 west or about 55 miles east of Fort Lauderdale.

[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.240]
Oh my God.

[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.880]
Katrina is moving toward the west near six miles an hour.

[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.900]
It's slowed down a little bit but it's still creeping along.

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.820]
This general motion is expected to continue with some decrease in forward speed during the next 24 hours.

[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.480]
So there you go Chad Fort Myers.

[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.380]
See he's the one that's telling us all it's going to be sooner rather than later.

[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:24.820]
It's slowing down which is not good because the slower it goes the more rain is going to drop.

[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.040]
Right. Don't like that.

[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.500]
On this track, and this is from the National Weather Service.

[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.080]
So I trust them more than I trust any Jackass on CNN, any line, second crap.

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.620]
Chad Fort Myers or Scott Miles or Brian or that simple bubblehead, so they dad.

[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.060]
Oh my God.

[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.320]
On this track the center should be near or over the southeast Florida coast later tonight early Friday morning.

[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.860]
So I apologize for being influenced by this Jackass on the run CNN.

[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.720]
Whatever they tell you is a pack of lies.

[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.740]
They suck.

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.800]
We do like Susan Candy out the other net.

[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.020]
If it's like a H bomb fell on CNN and took them all out.

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.620]
Yeah, when it doubt take them out, right?

[00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.160]
Right.

[00:34:59.380 --> 00:34:59.500]
No.

[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.000]
We would have a party we'd celebrate.

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.960]
Tropical storm force wind extend outward to 70 miles from the center automated observing station at settlement point in the Grand Bahama Island.

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.360]
Recently reported to stay winds of 33 miles an hour.

[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.580]
Well, whoopie do.

[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.380]
Huh? What's the big stimulus with that?

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.880]
Right? 33 miles an hour? I didn't have to shake a coconut.

[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.840]
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 millibars.

[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:30.100]
Storm surge flooding of two to four feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected near into the north of where the center makes landfall in Florida.

[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.480]
Storm surge flooding of two to four feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves.

[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.680]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.220]
You can also be expecting areas of unsure winds and the Bahamas.

[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.080]
Storm surge values will gradually decrease in the Bahamas later today.

[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:52.640]
As this thing blows by due to its slow forward speed, Katrina's expected to produce a significant heavy rainfall of end over the northwest Bahamas and South Florida.

[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.400]
Total rainfall accumulations of six to 10 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible.

[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.100]
I saluted tornadoes are possible over southern Florida and the Florida Keys.

[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:02.600]
Oh my god.

[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:09.520]
Repeating the 11 a.m. position 26.2 north 79.3 west movement near west near six miles an hour and etc.

[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.580]
Next one is at let's see one o'clock the next advisor.

[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.260]
Well we'll be right on top of that hot like stink on Greg will be right on it.

[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.580]
Won't we?

[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.300]
Yeah let that WQA in. Hello.

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.420]
Hello.

[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.240]
Yes sir.

[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.020]
Is it Neil?

[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.840]
Yeah. Hey Neil what's up buddy? It's Brooklyn Joe.

[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.540]
Oh yeah how you doing Brooklyn Joe?

[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:34.960]
Good I was just over by popping out down I was driving on power line and so I got that bad over there.

[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.280]
Now it's the rain and so what's the big simmous right?

[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.780]
Yeah what the hell is the big deal I love this.

[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.000]
I can't weather anyway.

[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.600]
Yeah there you go it's good day to go outside and stand hold on to something electrical.

[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.040]
Good idea grab some of those power wires right?

[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.320]
Do it.

[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.560]
Just do it.

[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.280]
Put you out of your misery.

[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.160]
Oh speaking of misery Doug Thompson from the Iran he's the founder and publisher of that fantastic website.

[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.260]
Capital Hill Blue that is Georgia's favorite.

[00:36:59.700 --> 00:36:59.800]
Yes.

[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.540]
Vets and the power that a great column was on our website.

[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.480]
I believe that we put it on for today Josh.

[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:04.980]
Yes.

[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.280]
Vets and the coward.

[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.940]
It's short it's right to the point.

[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.360]
He doesn't he doesn't pull any punches man OBS.

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.080]
In fact this is a Vap B.S.

[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.740]
The man who dishonored American veterans by hiding out from the Vietnam War in Texas National Guard

[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:22.340]
and added an insult to injury this week by shamelessly invoking memories of those who died in war as a pathetic excuse

[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.780]
to continue his illegal and failed war in Iraq.

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.940]
Bush's lame attempt so disgusted veterans attending the VFW annual convention in Salt Lake City

[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.280]
that many of them wore B.S. Protector Earmuffs during his speech to the group on Monday.

[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.720]
Oh get your B.S. Protector Earmuffs out.

[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.020]
Especially if you have a meeting at QAM.

[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:45.360]
Memo to the dimwood now living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when the vets who actually fought for their country stop buying your bullshmit

[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.160]
you're in a lot of trouble.

[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.680]
Truth is veterans especially those who served in Vietnam have long this thrusted W.

[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.940]
They know he hit out from the war using his daddy's connections to get bumped to the head of the line to get into the Texas Air National Guard to avoid serving in Southeast Asia.

[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:04.880]
They've seen the enlistment documents where he opted out of overseas service and extra step to make sure he stayed state side during the war.

[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.740]
Real veterans can smell a coward and Bush stinks like a dead rotting carcass yellow through and through a cardboard.

[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.760]
Yellow through and through a cardboard cowboy who can sign an executive order sending American men and women to their deaths in Iraq

[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.380]
but one who didn't have the courage to stand up and fight for his country when he had a chance.

[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:29.540]
Many vets joined in the patriotic fervor that followed the 9-11 terrorist attacks and supported our military actions in Afghanistan to try to bring out kind of leader or some of in London justice.

[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.360]
Some back the invasive Iraq choosing to leave Bush's justification for war.

[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.160]
Justifications that turned out to be manufactured evidence in outright lies.

[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:43.680]
Now more and more vets he bushed for what he is a lying, sniveling coward who doesn't deserve to be called Commander in Chief.

[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:53.320]
They see a man who sent Americans to die in a war based on false pretenses and now has the goal to try to invoke the memories of real heroes to try and rationalize his illegality immorality and cowardice.

[00:38:53.460 --> 00:39:00.680]
They don't fight. Why should they? They served their country in a war. He didn't. He had out like a spoiled little rich kid afraid to stand up and face the enemy.

[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:09.540]
Ironically and sadly the coward who used the National Guard to avoid servicing conflict is now the president who sends to reserve and guard units to fight and die in his own dirty little war.

[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:17.400]
Veterans know Bush sold out this nation its honor and dignity by invading a country that posed no immediate threat to this nation and waiting for war that didn't need to be fought.

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:26.540]
They know the blood of more than 1800 Americans 1874 by the way. More than 1800 Americans forever stains the hands of a coward named Bush and every fool who supports him in his war.

[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:33.800]
They also see Bush as the president who cut their benefits, reduced their cost of living allowances and sent troops into battle without proper equipment armor or safeguards.

[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:39.160]
The veterans who served their country have no use for someone who did not. They have no use for George W. Bush.

[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.440]
But he like that. There was a message from Mark. That's right. That's the accurate percentage by the way.

[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:59.180]
Hugo Chavez not only has he got a 70% approval rating but he got 70% of votes in the election and then the best part of that is that the right wingers are saying, oh yeah but that was a fixed election and believe you me if anybody knows about fixed elections they're the ones.

[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:05.280]
They're the expert. They had the expertise. God forbid we should have our effects of fixed election in the USA.

[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:14.120]
Mark says today George Bush is approval rating is 46%. I saw 38% the poll we had on there the other day. Wasn't it Josh? 38% I don't remember.

[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:23.440]
Yes. Through approval through approval of all seven as well. I hear what Chavez at 70%. Anyway we can make a train. We'll even throw in Dick Taney and Proud Alise of the sweet and the deal.

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:32.360]
I say it sounds like a maximum heaven and get those low gas prices too. What do you say? Let's get to know Chavez in their right away or at least Caesar Chavez. You get some cheap letters.

[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:43.580]
What? Oh look at that. The statement Robertson says quote is it right to call for assassination? No. I apologize for that statement. I spoke in frustration. I am palindian. I can ask you.

[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:55.340]
How come they have all these silly broads on here reading the news? It's embarrassing. She got about as much credibility especially since he married that Lardas hill pop and right wing hypocritical phony that doctor shopping piece of third.

[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:03.900]
They're in Kagan my ass. So you got to 11 o'clock advice. We had a lot of rain and a little bit of wind and 33 miles an hour that won a gusty.

[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.960]
What was it in somewhere in the Bahamas and of course guys trying to blow them off the face of the map and I don't blame him. You know what I said?

[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:15.020]
What do you say? In fact if he was smart he would take. I think they're about to like Pat Robertson says when it does just take him out.

[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:23.200]
And starting October 1st it's already the 25th of August. Let's hear it. Man October 1st when it does take him out and Florida.

[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:30.680]
Another good reason not to be in that damn state. Oh man. You look at somebody cross side or like. Give him a look that they don't appreciate.

[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:39.760]
You can't just blow your crap away in your fat ass governor says nice job well done. Crazy. Oh speaking of the war and and right wingers.

[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:54.140]
The crusty American Legion you think the VFW are a bunch of old toads. The American Legion which has 2.7 million members has declared war on anti-war protesters and the media could be next speaking at its natural convention in Honolulu.

[00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:04.840]
Which why by the way was the first state just passed a bill to put in gas cap prices. Good. A cap on gas not not on your gas cap but a cap on gas.

[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:13.120]
I'll know who the hell can afford to live there anyway. If you can afford to live in a while you don't need a gap a cap on gas prices. I mean it just cost to arm and 10 legs.

[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:21.760]
Anyway speaking at its national convention in Honolulu the group's national commander of the American Legion called for an end to all public protests and media events against the war even though they're protected by the bill.

[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:31.960]
Whoever heard a such business these are supposedly the self-proclaimed papiates. Yeah the American Nazis. Yeah all end to all protests. Now there were just goose step a lot out of you.

[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:38.720]
The American Legion will stand against anyone in any group that would demoralize our troops at worsen to see that's always the excuse.

[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:44.740]
All if you're against the war you demoralizing the troops right. Maybe that's why 58,000 kids came home and body bags and be at nom.

[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.180]
Or worse endangered their lives by encouraging terrorists to continue their cowardly attacks against freedom-loving peoples.

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:43:01.340]
Thomas Cattamus National Commander told delegates of the groups National Convention in Honolulu the delegates voted to use whatever means necessary to ensure the united backing of the American people to support our troops and the global war on terrorism.

[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:10.880]
They'll take whatever steps are necessary when it does. Maybe they'll take you out if you like protests. Now pile a crap bunch of seen-out old coups with us so he asked caps they were.

[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:23.060]
Does that the American Legion of the VFW were both? I think they both were. They both got their own head gear. See it's the battle of the head gear again like I've always told you. 1057. Well that just seems like this show is going to end like real early like about one 30 a day.

[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:29.560]
That's a huge. I make it pardon? I said it was. It'll be one 30 before you know it. Before you can say.

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:36.220]
I'm dying of it. This is the neo-Rodger show. This is your brain.

[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.180]
Any questions?

[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:49.560]
I feel some man that I can't refrain. Oh my. Let's go eat up.

[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.320]
I'm going to be a man. Get a dagger now.

[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:36.900]
Screw you. Me, head jager. You had better shut up fast.

[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:45.160]
If you don't all have to open a big old channel whoopass.

[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.320]
Hey, Jenny, have me that whoopass can't open her.

[00:44:52.760 --> 00:45:00.120]
The stone holds iron on my side. No they ain't.

[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:14.200]
They say that they don't like not born policy.

[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:25.320]
Hey, I don't know Jack. I think very smoke and crack. And they best not be talking smack.

[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.100]
I bet me. Hey, hey. Did you see that? I'm not.

[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:36.060]
I'm just a three for the price of one. I figured they're all like in the same same vein. So why not like bunch them together right when it doubt lump them out?

[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:42.600]
Absolutely. It's undoubtedly. So I'm looking at the short term the short range loop right now. The radar.

[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:51.980]
Yeah. And that that Chad Fort Myers, whatever it is, name is on CNN. I went over to MSNBC because CNN is just a floor crap.

[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:58.520]
He's about as accurate as he wasn't at Air France yet that over and the runway of Pearson. He hasn't got any idea what he's talking about.

[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:09.480]
What is sure to be a wet system removing billions of gallons of water in order to create more space just in case we get those forecasted five to ten inches with that possible ten inches of maximum.

[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:19.120]
See, I think that there's a great slogan in my put them on a map because that read a cosmic bitch. He sure ain't going to do it. If you want the MS to an into MSNBC not good, not good.

[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:25.020]
So I think I'd be there for a mountain guy man. I'd be in charge of I couldn't do any worse than they're doing already. How many viewers they got?

[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:34.280]
About 30 man. I'm not every cable assistant in the world. I got about 30 people watching pretty sad for the MS to an into MSNBC. And then of course, then you see some of the people they have on the other line.

[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:43.940]
But at least it's a catchy slogan. The eye looks like it's due east of the door. I was going to say vocal, but that would be stretching a little bit. I would say more like a dear field pompano.

[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:58.760]
But it doesn't look to me like it's going south. See is it's spinning around, but it is moving very slowly so we could in fact, I can assure that the weather for he's got his very well used finger all sharpened up and is moving that thing right into your backyard wherever you are.

[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:07.140]
If you're in homestead or if you're in for a lot of day or if you're like in Jupiter, he's moving that thing right in your direction. He's going to move that finger right in.

[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:16.260]
Slide your way. I was going to say your rein is for the whole day. You can't say that. Sorry about that penny and Joyce. That joy she did one hell of a job.

[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:27.140]
Not you're in any of choice. You're a simple demand. I'm going to tell you one thing. She's taken a beastlies down that joy. Nice going sweetheart. You are incompetent. You are useless. I'm starting to roof for the other side.

[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:39.360]
Anyway, there's what you got right now. In fact, if you want to go to Sun Centrel's got a pretty good thing on there. Although quite frankly, I went to the National Weather Service radar and the short range loop put that thing in motion, baby. Click on the loop.

[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:49.940]
It walks the loop to loop and see the dark yellow is out there to the real bright yellows. Right now it's just like I looked at guy said. So what's your rein in as if that's an novelty in South Florida the summertime. Right?

[00:47:49.940 --> 00:48:07.660]
And mosquitoes are as big as bowling balls, but other than that, everything is just fine. Am I correct? Oh, we're fine, but billionaire television producer John DeMal behind the Pioneer Show Big Brother will test the limits of reality TV with a program in which a woman searches for a potential sperm donor to conceive a child.

[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:27.760]
His new tea those ducks man, they are such a much of perverts. You know, any excuse to put anything sexual on here. I love anything dealing with drugs and sex and drugs perverts can't wait to go back. It's okay. It's not what it used to be too many bizarre people are now too many people from Algeria and Morocco. I don't want to like single them out, but I will his new TV station,

[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:40.300]
and in Tampa launched earlier this month confirmed a little error program called I want your child and nothing else. I bet your watch's name Edmund on guiding light will be proud of that. Is he really going to get what's your name's baby. I just can't keep the name was there.

[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:52.660]
I want your child and nothing else, but give no further details about the show do at 18 30 GMT on Wednesday or 18 30.

[00:48:53.500 --> 00:49:00.600]
Greenwich mean time. What is that? Tell us. That's about I don't know what it is 130 330.

[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:14.420]
You ought to know these things the Brits are Greenwich mean time. I think it's an hour behind the Brits and the Brits are like five hours ahead of us. Who knows. The plan is that we visit potential donors and of course on camera decide which man is most suitable.

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:21.140]
The 30 year old woman will feature in the program said an interview with the telegraph newspaper. Well, that's the that's paper.

[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:33.820]
Check out their website if you want the weather find out how many hours it is going to be raining before you go there. Afterwards there will be artificial insemination said the woman was identified only as yesica not Jessica, but yesica as in.

[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:43.980]
How do you go like that? Oh my God. I got a. Where is it? I got a perfect dropping for that from your close personal friend is probably going to get blown blown away. Where is it?

[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:58.340]
Those of us. Yeah, boys and one is a nosey. Yes, and he got one doing that. Yeah, he does. There are there. Oh, here it is. Yes, the boss. He is the best at moment. He's going to drown in this hurricane and this storm.

[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:11.660]
Anyway, the show is a one off competing with four other reality. What does that mean? A one off competing with four other reality TV programs, one of which follows five former prostitutes starting a cafe. The program.

[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:24.580]
Oh, I see the program receiving most votes from viewers on Saturday after all these shows have been turned into a series. But it is just amazing. The telegraph also published an email address from and wanting to donate sperm to yesica.

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:37.200]
Well, of course, it was just fine. Yes, if you put it on our website, we may have some of our listeners out there wanting to donate something. All read across be live and direct gets exclusive prison to our video of Andrews sleuth.

[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:51.880]
At the time, we said you know, can we be sure to miss that tonight on MSNBC? If you want the MS, be sure to avoid MSNBC. And then by all means avoid CNN, the Nazi network. They are. I'm not going to call it certainly not news. It's definitely the NN stands for Nazi network.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:51:00.540]
But a bunch of suck ups. I want to say it again that that crap they had on Sunday nights, supposedly that probing, you know, they're actually having the gold and

[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:16.120]
question the president and the illegal war that was that was such a wishy washy half baked piece of turd man exactly what you'd expect from the suck ups at CNN. You people blow man, you're pathetic. You're embarrassing. I'm going with MSNBC from now on from here on out.

[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:24.600]
You stick with CNN there and I'm sticking with MSNBC because I like the amus. I don't like MS broadcasting. But I do like M the M's. You know, kind of a Jews.

[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:34.780]
Thailand's prime minister is trying to fear it out a government minister who allegedly had a penis enlargement procedure saying news of it is affecting the cabinet's reputation. A news report said yesterday.

[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:45.800]
Who did it tell me the prime minister told his ministers had a two day cabinet meeting triggering around a banter and causing some to squirm in their chairs. The nation in newspaper be saying who done it?

[00:51:45.800 --> 00:52:00.740]
Last week a woman being sued for defamation by a clinic after she claimed it gave her a face disfiguring silicon injection said a cabinet member had received a penis enlargement injection at the same clinic and urged him to come forward as a witness in her defense. I wonder if he had a penis disfiguring injection.

[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:11.920]
I only want to find out I guess go figure calling on the official through reporters on the steps of government house on today. The woman said the problem of my face is bigger than the problem of your penis.

[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:21.020]
This is affected the reputation of the cabinet because I wonder if they know Joseph Gaki. This is affected the reputation of the cabinet because the news went around the world.

[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:32.060]
I don't want people to think that cabinet members are obsessed with this kind of thing. The newspaper quoted the prime minister is telling his ministers speaking to reporters after the meeting the agriculture minister said no one admitted to the enlargement procedure.

[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:41.020]
Other ministers joke about various suggestions on how he can be identified. Oh, I can't imagine how can you. I don't know. Think about it.

[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:53.240]
I'm sure every now and then sharp as a marble. I'm on top of it. Don't forget we got to Marlon's another Marlon's have been to sharp less. They better win today or I'm saying how many games they got left about 45.

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:53:06.780]
Yeah, about that. I don't want to put you on the spot. Listen, you should know their record won and lost a percentage. How many games they are out of the wild card. You should be on top of this crap to have the wild card.

[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:17.000]
That's a piece of cake. They can do that in a nice weekend. Yeah, they could beat Milwaukee. Now let's see what are they about five and a half behind. Yeah, they always seem to lose to the crap teams when they expose.

[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:33.060]
Milwaukee's not that bad to sure. They're Milwaukee. Oh, give me a break. They're in the wild card race. They're in the wild card race. They're in the bottom of it. Too bad about the blue jays just when they were starting to make a little bit of a move. Now they're making a movement. You can second smell it all the way here. They were really on the move.

[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:45.140]
They went in Detroit. Now they like lose every day. Just when it looked like they might have a shot, but they know pretty good. They're like a mediocre 500 club. What's wrong with that? Pretty much. We'll settle with that. Anyway, let's not get too sports intensive.

[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.160]
Because next thing you know, we'll be talking about hockey. Okay. We're talking about not Chad.

[00:53:49.640 --> 00:54:02.480]
And four Myers, four Myers guy on the CNN, but Chad Kilder with the least for his week. What's he doing on that team? Huh? He's worse than we'd be like for years. Armstrong, four to homes that is always treated everybody like family. And they want to extend it off for the youth and join their family.

[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:15.080]

So what's not to like pick up the phone right now called David Richard 305 247 51 12 and be sure and tell me that fat boy told you to call.

[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.320]
This is a meal Roger.

But your sport whole update I'm how in a color.

[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:38.920]
After a year of being in debt, Ricky Williams bought his first bag of grippy today. Never mind that. You know the other day I broke 70 on the golf course.

[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.580]

Doctor. Doctor and speaking to doctors. Doctor tells this guy to join the health club to take some weight off. See. Yeah.

[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:08.340]
The guy losing twenty pounds in one week. How do you do that? The machine with this leg off the dump boom.

[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:17.080]
And now this breaking story about Ricky. You know what I say in a vacation and how to luller. Yeah. The hotel is so swanky.

[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.240]
Room service had an unlisted number.

[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:29.480]
I had a color. I just thought it two minutes ago. I'm Helen Keller. I was more sport home. The room in the joint was so small when I put the key and I broke the window.

[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:38.080]
What are you doing? I was tripping a book. I'm like their copy on fire.

[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:53.260]
Hey, buddy, you're looking at that. Helen Keller. What's up? Maddie? I got no sense of you.

How do you get there? You've got like 15, 20, 80 inches of rain. I can swim.

[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.460]
In fact, maybe you're stopping at late tub and bringing lunch for everybody on the way. I swim over from Cuba.

[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.880]
Swim over in the tub. Yeah, that's true. We came on a rubber ramp. The top of the top.

[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:51.280]
The children's club votes on the pool so far. And we don't really care about the pool all that much. Although now where did John Ascrock come from?

[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:58.280]
Oh, facts. I just came in. He made that. That's a good one. He may not be one of our favorites, but he sure can't sing.

Which religious nut do you hate the most? Hey George W. Bush 138. They hate Louis Fairecon 37 Jerry fallball.

But I don't have a lot of time to mess with that. Pull because I'm too busy on my Doppler radar man. You know what I'm saying? What do you say? Well, I'm busy checking it out. I want to stay on top of this thing so we can pretend like we know something that's going on.

[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:47.380]
There's my loop. I've got it in motion and it's I don't know. It's hard to tell really it's swirling around. I think the next time it makes you know that circular motion that these storms do next time it like swings around. That's going to tell you where that eye is going to hit.

[00:59:47.600 --> 01:00:01.960]
Keep your eye on the eye. WQ. I am. Hello. Q. I. M. I. Do okay. Did you see that your friend or Hank Goldberg? It'll help. Why would you find whatever you say? As a matter of fact, well, that makes three.

Yeah, I think that's right. It makes three. Well, yeah, I'm right. Well, at least he's consistent. Okay. The Patrick Valensweiler Broadcasting speaking of broadcasters. Robin Bertolucci has offered former WMAL Washington host Michael Graham who was fired from the ABC radio news talker after calling Islam a terrorist organization.

Yeah, I bet you are of the biggest ass. I'll tell you what, drop your doors and look in the mirror, man. You're it. WQ I am hello. How you doing?

[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:18.360]
I forget about the door is just looking the mirror. Pretty good. I did hear my word. The Roberto Lolanda frustration hearing. I beg your pardon? The Roberto Lolanda's arbitration came back. Yeah.

[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:28.980]
He was awarded 3.2 million for one year. And I think he didn't deserve even that. Why is that? Well, he hasn't he's been a good gold tender. He'd been having performed level or a bird or anyone else.

[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:48.340]
What are you talking about? What kind of defenses? You got to win. He doesn't matter. He's a gold tender. He's a gold tender.

[01:01:48.340 --> 01:02:00.880]
He's played brilliantly. He stood on his hand for two years. Let me ask you this. If he's not so good, how come he keeps showing up on Canada's Olympic team like again this time too? They picked him. Every time because he's not so good. You're quizzling. You silly.

[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:14.580]
You fair right. Didn't deserve 3.2. You're another one of these guys. They got more money than Carter's got pills. They got plenty of money left over under the cap. Show some appreciation. Show the guy you wanted to stick around. But instead what they'll do is chase him out of town now. Like anybody else who might be good.

[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:25.380]
And they'll continue having a horse ball organization. Yeah, let's bring back some of those other great gold tenders like damaged goods like Trevor. Are you kidding me kid? Somebody like that? What are you thinking about man?

[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:37.360]
Just I just do not for the life of me understand how strong Ford has got a hockey team. It makes no sense at all. It would be like Belarus having a hell of a stand. I just don't get it. Do you? No.

[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:43.260]
But you sure as hell don't and in fact you're living in the example of why there should not be a hockey team in South Florida.

[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:57.340]
Come and get away and hello to it. Hey you guys open today. And we can open today. Yeah. What can we do for you? This guy is falling. Yeah. WQAM. Hello. Hey. Yeah. It's raining outside. I'm going crazy.

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:16.320]
They're going to crazy. So they're going to call us. That's fine. We don't care. We're just here to kill another two hours and five minutes. Not that I'm counting you understand. Right. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm not to call because the guys are more on how can you say the rebuttal on the good going what

[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:24.240]
the difference that you have exactly. It may be how to really pour us the worst defense in league for two years and still stood on his head and kept them in a lot of games

[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:33.220]
where they either tighter got to win only thanks to him game after game. This guy wouldn't know hockey if for sure he would pop out of his ass. Yeah.

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:43.220]
Have one for your poll. Yeah. Billy Graham. Billy Graham an excellent choice and he's still alive. Unfortunately, he's still just barely hanging on. All right. New. We're all going to die. Be careful. Thank you.

[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:50.840]
I'm dying on the. Yeah. That's what he was trying to say. Well, these days are honest caller for you. We're all going to die. It's going around.

[01:03:51.900 --> 01:04:00.460]
Money hall turns 84 today. Good Canadian boy. Money hall. Let's make a deal. Money. He made millions and millions and then he got out of our face. You know, see, I like guys like that.

[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:12.300]
Regist 74. He's hanging on much too long and they keep trying to push him out and he doesn't want to go kicking and screaming just from that stupid. I show which we told you was a piece of crap show who wants to be a millionaire or the worst game shows ever.

[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:23.880]
Oh, it's getting good ratings. Let's put it on 18 days a week. You know, and of course, there went brutal. He turned 74 today. I think that Bob Barker and Regist, when you get to be an old coot, it's time to bail out. So see you.

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:05.780]
I'm not behind you, sir. Wondering allowed. Is it going to turn here? No. Maybe the next. No. There may be. No. You're going to cause a fine car.

[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:21.780]
Perhaps Mr. Guy who leaves his stupid lake around you are simply on a personal mission to drive around the entire globe slightly to the left. Apparently you don't notice anything.

[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:41.820]
You believe a left turn signal should be left on and your right turn signal feels so right. You'll never shut it off. And so we W Mr. Guy who leaves his stupid liquor on a real American hero.

[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:57.740]
Oh, you must be joining here. Nope. And don't forget starting October 1st in Florida. That's right. I was blinker idiots who have to blink around for like a mile and a half. They represent a threat to your safety.

[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:07.220]
You know what I'm saying? And as a result, ask governor says when in doubt take them out. Isn't that the new slogan of the right wingers when in doubt take them out to a passage on doing a good job in a right by the way.

[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:18.740]
Now here's the facts from somebody who obviously has good intentions is go to went telecast dot com. They've got the best and most accurate radar and storm tracker. I wish I already had been there, but I thought well, I'll just reach a check adjust to see if he's right and guess what I would say.

[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:35.980]
Now the best way to are for what I'm looking for here. The short range loop is the national weather service radar. Yeah. Don't you agree? Do the short range loop. I mean, it shows it out. You know, pretty well as far as you wanted to like Bahamas and whatever.

[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:51.400]
And there it is. And that's raining. And Casey had noticed it's raining over there. Well, here's the MSD MS not only Florida, but for the rest of the southeast as it makes its way across the peninsula and then eventually back up in two portions of the pan handle.

[01:06:51.620 --> 01:07:02.580]
It could be a long day. We'll be right here with you each and every half hour. Excellent. We want the MS from MSNBC. That's right. They are so pathetic, man. You know, you saw that really close big bitch. How can she? Yeah, I don't know.

[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:17.500]
Does she look good? No. Can she speak? No. Is she got a voice? Not a great voice. Does she got any voice? No. Is she penetrating? No. I don't want to get that. But I mean, what is that? What is it? So she was on Fox News right away because see, they don't understand one thing.

[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:28.440]
And that is that people are watching Fox for the other than O'Reilly, who's a phenomenon. You know, I'm TV now. Radio radio. Radio. We still got that point. Oh, but but other than that, they watch Fox.

[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:37.840]
Well, because it's Fox because it's a religion. It's not a news outlet. It's a religious channel. It's a right wing fundamentalist Bible thumping. We hate everybody channel. That's Fox News.

[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:49.540]
So whatever they got on there is got a number. I mean, if Greta's got a big number, what does that tell you? I mean, she is just I've had I've had bomb movements that were more attractive than Greta. She just wrote.

[01:07:50.500 --> 01:08:19.520]
She takes a picture that she's got a nasty. She sounds like the water Nazis. You got a nasty gravelly voice. I'm sorry, but these right wingers, man, he can't complain about their IQ or their taste because they have neither neither. They just idiots. That

[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:31.300]
are also opening a mark this in anticipation of the storm of making landfall somewhere in this area later today. Again, no one here is panicking. They are veterans of much bigger storm.

[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:45.400]
Oh, my God. They're watching it. Mostly again, they've turned about the flooding and residents here are just being asked to watch the news. Watch the weathercast. Yeah, once they know where the worst of the storm is hitting. And at what strength later today back to you. All right, Mark.

[01:08:45.400 --> 01:09:14.620]
I'm a part of reporting there. You can get the latest on tropical storm Katrina by logging on to our website at msnbc.com. Excellent. Get the MS from msnbc.com, baby. She's really ugly too. Yeah, that's fine. I'm not on television and was once upon a time. Boy, I'm still embarrassed about that thing. Thanks a lot, Marvin. You idiot. You quizzling. You simple. You you fairy. So I'm watching that thing. And like I said, it's just I don't know. I think perhaps it's some people are making a little bit more of this than need be like.

[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:42.880]
Like the weather hysterical people, the weather theories that their job. I mean, you know, I see that thing is swirling out there and it's got a lot of rain and big, semi big deal. 5 6 7 0 5 60 time. Maybe there's some other people out there who are like getting all like the other guy said he's a driving in pomp and a beach right now. His little rain coming down. And we're not talking about jagged. It tremendous winds here. We're not talking about the end of the world. We're not talking about trees being uprooted or you know, your dog being sent flying in outer space.

[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:55.860]
Just it's a storm. That's all. And maybe like a very, very mild bargain basement hurricane category. Well, a very weak category one at best by the time it hits you and blows you all away. You know, that's all.

[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:07.720]
We'll get all upset about it. I'm just sitting here very calm, cool and collected. Looking out my window, looking at the very sunny sky. What's the temperature in Toronto right now for a podcast? We know who I'm sure is listening. It's 22 Celsius 72 Fahrenheit.

[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:37.700]
Hey, hi today sunny and no clouds. No rain on sunny and 26. That's 79 last time. I said Fahrenheit. There's Eric Lindrosso. The maple leaves. Get with it. Eric. Okay. Cut the crap. Better wear a heavier helmet. 5 6 7. Let's get some hockey talk on here. Let's get Rimmer lined up for a hockey show. You notice how it's really interesting when I put these people on the spot because they're all like in bed together. So with guilty and he's popping. I was like, keep sucking up to him because he's got to be there with him every. You got to see him every day. Right. And not that he's going to be.

[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:55.820]
He's going to be up there in that press box all the time doing those pants and games on the radio. The guilty myself. I think he's going to do okay. I guarantee you won't be boring like some of the other sports cases we've got in town. Not to mention Dave Van or that Rich Walskoye in TV who evidently has naked pictures of Jim Sarni with a billy goat. You've got to be kidding me.

[01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:04.640]
Maybe naked pictures of Jim Sarni with Billy Martin. I don't know what it is, but there's something there. Talk about a suck up. What's that all about? God comes in the town as a horse ball job is totally.

[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:14.740]
See, it's like Jimmy Cifalus in Rich Walsk. I put him pretty much in the same category. Not ready for prime time. Unqualified is what they are in experience. They're just totally unqualified.

[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.740]
So Josh wants to take the rest of the show to where we're finesse on Jimmy Cifalo and Joe Rose. I like Joe. I know he like him personal.

[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:28.160]
He's doing a good job on the games. That's good. No, he wasn't, but he could be okay.

[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:37.920]
It's a work in progress. Are you starting with that crap too? Exactly. A work in progress. Well, you must be a job I think can get that.

[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:46.060]
I like Joe. Well, Joe Rose is a great guy. He's an excellent broadcaster, but he's certainly no mad dog. Oh, no. He's working. Of course, working with a guy that's totally unqualified.

[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:52.300]
And just Jimmy and Joe and Joe and Jimmy are talking back and forth with each other and not doing the description of the game, which is what you said.

[01:11:52.620 --> 01:12:00.740]
That's when I listened for the 15 minutes. It was a lot of stuff. And the reason he's not doing play by plays because Jimmy is not a play by play guy.

[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:07.580]
Okay. He made me play a little bit, but he's not doing play by play on the radio or off. Oh, I know. So we're pretty upset about it.

[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:16.220]
Jimmy, okay, those dolphins out there who miss Rick Weaver. So desperately and even Bill Zimper was pretty good. Good guy Zimper. Good guy got screwed badly when somebody came to the door.

[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:27.660]
They must have done my stir. So I told you, you'd miss him. They're drones like for a motor car. Huh? Seriously? Oh, I'm speaking. I'm all yesterday. So George leading into the Moe show being the bastard that you are.

[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:35.700]
Yeah. He like had like about a minute. How long is that bit? But a minute. What was that thing called? Moe update? Yes. It's 147.

[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:44.060]
So you got a car and fact you probably ran over. I didn't. Oh, two minutes still two years today. And so George plays that Moe update bit by both of Brian going right to the Moe show and Moe.

[01:12:44.200 --> 01:13:01.160]
I don't know if he said anything on the air or not, because who then why would I pay any attention? But he evidently was p-oat about it, which means he's not making progress. He's regressing. Okay. It's a radio show. Moe. Stop at ego. Okay. Stop at the below. And don't start slipping back at those old ways again. They're going to bring back the muskrat.

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:06.480]
Now there is his middle Roger. Go go go. This is 516.

[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.360]
So wait.

[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.380]
I'm going to take my books.

[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.220]
Number two.

[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.980]
Studying in the door.

[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.640]
Studying in the door.

[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.160]
Hey, Pamela, you know you missed a chance.

[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.680]
So now all this guy with girls are going to get in my bed.

[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.280]
Never finished high school.

[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.880]
What am I doing here?

[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.000]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:11.460]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:11.460]

[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:11.520]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:11.880]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:11.940]

[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.460]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:14.280]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:14.780]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.560]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.020]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.740]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.860]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.740]
I'm not doing anything here.

[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.180]
1147.

[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:28.760]
13.

[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.380]
You'll know in the 560 WM.

[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.860]
The Marlins and Milwaukee Brewer is a huge game this afternoon.

[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.900]
Pregame at 130.

[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.140]
Marlins at 205.

[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.200]
Curtis Stevenson after the ball game.

[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:39.480]

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:36.480]

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:36.480]

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:36.480]

[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:36.560]

And then we got a bunch of stuff and then we found that out and we found the book.

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:51.720]
And then we found the book.

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:51.720]

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:51.720]

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:51.720]

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.060]
And within other speakers,

[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.160]
we found the book.

[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:06.080]
And yeah, I find it cool.

[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:06.200]

[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:13.040]
I find it really cool.

[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:13.040]

[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.320]
And then we found it nice to talk about it all today.

[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:15.320]

[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.060]
He is, I mean, you talk about Nazi.

[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.080]
He makes Hitler look like a girl scout.

[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.140]
The Pope 15, who makes him both pale into one's significance, you're right.

[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.760]
He's got the face of evil, man.

[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:30.420]
You look at him and you see all the images of WWII and the Holocaust, all conjured up right

[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:30.560]
in.

[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.020]
And this crap about the Jews buying into his, you know, he stuck out.

[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.020]
He stuck out of the Muslims and everybody else.

[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.000]
Yeah, don't kid yourself.

[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.360]
He wants to convert everybody.

[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.100]
They want you, man, especially if you're a cute older boy.

[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.380]
The Pope 15, Al Sharpton 13, Jimmy Swagrid 12, DJ and Kennedy 6, the Quarrel Ridge Presbyterian

[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.920]
Church who used to have that gay guy playing the organ there.

[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.940]
I told him that, didn't I?

[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.300]
He was the organist.

[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.440]
In fact, he may still be there.

[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.220]
I don't like that at all.

[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.360]
Oh, gay guy.

[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.000]
Talk about a cello.

[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.140]
He's worse than Miss Fudge.

[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:00.560]
Hey, man.

[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.740]
You're fair, brother.

[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.140]
I'm so tired of that garbage.

[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.040]
None of them.

[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.800]
I'm religious enough.

[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.040]
Five.

[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.380]
We have five religious notes out there.

[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:06.600]
Good.

[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.580]
Benny Hins got two.

[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.020]
John A. Crock two.

[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.840]
Jeb Bush and Billy Graham have got the big, well, Jeb just went on.

[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.720]
Oh, so far.

[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.160]
Well, Billy, they feel sorry for her because they know he's like a one step away from death.

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.140]
So they're like, of course, Sylvia Larry King again, 85 times before he croaks before the

[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:23.620]
end of the year.

[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:29.360]
A judge on Wednesday in Pittsburgh ordered a school district to read mid to 14 year old

[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.720]
student expelled for writing violent, profane rap lyrics, finding that his songs did not

[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.600]
amount to truth threats against the school.

[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.500]
And so were protected by the first amendment.

[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.420]
The Riverside Beaver County School District kicked out Anthony Latour because officials

[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.640]
believed his lowest constituted threats to shoot up the school and other students.

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.800]
The ACA you representing with tour claim the songs were battle rap, a music genre in which

[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.100]
two people try to outrime each other, often using violent put downs, battle rap.

[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:55.920]
You're here?

[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.820]
Yeah, you know, you're spitting.

[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:58.880]
Why?

[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.280]
Battle rap, yeah, they rap off.

[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.360]
You guys, I heard that Moe was going to be one of those, but it was a rap off.

[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.260]
Is what I heard?

[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360]
Do do do do do do do do.

[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.760]
U.S. District Judge Donetta and Rose overturned his expulsion issue in a preliminary injunction

[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.640]
against ordering the District to admit the Latour to the ninth grade when classes resume

[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.780]
August 31.

[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:17.600]
That's less than a week.

[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.380]
That's a week from yesterday.

[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.800]
In one song, Latour wrote, so watch what you say about me.

[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.800]
I'm everywhere son.

[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.140]
And the word of mouth is that I'm carrying guns.

[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:29.040]
Now that I'm coming for you, what the F you're going to do come trouble with the pump

[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.600]
tons of slugs that'll punish you.

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.520]
How do you like that?

[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.740]
School officials learned of Latour's writings in March and contacted the police who charged

[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:39.980]
him with terrorist threats, terroristic threats and harassment.

[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.620]
Latour was expelled in May.

[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:42.600]
The charges are pending.

[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.480]
Terroristic threats and harassment.

[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.240]
How do you like that?

[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:45.880]
Uh huh.

[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.020]
He's just rapin' it baby.

[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.700]
The judge said the school's argument that the music was threatening was weakened because

[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.560]
school officials did not take immediate steps to investigate the music, such as searching

[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.240]
Latour's luck or contacting his parents furthermore.

[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.520]
And roasted school officials didn't present any evidence that the songs disrupted the

[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:01.860]
school.

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.060]
The school district and the terrorist family did not have any comment.

[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:05.960]
How do you like that?

[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:06.980]
He just rapin' it man.

[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.340]
He's doing a little what kind of rap is it battle?

[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.960]
It's not about the graphics, it's just about your battle rap.

[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.660]
That's what it is.

[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.620]
It's just a little what kind of rap is it battle rap?

[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.520]
Now this is a story that obviously nobody cares about because we headed on our website.

[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.540]
I think it was the least read.

[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.360]
Actually it was about the states.

[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.560]
I don't think I even saved that story because nobody cared about it.

[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.380]
About the fattest states.

[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.300]
Did you know that Houston is the fattest of the city in the country?

[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:30.900]
I did not.

[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.380]
And that Texas has got like four or the worst ten fattest of the city.

[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.280]
That's because they meet all them bobbacue down there.

[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.120]
They're all at Texas B for whatever they're doing.

[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.940]
They're just sittin' around on their fatt ass.

[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.560]
Kind of like your president is doing sitin' around on this fatt ass and Texas and Idaho

[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.340]
while Rome is burning in the middle east too.

[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:53.220]
Obesity rates rose last year and every state we're gettin' fatter and fatter.

[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.340]
I lost two pounds by the way.

[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:54.880]
Good.

[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.000]
193.

[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.800]
It's not good but I was trying to get a little on the precipice of being over my plane

[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.080]
area.

[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.160]
I'm not joking about that.

[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:07.180]
If I get like over 195 I can't function as a quasi-human being.

[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.580]
I can't even do this show.

[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.020]
Like I can't even just, it's a function of the diabetes thing.

[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.180]
But now I'm like, you see, you notice the difference I sound like almost like myself

[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:17.500]
today.

[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.600]
Although that's quite as, huh?

[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.440]
Although it's, you're almost out of day over 90.

[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.560]
Hey, by the way, it's QAM or old.

[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.460]
Obesity rates rose last year and every state we're gonna coin to an advocacy group that

[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:30.060]
come on the government and the private sector to get more involved in America's battle

[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.140]
with expanding waistlines, the advocacy group.

[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.720]
Oh, by the way, I wonder how a Kichuto Kevin Tuto is doing.

[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.080]
Don't buy that book, please.

[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.040]
I sure hope a lot of people read that story.

[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.500]
Please don't buy that book.

[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.500]
Don't waste your $30.

[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.620]
Bust third man.

[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.500]
Oh my god, the number of things you, you could get a half a tank of gas for $30.

[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.940]
The advocacy, what do you say?

[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.300]
The group press for American Health said data from the Centers for Disease Control and

[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.780]
Prevention show that the percentage of obesity adults for 2002 to 4 stood at 22.

[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.920]
Now it's over 25%.

[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.960]
You ready for that?

[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.420]
I'm ready.

[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]
Obes, not just fat.

[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.560]
I mean, fat's like 60%.

[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.040]
But obese.

[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:05.580]
Obes.

[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:06.400]
Obes.

[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.000]
The state of civilian largest increase in obesity was Alabama.

[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.940]
Maybe they took the vanguard off their knee.

[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:16.220]
There, the rate increased to 1.5 to 27.7% Oregon's rate held steady at 21.

[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.620]
The report said the states for the highest percentage of obese adults are Mississippi,

[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.220]
Alabama, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Tennessee.

[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.160]
The states for the lowest percentage of obese adults are Colorado.

[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:27.140]
Huh?

[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:27.700]
Yeah.

[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.320]
Is it that outdoorsy kind of thing?

[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.860]
There is a federal spend all their 80 running around shooting them.

[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.300]
Faggot.

[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.500]
Nice to walk outside.

[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:34.200]
And Massachusetts.

[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.300]
Oh, yeah, Massachusetts, man.

[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.120]
They're like real active.

[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.080]
They're run up and down.

[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.700]
Beacon Street.

[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:40.760]
Rhode Island.

[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.400]
Connecticut, Vermont, and Montana.

[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.880]
Hawaii was not included in the report.

[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.280]
Of course, I say, did Hawaii that have to include all those sumo kind of guys?

[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.240]
A lot of the Hawaiians are like that.

[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.060]
Well, what are they?

[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:50.640]
Fat.

[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:51.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:52.320]
Right.

[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.980]
And so they're one of those, and they do that pig roast where they put the pig on the

[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.180]
spit.

[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.300]
Sometimes they make a mistake.

[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.060]
It's another one of those things like the Eskimos, you know, as long as they kept

[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.740]
to the native diet, it didn't get so crazy.

[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:02.320]
Yeah.

[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.420]
And we poisoned them with our refined everyone.

[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.540]
Well, I think I've got some really great, they've put an Asian food.

[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.320]
I don't know if you like that.

[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.880]
I think I've got some good food and hello.

[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.840]
Yeah, man.

[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:10.520]
Damn.

[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:10.960]
Damn.

[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.080]
And official with the trust America's health said the US is stuck in a debate limbo about

[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.820]
how the government should confront obesity.

[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.380]
First of all, how about if they went after all the food manufacturers that putting all

[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:25.360]
this crap to addicted to make you addicted to their food and all the crap in there, it's

[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:25.980]
making you fat.

[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:26.940]
How about that, huh?

[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.080]
But that's bad for business, so they're not going to do that.

[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.600]
If you're smoking those cancer sticks, then right away, oh, it's bad.

[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:33.360]
It's going to kill you.

[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.760]
And we're going to sue all, you know, all these multi-billion dollar lawsuits.

[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.900]
I just don't understand what they're not like to do.

[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.180]
But oh, there's a chance ever again.

[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.100]
This would be a huge storm getting Florida.

[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.880]
It's not a huge storm.

[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.300]
It is going to be probably a category one as it makes landfall.

[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.740]
It is still traveling off to the west.

[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.380]
That about seven or eight miles per hour.

[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.360]
Now you do this.

[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:57.000]
Here's a north and north state Iowa, the most dangerous part of any storm, especially

[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.840]
when this convection here rotates up and around and it's on this side and as the storm

[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.740]
moves toward Bocca.

[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.140]
I thought you had Bocca, maybe only 30 miles per hour to focus on the storm.

[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:09.320]
The van down the hatches and the most red bring them in.

[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.820]
Still developing.

[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.340]
Right now, officially, it's 60 miles per hour.

[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.960]
There may be some higher gusts, especially in this squall right here, which will rotate

[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.220]
and then the squall can.

[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:25.380]
Right between the line between Brevard County, Broward County and into Palm Beach County.

[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.760]
That's where the strongest part of this storm is going to hit.

[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.020]
Probably 75, maybe 80 miles per hour when it makes landfall.

[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.060]
And there you go, Bocca.

[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:36.040]
And like I told you, it's not moving south and spread what this bubblehead on CNN said

[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.280]
there's been saying all morning long.

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.400]
It is not going to the south.

[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.880]
It's going west if anything.

[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.420]
It may go a little tiny bit.

[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:41.880]
Do you understand?

[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:42.280]
Yeah.

[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.740]
Right in the Bocca, right in the most house.

[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.620]
This is meal.

[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.040]
Oh my God.

[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.520]
This is 5.

[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:50.620]
Sixty two.

[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:51.140]
Keep it.

[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:51.420]
Keep it.

[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.160]
Keep it.

[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:58.560]
Hey, I'm from Eliana Ross, Lateman and I like scrubbing my slag.

[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.900]
I like real house with soap made from jewels.

[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.020]
And listening to the new Roque Amunista Art.

[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:05.780]
Hey, guys.

[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:06.920]
Oh, no.

[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:07.640]
See here.

[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.860]
I ain't never said no.

[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.020]
Yeah, that's the third noise.

[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.400]
I'm going to go to the door.

[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.240]
The ball keeps saying, the noise.

[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.760]
Yeah, yeah, it never said it.

[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:17.560]
Oh, no, no.

[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.020]
It's the first thing you said there's a door.

[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.420]
That's the ocean.

[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.400]
Hey, me, my dad.

[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:24.860]
The door, the door, the door.

[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.460]
The door, the door.

[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.320]
The door, the door.

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:27.740]

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:27.740]

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:27.740]

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:27.800]
The door.

[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:27.860]
The door.

[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.000]
The door.

[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:28.280]

[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:28.280]

[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:28.440]
The door.

[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.160]
The door.

[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:30.600]
The door.

[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:30.820]
The door.

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:31.220]
The door.

[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.520]
The door.

[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:33.600]
The door.

[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.020]
The door.

[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.420]
The door, the door.

[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:37.040]
The door.

[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:37.060]
The door.

[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:37.060]

[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.040]
Hey, you don't care.

[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:43.740]
Yeah.

[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:44.700]
So we are going to go to the door.

[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.380]
Hmm.

[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:48.560]
But the noise doesn't teach us.

[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:14.700]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.060]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.620]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:16.960]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:16.960]

[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.000]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:17.400]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:17.400]

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:17.400]

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:17.540]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:17.540]

[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:17.640]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.540]
I'm going to get you.

[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:18.540]

[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.900]
Don'tット againstones are you going to get up?

[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:29.620]
I'm going down with that 35,ustraged sharply with that 25-meter butt.

[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:30.020]
That 30-meter butt climber's just been too bad.

[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.580]
That's that ident all—

[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.860]
I'm always hoping that you don't stay on that.

[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.000]
I can't seem to get up on that.

[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:37.700]
I'm beating a Machoo in front of the woman that great-

[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.320]
Catch me from the other side.

[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.680]
Fuck it.

[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:45.540]
It's all family.

[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.520]
I can think of doing it.

[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.760]
You are crazy!

[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.580]
Oh, yeah, the way you throw it,

[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.420]
I'm in trouble, man!

[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.080]
You can't be the joy you're anxious!

[01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.280]
You're joy to die!

[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.580]
Oh, no, this is not a good idea to throw it to the door, to the door, to the door, to the door!

[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.860]
It's a bo-man!

[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.240]
I think the lucky wisdom,

[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.180]
you can even throw it to the wall!

[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.560]
And it's not a good idea to throw it to the wall!

[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.280]
It's a bo-man!

[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.040]
Let's try it once!

[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.820]
You'll try to do it again!

[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.060]
You'll be aimed at the point of the door to the door to the door to the door again!

[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.640]
It's a pain of strength!

[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.420]
When I used my horse,

[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.880]
I was like,

[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:22.980]

[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.380]
I was like,

[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.800]
You're right, we're right!

[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:54.680]
Oh, yeah, we're right!

[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.020]
Oh, yeah, we're going to the door!

[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:55.080]

[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.160]
To the door, to the door!

[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:56.680]
To the door!

[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.340]
To the door!

[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:04.500]
To the door, to the door, to the door, to the door!

[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.880]
It's a pain of strength, a bo-man!

[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:07.180]
Yeah...

[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.760]
What's the story to wait, a wave?

[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.220]
I don't know what you're talking about!

[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.640]
I've never said both of those are going to the door!

[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.380]
Oh, you're just a child!

[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:14.480]
I just am not the child!

[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:14.960]
I just am not the child!

[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:15.940]
That's not the kid's door!

[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:16.400]
That character is not here!

[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.240]
I want to look on the door!

[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.660]
Oh, OK!

[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.160]
Lucky at least!

[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.060]
I can get a little piece of quiet.

[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.100]
Wow! I am old!

[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.240]
But I can't go in here and I'll lose it.

[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.940]
When I wait here, I pull my golden dress up like honey,

[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.640]
evens. That's for you.

[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.600]
There you go. You're forcing me to do this.

[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.860]
Hey! How about a nice Hawaiian tank?

[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:38.680]
Sure!

[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.860]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:58.900]

[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:58.960]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.260]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.700]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:00.700]

[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.100]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:01.420]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.360]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.060]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.680]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:05.760]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.620]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.640]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.640]
I'm going to go in here.

[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.940]
That's for you.

[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.100]
That's for your own good or not?

[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.980]
Not sure.

[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:30.620]
You're one of the famous Japanese hence name.

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:30.620]

[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.140]
I don't know how much I can do.

[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.820]
It just gives us the feeling that we should make an effort.

[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.060]
That's for you.

[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:36.060]

[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.620]
I'm going to try to fix the tribute here for our good close person.

[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.220]
You don't want to know why I do that, don't you?

[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.000]
Why did you do that?

[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.380]
Because I think Boka may be obliterating.

[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.220]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:53.420]
And we're going to have to have a tribute for the moment because that's his headquarters.

[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.380]
That's where he hangs it out.

[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.120]
That's where he's probably playing golf right now.

[01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.420]
Don't get wet out there in a course, Mo.

[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.420]
Don't get pneumonia out there like William Henry Harrison.

[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.320]
And I have some shocking news for you.

[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.320]
Are you a track and this or not?

[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.480]
Are you paying no attention to him?

[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.660]
I'm backtracking it.

[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.360]
No, no, seriously.

[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.660]
No, I'm not paying any attention.

[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:09.580]
Well, why not?

[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.280]
Whatever.

[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:14.640]
So in other words, you're not on my thing here on my national weather service radar?

[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:15.800]
No, let's see it in.

[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.380]
Oh, forget about them.

[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.300]
That's a goon.

[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:21.560]
The, it looks to me because now the eye is opened up.

[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.960]
It's kind of like they went to the storm of the dentist and he said, open wide and the eye

[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.700]
is not only visible again, which is kind of like vanished, but it's now, you can see the

[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.440]
motion of the, is Northwest again.

[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.160]
Which you'll notice that we're just talking about Boka as opposed to Fort Lauderdale.

[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.620]
Because now you can see very definitely the whole system is like taking a little jog,

[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.160]
you know, like a jog road, a little jog to the Northwest.

[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.260]
So that big eye is headed right for a, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.900]
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Lord is peeing

[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.400]
the, the Lord is pissed off about that muskrat.

[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.340]
Now you, uh, for, uh, neglected to mention the death of somebody very important that nobody

[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:57.880]
ever heard of.

[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:58.280]
Who?

[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:00.220]
I think it's a racial thing with you.

[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:00.960]
Brock Peters.

[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:01.560]
Who?

[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.460]
The way Brock Peters recorded the competition for Tequila Mockingbird came about him in James

[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.140]
Rolzones.

[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.180]
You know, James Rolzones, this is a good idea.

[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.160]
And you know him, right?

[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.240]
Peter's one out.

[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.340]
I never actually knew who made the decision you remembered, but to whoever it was, I'm

[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:14.580]
grateful.

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:18.920]
Peter's the character actor who made his mark as in like his booming voice to the doomed Tom

[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:24.540]
Robinson in the 1962 film version of Mockingbird died to the latest LA home following an eight month

[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.400]
battle with Pank Radd, a cancer he was 78.

[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.880]
So you didn't even mention it.

[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:28.880]
No, I didn't.

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.320]
We spent two weeks that I called two weeks of tears.

[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:36.500]
My valet tears Peter said the movie shoot before an audience in Kansas in 2000, uh, per

[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.640]
the site to kill a Mockingbird.

[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.280]
What?

[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.240]
Oh, I see quite a, they aside to kill a Mockingbird in Harper Lee.

[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:42.820]
Huh?

[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:46.760]
Tears didn't necessarily come easy to Peter's the actor in order to come easy to a

[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.420]
Stovac character.

[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.740]
They did, however, apply to Tom Robinson's flight.

[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:53.700]
A wrongly accused black man faced with an all-white jury in the 1930s.

[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.440]
South, kind of like O.J. in reverse.

[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.420]
A claim by the American film Institute is one of the 100 greatest US films at the

[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:04.080]
last century Mockingbird won three Oscars, including one for Stark Gregory Schmeck who died in

[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.440]
2003 and was Peter's who read the Eulogy of Peck's funeral.

[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.380]
In art, there is compassion and compassion.

[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.560]
There is humanity and humanity.

[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:14.760]
There's generosity and love Peter said Gregory Peck gave us these attributes in full

[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.080]
measure.

[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.800]
And that touching, touching it.

[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:16.920]
No.

[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.340]
Over the years, Peter's was regular on the Mockingbird circuit, appearing on stage with Mary

[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:25.560]
Badham who played Scott or is that bad-ham, kind of like Cindy Sheehan who played young

[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.640]
Scott in the movie and most recently at a 2005 LA tribute to Harper Lee upon whose novel

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.380]
they largely faithful film was based.

[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.400]
Well, that's the shame.

[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.620]
It was a good actor.

[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.460]
And now he's dead.

[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.360]
See, I told you that dying thing is going around.

[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:38.820]
Sure.

[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.620]
A lot of people go in.

[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.820]
I'm dying on the hands.

[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.360]
Like that, including Jason Robards.

[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.980]
They're all going to watch that again.

[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.840]
Maybe this weekend.

[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:45.960]
Do it.

[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:47.340]
Magnolia.

[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.500]
I think if you watch it again, especially when the frog stared at the fall, I think you

[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.460]
might like it a little bit better.

[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:56.900]
I got to rewatch that scene very carefully about the TV gameshow host went right when he

[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.840]
fires off that shot and see if he really blew out the TV.

[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.420]
Was it brains or both or whatever?

[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:02.820]
What?

[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.700]
If you blow out the TV or his brains or both.

[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:05.460]
I think both.

[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:05.940]
Yeah.

[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.340]
And you got a watch of Myson Mund.

[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:09.620]
Why do Myson?

[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:10.080]
You did not.

[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:11.100]
Did I get it?

[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:11.920]
I got it.

[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:12.880]
You just haven't watched it yet.

[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.900]
Well, I haven't watched that.

[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:16.320]
Oh, maybe one of these days when I'm really, really bored.

[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.060]
I don't know.

[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:18.560]
Is it really good?

[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.020]
What I enjoy?

[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:19.920]
It's just fine.

[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:20.760]
It's a good story.

[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.920]
It's a good story.

[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:22.400]
Corny.

[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:22.980]
No.

[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.720]
Who's in it?

[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:28.840]
In this version, it's Gary Seneese and John Malkovich.

[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:29.460]
Yeah.

[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.200]
And it's good.

[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:31.440]
Okay.

[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.040]
I got it.

[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:32.840]
It's in right in the other room.

[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.020]
I'll get around to it.

[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:39.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, let's take a few calls because our 20 minutes, we're

[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:39.960]
out of here.

[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:40.720]
That's bad.

[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.580]
I feel like almost guilty today.

[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:43.120]
Almost?

[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.580]
In fact, maybe I watched of Myson Mund before I watched my next Corrie Hand movie.

[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.520]
A 72 a.m.

[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:51.160]

[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.780]
2 a.m.

[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:54.600]
Hey, me.

[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.220]
How you doing?

[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:55.960]
Pretty good.

[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:56.840]
Good.

[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.400]
Listen, as you can tell, please put it.

[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.540]
That's that ass filter.

[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:05.900]
It's got a young that poll because he is religious belief, I suspect me directly, man, in my

[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.960]
kids school and stuff.

[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.700]
So I want to get him on the poll.

[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.580]
Don't forget to choose life, man.

[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:16.200]
And what he and me to ask are so called President is that I know the President has a lot

[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.680]
of power, you know, but when did he change the second commandment from?

[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.360]
That was not killed, Bill.

[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.520]
That was not killed.

[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.560]
He killed anybody.

[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.820]
It doesn't believe what I believe.

[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.680]
They're killing the ragheads.

[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.300]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:33.400]
I mean, he's pretty religious so much, but you know, what about love by enemy, you know?

[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.100]
Choose life, baby.

[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:35.920]
You might.

[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:36.320]
Yeah, I'll tell you.

[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.140]
Okay.

[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.540]
Much of hypocrites says that just like Pat Robertson, you know, the way he gets a free pass

[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.180]
from the media, I really scoured to try to find some really scathing editoros.

[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:46.960]
And comment here.

[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:47.100]
Yeah.

[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:50.580]
There are other couple articles I've put on the website, but there just wasn't a lot.

[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:57.180]
Here's the guy who comes on the air on his own TV channel there and his 700 Club and

[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:01.900]
advocates the assassination of a duly elected leader of another country where we already had

[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.960]
these very grotesque relations with in a very delicate oil situation and opens up a month

[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.480]
and says, yeah, let's kill him.

[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.400]
Let's not wait anymore.

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.200]
Let's get over with an assassinated man and then go sign in lies about it in a half-baked

[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.080]
lukewarm apology.

[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.780]
To avert a war as if like war is moving.

[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:16.560]
That's right.

[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.180]
We got to say that 200 billion, but you know, a lives that's not important.

[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:24.100]
He even mentioned that the 1874 dead kids in Iraq.

[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:24.980]
He didn't talk about that.

[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:25.900]
He's talking about the money.

[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.320]
And of course, because that he's a money grabbing a whore and crook is what he is.

[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.100]
If you want to, if you, if you Google Pat Robertson crook, just put his name in the word

[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:38.620]
crook next to it, then you'll find out all about him and his exploits in Africa in

[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:42.840]
Zaire and in Liberia, all of the stuff with the diamond mines and the phony operation

[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.460]
rescue all this aid they were saying in the pilot said they weren't bringing any aid

[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:46.760]
at all.

[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.720]
They were doing was like bringing materials over there so they could do their diamond mining.

[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.660]
And by the way, the good news is that all went to pot.

[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.000]
So to speak, well good.

[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.480]
Went to hell on a hand casket.

[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.420]
Miserable, crooked, drool and the fate that he ran from prison.

[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.860]
I think it's mighty appropriate, given what's going on in your country today, your country.

[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:05.860]
1213 if I were there, Cindy.

[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:06.720]
Same pain.

[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:11.960]
And we do what we have to do to get through our pain and we hope they respect us for that.

[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.720]
And we respect them in any way they have to do to get through their pain.

This is Meele Rogers.

[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.000]
This is 5-16-Q-A-M.

[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.920]
What's going on here?

[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.920]
There's a marvelous place I know.

[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.920]
All the wealthy people go.

[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.320]
It's where rural people are and that's what I like about Velka.

[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.760]
A down there equals only the small.

[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.920]
A down where they say help call and every corner has a wall.

[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.820]
That's what I like about Velka.

[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.560]
And 10 grand out of all the first meetings.

[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.340]
Spend the day with George V. Freeze.

You shall take these delicacies.

[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.180]
That's what I like about Velka.

[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.480]
Please excuse our attitudes.

[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.160]
And I'll be as double the ooz at the Weefine pleasure and be enrooted.

[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.760]
That's what I like about Velka.

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:26.800]

[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.180]
Who cheesed those at Paralyx watches?

[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.960]
Why do you choose like us so often?

[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.420]
If you're clean, let you touch us.

[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.040]
And that's what I like about Velka.

[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.380]
We really don't care what you think.

[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:52.600]
You see how a dude who doesn't stink.

[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:53.740]
There's no coffee.

[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.800]
I don't think Velka.

[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.440]
That's what I like about Velka.

[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.400]
If you have a restaurant or a drink about Velka, buy Velka.

[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:12.880]
Buy Velka.

[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:13.380]
Nice dough.

[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:14.940]
You know something.

[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.040]
A lot of old Jews there.

[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.400]
I guess we're going to have to relocate back to Miami Beans.

[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:21.020]
If there's Jews relocating on Gaza, right?

[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:21.400]
Right.

[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.940]
Look, they already wear those high water shorts anyway.

[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:24.940]
Those very muted shorts.

[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:28.660]
And of course, those rain catcher hats that are really great on the golf course.

[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.220]
Police tried around in 87-year-old woman snoozing on a recliner to this conster on the weekend.

[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.380]
Found $60,000 in cash in her purse while looking for ID.

[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.740]
This is in Jane'sville, Wisconsin.

[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.580]
Employees at the big lost store said the woman had been sleeping there for hours when police arrived.

[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:49.660]
Police couldn't manage to wait for an officer who rummaged through her purse, found 600 bills stacks of $100 bills.

[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:53.940]
Maybe she was going to woodbind inside a second bag secured with a safety pin.

[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.740]
A sergeant was dispatched to the scene.

[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:56.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.020]
Speaking of that, there was a couple at one to lottery here.

[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.680]
The lotto about two weeks ago, the $6.49, $7.50 million, 90 years old, they both lived in nursing home.

[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.020]
Well, good for that.

[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:07.660]
Bastard.

[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.720]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.720]
The $7.50 million, and the guy's going to go out and buy a licking continental.

[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.260]
And of course, if they were in South Florida, he'd be driving it around, I'm sure.

[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:17.400]
Hey, my mother was driving, she was 90.

[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.080]
Find out yesterday who heard a story about how she was once driving on the wrong side of the road on Sterling Road.

[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:22.860]
But he ever less.

[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.780]
Hey, listen, it's confusing, you know.

[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.100]
Sure.

[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:30.700]
A sergeant was dispatched to the scene to verify the money count and the cash later was also counted by Lieutenant Keith Lover.

[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:34.500]
Oh, and you know something, this reminds me I have got to tell you this story.

[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:37.600]
It's not a lot significant, but it has to do with finding money.

[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.880]
A few days ago, I go over to my little neighborhood convenience store to buy a newspaper, so whatever.

[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.160]
I screened.

[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.400]
And I come back.

[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:49.580]
It was like, I don't know, maybe eight o'clock at night.

[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.220]
And in front of my building, I see on the ground.

[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.380]
I mean, you can't miss it because the Canadian currency is very colorful, especially that pink $50 bill.

[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.400]
Yeah, but you like it.

[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.500]
And I see like, what appeared to me?

[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.540]
Like three bills, like kind of like watered together, sitting on the right.

[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.620]
Now, there's this young couple of a few paces behind me coming into the building.

[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.820]
And they unfortunately, well, I mean, whatever.

[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:09.860]
They spotted it too.

[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.120]
And the guy says, what's that?

[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:17.900]
And just as slick as oil on a barge, man, I just reach right down as a without breaking or enshrined,

[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:20.320]
and pick that the three bills off very good.

[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.680]
Now, the kind of I can see, even though I don't have eyes in the back of my head, I can feel it that they're like lying.

[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.780]
And like, what is he going to do?

[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.460]
There is a 50, a 20 and a 10. There's 80 bucks.

[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.320]
Now, I got about, oh, 30 seconds.

[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.220]
30, man.

[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:37.360]
A few seconds as I'm walking in, I can always go to the concierge and say, oh, I just found this out there.

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.080]
If anybody says they lost 80 bucks, but of course, he probably stick in his pocket when nobody's looking, right?

[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:42.560]
Wouldn't you?

[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:43.840]
Or I did.

[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:44.340]
Okay.

[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:45.140]
Or.

[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.580]
Now, anybody could say they could put a sign up there and say, oh, if anybody lost 80 dollars on it,

[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.340]
about how the hell would you know you lost 80 dollars in the first place, right?

[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:53.680]
Right.

[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:58.220]
Because it looked to me like somebody, you know, maybe had a bunch of bills in their pocket and they started pulling some out.

[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.360]
And they just dropped that little water cash on the ground.

[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.040]
80 bucks.

[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.880]
Now, they're going to be people out there.

[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.460]
And I didn't have to tell this on the ears there.

[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.560]
Oh, my God.

[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:06.860]
Look how dishonest you are.

[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.120]
All the money you're making, 80 dollars, I can lose that in about five seconds it would buy.

[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.780]
But the fact that it matter is, I found it.

[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:14.240]
Right.

[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:15.580]
Sure.

[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.760]
Well, what's the point?

[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:21.880]
So I stuffed it in my pocket and I came up first there and I kind of little smirk a lot of my face.

[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.160]
What difference does it make, right?

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.200]
Finders keepers.

[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.020]
Now, that's right.

[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.400]
Finders keepers lose their way.

[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.560]
Preciadee, Adi, Adi, Amama.

[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:28.040]
That's right.

[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.060]
My 80 bucks didn't change my life.

[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.300]
And hopefully, it's not going to end.

[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:34.000]
Anybody can afford to live in this building is not going to change their life either.

[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.500]
80 bucks, Canadian, huh?

[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.380]
Chicken feed.

[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:37.820]
I was just one of those things.

[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.720]
Reminds me that that time, which was like an act of God.

[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.460]
Damn, God.

[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.420]
When I first came to South Florida, I lived over on Miami Beach very briefly before I couldn't,

[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.460]
I just couldn't stand it.

[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.500]
All was far-bison.

[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.680]
And it was on a Sunday.

[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:50.880]
Never forget this.

[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.020]
What the hell was the name of that drug store?

[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.300]
It was an Alton Road.

[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.820]
It was a drug store that had like a fountain, you know, a counter with like good cheeseburgers and bananas splits.

[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.740]
What the hell was the name of that place?

[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.120]
I'm sure it's not there in no more.

[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:03.760]
Somebody will know.

[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.860]
At any rate, so I take my very first credit card.

[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.780]
It's 1976, because I had no cash in my pocket.

[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.460]
I had cash in a bank.

[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:15.820]
And I go to the bank and the dem, the flagship bank on Washington Avenue,

[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:16.960]
and the Alton Road.

[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.000]
Whatever it was, the flagship didn't all over in business.

[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.640]
And I go to take money out and then come to find out that the ATM was broken,

[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.860]
which back in those days they were kind of on the primitive side anyway.

[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.240]
And they were like all over the place.

[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.340]
And without a service.

[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.060]
And I couldn't get no cash.

[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.240]
So I had like, I don't know, made like two bucks in my pocket.

[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:37.680]
So I'm walking back to my little apartment where the Orthodox Jews who lived upstairs used to like

[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:38.960]
hockey shining till three and a half.

[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:39.700]
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.320]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.620]
Makes so much noise you couldn't sleep.

[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:46.420]
And I'm walking back there and I'm on the side street right where this restaurant,

[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:48.160]
a drug store was.

[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:51.360]
And there by the curb is $20.

[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.040]
$210 bills.

[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:53.880]
How about that?

[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.640]
Just I'm on the street.

[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:56.020]
$210 bills somebody would drive.

[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:56.460]
Just for you.

[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.720]
Just for me.

[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:01.500]
You see, so I'm assuming that that $80 I found there, they might like who knows.

[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.600]
Maybe I should take the $80 and go buy a lot of tickets on Saturday.

[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:05.760]
Do it, huh?

[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:06.820]
No, I already did.

[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:08.560]
I spent $100 and got $25 back.

[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.640]
And by the way, I'd like to mention some jackass, one 14 and a half million in the $649

[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.460]
lotto here on Saturday.

[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.220]
I'm not too happy about it.

[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640]
It wasn't this jackass.

[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.460]
Somebody won the $35 million here?

[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.020]
No.

[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.920]
Yeah, because I drive by it every day and it's back to three.

[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.120]
Oh no.

[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.920]
Yeah, this was $14.5 and I said it was back to four.

[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:29.480]
And out of I spent $400 on lotto tickets, you know what I got back $60.

[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.640]
Not another good investment, right?

[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:32.220]
Right.

[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.400]
See, one thing when you're playing the lottery, I just, you know, that time that I just missed

[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.700]
the $15 million by one digit.

[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:38.680]
Remember that a few months ago?

[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.040]
Mm-hmm.

[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:39.820]
I spent $80.

[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.620]
And I got back $1600.

[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:45.720]
In fact, I got $1600 for the $5 out of $6 plus I got some other ones on there.

[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.220]
So I got back about $1700 for $80.

[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.640]
So just the idea that, because there's millions of combinations, so the idea that you're

[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.800]
going to want to spend, oh, you know, hundreds and hundreds, it doesn't help.

[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.760]
You might get a few extra $6 or four, whatever they pay.

[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.180]
That's about it.

[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.260]
Japan's champion speed eater devoured a hundred roast pork buns in 12 minutes in Hong Kong

[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.720]
in the final bout of any contest this past weekend.

[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:09.940]
Takuru Kobayashi.

[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:10.960]
Yeah, he's famous.

[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:16.000]
27 Todds who the Chinese steamed buns to easily be five other local contestants pocketing

[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.760]
your cash prize of $20,000 in Hong Kong dollars at $2574 bucks US.

[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:25.100]
First runner up, Johnny Wu, 34, finished 47 buns.

[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.380]
This guy did 100, a hundred roast pork buns.

[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.980]
Kobayashi who weighs just 144 pounds said the ponseized buns, both more of a challenge

[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.820]
than the 83 vegetarian dumplings he done in eight minutes on Saturday.

[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:36.880]
What a pig.

[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.160]
The Japanese speed eater, a lot of the Heather The Olympics, now that everybody's so fat,

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.300]
how about speed eating?

[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:42.820]
That's right.

[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.160]
They do have, they have eating contest on the SPN.

[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:46.800]
It's a national event.

[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:47.500]

[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:32.180]
A duet.

[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:35.780]
Oh, you'll be pleased to know since you hate that thing I play all the time.

[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:37.720]
Because it's not the original Thin Lizzy one.

[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:38.280]
Right.

[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.500]
Then I'm not playing the Boys or Back contribute.

[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:42.140]
I'm not playing that going into the ballgame.

[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:42.500]
Good.

[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.120]
Aren't you excited?

[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:43.560]
I am.

[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:44.380]
What do you got in that?

[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.500]
I don't know what you have against it.

[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.400]
I think it's pretty good.

[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:47.820]
It's a, it's a Zot.

[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.640]
For one thing.

[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.160]
Well, no, it's not the real thing.

[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.800]
Well, if you want to go on by the Thin Lizzy CD,

[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.660]
yeah, really have no need for it.

[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:55.800]
It's like from here if you wanted me to.

[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:56.880]
I don't want you to.

[02:05:57.020 --> 02:05:58.500]
And now let's mix it up a little bit.

[02:05:58.580 --> 02:05:59.700]
We don't want to hear that crap again.

[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.520]
We're going to take it on my original CD.

[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:05.360]
You two!

[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:06.200]
You failed!

[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:08.220]
You failed!

[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:09.380]
You failed!

[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:09.720]
Okay, that's enough.

[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:11.700]
Now, you got, I don't know what's wrong with me.

[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:12.100]
I don't know.

[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:12.400]
I read your write.

[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:13.040]
I don't like it.

[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.180]
Yeah.

[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.180]
Okay, that's enough.

[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:18.540]
I don't know why they couldn't have been a little more true

[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:19.180]
to the original.

[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.660]
But then they, you know, they have all these great art things on your

[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:21.920]
man.

[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:22.520]

[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:22.620]
Huh?

[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.580]
That's what people do when they remake.

[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.360]
They destroy.

[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.020]
Musicians from the following bands are in this Motorhead,

[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:31.500]
Ozzy Osborne, Rainbow, Alice Cooper, White Sadek, Iron Maiden.

[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:32.100]
Huh?

[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:36.420]
You said, we all mighty foreigner, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep.

[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.420]
Oh, man, what a heap.

[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.320]
Anyway, I'll surprise you.

[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.080]
Here's the MS on the storm.

[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:43.060]
McCain's Center, it has gained strength.

[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:46.200]
Wing Gus up to about 85 miles an hour.

[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:48.840]
And again, about 20 miles off the Coast of Fort Lauderdale.

[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:52.300]
We expect it to make landfall sometimes tonight between 8 p.m.

[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:57.120]
and midnight eastern time, possibly, again, as a small category one hurricane.

[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.240]
Then here's the path of Katrina.

[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:04.240]
It will move right across the South Central Peninsula, exiting about

[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:06.040]
Friday, late afternoon, Friday evening, right.

[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:06.500]
We're in the neighborhood.

[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:07.660]
They're taking it out.

[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.260]
It's going to rain, getting a little bit of strength.

[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:13.000]
Maybe possibly back up to a category one hurricane and a warm Gulf of

[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:13.700]
Mexico waters.

[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:16.780]
And then back in through the Panhandle early Monday morning.

[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.500]
A great rain event for those folks up there as well as South Eastern Georgia.

[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:21.740]
Let's talk about rain.

[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.860]
You can see those outer rain bands spreading all the way across the sunshine state.

[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:29.480]
And we do have some flood watches in effect for most of South Florida.

[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:32.460]
So even here in the MSNBC, they're talking about the outer bands.

[02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:33.880]
The ones that I just listed for there.

[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.540]
That who did that music?

[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:39.160]
A training device mistakenly left by a secret service contractor,

[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:41.540]
Washington Hotel, was the suspicious package.

[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.540]
Not that people are nervous to understand that prompted a building evacuation Sunday afternoon law enforcement

[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:51.540]
sources said the FBI and secret service and teams of investigators to the Mayflower Hotel,

[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:54.620]
just a few blocks from the White House after the package was found.

[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:58.180]
A lot of people run around with dangerous packages, according to Farell.

[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:00.180]
It was a hotel employee who discovered it.

[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:05.720]
Initially a spokesman for Washington's Foreign Emergency Management Services Department said the package appeared to be a hoax.

[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.900]
It appeared to be a deliberate attempt to make people think it was a real device and Alan Eder.

[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:11.720]
It was made to look like the real thing.

[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:13.820]
Oh yeah, I know people like that.

[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.260]
And then you find out it's not the real thing.

[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:20.480]
Just like that tape we got from the Horoldo show.

[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:21.180]
Remember who that died?

[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:21.940]
I do.

[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:22.540]
You want to hear it again?

[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:23.100]
No.

[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.480]
I'll speak to that arm with a tape measure.

[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:27.540]
What a segue.

[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.220]
Whoo!

[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.160]
Tosin Maryland arm with a tape measure.

[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:35.220]
Sophia Jennings keeps your eyes open for overgrown weeds in the owners of the yards that have them.

[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:38.480]
This is what America has become.

[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:46.460]
Jennings, a Baltimore County Code Enforcement Officer, checks on residents who are not in compliance with rules about overgrown lawns.

[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:50.000]
In most area of your predictions, letting grass grow more than a foot higher,

[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.740]
eight inches in Baltimore City is against the law.

[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:56.580]
In some jurisdictions, the grass cops come in the form of code enforcement officers.

[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.020]
In others, public works officials, this kind of reminds me of the tree people you had, the citrus tanker.

[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:06.460]
In others, public works officials or environmental health workers are assigned to the test.

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:12.420]
We actually have a grass ruler, St. Tommy Hauke, chief of zoning enforcement of Hartford County.

[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.440]
The number of complaints varies by county.

[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.960]
And so does the process that follows the complaint, although each county uses some form of notification process,

[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.060]
and type of landowners to comply with the law.

[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:26.360]
Officials say the goal is the same everywhere for property owners to cut back the grass and weeds cluttering their lives.

[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:31.240]
So we already had the grass police talking about a different kind of grass, talking about that wacky weed.

[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.320]
Now we've got the grass police talking about the grass that's grown out of your yard.

[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.680]
Oh, give me a break.

[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:42.720]
We've been located to a modern, expanded naval hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, not too far.

[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:44.580]
I mean, they're closing up while the Reed Medical Center.

[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:45.200]
How do you like that?

[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:46.360]
He was too liberal for them.

[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.940]
What religious nut, you hate the most, that's our poll question.

[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:52.120]
Here's our last peek at it.

[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:56.860]
You can take a peek at it yourself when you go to our website to read all those intellectual stories that Josh works so hard to put on there.

[02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:58.800]
And then I work that I scour to find.

[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.520]
George W. Bush, 222.

[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:05.160]
I keep asking you, remember that show room 222 with Karen Valetine?

[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:05.360]
No.

[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.360]
I always say, no, but Bokeh Brandt does.

[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:10.200]
Oh, that's because he's old like me, old chicken neck.

[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:13.600]
Louis Ferricon 5006, Jerry Falwell 55.

[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:14.260]
Look at that.

[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:16.740]
They're like, as to as, kind of like Jennifer Conley.

[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:21.880]
Pad Robertson 46, Jesse Jackson 35, Al Sharpton and the Pope have 20 of peace.

[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:22.860]
Have we seen them together?

[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:23.560]
Not lately.

[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:26.280]
James Dobson 16, Jimmy Swagger 13.

[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:31.240]
I have seen the, he James Kennedy 10, virulent, Jeb Bush 9,

[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.060]
none of them.

[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:41.400]
I'm religious nut 9, Benny Hinton 6, John Ascroff 3, and Billy Graham out of 520 votes are gold by the way, is 500 for the show today just to make us feel better about life.

[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:42.460]
And we got 520 already.

[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.240]
I like that.

[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:43.840]
That's pretty good.

[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:45.940]
I guess we've probably got a captive audience.

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:50.980]
Everybody's inside glued to the radio to get the latest and the greatest on this catastrophe that's about to take place.

[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:51.820]
Everybody's going to drown.

[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.780]
I just think there's a little bit of overreaction here.

[02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:03.660]
I could be wrong, but whether I'm there or here or any place else, that's always the, that's the Florida F and Way man, the South Florida F and Way.

[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.480]
Everybody, I saw some stories on there on the wicked web.

[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.380]
People showing pictures of people buying lumber again and stocking up on all the bottled water.

[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.580]
It's the same old overreaction.

[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.320]
Did you go out and buy a whole bunch of bottled water?

[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.020]
No, it was going to get gas for the generator, but then you know what happened.

[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:22.620]
Gas for the generators.

[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:27.160]
You don't think that you're going to lose power doing this if we're at like a little bit of rain.

[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:28.700]
It's pouring out.

[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:28.820]

[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:29.120]
It's pouring out.

[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:30.580]
It's me again, Bob.

[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.800]
Dush when you're done.

[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:32.200]
Okay.

[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:33.920]
That's Bob from FP&L.

[02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:36.000]
Now of course we like FP&L a lot, don't we?

[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:37.340]
Oh yeah, heaps and gods.

[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:39.620]
They're the best.

[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.800]
If a pigeon's got diarrhea man, you're going to lose power.

[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:50.420]
Speaking of that, a man in Columbia, Kentucky, clad Odie and his swimming trunks and wielding a baseball bat, went on a vandalism spree at the home of his estranged wife and her former husband.

[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:54.040]
And then smashed his pickup truck through the back doors of the near county courthouse.

[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.440]
He was a little teal, I guess you might say, and fired up.

[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:05.180]
Royal Graham Webb of Columbia, Kentucky faced multiple charges from the screelized weekend, including driving out of the influence criminal mischief, burglary and driving without insurance.

[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:10.400]
Oh, driving without insurance, if that was a crime in South Florida, man, you'd all be in jail, especially in Dave County.

[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.540]
He made an initial quarter appearance this past Monday, pleading not to be able to do the charges.

[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:20.840]
A breathalyzer measured Webb's blood alcohol level at 0.19, well above the legal limit of 0.08.

[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.580]
Webb using an aluminum bat, allegedly struck three vehicles in the driveway at the home of Steve Franklin.

[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:31.060]
The ex-husband of Webb's estranged wife, Webb's wife, Marsha, moving into the home after she separated from Webb this month and filed her divorce.

[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:43.920]
Webb also allegedly broke into the houselaving damage estimated at 25 grand, among the items severely damaged, were two televisions, two computers, air conditioning unit, three fans, ten mirrors, two compact displays, five doors, several walls, apartures and a pair of three.

[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.580]
He also shattered the turret. That sounds to me like the worst crime of them all, wouldn't it be?

[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:53.360]
Indeed. What you do without that porcelain bus, the family had been away at the Kentucky State Fair.

[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:55.760]
Oh, stayed there with Pat Boone, remember that? No.

[02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:01.900]
Wesley said that Webb then drove to the courthouse door shortly after 9.30 p.m. on Saturday. The courthouse was closed at the time.

[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:06.140]
Thank God, and nobody was interested. And I just got a little worked up. That's the American way.

[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.680]
And just come down to Florida, baby. That's right. You get all exercised in PO, just blow a bunch of people and make you feel better.

[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:17.400]
Because they're all dangerous. They're threatening. Yeah, it's hard to believe, but that's just the way it is.

[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.420]
Just like Jim Clancy said on CNN International yesterday, there were Tuesday. Remember that? No.

[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:29.440]
About Pat Robertson, in the fact that he plays on the ignorance of the American play, I know they have no idea what's going on around the rest of the world.

[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:32.720]
And they know nothing about geography or history or anything, current events.

[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:37.820]
He plays to the fact that there's millions of ignorances in America and look what you got for president.

[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.860]
Abukar, that should prove it, even though they had a steal it.

[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.220]
You know, for years, Armstrong, Florida, Homestead has always treated everybody just like family.

[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:48.060]
And they wonder what's still not for right now to you to join their family.

This is Neil Rogers. This is 516,000.

[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:17.400]
I turned the knob on my radio. I heard a crappy song by JLo must be pale.

[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.400]
Yes.

[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.860]
The North Country Man has made the Guinness Book of World Records in the new entry for the longest eyebrow here.

[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:30.980]
Frank Ames of Cerenaac in Clinton County measured at 3.078 inches or about 7.8 centimeters.

[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:32.840]
You're hard on Andy Rooney.

[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:37.140]
I don't understand why maybe he doesn't have any hair on his head.

[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:40.180]
But people like when you get a haircut don't you have them trim your eyebrows?

[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:42.060]
Sometimes they do it without your skin.

[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.760]
I mean that's because they don't want you to look like some kind of a clown like Andy Rooney.

[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.520]
One of the sloppiest slur...

[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.940]
Oh, there's just so many of these people over the years.

[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:55.340]
And these bushy, nasty looking eyebrows just makes them more gross to look at.

[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:57.320]
Maybe it's a distraction from the rest of their face.

[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:58.080]
Lean at the bread net.

[02:16:58.500 --> 02:16:59.300]
Oh, brother.

[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:00.420]
Yeah, there's another good one.

[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:05.820]
Long. There used to be some like Union guy AFLC. I was at John Lewis.

[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:06.500]
Was that his name?

[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:08.080]
Had those big black eyebrows.

[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:10.340]
Must have weighed about 14 pounds of peace.

[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:11.120]
Now, great.

[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:14.540]
And I don't go get a haircut anymore because I do my own thing with that primer.

[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:16.740]
But I certainly trim my eyebrows.

[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:18.220]
I don't want like big... Oh, Jesus.

[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:19.980]
I don't know why girls like that.

[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:20.840]
It just always has.

[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:23.420]
Aimes told the press Republican of Plantsburg, New York.

[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:28.380]
Aimes journey toward notoriety began almost two years ago when a co-worker at Bombardier Corp noticed the bushy brow.

[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.100]
And suggested you try for a record.

[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:33.540]
Aimes then decided to go for it but discovered that no such category existed.

[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:38.060]
So he made a phone call to Guinness and was sent a bunch of forms through Pilate and rules for officially getting records.

[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:38.640]
He was recognized.

[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:48.300]
Can joy a machine-staff measuring expert at Bombardier measured the hair in February 2004 with Plantsburg Mayor Daniel Stewart and the city's entire common council standing by his witnesses.

[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:53.280]
Now Aimes is on page 24 of the 2006 edition in the Body Parts section.

[02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:55.600]
Well, I wonder what other body parts they have on there.

[02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:56.120]
Huh?

[02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:59.840]
It's crazy how much people want to know about this Aimes said this week.

[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.340]
I've been on radio shows all day. I could build children's hospitals all across the world.

[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.920]
And this is what I would still be known for.

[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:10.100]
Bushy eyebrows. That's the American F and Wayman pathetic.

[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.400]
Peru, Indiana. They've ever been there.

[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:13.980]
I don't even know what hell that is.

[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:14.420]
No.

[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:16.620]
Well, that's a Peru with South Americans.

[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.100]
Latino obsession with drugs. It's in their blood.

[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:22.500]
Not so much the Cubans though except for George.

[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:27.000]
They're more like the Colombians in Manitowalans and I don't know about the Peruvians.

[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:32.320]
Me either. A custodian was arrested for making meth inside the first Baptist church where he worked.

[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.000]
Richard gained mostly 30.

[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:34.900]
But turn it in.

[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.460]
Peru, Indiana, has been charged with felony manufacturing.

[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:39.880]
Methamphetamine within a thousand feet of a youth center.

[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:42.640]
Well, I guess he figured that business would be close by, you know.

[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:43.120]
Sure.

[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.840]
He was arrested Monday after Miami County. That's Miami Ohio.

[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:48.740]
Sheriff Deputy's discovered materials used to make the drug in church.

[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.860]
All right. You've got to be on drugs to go to church.

[02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:52.160]
You have to be a crazy person.

[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.860]
He was released from the Miami County jail on bond, too.

[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:56.780]
They also charged with possession of stolen property.

[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.820]
Possession of precursors within 10 to manufacture meth

[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:01.500]
and maintaining a common nuisance.

[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:04.500]
Deputy searched his home and pick up truck where they found several loaded handguns,

[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.720]
including one that had been reported stolen.

[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.020]
But you know what they didn't do?

[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:09.320]
They didn't shoot.

[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:10.240]
They killed him.

[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:10.980]
I caught Anthony.

[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:13.640]
Well, I just keep thinking about that story.

[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:16.920]
I just didn't know about that call we had that they could advise squad cop that Jack asked

[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:18.000]
to swap the team.

[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:18.840]
Yeah, I dropped it.

[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.960]
Yeah, he had a scale.

[02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.040]
Yeah, maybe I'm going to put your ass on it.

[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:24.920]
God, probably break the bank.

[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:29.140]
But why don't you give me another beer?

[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:31.440]
Oh, what do you get less?

[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:33.300]
I can get a little piece of quiet.

[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:35.320]
I am all.

[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:37.160]
What do you get to do in here, Donald?

[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.040]
When I wait in here, I pull my open,

[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:41.800]
dressed up like Connie Stevens.

[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:42.900]
That's for you.

[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.960]
Tell you. You're supposed to be doing this.

[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:47.120]
Hey, how's that a nice Hawaiian punch?

[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:47.960]
Sure.

[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.020]
Yeah.

[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.100]
Yeah.

[02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:58.300]

Yeah.

[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:10.620]
Yeah.

[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:11.500]
Yeah.

[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:12.300]
Yeah.

[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:14.600]
Yeah.

[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:14.880]

[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:14.880]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:14.980]

[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:15.000]

[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:15.000]

[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:15.000]

[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:15.000]

[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:16.260]
Yeah.

[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:16.700]
Yeah.

[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:16.700]

[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:16.700]

[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:16.700]

[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:16.700]

[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:18.100]

[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:18.100]

Ciao, ciao, Ciao.

[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:20.660]
Bye.

[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.660]
Is God cool?

[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:26.220]
No.

[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:29.640]
Bye.

[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:37.020]

Bye.

[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:47.400]

[02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:47.500]
