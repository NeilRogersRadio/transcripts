[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040]
I'm dying out there

[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.900]
I'm dying out there

[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920]
Miami has a dolphin so the worst football team

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.540]
There are every gamblers right there

[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.720]
There are every four keystreams here

[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.060]
They dance for any touchdowns

[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820]
Not even one field goal

[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.600]
And when you say Miami you're so fucking toilet-folders

[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900]
There are Miami dolphins

[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.040]
Miami dolphins

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.720]
Miami dolphins number

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.020]
How many teams do we believe that it's you?

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.900]
Miami dolphins

[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.140]
Miami dolphins

[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.540]
Go fed on them you'll always lose

[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.840]
But dolphins can't eat anyone can't even beat the spread

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.420]
I wish that Vince Lambert could come back from the dead

[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.800]
Nick Sabin makes them practice while he wears that stupid hat

[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.580]
Till end up like their last pet coach

[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.300]
That loser day wants that

[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900]
And they're the Miami dolphins

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.160]
Miami dolphins

[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.760]
Miami dolphins number

[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.500]
How many teams do we believe that it's you?

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.920]
Miami dolphins

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.180]
Miami dolphins

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.720]
I missed our chula how about you?

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.760]
That's what I'm saying

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.660]
That's what I'm saying

[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.020]
Some dolphins are in trouble with lots of legal stripes

[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.440]
They're tight and like so we're got by beating up his wife

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.980]
Half the team are criminals, the other half sun drugs

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.340]
And this is what will happen when you draft up bunch of bugs

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.860]
And they're the Miami dolphins

[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.220]
Oh Miami dolphins

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.800]
Miami dolphins number

[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400]
How many teams in the league?

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.920]
Miami dolphins

[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.200]
Miami dolphins

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.780]
They really are a motley crew

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.900]
But dolphins have no walking

[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.000]
They've got no passing games

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.320]
I've got just one suggestion

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.560]
They ought to change their name

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.140]
Do the Miami tampons

[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.960]
And why do such a thing

[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.340]
They're good for just one theory

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.400]
And have no second string

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.020]
And they're the Miami dolphins

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.760]
Oh right

[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.240]
Miami dolphins

[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.840]
Miami dolphins number

[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360]
How many teams in the league?

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.120]
I'm the two

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.020]
Miami dolphins

[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.300]
Miami dolphins

[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.300]
Again the fans begin to boo

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.140]
You suck

[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.800]
But dolphins have no balls

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.000]
Except the ones they're playing with

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560]
I just can't wait to see how Ricky Williams takes on it

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.340]
It doesn't matter

[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.020]
It's been ever has another token

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.840]
It seems that this team's playoff dreams have all gone up

[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.300]
So can they're up?

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.100]
Miami dolphins

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400]
Miami dolphins

[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.900]
Miami dolphins number

[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.760]
What the hell 32?

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.100]
Miami dolphins

[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.340]
Miami dolphins

[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.580]
Miami dolphins

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.060]
Now they're through

[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.440]
I'm down here

[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.040]
You know 1037 at 560 WQM

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.000]
Happy Monday to you

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.740]
Bad news from Iraq again

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.820]
Why don't you ever read the good news from Iraq?

[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.660]
Can't find any

[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.340]
Although freedom's on the march

[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.320]
And that direction over the weekend was just fantastic man

[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.140]
Was fantastical

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.360]
And it looks like the draft of the constitution has been like

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.340]
Passed with flying colors

[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.980]
And if not they'll stuff a bunch of paper ballots in there

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.040]
Make sure because these are experts at fixing elections

[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.020]
Can you see I've noticed?

[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.840]
Yeah

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.600]
That's one of the great areas of expertise

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.520]
Let's see, oh look at that

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.420]
Oh yeah, in the internet we got 180 dropouts on there

[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.660]
And what is that all about?

[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.040]
Because it says I guess by now you know the internet isn't working

[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.000]
It's working now, it says it's up

[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.300]
But it's 180 dropouts in a half an hour

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.180]
How's that possible?

[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.520]
That's like after a word like that

[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.840]
Anyway, maybe it's fish now

[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.780]
You chat with Eric about it the little chat room they're not

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.260]
Uh, no

[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.360]
No, well why not?

[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.400]
Now that's right it's only Monday

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.740]
Let's not worry about such things

[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.680]
It says cash money is the currency standard of Yeehaw

[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.620]
Beverly Hill believes in green ather's

[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.360]
Really?

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.160]
Yeehaw

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.500]
That's why when I was taken aback

[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860]
My man who's supposed to be the leader of the free world

[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.000]
El Presidente of the United States of America

[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.820]
Which once upon a time boys and girls

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.440]
Was the greatest country on the face of the earth

[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.640]
And at least so we say

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.880]
And now all of a sudden we got a guy who's here

[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.240]
We're giving him cash money, cash money

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760]
You know that's a whole group of rappers

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.580]
What?

[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.040]
It's like a rap group

[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.140]
The cash money, they're not

[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.340]
I don't think that's what he was talking about

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.980]
I'm just saying

[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.560]
He doesn't impress me as being a rapper kind of a guy

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.780]
You know, I could be wrong about that but I have serious doubts

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.820]
He's a cash money millionaire

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.640]
He is a cash money kind of guy

[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.440]
He likes that cash money for the oil

[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.300]
I'll tell you that already

[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.680]
Didn't do too early in the oil business even though his Saudi buddies tried to bail his ass out

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.460]
But nevertheless

[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.820]
At least he's consistent though and he's failed today

[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.500]
Every endeavor in his life from oil business to baseball to a politics

[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.620]
They did they did steal through oceans for him

[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.460]
But he's still a failure would be an understatement

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.400]
The complement for his performance

[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.320]
Anyway, a senior British military police officer in Iraq

[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.780]
Involved in the investigation of alleged abuse of a record of evidence by soldiers

[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.200]
Have been found dead and a camp in Basra

[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.320]
Oh my god

[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.240]
But he liked that

[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.780]
Huh, cool

[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.240]
So that's the body of captain

[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.320]
And wait until you hear this the reason for death

[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.180]
The body of captain Ken Masters, the commander of 61 section of these special investigators and investigations branched S.I.B.

[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.520]
Or that S.O.B.

[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.000]
Was found in his bed at the airport this weekend

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.040]
The death is being investigated by some S.O.B.

[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.940]
Defense sources said the death was now listen to this

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.440]
The death was not due to hostile action also not due to natural causes

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.300]
How?

[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.500]
Some words in the death

[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.840]
However, it is believed investigators have not found any suicide note

[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.280]
Nor firearms related to the incident

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.380]
Captain Masters was not receiving any medical or psychological treatment

[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.760]
But I think he just died

[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.400]
It wasn't happened

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.780]
It wasn't due to hostile action not due to natural causes or suicide

[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.740]
Well, maybe I'm missing something here

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.260]
Maybe God just called his spiritual

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.980]
Friends and colleagues of captain Masters was married with two children

[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.640]
Said his death has come as a total surprise after he was found

[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.640]
His body was found on Saturday evening

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.920]
A siren sounded over Basra camp

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.400]
Flares were fired in the air and all military personnel were confined to barracks

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.940]
Despite being of middle-ranked captain Masters was in charge of all serious incidents involving the British military in Iraq

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.860]
It wasn't immediately known which particular incident he had been personally involved investigating

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.680]
The British military however is looking to several dozen cases

[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.740]
Several dozen

[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.360]
It was not because of natural causes

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.280]
It wasn't become of hostile action, it wasn't a suicide, no gun, no way

[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.300]
He just made me just had a bad B.M. or something

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.280]
It was his time

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.540]
Maybe the Lord is one of these things that's going on

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.160]
We got your hurricanes and mudslides and flooding in New England and Guatemala and New York and all over the place

[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.740]
The tsunami last year

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.900]
Earthquakes in Pakistan and Kashmir

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.760]
Is not what they say there over there, the Indians Kashmir and Tophis

[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.420]
And the bird flu of course is right on the horizon out there

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.080]
If you're not panicking about that, go ahead and have a good time

[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.320]
Of course we don't have any

[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.980]
We don't have any of our communities

[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.060]
We don't have one human being as a contracted bird flu from another human being yet

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.000]
But in the meantime, but it would be better

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.320]
Another way to keep the entire world on pins and needles

[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.420]
Remember that song, pins and needles by...

[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.620]
Wasn't that needles and pins by the searchers?

[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.200]
That's it

[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.460]
Needles and pinsah, which I think had some of the...

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.340]
It's the Opinza I remember

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.560]
That's how they say it

[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.280]
That's how they say it

[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.720]
That's how they say it

[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.380]
Needles and pinsah, which I found very very Italian

[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.000]
Which is strange because they were brits

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.380]
452 votes

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.960]
What do you think is the cause of all the recent natural disasters

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.540]
All of these terrible things that are going on in the world

[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.080]
He gets disgusted and pissed off

[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.960]
He has bad aims sometimes, but sooner or later, like the grassroots said, sooner or later he's going to get you

[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.620]
The end-bays are near 23, so all of you, he's in masters

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.380]
And all of you, Jew, is better except Jesus, or are going to give you what for

[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.040]
We love Israel, but you're going to get it

[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.480]
It's the Gaysfall 22, like everything else

[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.320]
It's so vague

[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.400]
And who gives a crap 17?

[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.460]
452 votes, in about 40 minutes, Josh Cornish is extrapolating that

[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.040]
He's thinking we're going to make a thousand again today

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.160]
I don't think I know

[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.980]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.880]
Do you think you know what?

[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320]
Got them votes, buddy

[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.580]
I'll tell you one thing, you better give George the cause of about 135 bucks if you want that passport

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.800]
If you want him to take you with you to Amsterdam

[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.340]
Anyway, before I do the break, the funniest person on the face of the earth, I told us to George

[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.540]
And you didn't disagree with me either

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.980]
No, no, it's a bomb

[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.120]
And he's not known as a comedian

[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.260]
I don't think this is my opinion, I think this is a fact

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.040]
The funniest living person in the world today is Al Goldstein

[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]
Now he's still

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.080]
I'm a fat Jew

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.880]
He's got his issues as they say

[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.040]
This is Neil Wright

[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.420]
This is 5.62 AF

[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.060]
Pramah, I'm a fat patient

[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.940]
That's a good name

[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.480]
Welcome

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.640]
Oh, right

[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640]
Oh

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.640]
Oh

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.640]
Oh

[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.080]
Oh

[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.640]
149, 114, 115, 16 WQAM

[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.080]
Little more on news from Iraq and none of it seems to be very good

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.400]
US warplanes and helicopters bomb two villages near the rest of city of Ramadi

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.680]
Don't you love that word restive?

[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.380]
Was it?

[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.540]
Not anymore I guess

[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.440]
Kill him and estimated 70 militants, the military said yesterday

[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.120]
Though witnesses said at least 39 of those 70 dead were civilians

[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.400]
Oh, more of that pain in the escalator will damage over there again

[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.520]
Those people got out of the way for crying out loud

[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.740]
We got bombs to drop, we got people to kill

[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.040]
Because after all, it's not the main goal of this whole mission over there

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.080]
It's not to bring democracy or crap like that

[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.900]
I think even your president would, you know, if a push game to shove

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.820]
Would probably admit we're there to kill some people

[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.360]
That's it

[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.280]
Heaps of them

[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.120]
Anyway, I want to get, oh look at that we got a couple of calls coming in

[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.040]
I had my own agenda, I got a great poll for tomorrow that I was inspired by one of our commercials

[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.560]
Yeah, I'm not going to, no I'm not going to tell you what it is

[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.960]
Okay, I'm going to be calling in about it

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.120]
But you like it, we've never done it before either

[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.620]
Wow

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.940]
The spot was and had the happy days theme on it

[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.280]
There was a good theme

[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.580]
Yes, yes it was

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.600]
There was a good theme and the only problem is the show sucked

[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.640]
I mean, really, really good

[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.760]
The characters on it were just obnoxious and disgusting

[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.060]
Yeah

[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.420]
Oh, he gives me spiel keys man, that's Henry Winkler

[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.320]
I mean, she, I'm sorry, hey Henry

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.820]
You're fair

[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.200]
Yeah, she's another one

[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.620]
I bet a lot of money on it

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.600]
WBQAM, hello

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.940]
First call back from vacation, it ought to be fantastic, hello

[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.140]
Yes, Mr. Warrant

[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.940]
Yeah, okay, and it was

[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.280]
A different pony boy, a slightly different pitch

[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.000]
WBQAM, hello

[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.480]
Sit well

[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.840]
Okay, so we're two for two on that

[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.600]
Like I said, I wanted to hear from some of these Julios outfit that you insist listening to

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.120]
Thanks to our close personal friend Fatboy

[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.020]
Got us the numbers from the spring book, the Hispanic numbers

[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.040]
Because I've been asking for these for weeks and weeks

[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.220]
Did Duff come up with these?

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.680]
Did Maddie Bell help us out?

[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.000]
No

[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.700]
Did Clarence don't have time for us because what do we got to do with sports?

[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.740]
I will say this for Duff, I can't say much, but I will say this

[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.280]
He's our only hope in that building, anyone in the why?

[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.080]
No, I don't want

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.440]
No, not that

[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.080]
Oh, why?

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.000]
No, it's because he's not a sports nerd

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.500]
Well, that's what I was thinking

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.600]
I see, I thought you were thinking of something else

[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.800]
Yeah, but at any rate, no seriously, he's the only hope we got

[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.820]
Because he realizes the importance of this show on the radio station

[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.580]
And it's supposed to other people who figure that were like a necessary evil

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.800]
I guess is the best way they would put up with us

[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.660]
Like Clarence, you know

[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.780]
How about doing this for sure today? Come on, you can do this for sure

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.800]
Then come on, you can do it

[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.700]
That kind of crap

[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.120]
And anyway, here's our Hispanic numbers from back in the spring book

[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.420]
The fall book by the summer book, Summer Fall Winter Spring

[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.740]
Remember her from Mahavir Nudy?

[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.060]
Yes

[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.240]
The Summer Fall Winter Spring

[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.660]
And Dayton Allen

[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.580]
I'm actually a book of Brian remembers all of that

[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.460]
She would think you know

[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.480]
It's good to be old, even though you're going to die much sooner than the young people

[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.880]
But nevertheless, you never know that kind of thing in Iraq

[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.720]
He just up and died

[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.520]
For hate

[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.940]
Wasn't natural causes, wasn't moral natural

[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.960]
He died?

[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.320]
No

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.180]
It was unnatural

[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.960]
Anyway, we're number five in men

[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.460]
Men 2554, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Hispanic now

[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.900]
That's not just Cuban, by the way

[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.480]
You don't get all whipped up with that Cuban stuff

[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.000]
Are you Cuban haters out there?

[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.400]
It's Nicaragua, is it 100, is it El Salvadorans and Brazilians and people from La Rea

[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400]
Publicity, Dominican, and we're my leaving out

[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.080]
Mexico?

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.020]
I think we got in the Mexican Columbia

[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.000]
Colombians?

[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.740]
Oh yeah, yeah

[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.840]
But I believe it's a George to bring in the Colombians and Bolivians and Uraguans and the

[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.800]
Argentinians

[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.280]
Or what?

[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.560]
Oh, and an Argentinian meatman, I'm telling you

[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.680]
Warner Clemperer said it was the best

[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.700]
Oh, that's another thing I saw in biography was the Bob Crane story

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.400]
Oh, that was really strange

[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.060]
Oh yeah

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.800]
But I was so enjoy it before I get to these numbers I was so enjoy it before the show Saturday

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.640]
Which was the El Goldstein comment

[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.340]
They had the, which I love the biography channel

[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.280]
I hate the Irish

[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.540]
They had the Larry Flip biography on there

[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.660]
Well you talk about a guy that was just I mean even that the

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.260]
Eversy Bob Gucci only speak

[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.480]
Yeah, yeah

[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.840]
Takes himself very importantly and talks like like a real

[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.240]
And an intellectual pornographer something like that you know Mr. Penhouse

[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.040]
Yeah, exactly

[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.520]
But even he when they have heard it came down to the US they they acquitted everybody else

[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.520]
And that last trial they threw Larry Flip and Jail trying for like I forget a thousand years

[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.780]
And it was only inter for six days

[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:35.420]
But they just railroaded his ass and the same thing with our friend Al

[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.960]
You know this is all the pornographers in America sooner later they get them

[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.500]
And they sent him like records Island

[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.520]
That's a big club you want wherever else

[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.420]
So they had clips on there from a guy named Rudy Maxa

[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.720]
Who if anybody else out there and probably the only person in North America watches the show

[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.000]
It's a good show

[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.740]
It's called Europe Travels or something like that with Rudy Maxa

[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.280]
And it's like a travel show on PBS United

[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.340]
It used to be at 7th or 8th of clock

[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.000]
And they should with different cities Amsterdam and Paris and Rome and Florence and whatever

[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.860]
So Rudy Maxa who comes on air like this real intellectual because he's on PBS

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.060]
I know he's over there being a pervert you know just like me

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.180]
And the proof is that he was good friends with Larry Flint

[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.080]
So he's on air a lot clips on this biography and the other person on air is Al Goldstein

[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.460]
And having known Al for years and years and years

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.060]
Who of course we know what he does

[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.520]
You're looking for glory hole

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.660]
You take it for granted when you know somebody

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.140]
But we haven't seen him in a long time and he's gone through all the hell that he's gone through

[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.560]
And he's got only knows what soup kitchen he's hanging out at today

[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.600]
He's hysterical everything he says it's the voice

[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.520]
It's the way he says it's the sarcasm

[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.680]
It's the absolute holding nothing back

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.860]
It's just great

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.860]
He can't help it he couldn't hold it back if he tried

[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.320]
Yeah I mean he's not a problem person

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.720]
Here at 2am we view Al as a problem person but nevertheless

[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.160]
He's just funny as hell

[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.500]
Oh yeah he's a panic

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.460]
Although he does worth him a little bit to be around but nevertheless

[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.720]
He nice job there Al we're praying for you

[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.900]
I wonder what he ate on young Kipper

[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.500]
No actually we really like to see him again because he

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.980]
Because by necessity he went on a starvation diet because he had to

[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.680]
And I guess he lost about like 7000 pounds something like that

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.720]
It's like walk around by a mini-mouse

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.640]
It's like carrying carpenter on a bad day

[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.560]
And we were in maybe Kate Moss

[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.560]
So he's slimmed down, slim and trim

[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.080]
That's what records are in a little video

[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.780]
Anyway those Hispanic numbers this is some shocking information which I think I'll say for after the break

[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.620]
We got 517 votes in the first hour on the pool

[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.480]
How do you like that, Chi?

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.000]
You like your record today?

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.500]
You think?

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.000]
Maybe?

[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.280]
During the show I think we did over 111 day a couple of weeks ago

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.660]
What was George doing during the show on your famous pools?

[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.320]
How much?

[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.160]
About 30

[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.740]
Come on George

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.240]
35 votes not bad

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.740]
30 man

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.860]
I think Greg had a point

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.360]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.220]
Hey Greg, you're here with this 516 QA

[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.260]
This is the Neil Rogers show

[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.860]
Two people think George this is your brain

[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.000]
Go go go go go go

[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.200]
Any questions?

[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.700]
I got a 40-second try

[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.680]
It is just simply so deeply

[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.320]
That was love y'all

[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.700]
It's Russell Seymour

[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.260]
Welcome to their poetry

[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.920]
Today, I'll put Seva's head to head match up

[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.660]
Luporigno, the Smiley Madlin

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.400]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.820]
Madlin

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.940]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:35.940]

[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.680]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:38.680]

[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.560]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:39.560]

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.720]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.540]
Madlin

[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:43.640]
You're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.780]
you're the thing with your shadow

[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.500]
Madlin

[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.080]
Hey Greg

[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.420]
Good morning, America faces the grey threat

[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.120]
Someday,η stability, κα

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.280]
Our government is doing everything in its power

[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.940]
to confront and defeat that threat

[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.260]
We're expanding in strengthen the terrorism

[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.120]
These efforts are paying off

[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.220]
We've established the terrorists

[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.380]
from the mountains of central Asia

[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.220]
to the deserts of the Middle East

[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.280]
and the Horn of Africa to the Philippines

[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.000]
There is more to do.

[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.020]
In the next several months, suicide bombings, the headings, and other horrific acts can and

[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.800]
should be accelerated and we're working toward that goal.

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.960]
We're doing everything in our power to invite disaster and by staying focused and determined,

[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.240]
we will prevail.

[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.500]
Thank you for listening.

[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.500]
Great job, WN.

[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.020]
He's doing it.

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.180]
It's 11 o'clock at 5'60 WQM on a fantastic Monday.

[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.780]
The sunny shine is going to be 61 degrees here today.

[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.380]
How do you like that?

[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:37.980]
Are you impressed?

[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.300]
That's nice.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.800]
It's looking be dubious.

[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.580]
It looks like this morning.

[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.240]
I mean, you know, acceptable that is.

[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.840]
By the way, Ted Kennedy is discovered that it's a good idea to help people under drowning.

[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.100]
Better late than ever, Teddy.

[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.400]
I like Ted Kennedy a lot.

[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.300]
We love Ted Kennedy on the show, but Marie Jockepectney probably would have appreciated

[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.740]
the interest that he showed over the weekend.

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.500]
It was a lot of these things.

[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.220]
Ted Kennedy was enjoying a relaxing morning yesterday at his family's compound when he looked

[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.040]
out his window by 11 o'clock and saw six fishermen in distress stranded along a breakwater

[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.120]
with the wind whipping and coming tides swirling around the fishermen.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.920]
Kennedy called 911 and reported the situation.

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.020]
Concerned for the men, the Senator boarded a small boat to try to rescue them, but rescue

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.100]
crews met him at the scene.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.800]
I asked Farc kept and Craig Ferrinkov said this.

[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.540]
Kennedy then waited on the shore to make sure the men were safe.

[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.300]
The fishermen in their mid 20s were treated at the scene for minor hypothermia and release

[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.020]
Ferrinkov said.

[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.420]
Then they all probably got invited over to Teddy's for a brew or two.

[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:33.900]
What do you think?

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.680]
And some chowda.

[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.440]
Maybe some chowda would be good.

[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.820]
I see we're not getting any more dropouts so I guess Eric doesn't have to like confedulate

[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.340]
about that.

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.040]
I guess you get the load on on that or not.

[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.300]
He said earlier that we were out and dropping out and we told the people here and they

[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.120]
said, eh don't bother us.

[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.820]
Why are you talking to us?

[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.400]
Why are you talking to us?

[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.560]
Why are you bothering us?

[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.700]
What do you people have to do with sports with games?

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.980]
What's wrong with you people?

[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.380]
What do you got to do with ball games?

[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:04.760]
See people as much as I love a lot of sports, people whose lives are just their whole life

[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.480]
is ball games.

[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.180]
They need to be exterminated.

[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.760]
Just when a doubt take them out like Pat Robertson would say, take them out.

[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.620]
Like Harry Carey would say, take them out to the ball game.

[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.340]
Something like that.

[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.020]
544 votes at 11.02 it is shocking.

[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.660]
It's true.

[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:19.340]
See?

[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:19.700]
Yeah.

[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.980]
Even Diane Feinstein agrees.

[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:21.840]
Hey Diane.

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:22.780]
You're fairy.

[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.540]
544 votes.

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.540]
What do you think is the cause of all the recent natural disasters in the world?

[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.120]
So Schmidt happens 190.

[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.680]
That seems like a logical thing.

[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.820]
Crap happens baby.

[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.220]
That's the nature of the world.

[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.200]
Global warming 148.

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.540]
And there she is.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.180]
There's Harriet Myers.

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.540]
See the celebration of mediocrity is epitomized by.

[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.560]
In fact, that'll be a good poll for later in a week.

[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.720]
George W. Bush.

[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.420]
That's the he's the epitome of mediocrity.

[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.380]
Harry and Myers.

[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.980]
Downtown Brownie Brown.

[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.280]
All of these people.

[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.940]
544 votes.

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.660]
We're paying for the sins of Bush 94.

[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.560]
God is pissed off 34.

[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.920]
The Lord is wrath waxes hot baby.

[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.940]
Can't you feel it?

[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.980]
Especially like in the middle of July, like right there in a hellendale beach.

[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.860]
It feel the wrath of God waxing hot and all those old Jews.

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.420]
Hot wax.

[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.560]
It's the Gaysfall 28.

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.460]
Like everything else.

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.140]
You're fairy.

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.280]
The end days are near 25.

[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.520]
And who cares 24?

[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.840]
The end days are near.

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.040]
That's what they're saying now.

[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.460]
Miss Robertson, she was on there again a couple of days ago, ranting and raving.

[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.900]
This is the same guy that said, let's assassinate Hugo Chavez.

[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.080]
And the media still put him on here because the media are a bunch of crazy people.

[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.640]
Last night on that fantastic show, which I would give you your left nut if they would

[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.040]
just put that show on American TV.

[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.700]
You can have them in the boy from CBC.

[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:39.300]
And it was about the way the media covered the war in Vietnam and then the way that they

[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.020]
started manipulating the media and the Pentagon would never let it happen again.

[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.340]
And the Iraq war won and now of course the Korea-Rak attack.

[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.400]
And it's just the scariest hell.

[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.920]
It's terrifying when you see the truth.

[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.220]
Anybody that tries to tell the truth, well guess what?

[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.380]
Just like that British intelligence officer in Bajra, a bank all of a sudden.

[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.980]
Maybe they gave him like Marilyn Monroe.

[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.120]
Hey, look, we have a little animal.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.020]
We have a little animal.

[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.620]
Racko.

[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.000]
Yeah.

[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:02.700]
Right?

[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.340]
It's hard to trace because when somebody dies, who's going to look inside the animal?

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:06.640]
Racko.

[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.520]
Anyway, here's the spring numbers from Hispanics in South Florida.

[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.400]
Number five.

[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.840]
Number one is WAMRFM.

[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.020]
A radio one more.

[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.520]
This is among men 25 to 54.

[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.160]
Not all you old Julio's out there with your green teeth in Domino Park.

[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.940]
We're listening to Radio Mom B all that.

[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.660]
Oh, it's me down.

[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.680]
Go to hell.

[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.100]
I crap.

[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.660]
We're second-tiered to that crap.

[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.020]
OK.

[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:25.760]
Get with it.

[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.560]
Get with the program.

[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.320]
Get involved in America like me.

[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.380]
I mean, like in Canada.

[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.020]
Radio Al-Mor is number one.

[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.600]
I got let's see.

[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.920]
What's the share here?

[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.660]
Do we have a share?

[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.180]
It's nice to share.

[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:36.940]
Not sure.

[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.760]
There is no.

[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.440]
I don't quite rating.

[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.340]
In fact, every year rating is 2.1%.

[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.660]
I don't know what that means.

[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.760]
Because these aren't shares.

[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.440]
At any rate, CMQFM has got a two point.

[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:47.800]
Oh.

[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.020]
Oh.

[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.660]
Let's speak it out.

[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.200]
You better get used to that, Joel Feinberg.

[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.600]
Because Friday, when a summer book comes out,

[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.000]
you're going to see a lot of that number.

[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.340]
Oh.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:53.700]
Point.

[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.420]
Yeah.

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.740]
Talking about a man, it's just pissing daddy's money down the toilet.

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.460]
Who are you kidding?

[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.620]
Oh, but we got, we're not in a broadcasting business.

[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.940]
We're more interested in marketing.

[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.680]
There was one of the great quotes of all time.

[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.280]
Maybe they do a better marketing.

[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.120]
Although I understand that the only reason Joe's got so many spots and issues,

[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.920]
because that's the only way they can sell on it at stations.

[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.940]
So he's got all spots radio, which remember how he used to scream.

[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.560]
And rightfully so about the way they put you up the format on the worst theme.

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.140]
Remember that?

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.560]
Sure.

[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.240]
And how they hit all his spots in there.

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.600]
I wonder how poor Joe feels now there.

[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.480]
There's the guy that has gotten used and abused.

[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.920]
No wonder he cusses out Joel Feinberg all the time.

[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.880]
No wonder they're always in that cat fight over there.

[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.840]
CMQFM is number two.

[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.040]
They got it and tied with the WXDJ.

[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.260]
Also with the two point.

[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.460]
Oh.

[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.320]
I don't know what that is WXDJ to you.

[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:35.660]
No.

[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.160]
WBGG, big 1.6.

[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.060]
What is that?

[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.000]
Big my ass.

[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.380]
Yeah, that's what I heard.

[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.840]
QAM right on there.

[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.260]
And it's 1.4%.

[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.800]
That's us.

[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.940]
We're number five among Julios.

[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.640]
Now again, this is like everybody.

[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.140]
All of Julios, no spigot English.

[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.800]
Life, then coast, then love 94 and then radio smegma.

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.780]
I mean after that it's really like small potatoes.

[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.500]
See, I don't understand this.

[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.360]
You know, this only adds up to 24%.

[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.700]
Well, I don't get it.

[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.760]
You know what I mean?

[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.280]
Right.

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.440]
I guess the rest of the audience is something else?

[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.660]
No, no, no.

[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.760]
I don't know what that.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.760]
Oh, maybe 24% of the whole audience,

[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.540]
so the South Florida audiences is Hispanic.

[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.760]
Maybe that I don't know what it means.

[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.840]
Radio Romanceia is way down there with radio,

[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.640]
written more wacky.

[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.480]
See, 0.7% of the men because only men over the age of 100

[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.400]
listen to radio, mom, all the domino playing,

[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.020]
fiddle screamers and other screamers.

[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.180]
HDR, which I have no idea what that is.

[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.800]
That's a new FM.

[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.060]
Well, which one did that used to be?

[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.860]
Who the hell can keep track the way that they keep

[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.040]
Germany stations around?

[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.780]
I sure is only HDR.

[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.580]
That's the isn't that the one I used to be.

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.380]
This go party for now.

[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.420]
That's the rock station.

[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.100]
93.

[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.200]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.600]
IOD is way down there, which includes rush.

[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.360]
How do you like that?

[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.320]
That includes rush from the noon to two hours.

[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.340]
We kicked his assing them on Julios 1.4 to a

[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.120]
12.6% more than 2 to 1.

[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.280]
A 0.6.

[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.160]
How do you like that rush?

[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.000]
And who's that Nazi they got on before him?

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.160]
That Tampa, a clown.

[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.180]
Glenn, Glenn, Glenn,

[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:58.720]
oh yeah.

[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.400]
The torture or the torture.

[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.380]
Yeah, the one who wants to torture everybody.

[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.640]
In fact, maybe he can look with our attorney general.

[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.160]
Mm-hmm.

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.620]
Why 100 magic power way down there?

[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.660]
0.6.5.

[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.900]
Radio Swabe, which nobody knows what they're like.

[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.760]
I.N.Z.

[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.140]
That's air America 0.3 and QBA 0.3.

[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.840]
Wow, time for like number 20.

[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.000]
So there you go.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.580]
I guess all thanks, fat boy.

[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.260]
Head boys make a little bit of a comeback.

[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.440]
Not much, but a little bit.

[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.560]
There is a hurricane.

[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.300]
Willie is that hurricane wet Willie.

[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.080]
It's likely become a hurricane.

[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.780]
Oh, no.

[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.860]
That's bad news.

[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.760]
It's not in the arrest though.

[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.620]
It's right down there in your.

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.780]
South of what is that central America?

[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:36.400]
Right.

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.800]
I got to be honest with that.

[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.240]
I need to refresh a course of my geography

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.300]
because I don't know from central America no more.

[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.900]
You know, once upon a time, in fact, I don't even know what

[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.780]
happened to countries in the world.

[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.620]
Our name didn't anymore.

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.840]
You know, when you see my N.R. which used to be Burma, of course,

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.300]
what was wrong?

[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.420]
What was wrong with Burma?

[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:50.960]
Huh?

[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.480]
Is there something wrong with Burma?

[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:52.840]
No.

[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.560]
Oh, I see it's Honduras and Nicaragua.

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.340]
Nicaragua.

[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.300]
It's about like a side of what's a Nicaragua.

[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:57.940]
Nicaragua.

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.520]
I sure miss those days, man.

[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.980]
When we used to have all his professional Julios on here,

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.840]
including Ana Squeek with a big ass.

[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.020]
Right.

[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.600]
Don't keep Curry said, man, she was a hell of a piece.

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.220]
What?

[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.620]
I can't see it on here.

[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.880]
Oh, look at that.

[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.740]
And now it's on a way to Cancun again, man.

[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.700]
If you look at Mexicans, can't catch a break.

[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.440]
Looking further.

[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.340]
Oh, no.

[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.320]
And now, oh, no.

[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.940]
You see something I think that Pat Robertson and I think Franklin

[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.180]
Graham had his thumb right on it.

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.500]
God has really pissed off with those.

[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.040]
Yeah, you fight against.

[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.820]
He's after New Orleans again.

[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.460]
Remember what he just saw them in Gamora?

[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.120]
He saw them.

[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.420]
110 mile an hour, category two by eight o'clock Saturday morning.

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.340]
And it's invented on a past.

[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.280]
Some of the bringing note over towards the Texas area.

[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.500]
So there's still a lot of uncertainty.

[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.600]
Yeah, but they we know they got it right now.

[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.380]
I had it straight for an Orleans again.

[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.880]
I'll be dang, man.

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.600]
They're going to need a lot of cash money.

[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.320]
You know what?

[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.560]
In Orleans, tag net.

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.660]
It dug Thompson from the Capitol Hill Blue website,

[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.660]
which you're just finally warmed up to a little bit.

[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.500]
Because you're just slow.

[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.160]
You know, he's a hard ass.

[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:56.640]
That's right.

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.120]
But he writes the rant.

[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.120]
It's a, in fact, I know it is even smirking chimps using this

[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.460]
condo.

[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.740]
They because they're so impressed by it.

[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]
And rightfully so, okay.

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.420]
Smirking chimp my ass.

[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.260]
And any American rights dog Thompson,

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.680]
the founder and publisher of Capitol Hill Blue dot com,

[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.520]
which you people ought to be reading every single day.

[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.260]
You ought to be reading near Rogers dot com.

[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.260]
Read those stories every day and reach your brain.

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:16.940]
Learn something.

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.240]
Okay.

[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.080]
Find out more than just a stupid propaganda.

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.140]
That's past audio by people from the networks.

[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.440]
Boy, did they do a job on that CBC and that.

[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.080]
Show last night at documentary, the passionate eye,

[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.140]
rip in Dan, rather, and Tom Broca and the late Peter Jennings,

[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.720]
a Peter Quetzmog and then Faggot's see Peter found out those

[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.420]
Faggot's okay to late.

[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.420]
Oh, you know, I do love that bit though.

[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.300]
Peter Jennings, what a life.

[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.460]
Oh, I mean, tremendous.

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.320]
So it calls the Silla Georgia.

[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:43.920]
Hello.

[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.520]
Hi there.

[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.020]
Hi.

[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.320]
First of all, Larry, I want to thank you for channeling

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.940]
Mr. Jennings from beyond the great force.

[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.400]
Okay.

[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.940]
Peter, how are things in hell?

[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.020]
Well, it's hard.

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.200]
I never thought it was going to be anything but hard.

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.720]
So I guess now you're really a smoker, huh?

[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.480]
I think it goes with the territories with the Taurion.

[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.940]
Oh, camouflage for Peter Jennings.

[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.280]
Hello.

[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.120]
Hey, Peter.

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.120]
Do you know any dead celebrity joke?

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:06.820]
No man.

[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.180]
And if I did, I wouldn't say so.

[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.480]
Well, the city can says hello.

[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.920]
But yeah, Peter, other rumors true is hell really a couple

[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.120]
degree cooler than the center of a McDonald apple pie.

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.080]
I think the answer is yes.

[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.580]
But you've asked a question that a lot of people in the

[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.000]
country are going to ask today.

[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.400]
Summer said Kentucky for Peter Jennings.

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:28.720]
Hello.

[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.840]
Hi, gentlemen.

[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.480]
Hi.

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.860]
Mr. Jennings.

[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.040]
Is there a lean beyond music in hell?

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.620]
Yes.

[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.920]
And it just happens.

[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.540]
It goes on and on and on and on for hour and hour and hour

[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.120]
after end.

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.740]
Oh, my.

[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.940]
I think that would make my ears bleed.

[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.220]
Oh, many do indeed.

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.780]
One more call we have on it left.

[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.000]
Downers grow Illinois.

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.560]
Hello.

[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.820]
Mr. Jennings, what would you like for Christmas?

[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.940]
Sodom Hussein.

[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.940]
Oh, so so down on your wish list.

[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:54.440]
Yes.

[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.480]
And as the George Bush, George Bush is also a Peter Jennings.

[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.080]
Yeah, thank you.

[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:58.700]
It's always pretty.

[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:58.940]
Thanks.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.920]
Really nice to see you.

[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920]
I got news for a man.

[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.700]
If there is a hell of George W, he'll be he'll be there.

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.800]
Trust me with bills on that reservation.

[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.180]
And they want they don't take cash money there in hell.

[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.540]
You can't get out with cash money.

[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.460]
Plastic 570.

[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.180]
He is 571 votes on that pull man.

[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:14.940]
We are so impressed.

[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.640]
We're going to have like over 700 by noon.

[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.840]
How do you like that, George?

[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.920]
Court is we might do 45,000 votes during the show today.

[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.360]
Just to just to piss off the old fineberg with her

[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.280]
crosses the street.

[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.400]
Although that'll happen on Friday automatically.

[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.640]
I'm predicting eight.

[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.520]
Oh point.

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.360]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.220]
As far as like infinity.

[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.540]
Oh, and they believe me infinity.

[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.760]
And they're interested in that station.

[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.800]
Oh, I see Jefferson pilot got bought out.

[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.340]
Do you see that?

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.660]
No, anybody here in any industry news?

[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.560]
No, not me either.

[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.140]
Bottom line.

[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.760]
I guess I'll see that.

[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.740]
Thompson's thing for after they were little teas there.

[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.880]
Okay, keep the isn't it?

[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.480]
I thought I'm going to read a lot of stuff today because we want to give a lot of these

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.440]
brilliant calls in like those first two we had the first hour.

[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.640]
Those are really special.

[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.340]
This will not be good.

[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.080]
W.C.Y.M.

[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.300]
Hello.

[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.620]
Good morning.

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.320]
I'm called Neil.

[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:54.780]
How are you?

[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.120]
Yes sir.

[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:55.600]
Great.

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.640]
Yeah, you know what?

[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.520]
There's going to be a big party down here.

[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.180]
Southwest Florida in 2008 when it's crony administration is.

[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.600]
Heist and our gaunt long gone.

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.060]
And and and the hammer needs to go on a diet to fed you.

[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.620]
Yeah.

[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.880]
And anything else I could think of that.

[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.780]
Yeah, 1113 at 560 WQM when you.

[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.840]
Where do we black baby in this country in your primary would go down?

[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.180]
You heard.

[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.260]
René had me from hell.

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.140]
I'm Mary Kenny of human.

[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.980]
Now all of a sudden she said something.

[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.260]
That's why I'm talking in my phone.

[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:57.860]
Because when René walked out and by the law she made the whole world

[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.380]
they come some kind of fruit.

[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.800]
Now people everywhere wonder what she meant by this

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.540]
a moment don't you like my hair.

[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.020]
It's true that I walked out.

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.120]
I was disgusted by the cowboy hat.

[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.320]
He always kept on his head.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.360]
Now there is no doubt that he's a pony.

[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.680]
I'll pay Alamoni just so I can get out.

[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.160]
Hey Kenny.

[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.720]
You fairly.

[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.140]
Now are we supposed to know who Kenny Chasney is or care about that?

[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.880]
Well, you know, oh, because the rumors were about him and I don't want to mention the quarterback

[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.320]
Peyton Sandy Peyton Manning for the Indianapolis Coast.

[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.700]
Because then Josh will get all upset.

[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.720]
Why is that?

[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:42.540]
I don't know.

[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.940]
It's your hero isn't it?

[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.400]
Gay they are.

[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.540]
Yeah, that's my hero.

[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.560]
I thought that was you said he's the best quarterback in history of the National Football League

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.200]
was Sandy Peyton Manning.

[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:51.440]
Yeah.

[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.820]
Doug Thompson the rant from Capitol Hill Blue says in angry America this nation of art that's right he's not he's no

[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.380]
Brian Greasy.

[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.960]
I'll tell you that.

[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.580]
This nation of ours is in a really bad mood says Doug Thompson.

[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.880]
According to the latest polls only 28% of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction.

[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.800]
The lowest in a decade and most points of finger are blamed with the occupants of Capitol Hill and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.360]
Poles say American anger is in an all time high.

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.960]
You don't need to pull to figure that out.

[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:24.580]
Just wander down to the local coffee shop for breakfast and listen to the anger spilling out over the war in Iraq skyrocketing energy prices and the government out of control.

[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.700]
More and more Americans are angry since retired general Wesley Clark Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 who weighed a lot of meals at the deli then.

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:40.020]
They're angry about the president's incompetence and his general unwillingness to acknowledge with some humility that he's made some terrible and tragic mistakes regarding the mission in Iraq.

[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.760]
Anger toward the president and government is not limited to Democrats or liberals conservatives and Republicans who are increasing this pleasure on a variety of fronts.

[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.940]
Bush clearly has retreated from the promising made to the country on September 20th 2001.

[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.200]
The night he cleared the war on terror rights conservative commentator Stephen M. Worshawski.

[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:03.060]
The entire conceptual framework underlying the Bush doctrine has been replaced in just a few short years with a Vietnam era retread.

[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:10.220]
RIP rest in peace to Bush doctrine some say the anger is long overdue and I would say absolutely correction.

[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.940]
Our company they find itself more bitterly divided than in any time since the war in Vietnam from the party of loyal opposition on down.

[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:23.020]
We have been what I suspect is a silent majority of the centers but the time for silence is now over writes Jeff Berkens Dean in counter punch.

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.960]
The silence is ending and the people are going to make their voices heard yet others wonder if the anger comes too late.

[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.820]
In the case of Iraq the American public has failed its soldiers editorializes the Minneapolis star Tribune.

[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:40.200]
We didn't prevent the Bush administration from spreading their blood in an honest military war based on contrab concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.280]
President Bush and those around him lied and the rest of us let him. Harsh yes true also yes.

[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.500]
The angriest goes over another parts of our society domestic violence is on the rise.

[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.600]
If today is a normal day in our country three women will be murdered by husbands or boyfriends tomorrow few more will die.

[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:03.220]
The next day three again the Arizona Republic editorializes many more will be beaten or raped screamed at or shoved against the wall in the fit of anger by men who say they love them they lie.

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:11.440]
According to FBI statistics crimes of violence rose sharply in the last year coinciding with what polls to say is an increase in anger in our society.

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:18.260]
We are pissed off and fired up baby and searching for writings about American and American anger I came across these comments right Stark Thompson.

[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:27.400]
For us to be loyal Americans we can't be random and hypocritical about it for years being American is supposedly meant to be unified as one and supporting equality on all levels from gender to class to race.

[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:37.300]
The land of the free and the equal seems to be the land of the confused in the phony let's get it together these words come from Brittany Garrett freshman at Murray State University writing in the campus newspaper she continues.

[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:46.700]
What I'm calling into question is the apparent hypocrisy that existed in American life where angry only when we're allowed to be patriotic when it's popular and are supposedly living under the great American ideals.

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:57.320]
When our children see the problems so clearly it's time for all of us to step back and think think as in like a reaser of Franklin would say think remember that's all do you got a cute up there to some more thing.

[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.400]
You have a thing huh about let's hear it you have it.

[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.220]
I know that was quick that was amazing.

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.000]
It really was.

[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.160]
Altogether.

[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:22.800]
Even your history knows it's happy to think it on the thinking kept pick off the skull cap pick off that smother from your head and put on a thinking cap and start thinking about these things all of these.

[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.200]
All of these things before it's too late.

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.160]
Oh look at that.

[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.060]
There's the dumb master.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.380]
I can't trust you.

[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:31.840]
Yeah.

[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.160]
Come push me out of my ass.

[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.260]
614 votes on a pool.

[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:43.380]
What do you think is the cause of all the recent natural disasters man the world is like spinning around like out of control with the Constitution.

[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.260]
Yeah that's true.

[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.660]
Schmidt happens to 16 but he's going to send him some cash money.

[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.880]
I feel better about that.

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.260]
OK.

[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:57.220]
Want me to add some cash money or at least a voucher like maybe a little bit of a bonus from that summer book even though it's only 50% because we don't really care that much about the summer book.

[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.280]
Although I'll tell you certain people in the building cry and wine and awful.

[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.680]
George is killing us.

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.700]
George is killing us.

[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.320]
He's sabotaged.

[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:09.180]
Even though he has the highest numbers on a radio stage in which this show always does but nevertheless don't give many credit for that.

[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.200]
Holding up his ass and during the summertime.

[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:11.940]
No.

[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.380]
Bitch and wine always find a scapegoat.

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.600]
You know?

[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:20.980]
I mean when you got a guy like Greg that's made so many in the last four or five years so many unbelievably grotesque egregious errors.

[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.160]
I would say that he's the George Bush of radio which I think is taken into a new level.

[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:25.620]
Hey Greg.

[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.840]
You better give me a break.

[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.840]
The ferelfy ass go to screw it over a Joe Rose the Mo the Mo.

[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.920]
Oh my god.

[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.440]
And of course the stern business.

[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.680]
Greg has come out with a book 50,000 ways to jeopardize your license in five minutes or less.

[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.540]
Nice go on Greg.

[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.740]
You may not be good at least you're consistent but he sure has a fine eye for the ladies.

[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.420]
614 votes.

[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.840]
What do you think is the cause of all the recent natural disasters?

[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.540]
What happens to 16?

[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.720]
Global warming 166.

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.540]
We're paying for the sins of Bush 108.

[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.320]
God is pissed off 37.

[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.700]
He is had it.

[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.180]
He is fuck.

[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.420]
Can you believe this hurricane is so what is it?

[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.280]
What will he?

[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.520]
That's going to be.

[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.460]
It's going to be really wet and somebody's getting the willies there in Norway.

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.840]
He's headed right back out in the gang.

[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:05.400]
Willie.

[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.020]
And this proves why I have told you.

[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.160]
Nobody else would tell you there's only a big fat mothel queen like me.

[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:17.760]
Would tell you and I'm telling you again right now that the Lord works in mysterious ways and he's busy with gambling stuff in the eyes and a morning line on the ball games.

[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.380]
But he is sometimes his aim isn't so good.

[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.760]
But you know the old axiom if it first you don't succeed hit him again right?

[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:31.840]
And again and again till you get it right till you just wipe that thing that's then of an equity right off the face of the globe.

[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.980]
No, it's my ass.

[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.400]
Yeah, we're going to have Marty grow out.

[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.100]
That's what you think.

[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.480]
Yes, again hot shot cracker.

[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.060]
Key John.

[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.160]
That's a just turned it down again.

[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.280]
Yes, again, K John said it just turned it over.

[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.640]
God is pissed off 38.

[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.820]
It's the gays fall 35 like everything else.

[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.180]
We have to have these scapegoat do juror in the last few years.

[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.960]
I think since Anita came along.

[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:57.640]
They've been the right wing is favorite scapegoat including even self hating fags like Mr. Rugg and the condolese and you name it and colder.

[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:04.100]
The end days are near 27 and who cares 25 622 votes in an hour and a half that is shocking.

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.800]
See even the Iraqis are whipped up and were friends about it.

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.740]
I'll tell you I see this proves to me today.

[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.000]
I need a lot more vacations.

[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.740]
I've got so much energy today and I feel like I'm actually enjoying the sound of my own voice today.

[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.020]
I'll leave these calls.

[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.720]
That's another story WQAM.

[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:20.980]
Hello.

[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.600]
New, I'm a black male.

[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.800]
WQAM. Hello.

[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:24.820]
Neil God.

[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.560]
How are you, sir?

[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.100]
Pretty good.

[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.600]
Hey, how about the Iraq Windross is working on his old team.

[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.400]
Oh, look at that. It's time for the ev'ry.

[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.700]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.740]
This is 516 QAS.

[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.860]
Qber, 1958.

[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.580]
A proud people, happy to live under the peace of regime.

[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.040]
We took great pride in the heritage of sugar cane farms.

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.520]
Topacco, mob run for C-0, petal act dealerships, hookers and syphilis.

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.700]
And came the specter of Kabobe-sta Kabobe-sta.

[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.360]
Waving Huber with only the heritage of sugar cane farms.

[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.200]
The back-o, European runs of C-0's, hookers and syphilis.

[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.460]
Since that time, only one true Cuban savior first fought from the Virgin Mary's papaya.

[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:18.400]
And lowered gingerly to earth by angels on a silken pillow of freedom.

[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.800]
No, not that little waterlogged Q-Kaleon.

[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.320]
But the real baby Jesus who sits on the moist hand of God,

[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.240]
George, or hey to you, Rodriguez.

[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.580]
Let's throw him as you would Christ or be struck down by the mighty gods of Hanna Hoist.

[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.440]
But baby Jesus is here, and you are there.

[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.020]
Well, I was 31, at 5.60 W.Q.A.M.

[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.440]
600 and some odd votes.

[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.300]
We're going to have 700 by the new hour when the little hand hits the big end.

[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.740]
And look over about 600 A.N. 56 is in Q-56.

[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.580]
I'm going to tell you something, man.

[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.300]
We are shaking the universe, do you believe me?

[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:58.620]
No.

[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.360]
We're doing it.

[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.020]
Well, we're just shaking.

[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.860]
I'm thinking of signing a lifetime contract with somebody.

[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.460]
Somebody with a old transmitter somewhere.

[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.500]
Crystal set.

[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:08.860]

[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.820]
We continue to do this forever.

[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.880]
You know, the fact that we got last week, just before we went on vacation, we could go Friday.

[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.500]
About what?

[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.820]
About the serious left channel or whatever the hell they called it.

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.180]
But that's still our lineup with Alex Bennett and Lynn Samuels.

[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.620]
I was thinking about that in the shower that's running really graph my body wash.

[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.740]
Oh my God.

[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.240]
What are people thinking about?

[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.680]
If that's a great lineup that's going to really have an impact, Alex Bennett is like the due

[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.620]
leberment of radio.

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.180]
Really, wimpy and wishy washing.

[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.480]
Oh God.

[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.300]
Alex Bennett, my ass.

[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.260]
How do you do that?

[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.120]
The number of young Americans reaching for prescription drugs to get a good night's sleep and the money,

[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.720]
the cash money being spent to keep from tossing and turning, as Bobby Lewis would say, is soaring.

[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.340]
Oh, and by the way, they got big fires in the truck now and it causes under investigation.

[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.000]
How unusual fires in Detroit.

[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.600]
You got burned, maybe burned by.

[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.160]
Who did that?

[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.280]
Disco in Furnow.

[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.120]
Who did this going for no?

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.460]
Trips.

[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.340]
Was it?

[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.000]
No.

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.000]
The tramps?

[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:09.820]
Trust it.

[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.600]
Oh.

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.700]
There it is.

[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.940]
Big fires in Detroit again, man.

[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:15.940]
They burn that city down.

[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:16.620]
It's just amazing.

[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.800]
A lot of rooms could talk up on this.

[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.160]
Oh.

[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.300]
I don't want to talk it up.

[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:24.900]
Okay.

[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.460]
I'm not going to talk about that.

[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.400]

[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:50.020]

[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:50.020]

[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.160]
freehold and a lock on the rail, a lock and I'm ready to go to the window and sure enough

[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.360]
Alan.

[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.760]
Alan also as great as he was he used me as a prop like rumored only and difference being

[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.260]
Alan was a great guy and Alan used to feed me at the track as opposed to expecting me

[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.020]
to buy the meals but anyway he brings over Stanley Dancer.

[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.160]
Well Stanley sits down and shakes my hand he sits at the table and it's like three minutes

[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.800]
to post time and I'm just dying.

[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.160]
I don't know how to make it a graceful exit saying I'm going to run to the window and make

[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.500]
a bet which I never did get to bet in the horse one pay 15 bucks and he starts talking

[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.480]
he says oh you don't want to talk about race you want to talk about football okay and

[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.100]
I thought what he thought I was Hank.

[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.680]
Well I was a lot of fatter in those days see I was a lot of fatter so he had me confused

[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.260]
with the Humper so he wanted to talk about football with me that happens a lot I bet.

[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:42.580]
No I mean why would I remember that well that's the only time I met Stanley Dancer but he

[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.220]
was great but I'm sure he didn't spend too much time talking about that.

[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.080]
Not a lot no.

[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.200]
699 baby the next vote will be the 700s one on a poll today people are talking across

[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.640]
the street you know that fat old queen had over 700 votes on the poll by noon today that

[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.120]
means that everybody in town is gathered around the radio like at the old and golden days

[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.720]
of radio just put the radio right there in the middle living room and everybody like sits

[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.260]
on the floor and does something.

[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.440]
They happen to maybe much to just what they're doing but of course Joyce wouldn't put

[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.100]
up with that and by the way Joyce nice job honey you are doing it man you and Greg in

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.460]
a brain trust you are really doing I'm actually amused to see their dilemmas you know

[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.560]
it really amuses me because they would listen to me I know nothing nobody knows anything

[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.420]
they're the experts were the perverts and they're the experts well the first part's right

[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.980]
yeah speaking of perversion bushes of scene performance with troops into creed this is

[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:34.460]
just to watch it is to vomit from I hate to do this right before lunchtime unless you

[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.580]
want to die I'm doing the opiwec service to watch that thing I had to change the channel

[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:44.820]
stage news just like that performance on a battleship there where he's dressed up first

[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:48.960]
president by the way everywhere a military uniform during his presidency ever another

[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.400]
photo op even general grant even the list he says grant never war is a uniform during

[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.120]
his 18th he was the 18th president US granderchick said about that he's also a drunk

[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.120]
I don't know less a drunk president come on he went he had to pave the way for later

[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.540]
presidents it was obscene enough that bush put on such a stage the vent turns out now

[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.700]
that one of the soldiers he called on was actually a Pentagon to our person whom he refused

[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:19.040]
to identify a suspect did you know that nope when I you do even more of scene was bushes

[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.780]
immature and foolish boasting about how cool it was that the soldiers were into creed

[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:27.260]
sedoms home town first he said by the way you're into creed as I understand it as well

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.100]
it's kind of interesting place to be it sedoms old stomping grounds how stomping grounds

[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.160]
kind of like I've actually had a lot of cash money floating around there he's so out

[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.700]
of it he thinks the people to create a grateful to the US troops for being there he asked

[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.180]
one of the soldiers as you move around I assume we have a chance to interface with these

[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.160]
civilians there in that part of the world and a lot of Americans are wondering whether

[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.760]
or not people appreciate your presence can you give us a sense of the reception from

[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.020]
the people there and to creed toward coalition forces the soldier as instructed past that

[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.600]
question out of another soldier captain Williams who couldn't answer how you as soldiers

[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.520]
interface with civilians because they can't it's too dangerous captain Williams referred

[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.000]
to comments his Iraqi counterpart had made after talking to locals and decreed and from

[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.840]
what he told me the locals told him the Iraqi people are ready an eager to vote this referendum

[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.520]
captain Williams said that was the answer Bush wanted that's good he said it's pretty

[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.680]
interesting that's a pretty interesting concept for the people of decree when you really

[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.240]
think about the fact that it was said out of the town but that account of the eager and grateful

[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.960]
local seems highly suspect according to Anthony Shadeed a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter

[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.380]
for the Washington Post the great has been seething with resentment and boiling with

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.380]
him in the nation's others have in the Sunni triangle in his new book night draws near

[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:36.760]
Shadeed explains what a lost cause this war isn't a quote say mechanic from the Sunni triangle

[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.840]
who says the American people should realize they're going to start receiving coffins we're

[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.840]
not their slaves we accept that as easily as we drink water and that was two years ago

[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:49.040]
things are a lot worse now and I'm not seriously Cavalier comment Bush told one of the soldiers

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.500]
it's probably a little early for me to go to the creek no Schmidt how easy it is for him

[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.000]
he's not putting his life online to create always asking these troops to do that and he's

[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]
put them in a no-win situation that's what's most obscene of all despite his happy talk

[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.600]
and the rehearsed sureness of the troops and even the vote on the constitution Bush can't

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.980]
change the situation on the ground and the more oblivious he is to that fact and the more

[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.940]
both the liaison the false progress in Iraq the more shameful his entire enterprise becomes

[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.920]
and I would say you are absolutely correct Matthew Rothschild wrote that for a common dream

[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:23.520]
that already wrote that for the progressive its on common dreams that are right he also

[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.880]
by the way his guy that's what's the website his McCarthyism watch webcom's crowned

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.580]
for more than 150 incidents of repression since 9.11 they like that good media citizen

[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.580]
dot blogs follow those like that just look up Matthew Rothschild with five or six different

[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:44.860]
ways to find it 714 how do you like that 714 old bean cool 714 now what is that what kind

[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:50.960]

[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:08.700]
recent natural disasters Schmidt happens to 56 global warming 189 we're paying this for

[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.920]
the sins of Bush 129 I said one thing gonna take a lot of cash money to pay for that

[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:19.160]
a lot of cash money quite a lot is that it 714 I think so did you look it up no well

[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:24.700]
look it up about 420 God is pissed off 41 he I'm telling him and his right can't you feel

[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:35.020]
about he's he's a apoplectic and that means it's gonna be a pochaliptic that's what happens

[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:39.100]
apocalyptic things happen when God becomes apoplectic right right and of course it all goes

[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:44.860]

and uh his uh partner in crime is boyfriend hey reber and jones you fairy if you play about see

[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.500]
this is uh like uh yesterday morning he says if you plan to read judy millers long and

[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.460]
secure this apology the new york time sunday edition bring your hip-waiters the obfuscating manures

[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:20.680]
need deep and bound to stimey even the most curious reader millers is a slippery customer but

[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.780]
picture is slowly developing if someone was deeply involved in white house maneuvering to

[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.920]
discredited joseph wilson it is clear now that they've changed his right hand man scooter liby

[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.960]
provided miller with the name of x c i a jent valery plane planes name appears at least

[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.240]
twice in the note print miller used when she interviewed liby although she pretends she can't

[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.240]
remember whether or not he furnished the name she's got this convenient Alzheimer's c a it's also

[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.760]
clear that liby tried to coerce miller into silence by dispatching his lawyer joseph tate to tell

[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.840]
miller that she was free to testify but that liby had not told miss miller the name were undercover

[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.460]
status of miss is wilson's wife in other words liby lied to the grand jury i was signaling the miller

[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.240]
to shut up if miller told the truth liby would go to jail the administration would be exposed as

[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.900]
plotting to disgrace joseph wilson it's the old smear and smear that's the heart of the bush

[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:07.460]
administration philosophy fortunately miller got tired of biting her time in jail decided to testify

[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.760]
that prompted liby to send her an encrypted letter which stated that the public report of every

[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.980]
other reporter's testimony makes clear that they did not discuss miss planes name or identity with

[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:21.080]
me again liby was advising miller not to spill the beans miller had a problem though she had no

[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.620]
way of knowing what the other reporters had said to the grand jury and she also had a way the

[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:28.580]
possibilities of being indebted on perjury or obstruction charges so she did what most people

[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.460]
would do in her situation she tipped out through the questioning denying and forgetting as much

[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.800]
as possible it's beginning to look like miller is the pivotal figure in an investigation and a

[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.400]
role could be the undiving of the bush regime in one telling comment miller notes two days before

[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.940]
robber novaks article appeared in the watch and post exposing c.i. agent Valerie Plain i might have

[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.700]
called others about miss is wilson's wife really two days before novaks momentous article miller

[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.380]
was giving out claims name so perhaps miller was the only reporter got claims name from liby

[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.980]
and spread it around anybody else that puts miller at the very center of the bush administration's

[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.280]
biggest nightmare miller already admitted that liby had told her that claim worked at windpack

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.000]
windpacks stood for weapons intelligence non-proliferation arms control the name of a unit within

[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.480]
the c.i. agent among other things analyzes the spread of unconventional weapons that's kind of

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.320]
an outing to confide in a reporter if it's not intended to start a leak remember miller never

[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.160]
even wrote a story about in the c.c. gleam from these private interviews with liby so what was her

[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.440]
role were they just friends having a casual conversation or were she a mule for the information

[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.680]
that the white house wanted to disseminate about wilson liby also asked miller to have the times

[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.480]
referred him as a former hill staffer rather than a senior administration official in stories written

[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.820]
about wilson he obviously didn't want it seemed like the administration was carrying out a

[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:41.220]
personal vendetta against wilson no problem the administration makes a request and the

[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:45.020]
new york times carries it out fort with one hand washes the other the question remains though

[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.500]
why the cover up why would liby care what the papers call him is if as he claims he wasn't doing

[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:54.880]
anything wrong the larger questions however where did liby get valory flames name the only person

[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.020]
who had access to classified c.i. information like that would have been his old boss dick cheney

[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:04.920]
uh-huh uh-huh cheney presided over a secret group of administration hoxtamen is the white house

[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.900]
a rack group wig not the wig party but wig you know i mean wig don't don't don't like that wig

[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.860]
the emergency was to brought the danger of sottams wmd the spread of those who tried to mitigate

[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.940]
the danger the biggest part of their strategy was to exaggerate the threat of sottams imaginary

[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.440]
nuclear weapons program the administration knew through their own polling data that the

[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.480]
american people with support a preemptive war if it appeared as though sottam had nuclear weapons

[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.360]
so it was incumbent upon them to make the case wilson's off had paced the york times challenge

[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:34.440]
the administration's conclusion about these years yellow cake uranium and underbind the claims

[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.040]
about sottams nuclear capacity so wilson had to be destroyed millerwood served as the conduit

[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.960]
from our administration's thoney stories about biological weapon sites mobile weapon labs and

[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.280]
aluminum tubes for noose aluminum q for noose was the logical choice to start the smear campaign

[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.400]
against wilson a role was to spread the classified information resources in the media who would

[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.180]
intern this credit wilson let me as done his best to protect tani from being implicated

[01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.080]
saying that the vice president didn't know anything about wilson but the claim is absurd as

[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.000]
Jason leopold notes in raw story tani was president several of the wig meetings they say tani

[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.980]
personally discussed with individuals in attendance at least two interviews in may in june 2003

[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.480]
wilson gave the new york times com is necrist off at washington post reporter water pinkus

[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.980]
in which he claimed the administration twisted pre war intelligence and what the response

[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.200]
from the administration should be the vice president's rule in outing of cia on agent under

[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.780]
examination jason leopold was that of the edline the article leopold's article also points out

[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:30.400]
the cozy relationship between miller and the members of wig priority rack war after miller had

[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.300]
written her damning article about aluminum tubes tube in a rack that could be used at centrifuges

[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:39.760]
in nuclear weapons a story that was later completely discredited tani rummisfeld bush and

[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.700]
rice running a high gear flooding the sunday talk shows and citing the stories proof that

[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:48.280]
sottles newton ultimately in gulf american a mushroom cloud the media's disinformation campaign

[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.980]
must have been coordinated with miller and key members of busham administration the plan worked

[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.280]
flawlessly clearly both miller and york times publisher Arthur solsberger were intimately involved

[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.740]
in manufacturing the fragile evidence that's right the nation to war neither is ever expressed any

[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.100]
regret over the role they played ironically liby's cryptic comments to miller in a letter that

[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:09.640]
center was in jail may turn out to be the best summary of the ongoing investigation he said

[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.060]
out west where you vacation the aspen's will already be turning they turn in clusters because

[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:19.800]
their roots connect them yes and if liby goes down so will channey rove card rice and perhaps

[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.080]
even bush because their roots connect them how do you like that the roots got to roll with only

[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.480]

Both Republican and Democrats criticized the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll that may be because as long as he remains an

[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.440]
Administration official his testimony must be cleared by the White House

Okay, I already forgot about it. Yeah, I forgot about the Marlins. I'll bet what I'm not gonna read this whole thing

As we go on this go on to four o'clock. We don't want to preamp mode doing here. Come on

[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.060]
Don't want to preamp the most show

[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:51.500]
But a special counsel is focusing on whether vice president Dick Cheney played a role in leaking a covert CIA agents

[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.580]
Name a corner of people familiar with a probe that already threatened to stop white house a it's Carl Roevan Lewis

[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.900]
Scooter or Libby

[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.420]
Scooter my ass. Clifford itch is yeah the special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald is questioned current and former officials of W

[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:09.960]
W is administration about whether Cheney was involved an an opportunist threat of the agents husband Iraq war critic and

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:17.360]
Former US diplomat Joseph Wilson according to the people Fitzgerald is questioned Cheney's communications advisor Catherine Martin and former spokeswoman

[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:23.380]
Jennifer Miller-wise and ex-white house A. G. Wilkinson about the vice president's knowledge of the anti-welsing campaign and his

[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.660]
leaving is with it with Libby is cheaper staff to people sent the information came from multiple sources of request and the

[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:33.980]
Limit of because number one they want to stay alive and because of the secrecy and political sensitivity of the investigation

[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:39.900]
Most former most obviously they want to stay alive. Unlike that British guy that all of us had just died

[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.120]
He's just I don't know why just dead. Yeah, forget about it

[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:49.780]
New York Times before the due to the Miller is not testified twice before a federal grand jury probing the case after spending 85 days in jail for refusing to

[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.020]
Cooper wrote in yesterday's New York Times that Fitzgerald asked whether the vice president had known what is cheap aid

[01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:00.360]
Libby was doing insane regarding Wilson a critic of the war in Iraq Fitzgerald as told lawyers involved in the case

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.660]
Of the hopes to conclude soon the grand jury's term expires October 28th over could be extended

[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:11.040]
And there's a growing sense among knowledgeable observers that the outcome will involve will involve serious criminal charges

[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:19.140]
All right, Fitzgerald is putting together a big case Washington attorney Robert Bennett who represents Miller said on the emissive TV program this week yesterday

[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:24.460]
Now you know who Robert Bennett is no, he was one of our Bill Clinton's attorneys and you know who his brother is

[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.180]
You could have born every black man in this country and yeah, I make would go down

[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:34.460]
Yeah, Robert Bennett and I'm sure not too proudly the brother of the anxious racist build minute and gambling addict

[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:39.440]
Finger pointing super moralist gambling addict and probably pervert

[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.700]

[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:34.280]
Row is about to get indicted and nobody nobody even seems to care

[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.080]
He's about to get indicted and everybody knows how do you know he's about to get indicted? How do you know that?

[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.760]
How do I know? Yeah, well besides the fact that there's plenty plenty of

[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:49.960]
Trail's leading to him. Yeah, and he's gonna be the scapegoat just like Brownie was but nobody knows that so

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.980]
Nobody knows the trouble he's seen is in it exactly

[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.180]
Yeah, yeah, right do some research fight out for me if he's got a wife

He had to be in his belt and he did think he always there was a bio and one of the margins right

[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.540]
He has a child from a previous marriage. Wow

[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.140]
Unlike Harriet Myers didn't never had any children because she's a never had a marriage

[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.720]
He's an old school marmer as they say. She's an old dyke

[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.080]
No, but forget about kind of Lisa play it's not the end of it tried to but Harriet Myers the idea that we got this old

[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:25.240]
Dike who's gonna be sitting on the Supreme Court. I'm sorry. It just it would seem to me that with all the issues for for example

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:31.100]
What what is an old bike you never had a child? What what did businesses she got telling other one more to do with their bodies and and making

[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:34.480]
Rubies on a bar. She's not on fetuses that'd be like bed making those really

[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.840]
Yeah, I've said that for years man. I've got no business making rulings about a bar. She's right

[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.000]
They're cooling about your own. Let's get some real women on there like Gloria Steinem

[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.600]

It's a you noticed the last one the last one also blew through Key West today

[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.420]
I think it's just a coincidence no way

[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.280]

You people gotta get smart too bad that I'm just croak too because maybe he could help them people get smart

[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:07.700]
What do you think? No, no, what do you believe? Send him to the lighthouse and help them get smart up there

[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:12.960]
I doubted so maybe this is the week that was baby get some indictments coming this week and then we can all go

[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:19.200]
But I get really angry and what's this guy say nobody cares if indictments come down against Carl Roveman as

[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.420]
Hostel and nasty as he's been toward the media and the way he's tried to manipulate the entire universe like puppets on a string

How'd you like to have him and Ned baby up in the woods together when I crowd from entry?

[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.440]
I'm playing I mentioned they have a really good old time with them. That'd be a grease fire. They call only Ned had to act

[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:52.180]
I don't think I don't think Carl would be doing an act. I mean, I enjoy it. We like a bite. Maybe Carl Rove and Miss Fudger doing a little something on the side

[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.480]
I don't know which side can do it probably the right side

[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.960]

[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.700]
cares about the white socks. They're very bright. That's why they call them the pale hose

[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.480]
Yeah, nobody wants to see a pale hose you know what I'm saying 5 6 7 0 5

[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.260]
I've discovered this time is definitely not just watery, but it's like

[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.600]
It's not good. So I want to retract although I haven't had a little banana nut

[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:08.580]
Came back. Maybe now have you tried that? No, don't well. I noticed you do have a mouthful right now

[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:15.120]
Tony's pizza Tony's pizza. Thanks Brad. I'm saying one thing Brad over there at Tony's and 190 third and

[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.140]

[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.400]
133rd and 441 right he is the best he always comes through for us

[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.960]
No BS doesn't want to come in and talk on a year. It doesn't gossip about stuff

[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.940]
He doesn't want me to set him up on dates

[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:34.360]
He just comes in and brings the great food and then that's it wants nothing not even though cash money bubbling cheese pizza

[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.260]
Oh man, and what's nice saying there during the fun my final days before I finally bailed out of that toilet

[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.700]
Wasn't I saying that he really had passed some of the others like they were standing still good thing

[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.040]
I said that so speaking of our goldstein

[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.140]
He's gonna be my woman. He's gonna be my bitch. Okay, I

[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:58.280]
Forgot about that one. Yeah, now see if I can play this. What is that thing in sports where there's this tremendous

[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.820]
Philly touchy and these people don't want to think about it

[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:06.180]
Then it become very annoying. I am before 10 and after two you're all a bunch of faggot

[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.780]
You're naked you're you're taking showers. That's a gay club you moron

[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:15.740]
You're in a fan club you're looking for glory holes. Don't mind me dolphin bathouse

[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:20.220]
How is your family's your home as sexuals your abandoned you are

[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:27.620]
Like that. What was he trying to do I had that huh? Oh, yeah, he is he's the best. He's very funny

[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:33.100]
I don't think he'd be right. He's even realized no. No, it's just one of those natural things. Yeah, just come natural

[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:38.580]
So to speak at any rate we miss him a lot from a distance not on the air of course, but from a distance

[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:44.660]
Nobody Q a.m. Hello hi George. It's Lance from the rainbow room. Nobody Q a.m. Hello

[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.320]

Um, two things actually one

[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.780]
I noticed down there that has a

[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.560]

[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.040]
This should do one with a one that calls up with what you take what you take. I want to take you

[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.920]
Nobody says the name or less. I will skip it. Yeah, it's annoying and

[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.580]
I don't know it's America. It's on the right name

[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.900]

We see Kane show. Whatever. Yeah, I that heath the mouse he works with. Yeah

[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.540]

70 Q a.m. Hello. I want to speak to you. Please speaking

[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:34.100]
Hey, Neil chan and I was about waygeldi's doing the hot teams. Is he doing a good job? Yeah

[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:36.540]
Better than juxtaposed McDonald

[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.920]
He'll be was great when he

[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.680]
Lasty he did very well when he had a

[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.540]
Children last season

[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.000]
Blast on the hottest season he did some more than I can remember who was no

[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.100]
I think that was a your your memory of slubbing was when Chris moron was still doing the games and he like had a miss a game for

[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:58.180]
He missed his plane or something in juries or whatever and got ahead of doing emergency filling. Yeah

[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.860]
Actually, he did a really good job

[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:05.000]
And I I actually went to the game on Thursday with my daughter the game's much more exciting now

[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.940]
Absolutely, I couldn't agree with you more man. It's wide open and this is what it should be the shootout

[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:13.720]
I hate but other than that everything is great. Yeah, it's fun. I'm a fan again

[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.360]
Steven Weiss is my hero 567 05 60 how about those leaves?

[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.960]
They're a clindrock and diponi or a gay son allocetal type dummy

[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.160]
Let's talk some hockey talk not don't worry. Don't panic now. We're out. That's the hockey talk

[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.340]
We reached our quarter for this week. What a shame, you know so sad

[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:36.800]
It's so sad in the time when they spend so much time talking the same crap with football football and don't get me wrong

[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.620]
I love football especially like and I agree with Hank that college games have been much better in these awful programs

[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.440]
The NFL like I said before I'll say it again

[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:48.700]
It epitomizes America's obsession with celebrating mediocrity

[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.180]
It wasn't good enough that we had some great teams and some of the other teams sucked

[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:57.100]
I mean, you know, that's the way it was that wasn't good enough and when we occasionally saw some really fantastic talent

[01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:00.760]
No, not anymore now they all have to be mediocre. They all have to suck

[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.400]
Including your Tampa Bay bucks. In fact, even rhymes with suck Josh. They're pretty weak

[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:06.840]
Although they hit some injuries yesterday

[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.560]
They still kicked off and asked and they have some key injuries. Yeah, no Cadillac Williams

[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:15.000]
No Cadillac man, how can you add for the odds just like poor Tom Brady after that Super Bowl

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.160]
I think it was after there was at the first or the second one when he didn't get the Cadillac on time

[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.260]
Got all PO about the S-line not showing up the first was the first one. Yeah, how much he's got three of them now

[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:28.900]
He can have whatever he wants Tom Brady. He's you know, although I'm gonna tell you right now

[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:33.060]
He has small potatoes compared to you know what movie was on last night's George for the 80 million time

[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:38.640]
And I had to watch a little bit of it. I don't know. Donnie Brasco. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna tell you something right and I

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.740]
Again, this is like telling you about the people in Germany and male female in the way of Tushir

[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:47.180]
I want to because it took me like two years to get you to watch that. That's a great movie. Yes, it is and

[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:53.620]
Johnny Depp in that movie is is if there is a if it's possible that a human being could look any better than he did

[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.520]
Oh, I can't imagine. That's not what I thought you were gonna say what that you're gonna talk about it

[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.060]
That's as acting because he's acting like a Guido. He's putting on a whole you know affected character

[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.780]
Yeah, it's his own character and you know, he's playing two characters in the movie right both both really great

[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:13.860]
He's an unsung hero. So forget about Brad Pitt. He's old. He's saggy. He's we already saw that thing. I mean, oh, she's

[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.820]
It was just a pencil

[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.320]
Me that's all I was

[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.120]
What you thought it was just a pencil Brad

[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.480]
But anyway Brad put it small but there's Johnny Depp. He's the man in fact

[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.740]
Who is it that Michelle and Miramar whatever her name is the one that's obsessed with Johnny Depp your right sweet heart and I think that I had him in my

[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:34.600]
Zeta studio then we took pictures together had my arm around her shoulder who's wearing a leather jacket

[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:40.580]
Yeah, wow. I have a line for that but choice would get very upset 1242 at 560 WQ way in the

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:56.580]
She's a young girl she post for Calvin Klein but since she did the powder her career is in the

[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.060]

That's why your size is mini she's already

[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.300]
Rosy what cocaine on her nose he came

[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.700]
She said she didn't do it but a picture doesn't lie

[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.500]
She went with the oh

[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.680]
Kate boss

[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.480]
Her eyes are red and buggy boss

[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.560]
Wait for final druggy

[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.680]
She's a red rose and put cocaine on her nose he came

[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:40.220]
The line is thick as an oak tree and he lost a door with deer from ancient Emmett burrowing

[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.080]
Boss

[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.180]
She's only in dinghy

[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:45.080]
No need boss

[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.500]
Her hands are freezing

[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:53.040]
She's a red rose and put cocaine on her nose he came boss

[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.840]
It's gotta be a nightmare

[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.820]
Her life's a living hell

[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.700]
One minute she's a star that she gets fired by so now

[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.700]
Kate boss

[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:08.660]
So that's how you touch our skin to give me boss

[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.400]
That's why your size is mini

[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.540]
She's a red rose and put cocaine on her nose he came boss

[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:22.740]
About 48-12 minutes to one we got the molemyster at two o'clock mad dog at four in the panther stuff

[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.040]
Panthers and arrangers with guilty so he's one for one on the uh

[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.500]
A guilty meter today they like him

[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.660]
Sciences device them some methods to ease concerns. Have you seen this?

[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:36.680]
I saw it on the website. I read it this morning. Did you really? I did you actually are reading the stories on our website

[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.620]
What I get around to it if I have some of that I thought maybe just the ones that you put on there

[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:47.580]
Some of it in a development that may shift the political debate over embryonic stem cells researchers have devised two new techniques designed to alleviate ethical concerns

[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:52.960]
Oh my god in one the cells are derived without the need to destroy an embryo the principal objection of abortion

[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.960]
Opponents pedisoggers who have stringentously opposed federal financing of the research

[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:03.000]
The other techniques makes skin cells bevert to the embryonic state in a way that prevents the embryo from implanting in the uterus

[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.160]
Both are described in today's online edition of nature. Oh nature. What's that?

[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:13.900]
It sounds like one of them chamepico or conspiracy deals all them secular humanists the chamepico's pushing this crap

[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:17.980]
The technique for making embryonic stem cells without compromising the embryo was developed in mice

[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:23.160]
And as yet to be adapted to humans but the two species species are very similar at this level embryo

[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.540]
Development I can't think of a reason why the technique would not theoretically work in people said bridging an

[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:30.860]
Hogan embryologist at Duke University where the hopper went to school at Duke

[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.880]
Isn't that where they have that rice diet?

[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.740]
Kind of easy rice. No, I'd Duke the rice diet they're famous for that obviously Hank didn't do it

[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:43.220]
If it does work in people the technique would divide the pro-life movement of those who accept or reject in vitro fertilization

[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:47.920]
Because the objection to deriving human embryonic stem cells would come to rest and create the embryos in the first place

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.460]
Not on their destruction

[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.540]
This gets all around the ethical arguments except for that small minority of the pro-life community

[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.600]
That doesn't even support in vitro fertilization

[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.520]
So representative Roscoe G. Bartlett Republican of Maryland whose website describes him as a pro-life legislator

[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.700]
Until now the only way of deriving human embryonic cells has been to break open the embryo before it implements in the universe

[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:14.400]
A stage of which it is called a blastocyst and taking up the inner cell mass who cells will form all the tissues of the future infant

[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.680]
Taking up that cell and taking it to mass. Now the good idea just take it to mass. Okay. Just like Michael Corleone took

[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.380]
You know had one of her baptized in counties baby and he was the godfather

[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:28.540]
Gonna be godfather to counties baby then I'll take care of all

[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:35.960]
Family business 900 votes and it's 1251 that to me is just I don't know whether to scream or each your kid is banana

[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:42.580]
An amazing 900 votes. It's a impressive. I'm impressed tv art imitates Paul. I couldn't take a lot more of these great calls

[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.320]
But I'm not too sure. I got a I didn't realize I had such a heavy pile here

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.400]
Including like this okay tv art imitates politics or vice versa this Ron silver

[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.500]
You know he is the actor from the west wing right another another self-hating Jew

[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:03.180]
I am so sick and tired of Jews and blacks and fags that like yeah have like this death wish for themselves that are politically inept

[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:08.420]
You know what we're talking about? I mean I know who the guy is. I don't I didn't hear what he said or around office water

[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:13.060]
Coolers across the nation fans of tv's the west wing are wondering whether former Bartlett star

[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:19.860]
Bruno Giannalli played by the New York actor Ron silver was wise to jump in the credit ship and begin working for Alan Alders

[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:24.180]
Republican presidential candidate if silver is real life as any indication he made the right call

[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:30.220]
Last week president Bush nominated the self-described 9-11 Republican to the board of directors of the United States

[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:35.880]
Institute of peace a Congressional funded think tank charged with promoting international peace and conflict resolution

[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:42.560]
Silver who spent decades advocating liberal and democratic causes surprise the entertainment community last year by speaking on behalf of Bush

[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.460]
During the Republican national convention

[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:51.000]
Kind of like that that sell out faggot there a ed crotch the former air of New York that the silly as you fair

[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:51.900]
Yeah queen

[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:55.660]
Wonder what they're paying cash money a lot of it

[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:59.800]
Just like Armstrong Williams. Oh my god that story coming up. It's my track. He's getting a lot of cash

[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.440]
Talk about sell-off blacks

[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.060]
Following recent accusations citing former FEMA administrator Michael Browns of pink core nominees

[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.620]
Here he admires and others that the Bush administration values partisan loyalty or receptive experience

[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.840]
The silver's resume support is nomination of the select group. No

[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:20.100]
Instantly directors are required to by law to have practical record of experience and experience in peace and conflict resolution

[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:24.700]
Institute spokesman Gary Matthews said he's unaware of any director who had not spent a career in academia

[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:28.600]
International development nonprofit worker government silver to climb a comment. He's mum

[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:35.960]
He has fluent in Mandarin Chinese and esponial white house spokeswoman Aaron Healy said and has been involved with various international think tanks

[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.400]
Silver is one of 4200 members of the council and foreign relations and serves on its independent task force on public diplomacy

[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:47.060]
Council members are admitted based on peer recommendation task force members discuss issues in prepare reports

[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:53.700]
He also sits on the Wilson council the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars private sector and advisory group

[01:40:53.700 --> 01:41:00.040]
And what's presented a photography exhibit in China under the auspices of the state department cultural connect public diplomacy program

[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:05.220]
So we feel he's qualified. He Lee said but a state department source wise not to be identified because he values his life

[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.440]
To this activity hardly represents substantial experience in peace and conflict resolution

[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.120]
He said peace my ass to the extent that public diplomacy is always working toward peace

[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:21.140]
You can make that stretch you said but in terms of conflict resolution as the state department normally sees not really she said is he qualified

[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:27.540]
Not really not a China-man's chance in hell whether he speaks Mandarin or Sichuan or whatever he's speaking this week

[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:32.840]
You like Sichuan? Yeah, it's alright a little spicy, but I can take it not curry though. No, we like kid curry

[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.380]
But we sure are like curry then you don't want to eat here man too many curry restaurants

[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:42.140]
In fact too many people walk around smell like oh curry smell like a bit in that earthquake now that sounds very insensitive

[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:46.300]
They're all those poor packies down there right I don't want to be insensitive in their time of hardship

[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.980]
But the fact of the matter is baby

[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.600]
Absolutely

[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.160]
Whose first name begins with

[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.320]
There's one thing we all understand

[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:07.960]
Yeah

[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.700]
Our

[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:13.880]
Kato won't be finished until we blow up a pack of sand

[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.660]
We could chase around forever

[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.240]
With our tanks and all our troops

[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:26.580]
That special forces are so tired

[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.720]
Of jumping through them rules

[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.620]
If only we need another

[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.600]
Plane

[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.280]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and we'll blow up pack of sand

[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.060]
All right

[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.460]
I'll play the knees and nuclear

[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.880]
Tane

[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.240]
Why don't we stop pussy food and we'll blow up

[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:00.580]
The

[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.180]
Absolutely

[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.300]
Jeffrey on

[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.080]
1256 at 560 everybody can be able to have any idea what that meant of course not

[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.840]
You would know boom boom Jeffrey on from boom boom from burn baby berms. Just gotta say it's a very

[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.800]
Yeah, this going for no who did that the trips. I'll be damned. That's to be confused with the champs who did tequila correct

[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:30.300]
Which is the president like that not the song so much but the tequila and of course

[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:35.900]
He was governor of that state that's border right ass in on Mexico. Huh? Maybe he and Tom Cruise went down there to a tealon

[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.480]
I had a little couple of pops you think there was somebody that's really getting out of my nerves bad as Tom Cruise

[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.520]
Is each day of my life goes by more and more he just I don't know what it is

[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:47.940]
But every time I see anything about one of his movies or anything at all about him

[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:53.820]
By the way, so what's that us a cute cartoon about Scientology really? Yeah

[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:59.460]
Oh, there's something cute about Scientology well, that's interesting cartoon's cute. It's a stir. I just want to put it on you fairy

[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.480]
1256 at 560 WQM

[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:10.000]
Oh my favorite Republican. This is not drawn and it's time for the excuse they are floating

[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.240]
It's time once again for the Neil Rogers one to two hour

[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:24.580]
I do

[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:29.540]
She knows all I am

[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:31.560]
Is hungry

[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:38.060]
For every girl in this world that ever has

[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.180]
Should I

[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:43.000]
I be

[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:50.700]
So let's break up I feel is the best thing for me

[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.620]
You know strippers are fine

[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.560]
I feel self-impressed

[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.660]
When they seduce me oh, Jessica I do

[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:07.380]
She don't you

[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:15.520]
I'll spend the rest of my life finding another hot white I do

[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.560]
She don't you

[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:25.240]
She didn't talk to control I give them just any

[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.140]
I've waited to say this to you

[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.660]
If they this break up leaving me

[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:37.540]
again

[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:44.260]
Something interesting about the audio on that isn't there

[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:47.080]
It's not like what snack crackling and popping and back. Are you gonna hear that?

[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.900]
I thought it was the the drum machine

[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:51.580]
The drum machine you know the beatbox

[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:58.240]
Oh, no, Nicholas A is that a beatbox. I'll be then kind of like that judge

[01:45:58.820 --> 01:45:59.060]
Well

[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.740]
Remember that story a couple weeks ago. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you do

[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:06.800]
This Supreme Court speaking to judges refused today to allow the Bush administration to pursue a

[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.040]
280 billion dollar penalty against tobacco companies on claims they misled the public about the danger of smoking

[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.260]
How do you like that?

[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:18.740]
They refused to allow them to pursue that penalty the decision to major victory for a cigarette makers

[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:24.040]
Was not on expect what we know that at least one of the Supreme Court justice is smoked a lot right

[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.280]
Right

[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:28.440]
Oh

[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:32.860]
There we go

[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:38.880]
You jeans how much the Bushes nominee for the Supreme Court

[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:45.280]
And you know there's not some people's that dead. It's ain't just us. I smoked a little marijuana when I was in cottage

[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.500]
And it wasn't ever

[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.060]
Yeah, we know

[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:48.900]
uh

[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:54.180]
The decision to major victory for a cigarette makers was not on expect because the urban's cases still pending and the federal's

[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:57.920]
Urgent presider with an ironman trial has needed to decide whether tobacco companies are guilty or wrong doing

[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.660]
These Supreme Court declined without comment to intervene now the case could be turned to justice's next year

[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:05.660]
When we get somebody who really knows like her yet Myers-Hunter she knows her crap

[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:10.480]
She's the choice of the Supreme Court. That's what she'll be she's not gonna get confirmed by them

[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.380]
No chance the the fight that the high court was over the amount of money the company the amount of cash money the companies would have to pay if the judge ruled

[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:20.860]
That the the father to the federal anti-racadtering law known as Rico

[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:25.400]
Rico, which is just a blanket that they throw everybody out of your racketeering right

[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:26.540]
chairs of

[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:33.220]
Altria grouping parent of the biggest U.S. cigarette company Philip Morris U.S. declined four dollars and 34 a set or six percent

[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:37.100]
To 75 bucks and more in train on the New York Stock Exchange William O'Mire

[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:43.840]
Al Fiery vice president said the decision was appropriate a training general al Berto the torture or Gonzalez and rather the administration was disappointed

[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.940]
We continually very strongly in this case when you're a case all right al Berto

[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.420]
In fact if they outlaw if they banned cigarettes altogether

[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:55.660]
Well, they they have to find something else to burn the asses of the prisons with women like like maybe a red hot poker

[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:01.420]
I think a red hot poker would be good. Yeah, low torch. Just like the one Robbie Benson told the courts to stick in one-on-one

[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.140]
You saw that movie of course. I don't recall. Oh

[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:10.080]
Anyway, what do you think is the cause of the recent natural disasters? I can't believe the this is part for the course man

[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.980]
Why should our audience be any different? They got a different agenda all the time nothing moves them

[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.320]
That's because they're in software their brains are fried

[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.100]
When you people are gonna wake up and realize here we got another one of these hurricanes

[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.720]
Wilma let Willie Wilma that's on her way right up towards cancuda and then zip it right up the gulf into New Orleans again

[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.800]
All right, how many times does the Lord have to you use a message huh before you get it?

[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:33.640]
Oh, we got about 27 to go then yeah, I guess

[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:40.120]
932 votes. What do you think is the cause of all this recent crap? Schmidt happens 334 just happens

[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.740]
right global warming 242 we're paying for the sins of bush 159

[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.120]
It's the gays fall 59 just like everything else if you had a bad body diary

[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.520]
It's the gays fault if your lunch is cold

[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:58.260]
It's the gays fault right if it rains like hell all day and spores your picnic. It's the fags fault

[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:02.280]
59 people say that god is pissed off 48 say that

[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.280]
Oh, God is pissed off and fired up and whatever you do don't forget about

[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:12.140]
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that the end days are near 42 and who cares 38

[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:13.940]
That's the oblivious crowd no matter what the pull

[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.700]
932 votes is just after one o'clock and Josh is really pleased as bunch

[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.800]
We got a shot at 1100 a day during the show during the show 1100 votes

[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.660]
That's more people than listen to Joel Feinberg station in four months 1100

[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.860]
Yes, yeah, I do like that Joel you fairy

[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:33.400]
Tropical storm Wilma strength in the day after forming an earth-washed in Caribbean now

[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.560]
Do we really want to talk about this?

[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.480]
Not gonna hit South Florida, but I think it's you know, it's probably it's part of our what no I don't care

[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:44.620]
I say yes. I didn't print this out so some of the little Julio can sit there and tell me not to read it

[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:47.000]
You want to waste a page and a half of my fags paper?

[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.700]
Oh, you saw how much fags paper I waste including everything that he sent me by the way prints out two pages

[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.660]
I still don't know what that is I don't care

[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:00.060]
Got money to burn baby. I think we're always made of burn now let's play that song by the

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:07.580]
Tramps this go in for a big fires. The threat we saw that on CNN once and then I think a bigger fish to fry like Sodom goes on trial Wednesday

[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.700]
There we go burn it

[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.200]
Farrah this is for our Supreme Court justice parents token Thomas burn a big fat one clearance come on

[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.680]
I wrote up in a Sun Sentinel

[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:22.820]
Right there in fact take the a Sunday TD book take Tom jik as Q&A and roll off a big

[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.000]
Pad will write on that page

[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.680]
He's rolling it okay, it's enough

[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:35.240]
Capital storm well is cranked in today after forming the Northwestian Caribbean tying the record for most storms in the Atlantic season and following a path

[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.240]
I've could minutes the Gulf coast next week is a hurricane oh my god Jesus

[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.700]
Wilma is the 21st name storm of the season because god is picked off. What are you people gonna smell it man?

[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:50.000]
What does he got to do to get the message across do it? He keeps slapping virgin Mary's face under overpasses and

[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:57.200]
Underpass in Chicago and on the side of bank buildings and our proteinus pieces at Rosa Lopez's house and on those

[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:04.600]
Cheese sandwiches and you still can't get the message and some jack as just for cash money goes in options it off on eBay

[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:13.140]
Now that's that's pretty a crash if you ask me crash on selling the virgin Mary on a cheese sandwich on eBay and taking cash money for it

[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:17.460]
The only other time this many storms of forms since record keeping me in 154 years ago was

[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:23.940]
1933 and that was a very good year because that was the year who was going out in FDR was coming in to begin dragging us out of the

[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:27.620]
Depression of course if it wasn't for WDW to do we never would have gotten out of the depression

[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.100]
But I have to be side-of-point and 11 o'clock this morning

[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:35.260]
Wilma had sustained top winds near 45 miles an hour up to five up five miles in three hours

[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:42.740]
In other words, it's growing it's strengthening it was sent at about 220 miles south southeast of Grand Cayman and drifting southwest near five miles an hour

[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.360]
Let's see this storm. I don't want to read all this because it's got nothing to do with us

[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:50.920]
It's gonna bring four to six inches of rain in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica mine and Jamaica. It's a good machine

[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.340]
Mon it's a good machine. I just I am never I don't know. I've got a bomb before I die

[01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:02.460]
I have to make my men my ways with the Jamaican right make a peace no chance with as much as 12 inches

[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:09.220]
Possible in some areas the National Hurricane Center says long-term forecast show the storm heading into the Gulf of Mexico by the weekend

[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:13.280]
Forecasters at high-water temperatures other conditions high-water temperatures

[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.780]
That sounds like global warming again

[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.000]
We're favorable for it to become a significant hurricane

[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.480]
But hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart said Wilma had shifted west of its previous path

[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.700]
Could it Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula at this time?

[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:28.480]
It doesn't appear to be a major threat to the Western the next five days, but then but

[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.640]
Wilma is then expected to reemerge into the Gulf and could become a threat to the southern United States the Gulf coast

[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:38.740]
Usually where a storm gets in the Gulf it's gonna hit somewhere so the hurricane

[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:46.400]
Center meteorologist Larry Layhiff where it's twirly until right now some models take it west some take it north and some just take it up the nose

[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.420]
I keep mine like that

[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:53.180]
So it's I mean it's got it look at it. She's on it right now

[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:58.700]
We're just into the Gulf of Mexico. There were other specialists a long way to go on this one and a lot of changes are likely gonna happen

[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.720]
Must be just a coincidence that they've got to track 20 it right smack at New Orleans

[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:07.120]
They got New Orleans like written on them after it's got like a big point of that like you're gonna get it again

[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:15.100]
Man God is so he is foaming at them out about this the gravity and insanity that's going on his planet

[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.320]

Commentator armistrow on Williams sell out black guy to promote its agenda and boy see ever ugly

[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.680]

[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:10.260]
Democratic New Jersey was pressed for a criminal fraud investigation

[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:15.960]
Focused on questions about whether Williams actually performed the work cited in his monthly reports to the education department

[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:21.200]
The GAO has concluded that the education department engaged in illegal covert propaganda kind like that

[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.380]
States press conference with a troops last Thursday

[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:30.080]
W. Propaganda my ass that that's all they know is propaganda because they can't tell you the truth if they totally the truth number one

[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.940]
They'd all be in jail and number two. We'd all be screaming in the streets bloody murder

[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:39.240]
The GAO's concluded that the education department engaged in illegal covert propaganda by hiring winners to vote

[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:45.060]
They know child left behind act without requiring to disclose that he was being paid cash money the education department's

[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.120]
Inspector generals also reviewed the Williams deal

[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.240]
Which is part of a broader contract that the education agency and with catch him a public relations firm catch him

[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.520]
You can before it gets away just like Osama catch him before it's too late now the US attorney for DC is investigating

[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.920]
Whether Williams accepted public money with a cash money without performing as required duty said then cats chief counsel for

[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:07.860]
Loughtonberg the attorney's office has arranged important ceremonies from suing to recover the money

[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:12.360]
The cash money the possible criminal charges cat said oh wouldn't this be wonderful, huh?

[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:16.640]
All of these people on record is Ireland now that they let out goldstein out would it be fantastic?

[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.620]
Or maybe an Alcatraz would be good. Is that still open and they closed on Alcatraz?

[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.560]
As the president's closed if Bush were in that would be called Alkie

[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:32.220]
Traz oh cute Williams spokesman Shirley Dave said the commentator hadn't been informed about the latest development had no comment

[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:36.760]
Of course, he's mom she had said previously that Williams was negotiating with the department of return part of the cash money

[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.420]
Was paid I see the deal occurred during the tenure of former Education Secretary Rod Page

[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:48.020]
Education department spokeswoman Susan Aspie had no comment on the work of Inspector General's office which operates independently

[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:53.740]
Independent rather Inspector General counsel Mary Mitchellson also is mom in October 6th letter to attorney general

[01:55:53.740 --> 01:56:02.720]
Alberto Gonzalez Loughtonberg and senator Ted Kennedy said questions to fraud remain Loughtonberg also asked the education department's office of Inspector General to more fully investigate the contract

[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:03.880]
I like that

[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:08.380]
Everything is a flim flam and a big sham and the smear and smear

[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:14.700]
Whether it's Richard Clark whether it's Joseph Wilson whether it's Valerie Plain smear them and smear them whether it was Scott the writer

[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.920]
Redder was Hans Blix

[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.800]
Mm-hmm any upstanding person that comes along and tells the truth smear them and smear them

[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.500]
Okay, it feels sure the clear except of course for the ones that are a part of the part of the group right partly boon

[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:34.500]
They're except for now 950 votes. It's not even one 15. I bet you Greg Reed is sitting in there rubbing his hind legs together like a grasshopper

[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.740]
He's so excited probably because he hates you so bad

[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:50.620]
Oh

[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:54.340]
One 19 over your gaudy in the panther game that it's seven o'clock from MSG in the york

[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.800]
970 to we're gonna have that thousand by the bottom of the hour and then 1100 would be like falling right off a log

[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.580]
You know you fall off the top of a log cabin

[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.000]
It's big enough people who may be falling off the a deep end a hearing for a swap shop owner pressed in hand

[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.100]
Was delayed for month-while his legal team awaits the results of hands psychiatric evaluation

[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:18.580]
Hands 74 was due to begin to his trial this morning on charges simple battery criminal mischief and battery of a law enforcement officer

[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:22.800]
Broward circuit judge John Murphy said a status conference for November 18 whatever that is

[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:27.820]
Hand was charged with a crime stemming from a May 20th incident at a swap shop flea market on sunrise bloward

[01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:29.660]
After got into a dispute with a vendor

[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:35.100]
BS oh deputies who responded to the incident shot ten with a taser stun gun and had led

[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:41.200]
We're knocked over a BS oh district chief since that incident had his twice been involuntarily admitted for psychiatric

[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:46.440]
Evaluation's under Florida's Baker act and you know the kind of people that have to be Baker acted are people like

[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.180]
I got a little off the deep end and I'm gonna tell you why this happened

[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:55.360]
You know you're only here and here. I'm gonna show you. I know what happened what happened just like our poll today about all these disasters

[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:59.940]
God is calling in the chips chips whatever it is

[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.140]
What we're right now now and all those remotes that we headed to with the swap shop

[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:09.020]
God is punishing you Preston for making me smell that elephant the crap and that's sought us man

[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:12.760]
Now that's what it is up the run at stayed with those blistering hot lights

[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.420]
And he finally admitted one time and him and his good buddy Nick de Barrow was always hanging around there when I was doing that show

[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:19.260]
He admitted that they did just like

[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.980]
Like an SNN thing with me

[01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:25.600]
With what the lights are the elephants both you get those hot

[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:31.380]
Clea lights on there that ring with the elephant droppings and it's sought us. Oh, do I like I have to tell you?

[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:32.560]
No, you don't have to tell me but

[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.400]
I can still smell it that was like a hundred years ago. I can still smell it

[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:42.380]
So the Lord is punishing you Preston for your evil ways you better repent before it's too late mister swap this

[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:46.880]
972 I bet you if I were first you were getting really close to a thousand

[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:49.060]
You know it and these people out there will work through it

[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.260]
It makes a 980 man

[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:57.000]
80 on the AM dial God what a spot. I don't even know anything on 98 you

[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.580]
No, of course. I don't know about the every WCFL 1000 what a great spot to be on the dial you know it

[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:07.980]
50,000 watts at 1000 red smack in the middle of the dial what a great what a great thing too bad Barney Pippin on no more or Bob

[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:14.020]
Elson in the white socks. It's a ball outside or you think you think that Dave Ann boring his terminal wow

[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:18.840]
Dave Ann voice sounds like a Mexican jumping bean and he compared to Bob Elson the longtime voice

[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.120]
Of the Chicago white socks you're perhaps the soon-to-be world champions

[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:26.820]
They got a club before about how come a market isn't because we don't we don't care about the pale hose

[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:31.420]
And especially after that bogus call and that there was that game won her two Josh game two of two

[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.640]
It's because the angels won the first game right?

[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:38.820]
Yes, that's it and then the white socks that won that disputed. I mean that was just ridiculous

[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:42.500]
I wonder how much cash money somebody said must have changed hands there

[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:46.780]
Say three you're out there. Oh, well, guess what I changed my mind. You're not just the run to first base

[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:51.800]
And I'll say I'll make up a story in an English to which it showed very clearly that the ball never hit the ground

[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.000]
They show they replay how many thousand time

[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.060]
Third man and even Josh would agree with that. Yes, being the baseball analyst that he is

[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:03.900]
It's Bush Cheney and not rove. Let me write Frank rich. We like Frank rich a lot of rest in New York times

[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:11.280]
There hasn't been anything like it since Martha Stewart fented off questions about her stock trading scandal by a manically chopping cabbage on the early show on CBS

[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:14.600]
Last week the setting was today on NBC with the image of President Bush

[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.800]
Manically hammering nails at a habitat for humanity construction site on the Gulf Coast was

[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.040]
Juggled with a site and tried to duck metal hours questions about Carl rove as with miss Stewart

[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.920]
Mr. Bush's pair of oxysmopanic was must see TV the president was a blur of blinks

[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:31.380]
Tadigal privates and shifts Dana Milbank wrote in the Washington Post

[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:34.860]
Asked repeatedly about mr. Rolf serial appearances before Washington grand jury

[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:39.440]
The January mr. Bush for once be a be raft of a script improvised a passable and per

[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.340]
I am a

[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.180]
Passable impersonation of Norman baits being quizzed by the detective in psycho like Norman and miss Stewart

[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.720]
He stone wall that stone wall may start to crumble into Washington courtroom this week or next in a sense

[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.840]
It already has now is always what matters most in this case is not what a mr. Roevin Lewis liby scooter liby

[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:02.640]
You engage in a petty conspiracy to seek revenge on a whistleblower Joseph Wilson by unmasking his wife Valerie a covert CIA officer

[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.660]
Well, makes Patrick to Fitzgerald's investigation compelling whatever its outcome is its illumination of a conspiracy

[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:12.560]
That wasn't at all petty the one that took us on false promises in way reckless and wasteful war in Iraq

[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.900]
That conspiracy was instigated by mr. Roevin's boss George W. Bush and mr. liby's boss Dick Taney

[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:21.060]
Mr. Wilson's wife were trashed to protect that larger plot

[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:25.900]
Because the personnel in both stories overlapped the bits and pieces we've learned about the leak inquiry over the past two years

[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.800]
Have gradually helped fill the fire in the uber narrative about the war last week with no exception

[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.820]
Deep in a Wall Street Journal account of Judy Miller's grand jury appearance was this crucial sentence

[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:40.780]
lawyers familiar with the investigation believed that at least partly outcome likely hangs on the inner workings of what has been dubbed the

[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:45.060]
White House Iraq group very little has been written about the White House Iraq group or wig

[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.220]
It's inception August

[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:51.820]
2007 must be for the invasion of Iraq was never announced only much later with newspaper article or two mentioned in passing

[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:57.160]
reporting that had been set up by Andrew card the White House chief of staff its eight members included mr. Roe

[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:01.060]
Mr. Laby counterlies the rice and the stint mysters Karen Hughes and Mary Madeline

[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:04.240]
It's mission to market a war in Iraq to market a war in Iraq

[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:07.700]
Of course the official more sister would have us believe that in august

[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:12.380]
2002 notice is not yet been made of that war dates bracket in the formation of wind tell us otherwise

[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:18.480]
On July 23rd 2002 a week or two before wig first convene and earnest a British official told his peers has recorded

[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:23.000]
And now famous dominion stream memo that the Bush administration was ensuring that the intelligence facts about a right

[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.820]
WMD were being fixed around the policy of going to war and on September 6th

[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:32.660]
2002 just a few weeks after wig first convened mr. card alluded to his group's existence by telling

[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:38.420]
Elizabeth Bumel over the New York Times that there was a plan of foot to sell a war against Sodom who's saying from a marketing point of view

[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:44.340]
You don't introduce new products in august he said the official introduction of that product began just two days later

[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:48.820]
I'm a Sunday talk shows is September 8th miss rice war that we don't want to be the smoking gun to a mushroom

[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:54.860]
We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud and mr. Cheney would already started the nuclear doomsday drumbeat and three august speeches

[02:03:54.860 --> 02:04:02.140]
Described Sodom is actively and aggressively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons the vice president said in his evidence a front page article leader debunked

[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:07.980]
About supposedly the furious aluminum tubes co-written by a junior middle in that morning's times the national security journalist James

[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:12.980]
Bamford in a perfect a pretext for war right that the article was all too perfectly time to facilitate

[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:17.380]
Exactly the sort of propaganda cool that the White House Iraq group have been set up to stage manage

[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:21.240]
Pause at this point. Well so long article all right. I gotta do the break

[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.620]
Well, I take it one thing it's 126 already this show is flown by like we were on for five minutes today. What's that all about?

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:30.600]
It's uh, you know you took that vacation is that it?

[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:32.280]
Well, guess what I'm going to vacation again tomorrow

[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.760]
And then we have that

[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.260]
And he shows all this fly by for me anyway

[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:40.760]

Freedom from the bunch

[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:13.120]
From the tone of a gun or spreading our

[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:17.000]
democracy

[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:21.720]
Iraqis want to show

[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:22.580]
Yes

[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:26.300]
At least to my common chance you

[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.240]
Just

[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:45.900]
Two

[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.320]
Three

[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.840]
Let me

[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:50.540]
Back at us Air

[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:54.940]
Oh. Oh they have taken on a yearly freedom

[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:11.220]
I see 90 and hold on a pull almost to a thousand at the bottom of the yard. How do you like that? 9 on the 8? That's kind of great

[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:16.040]
But we need to get another 102 by the top of the yard. I'm never gonna happen see how we slowed down because I wasn't pushing in my

[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:22.460]
Bad well get out and push anyway Frank Rich continues the administration's doomsday imagery was ratchet it up from that day on as

[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:29.440]
As Barton Gelman and Walter Pinkers of the Washington Post were determined in the first account of Wig the four year later the administration's escalation of nuclear

[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:34.880]
Redirect could be traced to the group's formation along with mushroom clouds your rating was another favorite image the post report noted

[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:40.380]
Because anyone could see his connection with atomic bomb it appeared in a Bush radio address that we can't have to the rice

[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.520]
Cheney Sunday show blitz that would reach its apotheosis with the information

[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:47.940]
Fictional 16 words about your rating from Africa and Mr. Bush's January

[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:53.500]
2003's the union address on the eve of war throughout those crucial seven months between the creation of Wig and the

[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:58.440]
Starley Merck and invasion of Iraq there were indications that evidence of a sedom nuclear program was fraudulent or

[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:03.720]
non-existent Joseph Wilson's the eye mission to the tonight year in which in a year I'm sorry his mission in a

[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:07.700]
Year in which failed to find any evidence to back up your rating claims to place nearly a year before the

[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:12.740]
President 16 words but the truth never mattered the Bush Cheney product rolled out by card roe Libyan

[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:17.600]
Company had been bought by Con risk the press in the public the intelligence of the facts had been successfully

[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:21.060]
to sell the war and any memory of Mr. Bush's errand 16 words

[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:25.660]
Melted away during shock and awe when months later when national security officials Steven Hadley

[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:29.400]
took responsibility for allowing the president to address the nation about mythical uranium

[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:35.220]
No one knew that Mr. Hadley to have been a member of Wig it wasn't until the war was supposedly over with mission accomplished in

[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:38.980]
May 2003 that Mr. Wilson started to add his voice to those who were disputing the

[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:43.200]
Administration's uranium hype members of Wig had a compelling motive to shut him down

[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.540]
In contrast to other skeptics like Muhammad Al-Daraday of International Atomic Energy Agency

[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:52.020]
This used Nobel Peace Prize winner Mr. Wilson was an American diplomat he had reported his findings

[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:56.820]
in these years or our own government it was a dagger aimed at the heart of Wig and its disinformation

[02:07:56.820 --> 02:08:02.060]
Campaign exactly who tried to sound to them and how is what Mr. Fritz Zero presumably will tell us

[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:07.240]
It's long been my hunch to his frank which that the Wig Wig guys were their most brazen and the illegal terms reckless

[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:10.900]
During the many months that preceded the appointment of Mr. Fritz Zero as special counsel

[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:16.280]
When Mr. Rowe was asked on camera by ABC News in September 2003 if he had any knowledge of the

[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:20.260]
Valerie plane leak and said no it was only hours before the Justice Department would open its

[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:24.580]
First-leake investigation when Scott McLellum later declared that he'd been personally assured by Mr. Rowe

[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:29.060]
And Mr. Libby that they were not involved with leak the case was still in the safe hands of the attorney general

[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:33.340]
Vengeon Ascroft himself a three-time rogue client in past political campaigns

[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:38.060]
The Mr. Rowe may be known as Bush's brain he wasn't smart enough to anticipate that justice

[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:41.980]
Department career employees would eventually pressure Mr. Ascroft to be cues himself

[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.860]
Because of this conflict of interest throwing away for an outside prosecutor as independent

[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:49.880]
Mr. Fritz Gerald Bush's brain is the title of James Moore and Wayne Slugger's

[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:52.060]
Dependent of Account of Mr. Rowe's political career

[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:56.460]
But Mr. Rowe is less of his boss's brain than another a literary organ or organs

[02:08:56.460 --> 02:09:01.680]
That which provides testosterone as we learn in Bush's brain bad things usually character assassination

[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:06.260]
Often happen to Bush foes whether Ann Richards or John McCain on such occasions Mr.

[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:10.360]
Bush stays compassionately above the fray while the ruthless Mr. Rowe operates below the radar

[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.420]
Always separated by a layer of operatives from any of the behavior that might implicate him

[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.520]
There is no crime just evicted Mr. Moore Mr. Slater right in this repeated pattern

[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.960]
This notice operand I was foolproof shielding the prison as well as Mr. Rowe from culpability

[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:27.120]
As long as it was about winning an election the attack on Mr. Wilson by contrasts his left

[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:31.120]
Then the chaney liby tag team vulnerable because it's about something far bigger

[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:33.760]
Protecting the lies that took the country to what the Reagan administration

[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:37.480]
National Security Agency director Lieutenant General William Odom was recently called

[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.300]
The greatest strategic disaster in US history

[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:44.420]
Whether or not Mr. Fitzgerald on Coverson indictable crime there is once again a victim

[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:47.180]
But that victim is not Mr. Mrs. Wilson it's the nation

[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.280]
It's surely a joke of history that even as the White House sold this weekend

[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:53.480]
Constitutional referendum is yet another victory for democracy in Iraq

[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.720]
We still don't know the whole story of how our own democracy was hijacked on the way to war

[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.520]
Not that anybody cares who understand of course

[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:06.600]
In five votes on the pool. Are you impressed? Yeah, well, no you're not sure

[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.320]
We're not gonna get to a level 100 by two o'clock. We're off to such a sterling a phenomenal start

[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.220]
And it is usual by the way that Hispanic were number five with Julio's that's that's not too bad

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:20.820]
You know I told you all the Julio's listen to what you have now. I don't know anybody any of you say that

[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:26.700]
You just your prejudice blinds you prejudice against what against Cubans get out of here

[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:28.220]
I love my Cuban friends

[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:32.720]
Well, depending on what they look like you just you want them to hear you are you are so full of crap

[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:35.640]
My president fight you're going to be in force and all my police there

[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:38.860]
They'll be like me you calling you anti-Semitic again, you know

[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.980]
You're a hobo. I beg your pardon. I said how's it go that part is true. You ferry

[02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:50.060]
Margin lie and listen I'm not gonna go into it. I just I'm just tired of clones, you know, I mean

[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:51.340]
Can't handle clones

[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:56.940]
Margin lie and it uh, I don't want to go into thinking about Philopeino's either but everyone lies by his universe

[02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:58.240]
Would you listen to this please

[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:03.300]
Bethlehem Pennsylvania see a little time of Bethlehem. I'm trying to everything points to it

[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:05.480]
You see how we put all these pieces together? God

[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.120]
Fulming at them out and you people are like busy farting around you watching stupid ball games and crap

[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.080]
Don't forget to pant the game by the way seven

[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.720]
Margin lies by his university colleagues

[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.680]
ridiculed as a crack by the scientific establishment

[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:23.640]
Michael be he that's be a be a T. It's like the first four letters of my name

[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:28.920]
Michael be he continues to challenge the traditional theory of how the world came to be for more than a decade

[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:33.720]
The tenured Lee High University biochemistry professor and author has been more than nations leading performance of

[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:39.140]
Intelligent design a movement trying to alter how Darwin's theory of evolution is taught in the schools

[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.800]
This week be he will testify in federal government Harrisburg in that landmark case about whether students in Pennsylvania

[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:50.140]
Classroom should be required to hear a statement before their evolution classes that says Darwin's theory is not a fact

[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:52.380]
What do you require? We require

[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:55.920]
The fact is that most in fact aren't they living proof of

[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.860]
Evolution right there? No, that that makes the current. Very case. Oh, I see the evolution well

[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.600]
They just hadn't reached reached the next stage yet

[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:06.680]
The fact that most biology text act more as cheerleaders for Darwin's theory

[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:11.280]
Rather than try to develop the critical failures of their students shows the faculties of their students shows the need

[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:17.660]
I think for such statements be he said in paper speeches and the 1996 bestselling book called Darwin's black box

[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:22.560]
Be he argues that Darwinian evolution cannot fully explain the biological complexities of life

[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:24.760]
Suggesting the work of an intelligent force

[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:25.160]
Oh

[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.880]
His life on the academic fringes can be lonely

[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:31.260]
Criticize the concept is nothing more than biblical creationism and disguise

[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:35.480]
He long ago stopped applying for grants and tried to get his work published in mainstream scientific journals

[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.860]
In August his department posted a web statement saying the concept is not scientific

[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:42.360]
For us doctor be his position is simply not science

[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.860]
It is not grounded in science and should not be treated as science at Neil Simon

[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:51.820]
The biology department chairman used to write some fantastic plays not funny no fantastic but not funny

[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:52.660]
I never saw him play

[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:58.520]
Oh, I see it. Well like what which one like a galaxy blues the goodbye girl

[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.500]
Oh good bye girl. Oh, yeah, he said he was a believer in Darwin when he joined the high 85

[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.760]
But became a skeptic after reading Michael Denton's book evolution a theory in crisis

[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:13.780]
Be he's big idea published in Darwin's black box and one that can't afford it him to academic fame is

[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:20.880]
Irreducible complexity what it's an ocean that certain biochemical systems are incapable of having evolved into Darwinian fashion

[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:24.420]
Because they require all their parts working simultaneously wow

[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:30.060]
Be he uses a mouse trap to illustrate the concept take away inhibits parts platform the spring hammer catch and the

[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:34.840]
Mosh trap can't catch mice intelligence design becomes apparent when you see a system that is a number of parts

[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.760]
And you see the parts are interacting the performer function

[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:41.160]
He said in other words nature isn't complex enough to do that. So of course not stupid right

[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.940]
The book put the positive case for design on the map in the way that some of the previous intelligence design work

[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:49.720]
Had not done since Steven Meyer who makes a hell of a wiener directly center for science and culture after they discover institute

[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:55.100]
Most of academic appanded you genie Scott directly the national center for science education

[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:59.120]
I do dream of you genie said he believes that be he thought he discovered something astonishing

[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:04.820]
But no one is using irreducible complexity his research strategy with very good reason because it's completely fruitless

[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:05.640]
Yes

[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:11.700]
Be he finds community in a web group that he says includes like minded faculty from other universities

[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:16.940]
Most keep their views of themselves be he said because it's dangerous to your career to be identified as an ID

[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:19.080]
Proponent intelligent design

[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:24.480]
He earned ten year ago before becoming a proponent which lets him express his views without threat of losing his job

[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.840]
Because of the immense publicity that's mushroomed around this issue in the past six months

[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:31.060]
See there's another loose mushroom more people are getting emotional about the topic

[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:34.980]
He said it's in my side and for good reason all I can say is deal

[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:36.560]
God have it help us

[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:41.900]
142 you're gonna be sorry man when the Lord comes and I'll cause you to the purly gates

[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:48.400]
And ask you to account in a tone for your indifference and your calisthenitudes of all is crap and you're over involvement with ball games

[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.040]
And guys that run around with jockstrap and take showers with each other which also sounds kind of gay to me and believe me

[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.500]
I know I know from gay a thousand and fifteen votes

[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:59.640]
We're not even gonna get close to eleven hundred that's okay once we got to the thousand like

[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:13.500]
That's all we care about

[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:15.320]
Democracy is like a trick

[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.800]
It starts from a tiny little fee

[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:27.220]
That gets planned in the military occupation and then the sheep begins to grow

[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:32.740]
And when the growth is really there it's a firm trade

[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:41.380]
And I don't know it's threatened democracy like trying testicles cross the state democracy's a tree

[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:45.620]
Democracy's a tree

[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:49.140]
Democracy's a tree

[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.140]
Democracy's a tree

[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:58.080]
I'm more unjust your president

[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.860]
I'm bigger than Jesus

[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.440]
Another cost

[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:14.660]
Science and liberals are bad things

[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:19.040]
So stick your yellow ribbon stickers next year

[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:22.560]
Shocker ball the key things you're dying to black and white

[02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:25.880]
The democracy's a tree

[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.460]
Democracy's a tree

[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:32.000]
This is hey everybody look away

[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:37.240]
I'm a leader of the free world nobody knows more about premiums and names

[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:40.200]
I put the film before you done

[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:45.280]
I lost it I'm a wartime president

[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.140]
I like being in the mouth that

[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.640]
147 a qm 13 minutes away from the more moisture we got a thousand and 27 votes no where near eleven hundred boy

[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.580]
Of course to show you don't count your votes until they hatch until we're in hatch now

[02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:02.900]
There was this story that the herald is they even did a poll on it, but I'm a little bit confused about it

[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:06.800]
Uh, West Miami restaurants name is too saucy for somebody do you see this?

[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:12.740]
No, a West Miami restaurant has been denied a sign permit for the eerie's name with some consider of scene

[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:15.720]
And I keep reading through this, but I don't see the name of the restaurant

[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:22.040]
Maybe that's how obscene it is. I see some customers giggle when they tell friends to meet them at the new Spanish restaurant on red road

[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.640]
Others might blush the cooks and waiters don't bat an eyelash

[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:27.160]
Even though the name is considered a profanity by many

[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:33.480]
It's used in the same that roughly translates to go to hell and it's defined in several Spanish dictionaries as males in a tadia

[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:36.000]
The restaurant's owners maintain it's not a cuss word

[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.140]
They point to a 15th century definition of closeness on a sailing vessel. Oh, that's the uh, the carapult

[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:48.600]
It says not convinced West Miami City officials who denied the restaurant permits for its signs the

[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:54.020]
Sign hanging out in front of the place open almost three months ago has to come down by today or the owner's face day

[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:58.060]
$250 a day fine. This was seven days zero. I don't think huh? I said

[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:04.020]
I don't think it belongs in our community said Maria Mohinia who lives near the restaurant and was the first to call the city to complain

[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:08.460]
They're being silly and need to grow up said George Reyes one of three owners of L

[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:10.360]
I see it is in there, but the word is chopped off here

[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:13.640]
What is it again? Carajo Al Carajo who I'm partnering with me

[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:18.740]
I would have told the story of the origin of the word and why it is a a bad place to be sent to

[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:21.220]
Yeah, just the other day if you want to hear it go ahead

[02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:28.340]
It's it was the crow's nest and Spanish people Cubans in particular they say go to Carajo instead of go to hell

[02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:33.080]
Because it does like sending someone to hell in fiat noise is like that has no substance

[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:36.880]
Meaning go now but sending someone to the crow's nest is from the old sailing days

[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:39.880]
You know how the spandridge just to sail to find places to rape and kill

[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:45.380]
Oh, yeah, the sailor was a it was bad or uh, he would get the the crap duty on the ship

[02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:47.840]
Which means that he had to go and sit up on the crow's nest

[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.820]
Which was a bad place to be you got it

[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:53.460]
To the you know you got rained on it was bleak up there

[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:58.600]
So the captain would send you to El Carajo and you'd have to climb up the pole and sit up there and get

[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.840]
Craped on by the pigeons. I see by the sun. So that's why it's that well

[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:02.200]
There you go

[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.720]
And of course the hero really mentions it one time

[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:06.980]
We have to search for it. They're in a stir because the hero doesn't want to be like a bunch of potty mouse

[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:12.140]
And have everybody we're all looking at the herald are bunch of pornographers now you're right up there with Al Goldstein and

[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:13.060]
Larry Flint

[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:19.900]
Yeah, I was in 40 votes 1040 that's KXEL and Waterloo, Iowa 1040 on the AM dial. Am I right if he's Iso?

[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:26.400]
But you used to live in that neck of the woods there in in Nebraska. Yeah, I'm sure the AXEL came booming in there at night

[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:31.520]
You know what's the part of time when those of us who were radio buffs we know all the stations all the 50,000 mark clear channel

[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.500]
When there was such a thing I think I'd never been to Nebraska. I mean Montana. Yeah

[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:42.680]
Water how far is Iowa from Montana mr. Hive's right Iowa? Yeah too far. No

[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:49.360]
Are you kidding me KXEL 50,000 wants on 1040 on AM you'd hear it like yeah like it was stuck in your

[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.500]
That was no woman here

[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:57.080]
James Carol writes and this is ties right in with our poll today in the Boston Globe all God all the time

[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:59.540]
When they told us in Sunday school that God is everywhere

[02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:02.540]
They could have been talking about the recent news cycle with Harry admirers

[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:05.680]
We see that God lives in the politics of the West Supreme Court nomination process

[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:08.260]
In a culture defined by separation in search in the state

[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:10.700]
President Bush and his allies have mastered the use of religious

[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:14.200]
Affirmation as a deflection not only of criticism but of critical thought

[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:16.280]
God is thus a trump card of free past

[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:21.540]
If the president senators and members of Congress can justify the decisions by appeals to God why not judges

[02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:28.180]
Acts of God is the phrase applied to staggering natural disasters from Katrina and the Pakistan earthquake to the coming avian flu

[02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:34.380]
At the same time survivors of such attempts to be credit God for having saved them is if God calcly that all the others die

[02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:40.140]
Humans are perplexed when rotten suffering occurs especially among young children and assumptions about God are overturned

[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:45.480]
The question becomes how could God let this happen today in Pakistan where fatal disease hunger and thirst go unabated

[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:52.220]
The very ones who praised God last week for sparing them are pleading with God now to know avail in the argument between creationists and scientists

[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:57.080]
Those aiming to defend God make excellent claims about mysteries of the past is if they themselves were there

[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.940]
Air Force flyers have thought of God as their co-pilot in the past

[02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:04.380]
But in today's Air Force God sits atop the chain of command at the U.S. Air Force Academy

[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:08.540]
Which was rocked by six scandals not long ago God is now the designated dean of discipline

[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:12.840]
But this jeopardizes infantile careers unique cohesion requires conversion

[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:18.360]
Indeed displays of faith can be a prerequisite for promotions throughout the government where the White House itself is a house of God

[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:24.540]
In Iraq, meanwhile somebody will turn his body into a tomb today coming up is by blowing himself up by saying God is great

[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:28.060]
Who is this God and whose name somebody diverse in troubling things take place?

[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:31.160]
Why is it assumed to be good to affirm one's faith in such an entity?

[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:36.460]
Why is it thought to be wicked to deny its existence most wrecking about so much talk of God both were fermented in

[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:41.020]
I is the way in which many who use this line would seem to know exactly to what end or whom it refers

[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:47.100]
God is spoken of as if God were the Wizard of Oz or the great CEO in the sky or grandpa or the Grand Inquisitor

[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:49.520]
God is the clockmaker the puppeteer the author

[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:53.020]
God is the light the mother the wind across the sea the breath and every set of lungs

[02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:56.320]
God is the horizon that is all of these things all of these things

[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:01.780]
But what if God is none of them what if every possible information that can be made of God even by the so-called religions of

[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:04.040]
Truth of God has to be false

[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:08.980]
Who's the atheist then the good God talked that infuses public discourse in contemporary America

[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:14.880]
This ends from an anthropomorphic habit of mind dating to the Bible and beyond the treats God like an intimate friend or well-known enemy

[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.860]
Depending on the weather and the outcome of battles

[02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:22.680]
But there's another strain in the biblical tradition that insists on the radical openness of God and other is so complete that even the use of the word

[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:24.660]
God is a name for this other one is forbidden

[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:29.760]
According to this understanding God is God precisely in escaping and transcending comprehension by human beings

[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.660]
This can only seem to mean that God is simply unknowable if so humans are better off not bothering about it

[02:22:34.660 --> 02:22:38.180]
atheism agnosticism or childish anthropomorphism all the same

[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:41.480]
But here's where it gets tricky what if God's unknowability is the most

[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:47.040]
Eliminating profundity humans can know about God that would mean that there were religious language instead of opening in the absolute

[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:51.560]
Certitude on which all forms of framful superiority are based would open to the true modesty

[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:58.300]
The closed creation in which every question has an answer will be replaced by an infinite cosmos where every answer sparks a new question

[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:04.340]
If what we mean by God is the living pulse of such open-endedness then God is of no use in systems of dominance censorship for power

[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:10.520]
God is everywhere. Yes, but also God is nowhere and that too shows in America especially in its fake religiously

[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:15.000]

Hmm, I'm really digging my men but when I'm talking it on you know, it's a real expense to look a down

Got a clear my car. Can't believe how I'm talking

It's hard to think of shorties when you're walking

[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:04.380]
Don't be the cry. No, I don't mean the cut

I can't

[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.740]

Bye bye bye
