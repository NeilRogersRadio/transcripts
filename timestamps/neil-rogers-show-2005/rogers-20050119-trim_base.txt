[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]
What I would count on is Neil Rogers was up in hockey land in Toronto.

[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.740]
Neil gets his hockey fixes from watching some my league hockey occasionally.

[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.420]
He's going to be with you for the next four hours.

[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.900]
And after that, it's anybody's guess.

[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.320]
I missed choice yesterday.

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.460]
Neil, she was in the building.

[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.200]
Yeah.

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.400]
I guess you resolved exactly what we thought she resolved.

[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.880]
Nothing.

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.820]
I think they're going to resolve today at that Trevor Lyndon meeting.

[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.000]
How can you have a meeting?

[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.020]
Whether you without the principal, without the principal,

[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.200]
our parties there and there's trying to say, well, you know, this is at least,

[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.200]
what this is a dog and pony show.

[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.500]
So the players can say, well, at least we made one last gas attempt and we try to do something.

[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.520]
Then they're going to go home.

[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.380]
Yeah, I was on the impression goal to you organize that meeting.

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.100]
Try to salvage, try to salvage a little bit of work.

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.920]
You know something he might be in there when he come right down.

[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.760]
I got two things I need to ask you about.

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.040]
Yes.

[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.300]
Well, I may not ask you about, but like Chris Myers,

[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.140]
he was Sonny's understudy.

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.340]
KT when I came to town.

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.980]
I mean, he was.

[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.760]
That's right.

[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.940]
And I saw him on one of the games over the weekend and I'm going to tell you what happened to Chris.

[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.880]
It looked like somebody stuck a bicycle pump and his neck and blue is head up.

[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.840]
I guess that's old age.

[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.760]
Yeah.

[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.960]
Chris is all of about 40 now.

[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.620]
Yeah.

[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.060]
It looks about 80 on air.

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.420]
Looks like Puffy, you know, not puppy com is, but like puppy in the face.

[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.680]
And also Joe Buck.

[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.220]
Now what's your take on Joe Buck?

[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.500]
Because you don't have a great word that you use on PL.

[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.680]
Unconscious.

[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.280]
Really?

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.960]
It fits Joe Buck to a tee.

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.720]
I'm reading this.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.960]
You know, Dr. Z and sports illustrated who rates the various announcing teams.

[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.300]
Yeah.

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.460]
So I.

[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.320]
He rates the fifth string guys over the first string guys.

[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.740]
Yeah.

[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.860]
He's all over the place, but he did rip Joe Buck and ass, which I thought was pretty.

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.640]
I did too.

[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.520]
I thought his, you know, he is so.

[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.380]
They become so psychomones self-important, self righteous and anxious.

[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.200]
Right.

[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.340]
And has no interest in detail or describing what's really happening in a game.

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.940]
And see guys, kids like Josh quarter think that Joe Buck is great because there's such a

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.340]
lack in the last 20 years of any new blood in sports cast.

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.380]
And there just aren't any great news sports castes.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.420]
I talked about that yesterday.

[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.200]
Tommy.

[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.880]
Well, what the why if he has the opportunity would be great if he was like the hero is

[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.680]
reporting that he's going to get the opportunity on TV.

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.220]
Yeah.

[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.880]
Well, good.

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.180]
Well, that's maybe they heard me yesterday.

[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.000]
It's what I suggested.

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.840]
So Josh quarters should be next in line into radio.

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.460]
He certainly could do a better job at a mall in the other guy we got now.

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.520]
Oh, brother.

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.900]
But you know what irritated me about Buck on that whole Randy Moss thing.

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.920]
And I know Randy Moss is a jerk and all that.

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380]
But yeah, but he's right.

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.800]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.860]
Randy Moss is a jerk, but they have the cameras on him or the entire game.

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.880]
And they continue showing everything he does.

[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.980]
And then they, oh, gee, it's too bad you had to see it.

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.440]
Well, if they weren't showing everything he did, we wouldn't have had to see it.

[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.700]
Well, they didn't show it again.

[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.900]
And what bothers me about is they misreported what he did.

[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.640]
You know, if you turned off that telecast, you thought he dropped his pants because that's the

[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.160]
one and the post game showed him doing a correct that he dropped his trial and took a dump

[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.380]
right there in the Enzo man.

[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.100]
And it was a deal.

[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.940]
He made about it.

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.960]
He didn't do a squad.

[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.240]

[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.760]
In fact, when Tony Dungee explained a tradition in Green Bay about the Green Bay fans moaning

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.900]
the opposition players all the time, that told us what that was all about.

[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.900]
That was the history of that.

[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.200]
Well, and for some reason, Chris Collins were, it didn't say anything on the broadcast,

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.860]
but on his HBO show during the week, he talked about how before the game, they were

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.300]
going Rachel, you know, Rachel insults Adam calling him fuck we.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.820]
Right.

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.180]
And he, and he's supposed to, you know, just let that all go.

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.500]
I thought the fine was out of line.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.120]
And I thought the bucks reporting was just way over the top.

[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.820]
But at least he's consistent.

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.880]
I'm sure I like that.

[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.820]
It's your word.

[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.560]
I love that word.

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.360]
That's your joke, Buck.

[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.580]

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.800]
All right.

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.340]
Heidi overrated mediocre and his daddy's turning over in his grave, believe you may.

[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.540]
I got news for a Joe Buck couldn't, he couldn't lick daddy's butt.

[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.220]
I can't believe what I just saw.

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.980]
Well, at least he was, you know, last couple of years he was seen out, but he had that

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.560]
growth voice.

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.280]
He was a personality.

[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.180]
He was memorable.

[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.680]
20 years from now, I was going to remember Joe Buck.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.460]
How about Joe Buck and Hank Stram on Monday night football?

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.280]
That was great.

[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.740]
You know, I used to do the radio on this.

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.140]
Jack Park, I'm sorry.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.120]
And don't get answers.

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.360]
I mean, I won't do that.

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.620]
It's just the early in the morning for me.

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.880]
How are you handling it now?

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.360]
I'm OK.

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.960]
Everything seems to be going great.

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.360]
Yeah.

[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.500]
And I'm not going to track any afternoon.

[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.440]
No.

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.180]
Because I just won't do that.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.640]
First of all, I'm not going to gallstream, but we know that they put men's rooms in

[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.660]
air, not for a while.

[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.400]
And I love anybody under 70 to go in.

[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.700]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.160]
So, you know, I go home.

[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.440]
I get on a treadmill for a little while.

[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.200]
And then I'm lost.

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.040]
I have no idea what to do with the rest of the day.

[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.960]
I take a map, take a cat map from like about three to five.

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.020]
And then you'll be all set to go.

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.680]
Somebody told me yesterday that a power map, like a half hour map is better than a cat

[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.360]
map because of that.

[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.960]
That's true.

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.580]
You know what I do?

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.920]
I take like 4.30 afternoon, I got a great couch up from my head down on the pillow and

[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.020]
automatically fall asleep for exactly one hour.

[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.880]
I don't know why, but I just almost every day.

[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.880]
I take an nap for now and I wake up and I'm ready to do a kick-ass.

[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.420]
All right.

[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.100]
Usually my own.

[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.380]
Well, kick some ass this morning.

[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.300]
We'll be living in the show.

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.360]
We'll try not to be too anxious.

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.820]
Yes.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120]
Love that word, Neil.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.780]
Bye-bye.

[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.200]
Don't lose too much, see ya.

[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.520]
How do you like it so far?

[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.120]
It's great.

[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.340]
Do it again.

[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.680]
The crap you can unwrap.

[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.480]
All the slime all the time.

[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.320]
I am old.

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.820]
What do you know?

[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.920]
What do you say?

[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.060]
I don't show it to me around here.

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.800]
That's nobody coming in.

[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.380]
I was trying to let people in.

[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.240]
Oh no.

[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.460]
Oh no.

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640]
We should shut up.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.000]
Do I get nothing out of here?

[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.720]
No, I'm not.

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.240]
Why you porous with my car?

[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.160]
I'd be rolling my window up round out.

[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.780]
No.

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.300]
Come on, but me and Ty's ain't got a shell.

[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.260]
And Ty's no shell.

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.240]
That's a good one.

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.520]

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.700]
Hey, here's my soul fast, pal.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.620]
Pull without your ass.

[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.400]
It's not a shackle.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.960]
You got none.

[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.560]
No, I mean, pull.

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.900]
Pull.

[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.040]

[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.180]
Pull.

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.240]

[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.340]

[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.360]

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.440]

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.440]

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.480]

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.600]
Pull.

[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.060]
Pull.

[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.280]
Pull.

[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.280]
Tell us, baby, so…

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.380]
Drink.

[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.940]
Please, drink.

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.340]
drink.

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.820]
You are so faint.

[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.500]
You're so far away from me."

[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.180]
I have felt a**.

[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.220]
Say agents file.

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520]
What would you like?

[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.300]
When it's crazy.

[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.180]
Give out your sore brother.

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.660]
Give it back.

[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.720]
Choose a hundred girls.

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.780]
Talk to mage.

[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.940]
I just want to know if you can loan me $5,000.

[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.400]
Can't find your record now you just got still waiting.

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.080]
You know my guess don't come easy.

[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.820]
That's why I can tolerate congestion for loans.

[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.280]
No, not that you'll pay me back.

[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.960]
I ain't no chase man at this.

[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.500]
But what can I call another being in that bag?

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.160]
I can't stand you in a car amongst a man.

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.960]
You just take one out, that's not the way it's my time to stand.

[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.060]
I can't stand you.

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.820]
That's not the way it's my time to stand.

[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.720]
Oh yeah, and I can't stand you.

[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.920]
No, no, no, no.

[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.740]
I can't stand you.

[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.720]
Don't let go of that.

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.660]
Don't let go of that.

[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.440]
A little bit of countertops there, kind of like the Barbara Boxer,

[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.720]
Senator Barbara Boxer, California, and the Unchist Condoleezza Rice versus going out right now.

[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.020]
Barbara said she'd like to take an aluminum tube and show it up condolences.

[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.460]
Something.

[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.880]
And that was she just said?

[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.000]
Exactly what she said.

[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.260]

[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.080]
Anyway, maybe she ought to give her a good time.

[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.580]
Although I think in Condoleezza's case it's not really necessary at the moot point.

[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.900]
Anyway, that was really, I'm just ecstatic.

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.280]
I'm like emotional.

[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.520]
Not quite as emotional as when I saw Jury Lido in that movie last night.

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.360]
Boy, that's a good, no, it wasn't a good movie.

[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.260]
No, it's a good scene.

[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.260]
There was some good scenes, right?

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.160]
Last of the high kings Irish movie, some very pasty looking Irish people in there,

[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.680]
but the lovely Jury Lido is in there.

[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.140]
He is my Carmella DeCezer, is Jury Lido like that.

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.320]
I wanted to watch it and then I watched all the Irish movies.

[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.960]
Actually, I take that back.

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.560]
He's a little scrawny, but nevertheless, he's just something about him.

[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.780]
He would do just fine.

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.600]
Anyway, we asked yesterday who's the hottest baby who has been on the Beated Curtain on the

[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.360]
Irishers.com.

[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.680]
Now, I could read the whole list, which would take you to about 145.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.660]
That would not be a good idea.

[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.400]
That would be a cop out.

[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.740]
We could either do that or take some really good calls.

[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.460]
QAM, hello.

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.380]
Hey, how are you doing?

[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.340]
I need to ask you a question.

[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.300]
Let's jump to him on the website.

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.960]
Which is the name of that skit that he runs says Kiss and Make Good Morning.

[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.840]
That was good.

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.060]
Like I said, await him.

[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.620]
Now, maybe this is the one he was thinking about.

[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.600]
Maybe that was it.

[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.060]
Maybe.

[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.040]
We'll check that out.

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.340]
Okay, who is the hottest baby who's been on the Beated Curtain?

[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.300]
Carmella DeCezer or DeCezer, which I like to say in that.

[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.640]
DeCezer, da da da da da da.

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.840]
440 votes.

[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.660]
He just killed the competition, man.

[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.080]
She kicked Big Fat ass.

[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.360]
Angelina Jolie, I'll just read a few of the double.

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.200]
Did you want to say, okay?

[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:18.680]
Okay.

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.880]
Well, no, if I read all the other ones, we'd be on here tonight.

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.740]
Angelina Jolie, 81.

[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.520]
Anna Cornelholy, 54.

[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.920]
Carmen Electra, 48.

[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.060]
Alissa Milano, 48.

[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.480]
Halley Berry, 45.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.780]
Charlize Theroll, 39.

[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.520]
Abyan Barbod, 24.

[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.580]
Jennifer Conley, at Elmer, 1st and 21.

[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.040]
A piece.

[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.040]
Shusha Menge, Menge, Hell.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.540]
Menge, Menge, Menge, Hell.

[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:37.780]
Careful.

[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:38.700]
Shusha.

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.260]
Shusha.

[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.980]
Shusha, Menge, Hell, 20.

[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.520]
Shusha, Britney Spears, and Barbie Vettany, Ted 20.

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.320]
Boy, Britney used.

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.760]
She's taking a big plop down the ladder, man.

[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.160]
Her stock is like a faster than N-Ron.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.980]
All her antics.

[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.780]
Yeah, all her antics, all her sleazen or robodums,

[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.320]
slimy yahos.

[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.600]
Jenna Jamison, 19.

[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.620]
Sophia Loren, 18.

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.320]
Joan Bondel had 17 out of the make that guy happy.

[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.860]
Tanya Harding, 16.

[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.380]
That, I do not understand.

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.000]
Sophia Vergara, 15.

[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.100]
Jessica Beale, 15.

[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.200]
Howard Beale, didn't get any.

[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.400]
Denise Richards, 15.

[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.400]
Tiffany Amber Thieson, had 14.

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.280]
Todd with Monica Balucci, 14.

[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.660]
John Balucci didn't have any.

[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.060]
Jamie Pressley, 14.

[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.380]
The King, didn't have any.

[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.360]
Oh, this one character.

[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.840]
This one Irish kid in the movie with Jerrelito.

[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.940]
His whole thing is about the King, about Elvis.

[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.980]
And then when Elvis dies, this is supposedly takes place in 1977.

[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.380]
And when Elvis dies, they hold a candlelight vigil on the beach.

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.820]
But anyway, it's pretty sad.

[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.800]
Rachel Hunter and Jamie Pressley and Alia each have 12.

[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.560]
How's Alia doing?

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.780]
But that's the Williams, Sarah Michelle Geller, and Jennifer Aniston,

[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.120]
and Ashley Judd, each have 10.

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.280]
And last but not least, in double digits, Lindsey Lohan had 10.

[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.780]
And that's it for double digits.

[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.360]
We have 4,000 other names on there, and if things get a little slow,

[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.280]
if the other calls are as good as the first one, maybe I'll just read those all day.

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:49.740]
What are you saying?

[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.460]
Sure.

[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.660]
That was really great for the person that Joe Buck is anxious.

[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.420]
How do you like that, Josh?

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.320]
Okay.

[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.300]
Well, you could be stubborn.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.140]
I mean, your mentality or opinion, even if it's wrong.

[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.180]
I mean, you can think Joe Buck's a great broadcaster.

[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.920]
I'm telling you right now, 40 years from now, nobody, or remember Joe Buck.

[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.660]
You'll say, hey, wouldn't you think of Joe Buck?

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.460]
And I'll say, who?

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.220]
Right?

[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:10.880]
What's that?

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.220]
Just Tonya.

[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.280]
I mean, you can believe me or not.

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.500]
Trust me when I tell you this is one thing I know about.

[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.540]
There aren't too many things in life I know about, but one thing I know is my sports casters,

[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.440]
Mr. and I'm Tonya right now, Joe Buck ain't one of them.

[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.860]
One of those great classic, memorable, legendary sports casters.

[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.300]
He ain't one of them.

[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.880]
Now, Kirk Gaudi was, again, one of the big fan of his, but he was one of them because he was legendary.

[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880]
He was there for his Indian years.

[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.880]
Whether it was the old AFL games, remember those before you were born?

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.260]
No.

[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.320]
No, but...

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.560]
You've heard about that.

[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:37.700]
Yeah.

[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.020]
You've heard of Jean Facendo doing the NFL films on that game.

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:48.660]
Yeah, for the great games between Kansas City and the Raiders, all of those phenomenal

[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.120]
games.

[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.900]
There are a Monica quarterbacking Oakland Man, George Blanda.

[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.160]
Number 95-year-old fuel roll kicker, George Blanda.

[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.960]
Yeah, I've seen him on the classic.

[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.520]
Right.

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.880]
Those are the days, man.

[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.780]
When the scores used to be like 75 to 48, things like that.

[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.780]
Those were exciting games.

[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.480]
But nevertheless, let's not live in a past.

[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.380]
You can't live in a past.

[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.060]
Let's move on.

[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.880]
Upward and forward and inward, right?

[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.340]
Right.

[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.140]
Get with it.

[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.020]
We did curtain.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.400]
We got another and even nicer.

[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.600]
Well, they all in each one.

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.220]
You don't know bad pictures of Carmella this season.

[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.460]
So we have a new one today and we have one every day this week.

[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.460]
And then the top five from that pool.

[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.840]
So we better save that pool, right?

[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.320]
Right.

[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.980]
So Carmella, I think we take the one from last Friday and put that on again next Monday for anybody

[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.360]
who's more.

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.340]
Unless you got that many, we can put a different one on Monday.

[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:29.920]
That would be neat.

[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.780]
I do.

[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.480]
Do you?

[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.880]
Yeah.

[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.560]
Yeah, that naked picture of Gerald Lido from that movie I saw last night.

[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.340]
No, sorry.

[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.440]
Oh, you ought to find that.

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:36.920]
You're welcome.

[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.680]
Well, I'm looking forward.

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.040]
Angelina Jolie, Anna Cornelholy, Carmen Lector and Alyssa Milano.

[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.280]
Those are the top five.

[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.180]
So there would be the ones that will be on there each day next week and then we'll see how

[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.020]
that works out.

[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.480]
Not that there's like a competition there, but there was unemployment yesterday.

[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.220]
And it really wasn't any competition.

[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.320]
It was as they say on the West Coast.

[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.380]
It was a green job.

[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.600]
Is that what they say in the corn factory?

[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.180]
No.

[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.880]
The Charlie Green Giant set.

[00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.700]
No, seriously.

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.500]
She just demolished the competition.

[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.180]
Yeah.

[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.980]
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two bag.

[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.660]
And I hope there's somewhere in Hell in the Bay.

[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.860]
It's El Michael.

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.140]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.140]

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.280]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.460]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:30.520]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.280]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.340]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:31.760]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:31.860]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.380]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.380]

[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.420]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.940]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.960]
I'm going to kick his ass.

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.960]
You shut up stupidity.

[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.060]
I remember he put those dialogues on Joe's name.

[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.780]
Oh yeah, sure.

[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.460]
There was at the park, Sheridan.

[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.740]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.360]
You want to bet it?

[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.260]
No, no, no.

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.300]
That was quite a twist we had at night.

[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.180]
No, no, no, no.

[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.100]
Yeah.

[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.180]
Yeah.

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.820]

[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.200]

[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.200]

[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.200]

[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.200]

[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.360]
Yeah.

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:31.760]
Yeah.

[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:34.820]
Oh yeah.

[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:34.820]

[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:34.820]

[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.260]
No, no.

[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:35.360]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.000]
Yeah.

[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.060]
Yeah.

[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.040]
Anyway, here's the poll question today.

[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.820]
Who are what is the most disappointing flash in the pan?

[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.400]
Thanks to Sean.

[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.500]
For he sure, he must have had these like you said.

[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.020]
Right.

[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.460]
For letting him back.

[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.880]
He was already fact-sub-able when you said that.

[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.780]
That was your psyche.

[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.460]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.860]
He must have already had this list just waiting for me to a beg.

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.620]
You know, that's okay.

[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.740]
I ain't too proud to beg.

[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.980]
Good poll question.

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.360]
Who are what is the most disappointing flash in the pan?

[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.620]
We've already gotten, now let's see, you added couple more

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.180]
to the ones I had on there and he had.

[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.920]
What do we got so far?

[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.680]
We got Scott Farrows got six, flash in a pan.

[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.720]
Well, he was on for about four months on this station

[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.380]
and then he kind of like racked himself right off the radio.

[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.260]
Howard Dean for vanilla ice three, Quentin Tarantino one,

[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.860]
Kurt Warner one, Millie Vannelly and Twin Peaks so far.

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.760]
We only got 15 votes on there so far.

[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.000]
None, I'm sure we got many other flashes in the pan.

[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.240]
They'll be coming in on the phone, maybe one or two.

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.480]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 50, by the way, again,

[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.660]
I hate to burst your bubblegif.

[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.440]
But let's get all the bats off out of the way in one day

[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.980]
and we'll just get out of the way.

[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.940]
Sue's getting married.

[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.420]
I didn't.

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.180]
Mike Piazza.

[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.520]
Oh yeah, he said that.

[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.660]
You don't believe it?

[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.540]
Oh, I believe it.

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.420]
Are you going to start that Jeff Garcia stuff again?

[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.900]
Oh, yeah, watch that thing we got.

[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.460]
Oh, my God.

[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.780]
Hi.

[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.380]
Hi, Molly.

[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.320]
Mike Piazza.

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.920]
I mean, yay.

[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.460]
Sister, please, that Jeff Garcia is just giving me a break.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.780]
Maybe it's just an application, you think?

[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.340]
Sure, I think she's still here.

[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.820]
Grimer.

[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.020]
My God.

[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.680]
Although foreign for Jeff Garcia, we never

[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.660]
would have found Carmella.

[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.800]
I think Carmella kept her on it.

[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.240]
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.440]
Oh, I know exactly.

[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:04.760]

[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.520]
Whoever found her.

[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.000]
So thank you, Jeff Garcia.

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.100]
I already had a picture, but it was not a very good picture

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.780]
and it didn't send off any alarms.

[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.340]
Yeah.

[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.100]
Well, this one did.

[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.980]
It was alarming.

[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.020]
Mike Piazza is getting hits to a lot of people.

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.560]
That's alarming too, because he's another one.

[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.780]
It was always a room where to be just because he squatted

[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.600]
down all the time.

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.220]
The Metz catcher is walking down the aisle with his long time

[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.620]
girlfriend.

[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.800]
They watch Bayban former playmate Alicia Richter in Miami

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.340]
during the last weekend in January.

[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.660]
In other words, very, very soon.

[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.660]
So, we're so serious today.

[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.060]
I guess I got to find her picture now.

[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.060]
Do you know who that is?

[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.680]
Alicia Richter?

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.580]
Well, I've heard of her.

[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.080]
Former playmate.

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.500]
Well, that means she's out there.

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.780]
Former Baywatch.

[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.380]
I'll do you know like that show because it's

[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.640]
Pamela and her husband was on it.

[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.080]
Inking it up.

[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.380]
And of course, so what's his name?

[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.520]
David Tassel.

[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.980]
I still Richter in her case.

[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.120]
Her name is RICKTER.

[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.300]
Alicia Richter.

[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.560]
RICKTER says the New York Post got it.

[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.800]
So Mike Piazza is getting married.

[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.740]
Thank God for that.

[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.620]
Oh God.

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.940]
We don't want the sports world overtaking

[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.240]
with all these mitochondrists, man.

[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:57.880]
It's bad.

[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.320]
WDQA and hello.

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.580]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.460]
Pretty good, pal.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.640]
I got one for your list.

[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.300]
Excellent.

[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.080]
John Kerry.

[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.740]
John Kerry.

[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.740]
John Kerry.

[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.120]
Oh, John Kerry, OK?

[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.980]
Yes, there are.

[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.780]
Her president.

[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.060]
I know the thing, Neil.

[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.540]
Yeah.

[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.060]
I am thick and tall to see all these five asses in the stands.

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.820]
I want to walk to Pamela's game.

[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.520]
Yeah, right.

[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:17.820]
Amen.

[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:18.780]
Right.

[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.880]
I don't want to see the people on the sidelines.

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.740]
I don't want to see the pan-ass clowns in the stands.

[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.600]
I'll run it around naked in 20 below.

[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.520]
And nobody wants to see those people.

[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.020]
We want to see the game.

[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.560]
You idiots at CBS and Fox and ABC.

[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.380]
We want to see the game.

[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.640]
There's a little game anyway, because it's 90% commercials

[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.620]
and promos now.

[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.800]
So let's give us a little bit of the game, OK?

[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.820]
Well, name his Brady's touchdown and that game last week.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.720]
That was absolutely unacceptable as what it was.

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.820]
Somebody should have been a horsewhip for that, don't you think?

[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:47.980]
Yes, we have questions.

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.440]
See Tom Brady stick his way into that pile, his way drive,

[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.720]
drive through that pile.

[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.860]
Just barely got in there, too, by the way.

[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.700]
WQA and hello.

[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.340]
Michael and son, boys.

[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.840]
WQA and hello.

[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:00.540]
QA and.

[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.000]
Hey, Neil.

[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.280]

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.240]
Nice job, Vince.

[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.220]
Pick Eric Gumerow.

[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.240]
5, 6, 7, or 8.

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.000]
Maybe they're not going to respond to this pool today.

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.620]
That would be fine.

[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.500]
We're just maybe it's the middle of the week we hit a dead end.

[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.140]
That could be it.

[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.840]
The most disappointing, who are what is the biggest flash

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.360]
in the pan?

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.680]
You think there'll be zillions of those kind of people, right?

[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.800]
Here today, go on tomorrow.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:19.820]
Wouldn't you?

[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.460]
You think?

[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.020]
Yeah.

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.940]
But there aren't.

[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.060]
WQA and hello.

[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.980]
QA and.

[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.380]
Neil.

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.000]
I thought Mark the bird, Vidrich.

[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.540]
Yeah, that was on.

[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.140]
This isn't Sean.

[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:33.660]
Is it?

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.280]
No, no.

[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.480]
This is first time caller, Neil.

[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.080]
Because he had that on his list and nobody knows who the hell

[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.420]
that is.

[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.440]
But I'll put him on here because that's two people saying it.

[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.160]
So I'll put him on there.

[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.660]
I remember him.

[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.680]
He was very popular.

[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.140]
You'd do well, but I'm a tiger fan.

[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.800]
That's why I know.

[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.580]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.520]
I apologize that.

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.140]
Good luck to pal.

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.760]
You'll need it.

[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.460]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.060]
OK.

[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.700]
Well, the poor tiger is Detroit.

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.800]
How the mighty have fallen.

[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.260]
Wow.

[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.540]
That is really sad.

[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.220]
Mark the bird, Vidrich.

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:56.940]
You got it?

[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.320]
That's spelled F-I-D-R-Y-C-H.

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.600]
Mark the bird, Vidrich.

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.780]
You know who that is, don't you, John?

[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.460]
I don't.

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.300]
You don't?

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:04.760]
No.

[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.400]
He was a very charismatic pitcher for the Tigers, for a short

[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:09.960]
period of time.

[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.400]
And he's like, you know, he's a wild man on the mountain.

[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.460]
He used to do all these things.

[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.680]
And I don't remember what the whole deal about him.

[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.620]
But and then that was it.

[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.680]
He was there and then he was gone.

[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.540]
He was no Danny McLean.

[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.700]
But then I understand Mark the bird, Vidrich, is probably

[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.400]
on the outside.

[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.180]
5'670560, pound 5'60 and a Verizon singular,

[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:26.740]
Rottles line.

[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.880]
Line 9, WQA, hello.

[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.340]
Good one.

[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.040]
QA, hello.

[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500]
Hey Neil, how about you?

[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.460]
I got you down, lady.

[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.900]
Flash in the fan.

[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.700]
They're in the air.

[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.800]
Hey, wait, I got some mouse, though, because I said that.

[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.100]
Hey, you had air in summers, John?

[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.480]
Yeah, I do.

[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.120]
Hey, um, Mohaward, just your name.

[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.820]
Oh, really?

[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.400]
Wow.

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:45.940]
Yeah.

[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.920]
That you shouldn't be, that you should stick to basically

[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.160]
what you're good with and you shouldn't be talking about sports.

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.740]
Who said that?

[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.520]
That's what Mohaward was saying yesterday.

[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.320]
You need to know what?

[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380]
What do I give a crap about?

[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.800]
In other words, I need him to tell me what I should talk about.

[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.720]
He was saying back in the day, he were good at what

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.400]
you call him baseball or something like that.

[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.400]
Yeah, how does he know?

[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]
He didn't hear it.

[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.180]
He said, but that was back in the day.

[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:07.880]
Yeah.

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.280]
He said, that's not now.

[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.860]
And you shouldn't be talking about sports, baby.

[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.240]
Tell me more about programming his own three hours over here

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.240]
than nobody wants on a year.

[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.000]
How do great day of power?

[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.120]
I could like to air in summers.

[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.620]
Yeah, Mohaward, you're about your own crappy three hours there

[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.980]
where you're butlicking interviews with all those people

[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.440]
and nobody wants to hear, okay?

[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.620]
With Dick Stockton.

[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.920]
Oh my God, if I have to hear any more of these old hacks

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.120]
on there with Mohaward,

[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.300]
one of the old hack is enough without having a pair on there.

[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.420]
See, when he resents, the fact that we're talking stuff on here,

[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.780]
he doesn't dare to rip the ass to most of these other guys

[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.260]
because they're his colleagues in the business.

[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.660]
So he's gonna kiss up to him, you know?

[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.540]
I was ecstatic that Hank had the balls to call Joe Bucke.

[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.500]
I'm just, that was good.

[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.280]
That means that Josh probably

[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.080]
didn't speak in a Hank anymore for a while, a couple weeks,

[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.760]
but that's okay.

[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.040]
You get over it.

[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.520]
Here's some good news finally.

[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.520]
Broward Commission sets March 8th Special Election on Slots.

[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.160]
How do you like that?

[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.700]
All right.

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.420]
I think the sky is gonna fall

[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.240]
because we may have real slot machines in Florida.

[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.540]
I don't think we'll ever be the same again.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.080]
Well, while this was going on,

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.020]
where's that story I have about your fat ass governor?

[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.040]
What a jackass man, what a piece of crap.

[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.140]
But you people in Florida seem to love a man.

[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.120]
You'll ever got it really a sticks it to you.

[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.800]
Did I actually put that story out or not?

[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.220]
They get it in bother with it.

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.580]
No about how he's like giving tax cuts to the rich against him.

[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.020]
Right, right.

[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.120]
And no money for education in the new budget.

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.880]
And this ridiculous spending money

[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.020]
like this coming out of a faucet.

[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.560]
Oh, what a fat ass governor runs in the family, man.

[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.560]
I don't think I even printed out was too depressing.

[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.640]
Anyway, Broward County commissioners on today

[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.020]
said a special election for March 8th

[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.340]
for voters to decide whether to run

[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.920]
on slot machines at the RSV race tracks

[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.760]
in one highlight front on commissioners

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.860]
at the special referendum.

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.200]
After working out a deal with the gaming industry,

[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.660]
to cover the cost of extra law enforcement

[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.160]
and government services that'll be needed.

[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.500]
A poll in Tuver charge that the vote has been rushed

[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.980]
by high powered gambling lobbyists

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.480]
and plan to challenge its legality in court soon.

[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.780]
Yeah, keep trying losers.

[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.120]
By an eight to one vote,

[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.440]
County commissioners agreed yesterday

[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.280]
to end the referendum to that they scheduled local elections.

[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.200]
If voters approved state lawmakers

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.900]
will have to July 1st, 2006 to cramp legislation

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.880]
detailing how the machines will be licensed

[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.260]
to regulate it in Broward County.

[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.240]
Wow, what?

[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.060]
Last November, we know about that vote.

[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.520]
Texas on Islam Machine Revenue

[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.660]
is with supplement public education funding statewide.

[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.340]
Advocates say it could pump as much as 400 million

[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.520]
year into the state coffers.

[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.940]
If voters pass the measure,

[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.840]
lawmakers would have to decide how many machines

[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.000]
have been installed at each location.

[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.740]
How many hours they could be open each day?

[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.580]
Dave commissioners will discuss the issue

[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.580]
to regularly meet tomorrow.

[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.020]
No vote regarding whether to rely on

[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.520]
selling machines at call to race course,

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.220]
Miami Highlight or the Flagler dark track

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220]
has yet been scheduled to be.

[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.380]
You can bet your bottom doubt

[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.320]
that they will be doing that tomorrow.

[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.780]
Got it?

[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.380]
Got it.

[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.200]
Besides Gulfstream, the other Broward facilities

[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.500]
eligible received Islam machines

[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.760]
include Hollywood Greyhound track,

[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.020]
Daniel Highlight and Poppano Park, Harness.

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.240]
So there you go.

[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.940]
Starting to make some progress,

[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.560]
taking little teeny tiny baby steps

[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.000]
in the rest of South Florida.

[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.280]
Even though we know that the world will,

[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.500]
the sky will come tumbling down with God's wrath

[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.140]
and it will wax hot when he starts here

[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.240]
in the sound of those slot machines.

[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.480]
When he hears, oh, part of it, when he hears that,

[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.080]
then you know that the world's coming over now.

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.140]
The way we knew it, right?

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:00.580]
Right.

[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.860]
And of course in South Florida,

[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.580]
that would be the best news if it never were the same

[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.460]
as it used to be again.

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.520]
27 past 10 and 5 60 WQA.

[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.680]
I guess this poll today is not really going to cut it,

[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.480]
you know, that's okay.

[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:10.960]
That's a good one.

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.520]
I think it is a good one.

[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.280]
But they're a little slow starting today, you know.

[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.400]
Oh, I don't know what they want.

[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.180]
Maybe they want us to spoon feed them

[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.580]
a Gerber baby food or something.

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.160]
Because after hearing some of them,

[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.840]
I think that it would be right up their alley, Sally.

[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.880]
Totally, totally.

[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.080]
say that again now there's only one reason that he ever roased the popularity you know who that

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:38.200]
was who is responsible for that uh-huh only trusted us that's it our good friend Larry who kept

[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.060]
was do do every time I saw him on air and millions of people voted him which goes to show you how

[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.660]
globally pubic really is five six seven oh five sixty he asked everyone who did a lot of votes

[00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:00.320]
Ross Perot right oh yeah who or what is the most disappointing flash in the pan so far how are

[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.700]

[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.020]
wq way and hello they knew how to go good all right all right how about Dennis Rodman

[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.060]

gone okay put him on there I don't know if they're well that's two we can play when we play Dennis

[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.740]
Rodman and huh see I thought I thought we had a full question but this is just idea for comedy

[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.240]
basically people you don't like and comedy that's that you do right but that's okay that's fine

[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.140]
yeah what a good time that's what we're here for help you kill some boredom time man in South Florida

[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.880]
let's take a look at that schedule for today we got mad dogs you managed to to for under protest he's

[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.820]
playing the game under protest four to seven we got more Howard David and by the way let me say it

[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.660]

[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.380]
here we're doing this fine we're kicking big fat Juicy ass okay so mind your own business then

[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.100]
seven o'clock we got the beast at the convocation center what's that all about the what the

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.320]
would see can voking what's he convocating well they played Duke tonight oh some of the

[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.440]
woods we got like a hour and a half pregame probably wow because we got hurricanes warm up at eight

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.960]
and then eight thirty got hurricanes in the Duke Blue Devils the where is that it says at the

[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.940]
do is it at Duke no it's at the convocation center here the one is it say it like this see this

[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.280]
clearance who supposedly is a hurricane maven you know he's part of that whole sick establishment

[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.300]
over there he doesn't know how to make out a schedule when you put a listing of a ballgame you always

[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:56.120]
put the visiting team first am I right yeah it's got hurricanes versus Duke so the way it looks on

[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.080]
here's like it's an away game but it's not so in game at the convocation center and then of course

[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.200]
Eddie K follows the basketball game such as it is any interest so they're kicking ass man they're

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.020]
really big what's that coach what's his name faith Frank hate faith yeah gotta have hate faith

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.480]
w.a.m. hello yeah for everyone's own flash in a pan right w.a.m. hello

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:22.440]
w.a.m. hello and here yes sir I wonder anyone called with a fiery foot on

[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:28.960]
a mole show that yesterday about what well he started saying things about how well I don't

[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.300]
want to add fuel to a fire but he was saying that he had to get out of match get out of

[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.740]
pick lighter man what was saying to start a conflagration he was saying comments about

[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:47.800]
about you and how you don't know anything about commentating on sports or whatnot and that

[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.740]
that your oil screw and you couldn't do it now there I believe you do a real good job if you

[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:59.060]
really have to fight for it so in other words if you couldn't be the president you can't

[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.180]
have an opinion on the president okay see the fact that I brought cash sports in the past that's

[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.980]
got nothing to do with my having an opinion on guys whether they're good better and different because

[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.900]
they got two ears okay and I've heard all the great sports casters and a lot of mediocre ones and

[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.460]
I've also heard him and believe me huh he ain't no mr. weaver see that that's what bugs him

[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:20.540]
is because he's the expert because he doesn't believe you me I will you take the opinion polls you

[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.120]
couldn't kiss Rick weaver's ass how do you like that model okay you couldn't come up to his

[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.240]
puppet in terms of stancher who you couldn't but nevertheless see this is good let's get it

[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.260]
started once again because he can't restrain himself he's only been under a few days and right

[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.720]
off the batty starting because and addition to which it's pretty obvious get a life okay you silly

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.720]
old koot get yourself a life what's he doing again the same old tired crap I'm listening

[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.760]
God anybody that works on his station I mean I can understand like Hank thousand a car on a

[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.640]
way home he's listening maybe or whatever and by him when you get home you forget about it right you

[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.460]
take most advice forget about it but oh no I'm listening all he does ever since the day he

[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.700]
darkened our door and believe me it was a dark day for for Gotham city the day he darkened our door

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.800]
with that ugly nasty muskrat on the said and every time you keep telling me oh his reform is

[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.500]
you know all you got to do is like look at him cross-eyed and his true colors come out like that

[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.980]
they started ranting and raving about the beast if that beast thinks I'm gonna make a point

[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:21.460]
hey mama grow up already get a life get a life that's your biggest problem oh you have no life

[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.480]
absolutely correction god go listen to uh pericomo records do something that's more

[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.900]

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.720]
okay see him Andrew dice clay he was big just big enough to do that for us and then that was the

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.500]
end of that what he didn't do that other guy the guy who's a born in christian yeah who refused to

[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.180]
do certain things because it was against his religious beliefs on the drop-ins but of course we

[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.160]
couldn't play those now anyways it probably just as well because they were filthy and pornographic

[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.120]
and joys would have very uh... negative feelings about that she would view them with an anxious uh...

[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.760]
the anxious i what a good name that would be for a show or a network

[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.380]
w k a m hello

what would mean calling in the i wonder what's the pull get out of here like he's going to have

[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.080]
an answer to the poll what's the pull i just turned you on the pull is my foot it where the

[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.920]
moon don't shine okay so bend down and drop your pants do a real moon okay clown who are what is

[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.820]

[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:46.920]
call he was on for about four seconds coward deen twenty four scot for our nineteen such great

[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.520]
promise we thought well i didn't think that nobody thought except your buddy gray

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.900]
see one thing that's always a good idea in this business i don't want to start on moa

[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.360]
don't don't know when you hire somebody to be in can every where they've ever been where everybody

[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.840]
hated them like poison or the created so much probably been can at about seven hundred different

[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.660]
jobs that's probably not like a real good reference starting point right

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.780]
who are you in my right yeah yeah check references that's always a pretty good idea checks

[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:15.340]
on references right but no we're gonna get him on there we're gonna report

[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.080]
i just can't believe that many to talk about old school i can't believe that many people remember him

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.580]
in addition to which by way speaking of old school i hate to break the news demo but there's

[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.320]
dr z on sports illustrator which i did finally have somebody thanks this to me who fasted

[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.340]
did you do it yeah somebody said it to me the tv commentator awards but as far as five he

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:40.200]
rates him on from like zero to five stars the uh... uh... NFL broadcasters for the third year

[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.160]
in a row nobody's got five stars that's how mediocre they are and if you i mean i'm not gonna waste

[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.760]
the time to go through this whole thing because we wasted enough time on it yesterday but i rest my

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.360]
case man and i challenge i challenge moa how are david and did to name me anybody and of course

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.380]
the book now he's gonna have the chance to have a great he's a outstanding broadcaster maybe he'll

[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:03.400]
make his own nitchin he'll be legendary someday but he's a punk right now i challenge him or anybody

[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.600]
else to tell me in the last twenty years name me one sportscaster who's gonna be remembered

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.640]
twenty thirty forty four years into from now is legend very not a question of old school

[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.720]
it's a question of broadcasting is going down the toilet

[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:21.380]
time he crammer said once too many drunks in the business is nobody said something like that too

[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.980]
many drug use too many drunks too many inquirant lunatics call in the shots that's the problem

[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.940]
let's start a big battle with him okay i just love to do i'm just itching to do it

[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:34.240]
on the air start to deal with us again okay i just knew he didn't have it any mo

[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.880]
it won't take long

[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.720]
it'll take it

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.160]
it'll take it

[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.220]
it'll take me one day

[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.360]

traditional policy the Catholic Church in Spain has said it supports the use of condoms to prevent

[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.400]
the spread of AIDS condoms have a place in the global prevention of AIDS one Antonio Martinez Camino

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.140]
spokesman for the Spanish Bishop Conference so one Antonio Martinez Camino shorts told reporters

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.640]
after meeting yesterday with health minister Elena Salgado to discuss ways of fighting the disease

[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.260]
the Catholic Church has repeatedly rebuffed campaigns for it to endorse the use of condoms in the

[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:22.240]
fight against AIDS the Vatican states that condoms being a form of artificial birth control cannot be

[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.120]
used to help prevent the spread of HIV the virus that causes AIDS Martinez Camino shorts said the

[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.020]
Church's stance was backed by the scientific world he said at a recent study oh well scientific

[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.820]
world in the Church i'm sorry but they just don't they just have a little conflict there he said

[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.820]
at a recent study by experts in the medical magazine the Lancet which supported the so-called ABC

[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.340]
approach to abstinence being faithful to partners in using condoms I don't know these condoms at ABC

[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.620]
so hockey is underway again by the way but you didn't know that hockey's underway not in south Florida though

[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.900]
the church is very worried and interested by this problem he said Martinez Camino shorts cold

[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.500]
steam the shift was welcomed by the Spanish Federation of Lesbians gays gay transsexuals and bisexuals

[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.780]
I think it was absolutely inevitable that the church would change its stance of Federation

[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:11.260]
President Beatriz Camino see I'll take it what Moa is really bad out of shape about that is the

[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.920]
team he's broadcasting with dolphins since he came to town they really started going downhill straight

[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.240]
downhill since he came is that correct that is absolutely correct I mean they just are going

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.400]
in the tank a once proud great franchise since he darkened our door they're going in the toilet man

[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.320]
while certain other teams I don't want to mention the defending world champion New England patriots are

[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.340]
just kicking ass okay that's where we need must bug his fat old hairy ass George Lucas is excellent

[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.380]
I I was trying to think that the other day you know George Lucas I'm not that I was trying to

[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.160]
think you remember sirly but some of it uh you couldn't remember his name no no I don't mean that

[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.260]
yeah I have to keep saying rape hairy rape hairy they look a lot of life George Lucas 1977 and then

[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:57.360]
I'll crap right very good right here's another one Ashley Bancroft who took on CNN with oh yeah

[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.440]
Ashley Bancroft remember she was like a 9-11 they had her featured on there with the glasses those

[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:08.340]
black frame glasses oh oh oh her reporting from huh ground zero and she was all over she was on

[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.720]
CNN MSNBC and all of some she disappeared the chick on CNN with the black glasses there was

[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.800]
on every event every uh minute around the world and all of a sudden just disappeared good one okay

[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.280]
what else we got got some facts is this poll take off they're a little slow today oh I

[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.200]
disappointed now let's see now but he wasn't a flash in a pan I see this is they didn't

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.680]
understand that it was in first huh it really didn't stay the question it says by

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.200]
disappointed I mean disappointed he's gone well that that's fine I'm glad I'm sure a lot of

[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.300]
other people like the mad dog are really disappointed that he's gone too bills in for but uh the fact

[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.500]
of the matter is he was hardly a flash in the paint did it often games with mad dog for like

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.240]
the seven years or nine years or something like that and we did a pretty good job too by the way

[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.840]
it didn't make a lot of trouble like certain other people you know don't try to get everybody fired

[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.280]
did it did and got screwed big time when somebody came to town that's a blue guy know about that

[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.800]
well I'm gonna tell you if you just mind your peas and cues most maybe you'd have a chance most

[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.800]
but uh they just can't control you just can't hold yourself back just always trying to stir it up

[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.240]
and stir it up and start taking the creativity shots instead of just trying to do a good show your

[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.180]
something there which by the way I'm not listening to I heard five minutes that one day about three

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.380]
minutes him kissing dick stock and zaz and I made a comment about it okay now I know that he's

[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.440]
sitting there listening right now every minute of every day glued to that radio oh do you hear

[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.960]
what he's saying he's talking about me about what well do you hear what uh yeah right get a life

[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:34.020]
get a life uh you silly old goat this guy's very good too I can't think of what his name is he's

[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.640]
the answer for the anaheim mighty ducks he's excellent I don't know what his name is though

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.840]
and i'm gonna say he's gonna be legendary but he is excellent but I will give that see we didn't

[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.760]
do hockey now it's just because that would be like uh talking enough thimble the whole audience would

[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.280]
bail out nobody knows from hockey now it's just Josh Cordis would know a hockey now see if they

[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.420]
stuck their foot up his ass and so although you do know who Joe Bowen is though I do right that's

[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.280]
only because I keep playing those promos right anybody you know Jeff rumor yeah he probably trying

[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.480]
to get your mind lunch couple times before left town but that's probably uh that would probably be

[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.940]
as far as hockey announces concern right right and i couldn't point those guys out by any

[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.220]
me i'm not feeling foster he wouldn't throw out wouldn't I remember them the voices no well you heard

[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.580]
me play the cards yeah i've heard them yeah so in other words you at least have an idea who they are

[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.960]
sure one there you go see when you're making progress man when hockey gets going again by the time

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.000]
they start to get in two years you're gonna be right up to snuff all right all right and they're

[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.100]
actually saying it it's not only this year but there's a very good chance the next year too is

[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.940]
what they're saying right now i don't believe that because i think a lot of these the medium and

[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.980]
lore played the salaried guys they're they're not gonna be able to hold out that long i mean the

[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.260]
guys making a big big bucks you know the guys like Matt Sundin and uh forceburg guys like that

[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.380]
well making a difference to them guys making eight nine ten million year right yummy yoghurt

[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.440]
i know that's not his name that's what Don Sherry calls him yummy yoghurt oh do you hear what Neil

[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.420]
said he didn't know his voice he called him yummy yoghurt yeah i don't know my hockey i mean i

[00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:00.160]
sure wish i knew hockey like moh Jerry Rafferty of Baker Street flashed in a pan okay okay what

[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.360]
you know what are he Jerry Rafferty had that hit yeah obscure it would be more like it well listen

[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.520]
that's what they're saying it listen to the question i'll boy you're really a hard ass today just

[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.360]
because you get it over a trash rarlin on a talent fee far were you i wouldn't be charging

[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.720]
600 bucks this spot maybe then i'll get back in a good graces again you know that's fat boy

[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.960]
yeah listen i hope fat boy somebody get him a message okay get a message to remember that

[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.780]
thing about message to Garcia get a message to Jeff Garcia now seriously fat boy you better quit

[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.460]
playing fast and lose with Georgia's income okay because i'm really tired of having to write

[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.300]
out these big fat checks to keep him and his family alive because you're screwing with his

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.620]
talent fees okay fat boy and you lie like crazy lie like a champion although that's right what's

[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.840]
the other county got you now finally try to make up for that oh um mind me highlight but that's

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.920]
done i cut their spots uh every now and then yeah and you get paid for that oh yeah about six thousand

[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.320]
a spot sure what you have to do you're gonna have to to make up for that money that it is causing you

[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.220]
a fat boy fat stuff there and he's only poor he's only prooked off about that treasure island thing

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.420]
because he's not getting those free jobs there anymore like he used to oh they're not free oh

[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.860]
on that case like i said he probably still is in fact he's probably using the money that you're

[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.280]
supposed to be getting for the talent fee to get more of those jobs speaking of uh that the panic

[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:20.880]
that's gripping american TV oh i love that the panic that is gripping american TV bosses facing a

[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.980]
puritanical backlash or exorbitant government fine as today extended to a cartoon series

[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:31.080]

entertainment tool variety yesterday and it just goes on man censorship is rampant and you can't say

my week.

[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:01.720]
What I did I do was crypto, but that it doesn't do if you play for the fish.

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.460]
I guess my girlfriend forgot to tell me.

[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.540]
There was something coming up in your room.

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.080]
That's it.

[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.420]
That's it.

[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.080]
That's it.

[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.080]

[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.580]
What is it?

[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.720]
What is it?

[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:16.720]

[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.160]
Give me the heads up on it.

[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.340]
It's a bit of a slip of the piece and it's really nothing.

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.840]
It's a foul doubt.

[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.560]
When it changed me with a dice.

[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.480]
Why didn't that bitch tell me?

[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.000]
It was too dark to see.

[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.840]
Here it comes.

[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.720]
He'd be here with the whole thing.

[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.000]
Oh yeah, and that's right.

[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:44.440]
Right now.

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.580]
I don't know what it is.

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.820]
Just a little, I could have caught it.

[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.500]
It's the skill of the battle, apparently.

[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.400]
How is he going?

[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.120]
Don't shoot it.

[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.820]
That was excellent.

[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.020]
Cecil's Lamette.

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.940]
Cecil Collins, a flash in a pan.

[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.840]
And we're getting the faxes with people that I have to owe.

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.440]
And you're right, it's Ashley Banfield, not Bancroft.

[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.600]
It's Anne Bancroft, but Ashley Banfield.

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.420]
What if she's kind of Gerald Banfield,

[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.200]
the old harness driver from Jackson Raceway?

[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.040]
See how I'm old school, Moe?

[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.740]
Ashley Banfield, can we correct that?

[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.040]
Or we like stuck with Bancroft?

[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.460]
No, it's not.

[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.560]
You're fissing it?

[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.220]
I thought that's what Cecil was doing.

[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.400]
And then it says, who are these people?

[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.240]
Jolton Joe Sharbinot and Kevin Moss.

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:20.880]
Who is that?

[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.520]
Are there sports people?

[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.420]
Josh, you ask him to say that again?

[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.700]
Jolton Joe Sharbinot and Kevin Moss.

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:28.740]
I've never heard of him.

[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.240]
I remember Duke Moss pitched for the Yankees way back

[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.080]
and because I'm old school, 100 years ago.

[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.440]
I don't have no idea who those people were.

[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.520]
Kevin Moss sounds familiar.

[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.960]
Would he see a baseball player?

[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.440]
No.

[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.360]
Not a Marlon?

[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.720]
Kevin Moss, come on.

[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.320]
Are you sure?

[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.840]
That would be embarrassing, but you're not.

[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.820]
He played for the Marlon's union.

[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.220]
I don't know that.

[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.140]
Wow, Dave Ann Boyd would never speak to you again.

[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.400]
He could only pray.

[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.480]
Elmer, who's just all over the place,

[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.960]
says it's Ashley Banfield, not Ashley Bancroft.

[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:54.540]
Please correct that name.

[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.100]
But OK, Elmer just ease off.

[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.740]
OK, a little bit.

[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.840]
Also, my suggestion with the poor is the good one.

[00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.460]
Phil Henry.

[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.140]
OK.

[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:00.880]
Good one.

[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.140]
T.S. Mike Lang is God.

[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.060]
Absolutely.

[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.580]
Yeah, he's old school.

[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.720]
That's what Moe would say.

[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.520]
Moe would know Mike Lang from Katie Lang.

[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.960]
Here's one that says Barbara Boxer reminds me

[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.780]
of Harry Truman's statement.

[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.020]
I don't give the Republicans hell.

[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.660]
I just tell the truth and they think it's hell.

[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.420]
Well, that's great.

[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.600]
The only problem is the thought of the dog in ponieshell

[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.680]
and can do no good.

[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:19.780]
The election's over.

[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.760]
I hate to break the news, Barbara.

[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.280]
But if all your Democrats were to like

[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.860]
spoken up and rattle to your spirit

[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.140]
and the way you were doing before,

[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.260]
well, maybe something could have happened.

[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.560]
OK, but it didn't, including scary John Kerry.

[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.660]
567.0560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Lines.

[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.740]
Who or what is the most disappointing flash in a pan?

[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.920]
John Kerry 36, Howard Dean 36, Scott for Route 28.

[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120]
Pretty good three-way battle there.

[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.300]
Vanilla ice 10, Quentin Tarantino 9, Ross Piro 8,

[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.000]
Mark the Bird, Fidridge 8, and Redized Play has got six.

[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.520]
Oh!

[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.920]
Kurt Warner, six, Cecil Collins, four, Millie Vanilla, four.

[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.340]
George Lucas, only three.

[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.680]
He'll do better than that, wouldn't you think?

[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:56.540]
Yeah, he will.

[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.940]
A.L.N.E.T.O. has got a pair.

[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.540]
Ashley Bancroft has got two, but we didn't take

[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.120]
long on that.

[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.520]
Aaron Summers, two, Twin Peaks has got two.

[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.420]
Well, I figure it's what they call Twin Peaks.

[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.120]
Brian Bosworth, Jerry Rafferty, Denise Rodman has got one,

[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.460]
and Phil Henry just went on there.

[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.580]
169 votes.

[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:12.960]
Got it?

[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:13.660]
Got it.

[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.640]
As the list continues growing, man, lots of flashes

[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.880]
in the pan so little time.

[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.740]
And we can also put things on there like, you know,

[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.960]
we don't have to put these on just using as an example,

[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.120]
like a Hula hoop or a slinky, you know, fads.

[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.280]
OK, fads, right?

[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:26.860]
All right.

[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.660]
Anybody got a good Hula hoop?

[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.640]
Hula hoop would be good.

[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.480]
Don't you even know it's a, I mean, if we can put Mark

[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.960]
the bird, Fidrich on there, Tennessee court

[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.320]
allows church suit to proceed.

[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.240]
The State Supreme Court in Nashville, Tennessee,

[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.560]
says a $68 million lawsuit alleging

[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.520]
that the Roman Catholic diocese of Nashville

[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.300]
covered up child sex abuse by a former priest can go forward.

[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.020]
How do you like that?

[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:47.520]
All right.

[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.380]
The unanimous ruling issued the yesterday

[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.140]
overturned lower courts, which had said that

[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.660]
diocese could not be held responsible for the emotional distress

[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.820]
alleged by the plaintiffs.

[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.980]
The high court in its ruling said a defendant can be found

[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.320]
guilty, even flick the emotional distress,

[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.660]
even if its misconduct was not directed at a specific person.

[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.840]
The court said its decision broke new legal ground

[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.560]
in such cases.

[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:04.880]
Good.

[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:05.400]
Good.

[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.260]
Put them all in jail.

[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:06.540]
OK.

[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.300]
Don't have a wonderful time in there, just like Father

[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.780]
Gagon.

[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.380]
How's he doing?

[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:10.980]
Is he still dead?

[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:11.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.260]
He's fine when he's dead.

[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.880]
I'm going to have to get to the one I got on my list.

[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.040]
All right.

[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:16.760]
Way to go.

[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.660]
I'll have to go now, you know.

[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.020]
Huh?

[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:18.820]
All right.

[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.580]
Only a few, though.

[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.100]
A former altar boy who claimed he was molested

[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.840]
by a priest reached the financial settlement

[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.960]
of his lawsuit against the Roman Catholic diocese

[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.320]
of Bridgeport, Catholic, Connecticut

[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.460]
as attorneys in church officials say yesterday,

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.700]
the plaintiff, known in the court,

[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.820]
document is John Doe, city was molested at age 14

[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.340]
by the Reverend John Castaldo in the early 90s,

[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.240]
when Castaldo was priest at St. Teresa Church in Trumbull.

[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.620]
His name in the term of settlement

[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.720]
and I've released it as a request.

[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.320]
The settlement means New York cardinal Edward Egan

[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.280]
will not have to testify next week.

[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.400]
The attorneys be saying, well, there's one.

[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.800]
And then abuse trial of notoriously

[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.340]
fraud priest begins Massachusetts prosecutors formally

[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.080]
dropped an accuser from the criminal case

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.980]
against the fraud priest Paul Shanley,

[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.480]
leaving just one alleged victim

[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.120]
to testify in the trial that began yesterday.

[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.580]
So one of the most notorious, one of the most anxious

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.700]
figures in the clergy says to be a scandal.

[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.480]
Yeah, anxious.

[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.200]
That is a good word.

[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.020]
Hank, you read about that.

[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.960]
Unchish has had like our management, anxious.

[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.520]
Prostitute has already had dropped to other accusers

[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.640]
from the case and removed the third

[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.920]
because they've been unable to find them

[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.820]
since they're hearing in October

[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.120]
when he had difficulty remaining composed to testify.

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.520]
The move to drop him from the case

[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.360]
was widely expected.

[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.080]
I'm getting there.

[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.940]
Here we have to spoke about it.

[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.340]
Oh, new developments.

[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.860]
And we exist to serve the American people.

[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.880]
We serve the American people by helping the president

[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.620]
execute his foreign policy.

[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.520]
And we have much to look back on with satisfaction.

[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.520]
Oh, Paul Bittsbury, well, bye bye, Colin.

[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.020]
Sell out.

[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.100]
The witnesses removed the leave Shanley 73,

[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.860]
facing three charges of raping a child

[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.520]
and two charges of indies and assault and battery

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.020]
on a child.

[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.920]
The maximum sentence would be life in prison.

[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.460]
About any prospective jurors were questioned today

[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.520]
for the trial that has expected the last about two weeks.

[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.300]
Four jurors, three men and one woman,

[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.980]
were seen to be four proceedings ended for the day.

[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.920]
Shanley's lawyer, Frank Mondano, has made a clear

[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.480]
he'll argue that the loan remaining accuser

[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.900]
made up his story of abuse to an monetary award

[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.580]
in the civil lawsuit.

[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.740]
The trial is one of a handful of criminal cases

[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.580]
that prosecutors have been able to bring against priests,

[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.200]
accused of molesting their young person

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.180]
whose death case he'd go on.

[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.160]
It goes on and on and on.

[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:13.480]
But nobody cares about that anymore.

[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.880]
We had, that was another thing, you know,

[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.060]
flash in a pan.

[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.620]
How about that for the poll?

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:18.500]
All right.

[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.940]
Yeah, Catholic Church molestation cases.

[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.880]
That was very big news for about five minutes

[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.500]
and then like even though it's been going on for years

[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.280]
and it's still going on, they swept it back

[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.300]
under the carpet again, you know.

[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.100]
The Pope lifted up his robe, they swept them

[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.320]
under there and they got lowered it again.

[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.840]
Yeah, we've got a lot of rubas to there.

[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.160]
Oh man, he's got a big fat one and a robe too.

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.460]
I bet he's smoking a big fat one right now

[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:38.560]
to Pope, he's in the opane.

[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.300]
It sits for pain, medical emergency,

[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.480]
that he's smoking out of the chimney,

[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:41.820]
over there.

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.340]
That's why they're always blowing smoke there.

[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.540]
Or something, five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.100]
pound, five, 60 on a Verizon, singular, wireless lines.

[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.160]
WQA and hello.

[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.120]
Oh, Gleo.

[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:51.760]
Yes sir.

[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.060]
One thing on me put this.

[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.020]
Yeah, I wanted to tell you, I know you're not talking

[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.680]
about right this, but second but there is another

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.700]
sinister reason behind the new Christian movement

[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.620]
and school, the intelligence is all right.

[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:13.220]
What they're not telling you is that one part is, you know,

[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.660]
true, but the other side is since you know,

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.100]
from the beginning of time, they all religious

[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.000]
is to preach that earth is the center of the universe

[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.800]
and all things remember.

[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:23.260]

[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.940]
If they go with the intelligent design,

[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.960]
it leaves them a little bit of wiggle room now

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.060]
for if and I shouldn't say yes,

[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.620]
when likes to discover another planet.

[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.500]
Oh, I see this is gonna give them an out.

[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.520]
I don't know how to give you an out.

[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:36.860]
Exactly.

[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.520]
Keep talking while I check and make sure

[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.120]
my heat is off to them starting to gag here.

[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:40.780]
Oh, okay.

[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.360]
Anyway, but there is another, I had read that elsewhere

[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.860]
and I put two together also, but you know,

[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.080]
for years they've been screaming, you know,

[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]
there's no such thing as that.

[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.780]
There's a lot of screamers in there, no question.

[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:53.200]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.000]
You might need sauce, thank God.

[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.600]
That artificial heat, man, it'll kill you.

[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.800]
You know, all that shmots from the building

[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.520]
gets in your throat.

[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.100]
Yeah, but you know, is your best on CD so available?

[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:00.880]
No.

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:01.360]
No.

[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.020]
Will it be reoffered when you put up a new one?

[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.320]
Oh, we might do one someday.

[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.140]
If we didn't have somebody lazy, people around the building.

[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:07.740]
Okay.

[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.220]
I'll be keeping in here.

[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.160]
No, the problem with the CD is that everybody

[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:11.760]
rips them off.

[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.200]
We make one and then all of a sudden, you know,

[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.780]
within the first day that it's released,

[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.700]
everybody's stealing them and burning them up.

[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.580]
I don't even know that.

[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.060]
I mean, I'm not honest.

[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:20.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.920]
Well, you might find one with a lot of other people

[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.440]
and everybody else's bootleg in them.

[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.900]
You know, I can't raise any money there.

[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:26.440]
Oh, okay.

[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]
I never think to do that.

[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.000]
We might just have to auction off most hair pieces

[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.720]
in a different one everywhere.

[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.560]
I know, okay, Charlie.

[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:33.120]
Thanks.

[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.240]
Now, here, see, this is what I thought

[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.780]
might be going on because we've got some Schmitt

[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.320]
disturbbers out there trying to stir the pot

[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.300]
and rekindling the old battles with us in mold.

[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.000]
But it was just, okay, I have no problem with that

[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.240]
because anything I say about him would be an understatement.

[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.380]
It says all Moe is doing was comparing

[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.220]
the older generation of broadcasts to the cookie cutter

[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:50.880]
craft we have today.

[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.920]
Well, in my case, he's right.

[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.240]
Cookie cutter craft is not what I was talking about

[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.140]
just the other day, Josh.

[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.480]
And I say that cookie cutter.

[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.120]
Yeah.

[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.360]
Don't let the Schmitt disturbers tell you different.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.040]
That's what Rick said.

[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.680]
Well, I'm sure that Moe will straighten that out.

[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.500]
Not really clear, but don't be starting about your craft,

[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.140]
okay, between us and our good buddy Moe.

[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.420]
Now that we finally minted our fences,

[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.780]
although you see how much it tastes to give me.

[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:10.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.000]
Believe me, I could sit here ripping now from this moment

[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.640]
for the next four years in my contract

[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.380]
and still not even come close to making up

[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.540]
for what he's done to all of us.

[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.020]
To each and every one, let me not charge cordless.

[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.100]
He didn't try to get you fired yet.

[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.740]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, surely.

[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.780]
But just about everybody else, man.

[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:26.960]
You're gonna get fired to this

[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.980]
and I'm gonna go to Greg Reed.

[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.400]
I'm up a mom, I'm gonna get my attorney.

[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.260]
Yeah, every single person, man.

[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.160]
You're just an old crabby, although,

[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.540]
keep telling me he's not as old and crabby as he used to be.

[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.440]
He's getting younger.

[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.440]
He flipped the lid, he's looking better now.

[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.140]
He's walking around with that flat top head.

[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.060]
Well, he can have a flat top haircut,

[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.340]
like Brian Bosworth, the buzzcut.

[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.260]
So that's the thing they have like a flat top head.

[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.040]
And acting like almost human toward you.

[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.320]
Right, lately, lately.

[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.520]
Of course, you're not gonna be seeing much

[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.580]
because he's doing four to seven,

[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.900]
which is exactly where our company

[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.940]
does not want him to be.

[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.400]
And I think that's poetic justice.

[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.420]
I'm delighted to see him there from four to seven,

[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.580]
I'm glad to see that.

[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.220]
Even though I don't want Mad Dog to have to go through

[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.840]
all the angsties already gone through it.

[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:04.800]
See, this is it.

[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.640]
You do a good job for this company, they punish you.

[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.180]
They don't reward you, they punish you.

[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.460]
They make you go through it, huh?

[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.980]
Well, that's correct.

[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.320]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.800]
They make you go through hoops.

[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:14.540]
Who the who?

[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.160]
They break you over to coals.

[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.560]
Don't ask me why because they're a bunch of satis.

[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.860]
I have no idea what the problem is.

[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.200]
They just don't know how to reward people.

[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.520]
I'm not just talking about money.

[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.340]
That's part of the contract.

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.140]
Also, I remember that Mad Dog was screaming

[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.280]
about all kinds of expense money he hadn't gotten

[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.420]
from the dolphin games and everything.

[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.740]
They treat you like crap.

[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.220]
And then they, oh, well, can't need to be a little nicer

[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:32.680]
to Greg.

[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.720]
Yeah, well, when you start being nice to us

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.940]
and stop lying to us, then maybe we'll be nice to you.

[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.420]
How's that?

[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.100]
It's called Dittfortat.

[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.900]
I can't say another word, no more.

[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:41.820]
Dittfortat.

[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.160]
You idiots.

[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.140]
Anyway, so Mad Dog is on it too.

[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.460]
And that's a very uncomfortable situation.

[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.280]
Can you feel the discomfort in the air?

[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.160]
I feel something.

[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.180]
Yeah, so maybe that's what I'm gagging

[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.120]
and choking on right now.

[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.480]
I said that artificial heat.

[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.540]
Don't let me turn that on again.

[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:56.380]
Don't do it.

[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.880]
If it gets too cold, I'm just gonna have to

[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.820]
like take those days off.

[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.120]
Just turn on the oven.

[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:29.600]
Let's look at the po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-

[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.440]
But, Neil, I apologize. It's way to deal. You are the truth.

[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:22.820]
We're so sorry. We're famous, Rodman. We don't stop and hold the titties. If you say we, we're so sorry. We're so sorry. We're famous, Rodman. But, the

[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.800]
time needs time with time needs to secure your thing.

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:40.320]
He's filled, touching, notified me. He said you're getting busy, but you're dressing completely. He asked if you were

[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.240]
fine, wearing something on his feet. So, your way to go. Wait, it's hot. Every time he jumps, you can see his

[01:00:46.240 --> 01:01:04.900]

42

[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.920]
Our team 38

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.080]
Sky's about 32 it's a three-way race every that small potatoes who or what is the most disappointing flash in a pan

[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.500]
That somebody who obviously is either an idiot or it doesn't understand the question since Bobby Kennedy

[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.120]
First of all Bobby Kennedy was the attorney general under

[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.500]
JFK and he was like a prominent political figure until he got assassinated in 68

[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.980]
So I hardly think that you call somebody to get assessment of a flash in the pan. We never less. Don't put him on there

[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.940]
You probably could will put him on it. Why not?

[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.620]
You and band that I had to be blue room

[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.600]
Listen, we're just all over the place. I mean, this is the one show where we admit it to you

[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.780]
We we don't care about getting it right. We don't care about the sponsor

[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:47.640]
We don't care about the audience. We just there to get the money. Okay, grab the money. Give us the F and money

[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.540]
And that's it get it over with already

[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.200]
Like I said when you go to certain I don't want to mention like any you know

[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.100]
But there's certain certain gambling establishments

[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:59.640]
They just ought to have a guy with a gun there when you walk into the entrance and say you know put your hands up

[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.480]
Any ear to stick up you have a soldier money and I'll go home and have a nice day

[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.280]
That's it. You know just handed over in a brown paper sack

[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.480]
Maybe could borrow one from Barry Jackass. He's got a brown sack. How many QA and hello?

[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.140]
Yeah, no. Yes, sir. Yeah, when you talk about the Catholic free things and I don't disagree with you

[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.900]
It drives me nuts and gets my blood boiling

[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.920]
Yeah, I expect the most despicable thing any a fart. Let me ask you this question though

[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.880]
How is it that people keep subsidizing such a corrupt organization? Why is that I?

[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.940]
I can't tell you but I can't tell you that I personally have stopped subsidizing it because I remember and I

[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:42.300]
Abuse but there were my my look who's going to records and I look back and read articles about it

[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:49.060]
My guidance counselor and the Catholic high school that I went to has been arrested and be fraught and he's in jail right now

[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:53.360]
Because he abused people when I was there and probably some of my friends were I mean

[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.600]
I know kids that have committed suicide from my eyes

[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.780]
Right, and it just and it makes my blood boil and it's like

[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.520]
We also had a thing and I know you talked about it yourself one time when we had swimming class

[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.000]
I don't know why yet from nude

[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.720]
Nothing you ever heard. Yeah, but you didn't question it

[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.540]
But they were a part of it. Yeah, the kids naked right?

[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.500]
You didn't question it and then when you went on your parents with that chance and well

[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.320]
I guess that's what has to be done right, but it is

[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.900]
It's I would like to just like run them over my car and

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.840]
It's just right it's

[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.100]
Get me frustrated. I'd like to line them up on

[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.880]

That they shouldn't they shouldn't have me I mean the settlement the one thing and one he can do something

[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.680]
Yeah, but it really can't bring back your respect and the trauma that you've gone through

[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.900]
I mean, and these people they should be put in jail to left and rot and die right amen

[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.800]
Okay, they should be put in jail like father gagan with the worst hardened criminal so this big oh

Patriots jets week seven if you want to really be good stopping the run you need to you need runstoppers inside

[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.760]
Patriots dealer's week eight looks like the football might have touched the top of the ground

Alright the one thing I really respect and Chris was a good guy. He was kind of a silly kid at the K. T

[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.500]
But he interviewed OJ several years ago and really ripped him an ass

[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.980]
He's one of the few sports nerd people that put him on the spot and really just do you remember that Josh?

[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.920]
I don't think so. No, he really you're ripped him good so nice go on Chris even though your face is blown up like a balloon

[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:32.780]
Bob oh, it's not that's exactly what I was thinking. He's a flash in a pan and a pain in the ass. Somebody Q. I am hello

[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:34.960]
Wastropan

[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.760]
Okay, good one

[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:44.460]
You have two excellent ones on it. Well, why did you do that? Why couldn't you just read them when you have this fetish about wasting my

[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:50.300]
Fax paper? Yeah, kind of I'd rather waste wax paper than fax paper because you don't have to chop any trees down to make wax paper

[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.780]
People really use wax paper anywhere else do that once before yeah, they do

[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.960]
All especially in like butcher shops and everything for wrapping meat and everything

[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:02.540]
Really in what now? I was kind of like you's aluminum for overwrapped by me. He was everything. They use lots of things

[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.040]
Wastpapers like kind of to lose waxy. Yeah little wax is a bit self-meat

[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.140]
It doesn't keep things fresh if you use it just by itself. So what's the point then you wrap a package into take it home

[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.960]
You send me a facts voice your mind must be coming by way of like through the buffalo mudslides

[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.640]
WQ a.m. Hello

[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.800]

[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.320]
No, I'm just a joke. Don't start with those hockey things now

[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.580]
Blazers once for three so they have one goal on the board here in the shootout

[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.440]
Well, this guy's really excited. What is that purpose here at the Boston Garden means anything or not

[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:56.200]
But the oilers have won only two games here in the last nine years. That's out of a total of 15 games

[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:01.320]
The oilers of course say it means the 88 Stanley Cup that this could be with the French Qsick on air boy

[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:08.260]
Talk about grade. Wow. He was sensational five six and see Boston has got the guys the one thing about Boston sports casters

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.240]
Why are you back on that again because I feel like it? They've all either been great or horrendous

[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:19.300]
There were great guys like Johnny most and Kim Coleman and the French Qsick and then really terminal boring guys like Ned Martin with a red sucks

[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:26.460]
You hear red and my Ned Martin? No, oh, well you I'm certain that you heard the bald head of guy what that guy that does the red sucks games now

[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:32.980]

[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.780]
I think it's basically the cool ones are happy to be back home

[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:57.380]
This past was cut and Grepsky made the past one of the problems and the sport news was on is the back check

[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.400]
We missed a great caller by somebody. I have no idea. Why you doing all the sports casters?

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.080]
So because I feel like it because Josh made some ass and I come ideas today about how Joe Buck was God and about how

[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.300]
That Dave and boring guys the best baseball broadcaster ever in a history of the marlins and the history

Of national league and I had to take exception of that. That's what I said

[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.280]
Huh, usually said Dave and boring is the absolute best and he's got the best hair piece even better than mose

[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.040]
I want you to stop and think about this

[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:21.060]

[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:59.380]
It's something I handled by handling this whole situation so in Nepheli so embarrassingly so humiliatingly and degradingly

[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.500]
The Florida Panthers right?

[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:47.780]
Gelly

[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:54.440]
Hey, Gelly hasn't made one mistake on his broadcast work with the Panthers this season right? Right?

[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.500]
He and the team have that in common perfect record no defeats no mistakes. He's are really doing a Gelly

[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.020]
The Gelly master old squeaky WQA am hello

[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.460]
Yeah, hello. Yeah, you'll please speaking. Oh, hey, you know about

[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.080]
Rick and sed

[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.760]
What would you say?

[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.340]
Between flash and the pan and people who had careers for years hit just ended at some point. Yeah

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.300]
Everybody

[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.360]
Long time. Okay, we'll get all the passive now because you think says and they said he's on the right

[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.300]
I mean he put up with the brick all those years. So obviously he's got thick skin. He can handle it

[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:34.440]
I don't think they deserve a bounty. They weren't for long time veterans. They didn't do all that well at INZ to say the very

[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:42.640]
Very best, but hey, all that stock market talk Rick. That's what put you guys on top at the soup kitchen line WQA and hello

[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:47.960]
Between

[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.520]
I'm right here you're on that pass man

[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.660]
I heard you talking about

[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.700]
The mad dog and you know

[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.760]
If they let you go and let him off the top broadcast

[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.000]
Superdating I've ever heard right all the way around even if he stays on QA which I doubt

[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.040]
But even if he stayed with us if the dolphins in the other place are that petty that they would let him off they don't realize that

[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.500]
He's the selling point on no matter who's doing a play-by-play mad dog is the drawing point on those dolphin broadcasts

[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:19.140]
Yeah, there was there was another couple or I don't know who showed he called in on my heard him talking and they were saying you know Q&A was smart

[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:23.320]
What they would have you and was smart if you and was smart oh

[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.940]
God what a sense of humor what time is issue on what they should have done is is

[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:34.800]
You know the TV delay and the radio delay they should simultaneously make it the same so you could listen to the mad dog

[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.500]
Why are watching the game? Yeah, I mean I was I never forget the first time

[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:44.320]
The dolphins were playing the Patriots we wanted to and it would want to listen to the mad dog

[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.520]
We're watching the game and the delay the difference in the delay was still bad. Yeah

[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.900]
Yeah, it used to be you know simultaneous there was no delay on our sporting events

[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:55.020]
But now because they're in such a panic and a cold sweat over the FCC grant

[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.220]
We got about a 75-minute delay so you're watching the game on television and then like an hour later

[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.480]
You know they call actually actually the call is ahead of the TV

[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.380]
Actually the call is way ahead of the TV where we're watching Brady under center

[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:12.000]
And I'm sorry on the dolphins. It was under center before the play was even shown on TV

[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.680]
We heard the was an incomplete pass. So it was like

[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.820]
It was ridiculous. I mean this season

[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:25.080]
Yeah, this season the first time the dolphins played the Patriots. Oh, well that was before I guess they put in the 48-minute delay

[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.420]
Yeah, but yeah, then it did the radio

[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:31.580]
What they had is a TV actually so I mean can't see can't QAM

[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.800]
Final cast of the TV to make it the same. Oh, we sure could we sure could it. Where does the world is away?

[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.080]
But not the you said if QAM were smart. Okay, that's all we need to say all right. Thank you

[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:45.760]
Good luck to us pal. If QAM were smart if we were really on top of things if we really knew what we were doing

[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.440]
Right?

[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:49.220]
If QAM were smart, that's the line of the century

[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:09.500]
Yeah, my sentiments exactly when you agree eight track tapes. Oh eight track tapes is an excellent choice

[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.680]
That's perfect. That's exactly what we're thinking of for this pool today. Perfecto

[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:13.860]
um

[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.660]
How about I don't know how we would say beta format on V8 on video tape date beta tapes beta tapes. They know what that means

[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:28.920]
Yeah, they know what it means beta tapes. I mean even VHS is very soon will be in the carrier although VHS has been here for a long time

[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.820]
That's been a survive. It's gonna go away now that they got the uh no

[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.980]
I understand though, but you caught what you wouldn't call it a flash in a pan because it's been around for a long time

[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:42.720]
But beta tapes. I mean did anybody ever even own a beta V uh video recording? No not me. No me no way

[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:48.240]
64 for Howard Dean we got a pretty good poll today if I say so myself the artist is a little slow catch it on

[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.800]
I think or maybe they were busy checking out DFO's new schedule

[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:56.240]
Go forget DFO on the ESPN starts Monday 7 to 10 PM next Monday. Let's give a big send off. What do you say? Huh?

[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.020]
All right. Hey listen. We like to plug the competition

[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:03.740]
We got some pretty stiff competition. That's why we like to plug them because we don't know who's been listening to them anyway

[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.740]
Who or what is the most disappointing

[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:12.060]
Flash in a pan is our poll question today. Howard Dean 64 John. Hey, I got another flash in a pan for you

[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.120]
Okay, speaking of radio. How about Greg oh

You could have played blueberry hill once and he was gone. He's gonna set the world on fire down here

[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.360]

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.460]
How about Howard Stern on QAM?

[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:44.660]
Okay, you don't think so and nothing that qualifies well with the criteria. We're using the state sure

[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:50.260]
Yeah, I think it qualifies he was on for like four months and bye bye bye. Howie. We just uh oh

[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:55.860]

[01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:02.680]
Would just do not believe this anybody from like a real radio market would hear this story say oh you got to be schmitting me man

[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.500]

[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:31.700]
Easy or it was just Ivarsia who is restructured and run and lead law the parent company for Greyhound buses

[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.540]
You know something I want to say it again, and I'm probably the only person in America who's thinking about this

[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:41.000]
That Greyhound bus business. You know where I'm going with this we never heard one more word about that. Oh, but those

[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:46.200]
Incidences yeah, because there was nothing to them obviously it was just a bunch of a couple of wackos in the media

[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:51.080]
How do you know that I don't but it was right was right after 9-11 and all of a sudden

[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:57.220]
On buses were getting a hijacked and it was like slicing the driver's throats and driving a buses all a tip them over on a road and my

[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:03.160]
Passengers have you come across country on a great-hound bus or any other? No, you know, I've been on a great-hound bus

[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.420]
Waco's are the standard pair get out of here. Come on

[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:12.800]
So another cover up all right the management shake up heightened fears about the defuble these facing crispy cream

[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.900]
It's being investigated by the SEC over alleged misrepresentations in the it's an accounting methods

[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:22.720]
And it's also the subject of sheerholder lawsuits. It shares once the darling of Wall Street lost three quarters of their value last year

[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.260]
See there's another example of why you take your money this crap with social security

[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:31.480]
You want to gamble away your retirement money? What looked like a sure thing then crispy cream right right?

[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.960]
I mean this thing was taken off faster than halava in

Miami Beach back in the day and now they wouldn't give you a nigger and not only all these scandals stuff

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.800]
But of course the fact thing in the low carb and all that and they're they used to be lined up there another running from there

[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:53.880]
Anybody will walk spider like start running in the other direction the management shake up heightened fears about the difficulty is facing crispy cream

[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.000]
crispy cream said mr. Livingwood who rose from being a personal

[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:03.580]
Personnel trainee in 1977 to be crispy cream CEO since 98 would retire immediately if not sooner

[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:07.500]
You'd been under fire from Wall Street, which believes he expanded the company too quickly without the business

[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:12.920]
Know how necessary to guide the rapid growth mr. Livingwood has also been accused along with other company execs in shareholder

[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:20.820]
lawsuits and filing false financial statements and trying to mass demand for the US second largest donut chain by shipping excess product the stores like that great

[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.200]
There's nothing like a good-stale crispy cream donut

[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:30.200]
I put it in the microwave it'll be fun now you're right. I'm not knocking a product don't don't give yourself

[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.160]
There's no way in the world I'd be a real liar if I throw down an electric product

[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.340]
Oh, man, you can't even only two

[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.240]
Three is my a that I've told you that before and people would laugh that's true

[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:45.380]
What's funny about that they're very light you can eat four easy now three three is my that's my average number now

[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.340]
Score ice cream I could either half a gallon you don't believe that doing of course. I believe it

[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:56.540]
Microwave put away microwave 68 seconds get it to a nice not not too mushy because if it gets mushy then it's lost

[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:59.040]
Then you can't re-freeze it then it gets like ice you know gets bad

[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.320]
But just get a little soft, you know

[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:08.040]
I remember it was so I would eat three people and we'd eat all four hours all throughout the show right you

[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.400]
Right back in those factories, but nothing like it's edible

[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.000]
I've told you by 830 we'd already eaten two meals every day now

[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.180]
The hopper says he's going home get on a treadmill

[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:22.120]
I haven't asked him yet about the weight thing because it's far be it for me to start picking on people like hank for like being fat

[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:33.320]
And when he tells me when I hasn't figured out what to do the rest of the day. I can just think of

[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.120]
We fought it over and I never win

[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.480]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again

[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:23.080]
Oh, so I sit on a pension delivery

[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:51.680]
Just waiting for the lonely person to take me away

[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:51.900]
Oh

[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:58.020]
I'd dig out somebody oldie moldy's yeah, we don't play those often enough not often enough right and probably there are people out there

[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.640]
New listeners and they even hurt some of those oldie moldy's including the ones we can still play from my last several years

[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.120]
Which I think they're probably about 30 man left of being still play that don't say

[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.900]
Or have some gate like that in it join George McGill and Vokobry and five to seven for happy hour treasure island

[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:15.340]
This afternoon after Palmetto just know for the 120 seconds to next it stop

[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.880]
I don't want prices enjoy dance specials all night long

[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.160]
That's all rhymes with ball as L. Michaels would say give me the ball

[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.040]
And look for the qm band tonight at bruise room which I should have known that that's my bad

[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:30.660]
But that's why I kept saying broo room. What about is that you know who wrote this illiterate garbage stop

[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:34.000]
I eight to ten at bruise room that I you'll see the qm van they're located at 56

[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:41.200]
5466 West Aferu in Margate stop by for LeBat blue hockey a dollar and have finds a blue until lockout is over

[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.840]
Well another which had next couple of years LeBat as in LeBat hockey and Canada

[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.400]
Which used to be more snockey on Canada which right now ain't nothing except they show movies on Saturday and that's something

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.620]
That's something pretty good anyway that movie. I saw wonder if anybody else has ever seen that movie the last of the high kings

[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:01.220]
Would you ever lead? I've actually only person in this crowd. It's ever seen that not a good movie until like the last third when they had that

[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:05.240]
Screw in scene and he everybody stark naked and then it's kind of interesting, you know all right

[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.720]
No seriously, and then everybody gets plastered and

[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:14.320]
Five things speaking of plastered Johnny Russo can't refuse. I imagine he's probably been drinking leaves a good

[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.200]
Take the knowledge since the godfather co star and Palm Beach visitor lists his phase

[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:26.540]
This is what what papers this from is it oh the Palm Beach post. I mean, will you say he was the co star of the movie?

[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.740]
What I know he is one of the leastest of the characters least is right post of the most

[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:40.440]
He was not much. He played Carlo. I don't get how many day go get any what grease ball go and bars come out of the woodware

[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.220]
Not Carlo but Carlo he was a conny's husband

[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:47.680]
Anyway, it says Gianni Russo is probably the best known as the godfather's Carlo Rizzo

[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:54.280]
Don Quoleon is lazy son-in-law who beats up Connie and dies courtesy of a giraffes after crossing the family and we turn around oh

[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:54.560]
Hi

[01:40:55.140 --> 01:41:00.040]
Clemenza, but now what was his first name Clemenza? Oh, jeez. What do you do this today? Because I think when he turned around

[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.380]
He summoned back to see he called him by his first name. I don't remember

[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:06.780]
I know that sounds like really nitpicky and very minute, but as Godfather or trivia people

[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:10.400]
We got to know like exact dialogue. What was Clemenza's first name?

[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:16.300]
I mean Tessio was Sal Tessio right? Salvatore do we ever even know Clemenza's room?

[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.260]
What is it? I'm across the room looking for the book. Okay, just relax. Okay. Do we got plenty of time here?

[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.740]
Anyway, Carlo Rizzo Don Quoleon's so sleazy son-in-law beats up Connie and dies courtesy of

[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.920]
Clemenza guaranteed him never crossed the Croyon as it says, but singer actor Russo has been busy in last several decades

[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.280]
in Perigun several movies like After the Sunset

[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.920]
TV shows including a few upcoming episodes of A&E's Growing Up Gaudi

[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:44.360]
Oh, no, he's gonna be a Guido now. I'm growing up Gaudi and on CD and on the stage

[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.080]
There are all these new things in my life. He says I'm in my 60s and I've had such a great life

[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:53.400]
I'm great physically. I'm well fed. I love life and singing. I love that more than acting reports

[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.500]
So who appears today at the Poe Lounge at Fort Lauderdale's

[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:01.480]
Romada Plaza Beach Resort Hotel and a collection of Kruiner classics called an evening you can't refuse

[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.900]
I like that and evening you can't refuse and if you do

[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.840]
But I'm bang

He lists five things he can't refuse one palm beach in the winter and getting out of the cold

[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:14.780]
Two obviously a great glass of wine three gorgeous women. That's why I'm always in trouble

[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:17.980]
So I have 11 kids for a beautiful yacht and five a golf game

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:22.880]
I've just started, but I've been told I'm an actual golfer. I was doing so good. He got to that last one there

[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:30.920]
golf don't ever take size with anyone against the family again ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.540]
What's the job?

[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.200]
I think I'm just gonna play the golf father's in the rest of the show. It's so comforting

[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:43.180]

[01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:02.820]
It's come up. I got a piece of a book now when he turned I don't think he did say Pete. He wouldn't call him Pete

[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:06.200]
No, I'm a right. I could say oh hi, so

[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.560]
I wonder if they do that anymore the thing with the Garrett with the rope you know they put the rope around the neck

[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.960]
I don't know. I'll go ask somebody. Hey go ask Solaco about that. It's wrong

[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.460]
As you're also right virtual. What was the captains first name captain McCluskey?

[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.120]
Um

[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:28.040]
Geez, I haven't got any idea. I know what sterling Hayden was the actor, but you're asking me there. I have no idea Mark

[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:35.420]
Mark, Mark Kluski, Mark. We never we never would have known that. No, anybody else. I'm looking. No, I think you got him on how about my

[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:41.380]
But Cunio Cunio you will never know Cunio. I would never know the heads of the five families. There was Bruno Tertalia

[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.940]
There was what was the other Tertalia

[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:50.220]
Bruno was the bald headed one with a little whiskey nasty mustache. Anyway, it's Othelio before I have to turn the page and what about

[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:56.180]
Gini he was a temp Luigi Barzini. I mean I'm just making a word. I gotta put it down. So good Luigi Barzini

[01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:02.420]
Might be it. Come on. Get out of here. Now. What was that actor's name? The fight about Zini. Don't tell me great actor

[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:10.120]
Oh, have you got it there? It's it's loading here we go. Give me give me the first name. I don't have it yet. Boys is a long list

[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.820]
Bruno Tertalia right? Where's Barzini? Yeah, he's up on the steps. So

[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.860]
I want to him no more

[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.580]
Richard Connie by the way, thanks. Why didn't you say that? I said this is giving the first name you

[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:35.600]
I just say Josh just give me the first name. Yeah, but I said it so we'd know it sure who said it Hank? Oh Hank said it

[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.700]
What's Hank still doing there? He's here. It's still doing there. It's gonna work. Yeah

[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:44.360]
It's no one and he's still there. He ought to be at the track right now. He could me. He's gonna miss the first race

[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:47.860]
By the way, Hank be sure and say hi to our good friend Phil Saltsman when you see him again

[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:52.880]
I mentioned the Phil a couple of times on the other fact he was retiring after a long and illustrious career. Good guy

[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:59.520]
He is retired and I guess he's not a ghostry me. Well, you blame him. No. Oh, and now I'm so glad you're there

[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.620]
I want to ask you one thing. Who's who's dick still forgot naked pictures of oh boy the worst

[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:07.040]
You can you believe he's doing he doesn't know what gets me about him

[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:13.720]
He tells you what the horse is thinking during the race. Does he really it takes a part of the horses anatomy to know that?

[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:19.360]
Yeah, which part is that I can't say Joyce was here. Oh, you can't say ask with Joyce around

[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.080]
I don't want to ask you about it. No, but he just I'm gonna roll with the deal is because he's so mediocre

[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.740]
He's a time-durken wannabe, you know

[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:27.680]
He tries to do the Durkins style, you know, and he doesn't do it well

[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.960]
But how's he doing the races out of California? You know, he does

[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:35.320]
Hollywood park right? So he he's not only he's working for

[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:39.540]
Astonic track and a Churchill Downs track. Yeah, that's amazing to me

[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:43.120]
And then he also works northern California. He's got to have some naked pictures somewhere

[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.620]
And I'm telling you who I've really grown to like which I didn't used to like him because I have an

[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.720]
I'm offended by that whole British accent thing is Trevor deadman. He's pretty good. He's good

[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.920]
Reaching down and finding more that's his favorite expression

[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.380]
Yeah, no, he is very good and I never heard to make a mistake ever

[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.120]
I've never I've never because I have the racing channel

[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.240]
You know, by the way, Philadelphia Park post-time for uh the first race coming up very soon. Oh, I gotta get out of here

[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:06.880]
Don't lose too much

[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.180]
Oh, no, wait a minute. Don't go yet. Yeah, what was I gonna ask about Chris Myers?

[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.760]
Oh, no, I was just gonna say one thing about Chris because we mentioned him this morning his face is blowing up

[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.140]
The greatest respect I ever had for Chris Myers is several years ago

[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.140]
He didn't interview on ESPN of OJ and he sliced him up almost as bad as OJ sliced up Nicole and Ron

[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:29.680]
I mean, he really ripped him an ass. I thought you go boy. It was great. Do you ever see that? No, I don't remember it

[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.080]
It was great. You'd have been very proud. I would have remembered it had I seen it. I I seen it. Yeah. Okay. Don't lose too much

[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:38.400]
By way did you see about OJ's daughter? What about her?

[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.920]
And Joan Fleischman had a note in the herald today about how she got in a fight at a high school basketball game

[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:52.200]
She was in the stands and she smacked a couple of girls who were there and they probably ran and she was firing f-bombs at the police

[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:55.860]
Right. All right. Yeah, excellent run. Yeah

[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:01.060]
You know what I was talking about this morning because Joan Fleischman is such a consummate reporter

[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:06.960]
It's like she took this course that says you gotta get every fact and the last line and the item says

[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.340]
Ramsen won the game 4037

[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:15.240]
Beauty. Yeah, get all the details. I think Joan Fleischman's been around longer than you Cola cats in time

[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.800]
She's all right. Have a great day Hank. You're doing it up

[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.820]
Probably just past noon at five six boys. Here's nice to have in the hopper around

[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.580]
I haven't seen him in about two years. I don't think you're gonna have and now we're like on the same page

[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:26.720]
And of course we got what's his name?

[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.120]
Don't don't don't don't don't don't he's all right, most people are just trying to stir up the crap

[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.960]
Okay, they're misquoting him. They're trying to stir up a contrived feud

[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.840]
Which is okay. Bring it on like Bush would say bring it on right?

[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.480]
There's a word we can do now. What are you eating now?

[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.840]
Hank was just in there sure. Hope he's not eating well

[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.120]
Uh-oh, it's Tony's

[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:47.620]
Thank you. Tony. Yeah, and it was Emilio. I'm inside. Emilio. Why?

[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:52.060]
In me the sewing never heard that during the movie. No, we didn't know Emilio by Zini

[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:53.280]
I think I'll watch her by Zini

[01:47:53.280 --> 01:48:01.020]
No, always so thanks to Tony's over there. I'm 441 and whatever. No, the nine and 441 there are 441 and 193

[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.560]
24 till 1 a QM now here's that story I couldn't find before but I found it

[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:20.380]
Just just a couple of paragraphs. It's too depressing over the fat-ass governor Jeb Bush yesterday on bail day proposed

[02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:24.880]
61.6 billion dollar state spending plan that would cut taxes paid by Florida's wealthiest

[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:30.060]
Let me say it again that would cut taxes paid by Florida's wealthiest while hitting students with hired tuition

[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:35.940]
Cutting medical services to the states neediest and providing little new money for public schools nice going fat ass

[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:41.040]
All right, I'm surprised. Yeah runs in a family man. They're all hard. They're compassionate conservatives

[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.320]
Void by a robust economy and a boost in post-sir McCain tax cost from rebuilding efforts

[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:49.760]
The governor's proposal is four billion dollars higher than the state budget approved by the legislature last spring

[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:56.680]
And continues to add the Bush's tax cutting legacy with the call for $285 million in tax relief mostly for the wealthy as wealthy buddies

[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.780]
Shlunk butt buddies for the fat ass governor

[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:05.240]
Same craft is his brother man. At least the families consistent just like his wife, you know the governor is a smuggling wife

[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:07.580]

All like jubbles in together, you know like a big hugged podge. That would be QAM. Hello

[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:55.600]
QAM guy. Yes, sir. I'd like to register a complaint go right ahead. I've been eating donuts for about 35 years

[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:01.180]
And a real donut has like a kinky like substance to it right but a bit of sugar cinnamon on it

[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:06.620]
Those crispy creams those are perversions and they're nasty and I don't know why everyone likes them

[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:10.620]
I think they're fabulous. Ah, that's just the two sugary two gross

[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:12.200]
I'm gonna go okay

[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:17.520]
Don't I got a good solution for your problem. What's that don't eat them save them for the rest of us

[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:23.320]
So K who got some taste because anybody who eats like bunk in donuts all I can say like the Chinese have a word for that fat

[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:29.440]
Fee H fat cake donuts are dry and great. Yeah, Kate donuts is not real donuts. Kate donuts are like cake

[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:34.900]
They're they're cake that shape like donuts, but real donuts are donut shaped like donuts like crispy cream

[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:39.780]
And by the way, crispy cream's been around forever that crispy cream on a hundred and sixty sixty three or five

[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:46.120]
That's been there since for about 30 years at least that's got to be the first one in South Florida, doesn't it? Oh, I don't know

[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:47.500]
You know what I'm talking about I do

[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:52.440]
Been there forever and there's also a diner right next door that that's been there for about eight million years

[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.780]
But that crispy cream to law me for anybody even heard a crispy cream that one was there and I was stopping Erwin on in

[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:00.500]
You still have peaches records to write up the street there

Human flesh because McDonald's is great when you're this by the Lord of darkness

[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:59.300]
The challenge is a registered trademark of McDonald's corporation

[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:05.960]
And I got by the way still dead 12 45 at 5 16 WBC start thinking about those changing neighborhoods

[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.140]
For example when I was home and we went to Ruth Chris and we drove east out there on sunrise

[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:14.920]
And where our pizzas used to be there and of course now it's slurry of flints that hustler joint right

[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.820]
That you know, it's like an adult video and toys store

[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:23.440]
You don't see what I'm talking about. I know exactly where you're at right used to be a pizza

[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:29.680]
Something like 14 thousand or something whatever the hell it is and everything in that area is all changed around

[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.640]
And the same with that north Miami Beach thing they had the unicorn restaurant

[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:38.280]
That was a sponsor mine used to be right off in fact crispy cream or whatever street that is the corner on right down

[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.920]
Street when you made a right there as you go in east that was the unicorn remember the unicorn mm-hmm

[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.100]
And there's another Italian restaurant there which I think was one of Hank sponsors across the street from that

[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:53.100]
Which I'm sure it's still there and was a sponsor mine for about five minutes. I can't be those oh vetoes was great

[02:12:53.100 --> 02:13:00.620]
Remember vetoes I do remember they brought food in many times. Oh, did they really if I do recall vetoes was sensational

[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:03.840]
Somebody where you can't they can't go back man. Just can't go back

[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.160]
That's why when you like living in the city 30 years ago like Detroit or Boston you go back and you say gee

[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:13.460]
Where's this where's macombos? Where's all the great restaurants I used to love. Sorry. No, not here. I'm uh

[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:15.720]

[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:22.020]
Dexin teaky not there we're Boston. Where's the principal getty house not there the only thing is still in Boston

[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:25.720]
I don't think Joe and Nemo's is even still there, but they still got brigams ice cream mm-hmm

[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:30.560]
Man here I have brigams ice cream. I thought you'd never been in Boston. No place you'd like a lot

[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.920]
Not in a winter time, but in the summertime. They're great

[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:36.520]
Anyway, Rocco says for your list the XFL excellent choice

[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:42.060]
The league that was gonna take on the NFL the only thing that they've come out of this was the camera that glides above the field on wires

[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:47.400]
And don't forget he hate me a player who went on to the NFL and played for Carolina last year he hate me

[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:54.140]
P.S. How about skip carries announced it'll be remembered in 20 years uh borderline skips good and but not legendary

[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:59.480]
So there's a difference right or Josh don't you say he's no no he's laying out on this

[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.200]
He's still wounded over Joe Buck. He's he's just all been out of shape over Joe Buck

[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:08.540]
Just ask Hank again tomorrow off the air have our engagement a conversation. He'll tell you about Joe Buck rhymes with suck

[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:15.560]
That's right Joe Buck is just a voice. That's all just a voice good voice. He's good. He's what he's good

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.380]
He's okay. Okay. I'm not saying he's bad

[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:22.200]
But I always appalled in an eagle game when when the clock ran

[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:23.840]
I mentioned this the other day. I mentioned again

[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:28.840]
How can you be the play by play guy in the game and not be aware of the fact that they're letting the clock run out

[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:34.120]
They complete a pass with no time outslip and there's like six seconds left in the clock and a clock runs out

[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:39.280]
And they they pass up the three sure points and it was like 10 seconds later something must have poked him in a ribs

[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:43.600]
Oh, and of course the Eagles the clock runs out. Yeah, he was oblivious

[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.880]
He's just not into the game enough. Okay. He's just too light. I know he's kind of boring

[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:49.680]
Not as boring as the guy they call that

[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.380]
Hunter turn for the touch on that promo. I sure like to hear that. That was that was pathetic

[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.700]
Anyway, here's one from Keith and Bokees is the most disappointing fraction of pan was Brian Greacy

[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:03.500]
That's not what they're saying in Tampa. Look at the great year. They hear that's right. Well

[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:06.100]
Brian Greacy that's a good one. How's it going Brian

[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:07.860]
Come on now

[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.360]
Let's see Josh Hamilton was a bigger busted says the first player taking in the track by the marlins Josh Hamilton

[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:19.260]
I remember who the hell that was who was that I remember Alexander Hamilton. I don't know

[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.500]
Josh Hamilton maybe that was like the inaugural year or something because I don't know

[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:26.080]
Get out of here Josh Beckett was second. I had to be the same year

[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:29.600]
The inaugural year who knew your Felix my ass

[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:35.180]
And we're gonna put the XFL on there. What about the wHA the world hockey association wHA got it good

[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:41.640]
So many flashes in the pan. They're just there's few things that stick around greatness man forever

[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:44.460]
Deal. God. That's right because you can't get rid of me

[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:48.080]
Virgin to offer gambling on those superjumbo's I talked yesterday about that new

[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:55.120]
The here must be a 380 but you see that on the news. Oh all over the place. It's beautiful. That thing is huge man. Woo

[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:56.900]
I can't wait

[02:15:57.540 --> 02:16:02.160]
To a hop on one of those glen and mirror mark glen and mirror mar are in our a guy

[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:08.980]
We have that effect from glen and mirror mar for about 400 years. Have we ever go in mirror mark right always cranky a little right wingy a little

[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.100]
A gun a total love it but nevertheless he's out there

[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.520]
He says right that's right next to crispy cream is the ham and eggery

[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:19.760]
That's what us two have both been there side by each for like a hundred years

[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:26.180]
Also, I worked in Kony Island to high school and may have served you a Zion kosher frank or a knisch

[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:31.460]
I don't eat knisch's but very likely a Zion kosher frank a fellow named godfrey worked there for 30 years

[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:34.880]
Doctor to man who is my neighbor, but I'm sure that place is gone. I boy. It was

[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.280]
I'm not sure. I'm sure it's filthy. What it was maybe it's still there and they cleaned it up

[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:46.340]
I can't believe you were in there. Let's see Charles and your field be said you were right Jacob Marley

[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:51.480]
You ran Jacob Marley. That's what I was talking about you talked me out of it Bob Marley. We know who Bob Marley is who's Jacob Marley

[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:52.020]
Oh

Yeah, that's Bob Marley you'll rise to mind Jacob Marley was having easier scrooge's partner in the Christmas Carol

[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.440]
Okay, don't you remember scrooge and Marley that was the name of their business. Okay. That's right Bob Marley

[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:07.320]
Now actually Jacob Marley. I can see I want to keep saying Bob Marley. Oh, no Bob Cratchett

[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:12.140]
Cratchett Bob Cratchett. That's why you suck me in with that Bob stuff Bob Cratchett

[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:17.580]
In fact, he was tiny Tim's father remember tiny Tim. Yes. No relation to Kimmy from passions and both of them are still dead

[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:21.000]
So who's Jacob Marley? I just wanted all what everyone who's Jacob Marley?

[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.460]
Jacob Marley was scrooge's business partner. Okay scrooge and Marley was the name of the business when scrooge was like

[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.860]
I tell you find it got the light the best

[02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:34.000]
Christmas girl is the one with Alistair Sim. Okay. I've seen that one argument. I've seen them all so yeah

[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.440]
I've seen them all 50 pounds Alistair Sim he was great

[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.040]
WQAM. Hello. Hello. Even if he was a Brit. Yes sir. Neil. Yeah

[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:47.140]
Three one or those praise one of the way to pray the tubercava

[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:49.960]
Kathy will in the exe fell

[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:56.800]
Okay, two out of three in there. We got the exe fell. Okay, get on here. Uh, Kathy will this is good. Sure. Huh?

[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:03.760]
She was very she was tremendously popular for about two minutes. Hey Neil. It's true. I can have an orgasm

[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.320]
Just driving down I'm 95 but only if you're driving beside me

[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:11.920]
Oh, man

[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:18.420]
To lose France high paying passengers aboard Virgin Air Atlantic's air bus supergumbo's will be able to work out in a gym

[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:19.420]
Get a makeover

[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:23.260]
Gave a little casino and then head to the bar for some cocktails before easing into a double bed

[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:29.980]
Virgin boss Richard Branson made the announcement. He is the attend the official debut of the new A380 at air bus headquarters in to lose

[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.380]
Southern France to lose the tracks

[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:37.980]
Some of Boeing 747s and Virgin's existing three-hour coupe with double beds for first-class passengers and bars were a traveller's

[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:39.820]
Constretch their legs while sipping a beer

[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:44.740]
But Branson about to extend the concept of Virgin taste leveraged since six A380s beginning in 2008

[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:49.740]
He says we plan to have a gym area for our passengers to stretch out and work out during the flight Branson said

[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:54.140]
We're going to introduce a beauty parlor and we plan to have a casino. So Neil can plunge his guts out

[02:18:54.140 --> 02:19:02.640]
The A380 can carry 555 passengers in a three-class cabin a third more passengers than a 747 with a lower operating cost per seat as well as much more cabin space

[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:08.720]
Luck over for other amenities airlines with upscale business models are likely to equip the plane with fewer seats to leave more space for

[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:15.660]
Live as facilities and first-class benefits at the other end of the scale a budget carrier charter operator serving busy holiday roots will be able to see more than

[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:19.600]
800 passengers comfortably in a single coach class configuration

[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:25.120]
Most of the airlines that awarded A380 so far keeping mum about what features they plan to offer on board

[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:29.220]
Cutter airways said to the day it's A380s would seat this 490 passengers

[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:33.340]
But gave no details of its plant cabin layout. I understand just gonna have a big gutter all around the edge of it

[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:38.680]
Jeff Dixon CEO of Australia's quantest airway said it's super-jumbo cabin designs will be unveiled in next few weeks

[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:43.280]
I do like that see this thing with Richard Branson and Virgin Skagland a having flown it

[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:49.300]
Uh, that's that's a scam. It's it's bad news remember that back in the day was not an IOD what the

[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:55.740]
Virgin Air experience what about it? Well because they were whining and dining and touting and a one-time

[02:19:55.740 --> 02:20:02.580]
I flew in the business class which was very extravagant and like lots of room and a lot in the food was very good and then they have what they call

[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:07.220]
Economy class, but I can't even imagine it must be like a cargo

[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:10.980]
They have premium economy. No, no seriously premium economy

[02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:16.400]
Which is that is expensive as business class which is outrageously priced but is you know premium

[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:21.140]
And they give you like the meal on a tray with plastic around it

[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:24.640]
That's a given idea and and it's it's crap is what it is

[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:30.000]
Preeding the economy my ass now that was some years ago and I made it by my at that point and then to not worry that but they fly

[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.620]
You know like from Miami or Toronto to he throw it to London

[02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:37.540]
So then if you're going to Amsterdam you have to do connecting flight who now wants to fly to London

[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:41.040]
I don't want to be anywhere near them damn Nazis man see one thing when I go to Germany

[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:45.940]
I hear people speaking German doesn't bother me. I see some of those skinheads out there in their motorbikes on the

[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:52.400]
Crawfruiston Dom on the in Berlin and bottomy, you know nothing like an honest Nazi anyway, but with the brits

[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:56.660]
See those are ones you got to be worried about the Nazis in hiding and drag the world family

[02:20:56.660 --> 02:21:03.520]
All goose stepping along here. See those silly twists them brits at Buckingham Palace much in Nazis the Nazi you can not see

[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:04.320]
Yeah, that's right

[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:09.240]
So the one just check about their uniform and the brits either they were in the kilts would you tell you a lie? Yeah

[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:12.840]
Like Jeff Garcia or like I got those other outfits on it

[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:19.200]
Should say that they're gonna be scoost of an a day at a street near nearby your ass especially if you happen to be a Jewelmore like me

[02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:20.520]
WCWAM hello

[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:37.760]

[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:43.180]
Yeah, and then all of a sudden just gone. Okay, Timmy Smith got it now

[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:46.980]
What about the quarterback for a 10-per-bay wedding when it's super bowl two years ago?

[02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:52.240]
We talked about that the other way. What was it named Brad Johnson Brad Johnson anybody see him lately? No flashing a pan

[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:54.460]
Anybody seen Brad Johnson? I don't think so

[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.320]
256 and 560 QM got the

[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:01.840]

You're listening to me, you're a Neil Rogers exclusively on 560

[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:18.940]
Not just the one to two hour it's a phenomenon

[02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:24.880]
Coming up tonight on inside of behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:31.600]
They may be the only band in the history of rock and roll to be inextricably linked to a dumbass prop comic

[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:34.060]
They were smashing pumpkins

[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:41.640]
Oh

[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:46.960]
Those bastards they got the whole concept of their band from me. It makes me so mad

[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:53.000]
Y'all you got me all wet aren't you supposed to hand out sheets of plastic to the audience or something?

[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:55.240]
Sorry, I get so angry

[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:59.980]
Get-wad comedian Gallagher has been smashing fruits and vegetables on stage since

[02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:03.540]
Well since people were stupid enough to pay to see crap like that

[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:10.000]
So I'm doing a show when this guy Billy Corgan comes to see me and I'm smashing pumpkins all freaking night

[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.780]
I'm smashing pumpkins like there's no tomorrow. I'm smashing pumpkins up your body's what I'm doing

[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:22.620]
I mentioned this guy Gallagher was a total suck bag and Billy Corgan finds me afterwards and he says hey great show

[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:30.520]
Man, I really like what you're doing and to least later. There's this band called smashing pumpkins and I have to switch to watermelons

[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:37.340]
You wouldn't be getting at the end inside the mohime is able to reach Billy Corgan for comment about Gallagher's accusations

[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:41.320]
He and this to say Gallagher what a total suck bag

[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:48.000]
This smashing pumpkins at least they didn't call themselves the dork with the beret on the strike shirt band

[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:52.100]
It's a big juicy shopping wet look at show business tonight

[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:56.720]
Uninsigned to my eyes. Speaking of that, I want to have the dork baby's doing, huh? I've known for a long time

[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:02.960]
It's a minute after one at five sixty WM here's the facts again from Glenn who just so encouraged by my enthusiasm

[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:06.800]
Getting his thanks miss the old neighborhood in North Miami Beach. Maybe this is a different one

[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.480]
But I don't think so Frank goes pizza remember Frank goes used to order from Frank. Oh sure often. I'll figure those pizza

[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:18.280]
Don't remember that corkies legendary legendary. We love corkies. Maybe if I talk enough about them

[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:19.760]
I'll bring you over some potato pancakes

[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.660]
Not the blackest and lowest theater

[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:25.560]
There you go, Glenn some other stuff under which I want to repeat that I already said it

[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:31.600]
Let's see here's one that says disappointed flashing a pan david justice first it was baseball then there was howie burry

[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:35.100]
And then he was gone going going gone as my lalena would say my lalena

[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.440]
So anyway there you go david justice you got it?

[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:40.960]
We got it. And of course for justice

[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:47.180]
Did we put Ricky Martin on there? Yes, okay. Just making sure that would be bad for justice. We got to go see

[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:51.320]
Collion. Uh, how did I do that? How did I screw that up?

[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:53.140]
I'm Collion. Like I said

[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:59.220]
5670560 pound 560 under Verizon and singular wireless lines before we were you take anymore call

[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.900]
This this is enough to make me just program the

[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:06.720]
CBS affiliates off of my TV. I got the CBS affiliate from Detroit and the one from Seattle here

[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.360]
I'm I eight million channel cable okay

[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:16.680]
CBS will probably replace Dan rather on evening news with a multi-anchor perhaps multi-city format that changes the

[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:19.000]
Antiquated way of reporting the days top stories

[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.280]
CBS chief Leslie Moonvest the moon man said yesterday

[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:28.620]
Moonvest who will ultimately select rather's replacement city believes many young viewers are turned off by a single voice of god

[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:32.940]
Anchor in the internet age. Well, what does that mean voice of god?

[02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:33.920]
I don't know

[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:39.120]
He spoke publicly about his search for the first time since rather than out in November that he was stepping down from the CBS

[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:45.440]
Even news after he got pushed out by the right wingers by the anneal cons moonvest rest that he's still considering all

[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:51.400]
Possibilities it's unclear whether new format would be ready for well one rather leisurely marsh whether an interim successor would be named

[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:57.220]
Those days are over when you have that guy sitting behind the desk who everyone believes to the anth degree Moonvest told reporters

[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:02.080]
It's sort of an antiquated way of news telling and maybe there's a new way of doing it and maybe not less

[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:10.020]
He wouldn't mention any potential participants or comment on a time magazine report that NBC's Katie Kurek had been contacted to a gauge or interest

[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:15.260]
Moonvest can see that the term wall at CBS news were three executives and producer were fired last

[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:21.520]
For the role in an ill-fated story about president Bush's military service even the story course was true has encouraged him to do something more dramatic

[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:23.640]
dramatic got it

[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:31.260]
Also has the CBS even news status as a consistent and distant third behind NBC's neckly news with Brian Williams and ABC's world news tonight with Peter Jennings and ratings

[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:34.260]
Since I got that fax about Brian Williams being a regular caller on

[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:37.720]
Rush Limbaugh. I will not I wouldn't watch that the news for two seconds

[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:43.840]
See what I'm saying. Where's the credibility factor there? I mean a rush suck up moonvest do appear a little to the early show on CBS

[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:51.480]
Which has seen ratings in shop since installing a four person team that includes his wife Julie Chink Jen when others are successful with one

[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:55.040]
Format it makes sense to do something different. He said nearly 30 million people

[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:58.340]
Watch the evening news. I'm one of the three never Sun most nights

[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:04.300]
But many of them are older like me old farts like me young people tend to get their news and bits and pieces from the internet and cable

[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:06.340]
Like go the daily show right right?

[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:10.540]
We have to try to reinvent that he said one of the ways we're looking at is making it younger and more relevant

[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.840]
Something that younger people can relate to as opposed to that guy preaching from the mountaintop about what we shouldn't should not watch

[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:21.940]
Ask twice moonvest would not rule out a rule on the evening news for comedy centrals John Stewart who's the daily show

[02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:28.300]
skewers politicians and news media each night moonvest is coachy executive of Icom which owns both CBS and comedy central

[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:33.260]
If separate briefly, I'll fated pairing a rather with Connie Chink in the 1990s evening news program

[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:39.200]
Is about a single anchor from more than 20 years anchor teams like chat humbly and David Brinkley are part of the evening news lore

[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:44.680]
The only real example of multi anchor format was when ABC news head Frank Reynolds Peter Jennings max Robinson

[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:50.800]
Occasionally Bob a Walker reporting from different cities from 1978 until Jennings took over low in 1983 and I showed it off

[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.460]
He is so dry man. He's drier than a dry wall

[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:59.780]
Dry than cement after sitting there for like 20 years in the cold the idea also likely reflects to

[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:05.120]
dissatisfaction would rather this presumed air is at CBS John Roberts has got probably an absence of big names

[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.520]
Well, you see this is just like the sports cashew thing. I was trying to turn it. Didn't I mention this yesterday Josh?

[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:18.260]
Yeah, didn't I say the same thing with the news people and with the dish off each other like how many big name personalities really have come along in the last few years

[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:24.420]
Not too many right you got Rush Limbaugh, right? Yeah, no necessarily. I mean he's huge. He's a big name

[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:28.760]
Who else what other news anchor on a network's local?

[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:32.800]
Somebody give me something to grab my a sink my teeth in new

[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.720]
Besides Jared Lido

[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:40.920]
Well, he sure look good in that movie out there. You know somebody's called because nobody saw that movie the last of the right

[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:45.700]
High Kings it's not a good movie. I'm not encouraging you to go out and run and blame me. Okay

[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:50.740]
Richard said how about cherry coke cherry cof's not dead in fact it's making a comeback

[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:54.280]
Right the silver dollar. That's good the silver dollar now

[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.580]
Do we have to say the Susan B Anthony dollar or just the silver dollar because the silver dollar was like huh?

[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:02.620]
They're two different things I get there are two different things the silver dollar was never popular

[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.920]
So it's not what I have to be a thing well

[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:09.080]
But I mean it was it was out in our lifetime the suede Anthony dollar now you're right

[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.600]
It was never popular and flip Wilson. Well, why would he put him on there?

[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:17.780]
What's wrong with the person he was about his popular? He had his career at a schoolerson and zero-deen. No went away

[02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:23.520]
They says the unicorn village restaurant and Windixie behind crispy cream were knocked down and replaced by a

[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:28.520]
CBS drugstore that's one fantastic piece of good news is that efforts which I despise

[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:34.620]
Records is being replaced by CBS which is open 24 or seven right and they're all over the place and put in Walgreens under a lot of pressure

[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:40.660]
To I see and they're clean and they got carpeting right and and and even though Jack and it's like blockbuster and Wayne

[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:43.660]
Heisenga and the same thing with records in Jack Eckerd even though

[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:48.120]
Those two individuals had nothing to do with those businesses for quite many years the fact that it matter is

[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:50.680]
You were so turned off against both of them because it was individuals

[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:55.360]
Even later you didn't want to shove there plus records of course everybody had a coupon you go in there

[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:01.120]
You had the unlike for a pack of gum for like for like two items and some jackass some old bitches then

[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:04.420]
If you see he's got the paper oven and he's got a flyer open

[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:09.980]
You got all these coupons man. She's clippin his and then and then the woman's got to look in there flyer to see if they

[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:11.020]
In there wait

[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:17.400]
I'm not going to be oh Jesus God it says the video is across the street close down about three years ago

[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:22.580]
And a barbecue place was supposed to be open they started and stopped refurbishing the place and for last year

[02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:24.820]
There's been no work on a place. Oh, you know what else is like that?

[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:29.000]
Which I haven't I didn't go out there when I was home. What was the ice cream place over the drive-through was it?

[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:35.880]
163rd Street Lord, I don't know. Oh, yes you do then a drive-through and then it turned into something else

[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:40.960]
And then it was something else after that was it a bastard robins? It could have been now what that was it?

[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:46.500]
You don't know what I'm talking about nope as you're going east. Okay on the left hand side

[02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:50.400]
There was a nice green place and we used to talk about it all the time with a drive-through

[02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:54.620]
You know I'm talking about no it was great, but it's fun

[02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:57.960]
It says now the coin island is a laundry the basket robin

[02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:02.460]
Oh was a hamburger place and then a barbecue place and I was a chicken unlearned and still a simpty

[02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:05.740]
Says they thank you day for the bad news. You see you can't go back

[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:08.780]
You can't go you old turds live in the past

[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:12.940]
But you know something even George would admit that there was a lot better places then sure

[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:15.760]
I mean what do we got now pop had you know

[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:21.600]
Coney Ireland look what we got WQ a.m. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Love your show man

[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:26.460]
What's not like I didn't get to hear the whole whole question, but if you say

[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:29.960]
Let me give you the whole question. That's what the W

[02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:33.200]
Who or what is the most disappointing flash in the pan?

[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:37.260]
I would say if I don't know if you remember remember Captain Kendall

[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:42.700]
He used to ride up and down 995 in a car carrying extra radiator hoses and belts and

[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:43.700]
Captain Kendall

[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:47.680]
You could wear a cape and it's like a Superman

[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:53.100]
He rescued people on 95 years ago. Okay. That's the only one I could think of well

[02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:57.520]
We'll throw us ass on her and see if anything hits it. I love your show man. Thanks a lot, Tommy

[02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:03.480]
Bye Captain. Can I remember that? I remember Captain Kirk Captain Kangaroo never heard a Captain Kendall

[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:06.140]
No, so does that mean we're not gonna put it on there?

[02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:09.800]
Because they never heard of it this guy heard a captain kennel. Maybe he was big for about a week

[02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:16.000]
You know for about five minutes. Nobody Q. I.m. Hello Q. I.m. Yeah, you know, yes, sir

[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.520]
You know I called I didn't

[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:19.860]
I heard this I

[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:21.180]
I told me this had worked

[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:25.820]
I couldn't believe it and I went on to the CNN website to see if it was true because he saw it on TV

[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:30.460]
Oh my god, okay about a gay bomb the public defense

[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:33.560]
I had to surround yesterday or two days ago

[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:39.020]
Okay, I wasn't listening and I he told me to work yesterday and I just couldn't believe it. No, sure

[02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:43.180]
Well, they wanted to make a bomb that was

[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.840]
See you see I'm telling you we don't miss too much. We don't miss much man

[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:56.400]
I'm scouring those websites and of course 95% what I guess off the internet occasionally

[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:00.020]
I'm gonna stir off the Sun center or the hero which again is off the internet because I'm not there but

[02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:05.160]
Like this one remember yesterday we had a story which I was shocked and you were shocked because you lived there

[02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:07.600]
It had the most polite cities in America

[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:09.580]
I'll tell you one thing now one of them could

[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:18.700]
Not one of them could come close to Toronto when it comes to polite the people are so polite

[02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:21.760]
It's almost disgusting not quite I mean it's just right you know in other words

[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:26.640]
It almost some of them a little overboard, you know what I would be very polite very friendly just fine

[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:31.580]
But Charleston South Carolina won that the thing for the 800 a year in a row not that anybody wants to go there

[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:36.700]
But anyway it says a Midwest adequate adequate etiquette etiquette etiquette

[02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:41.700]
Maybe it is ranked Hollywood Florida the seventh most polite city in the nation to which we say oh yeah

[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:45.560]
But an equally unscientific survey found if you mention that fact is somebody on the street

[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:50.500]
They're like to laugh in your face rudely in Hollywood Hollywood since city resident Claude Vidal

[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:54.480]
Maybe they're more polite than downtown Miami, but this is South Florida not known for politeness

[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:59.600]
We've been in North Carolina those people are polite right up to Toronto Valley were polite the city's ranking

[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:06.380]
The only one in Florida make the top 10 was compiled by etiquette expert Marge Abel Young Stewart who's been issuing the unofficial list for 28 years

[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:10.960]
She determines a city's politeness quotient by reading letters and taxes from the public. Oh, geez

[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:13.220]
Speaking from her home in Kuwani, Illinois on Monday

[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:19.680]
She said she got more than 25 letters extolling Hollywood a city more than 140,000 two of them were about wonderful weddings

[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:24.240]
That were held Stewart-Settled letters its people are proud mainly it's such a healthy climate

[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.540]
It's a wonderful place to have guests come a lot of people felt that the area Florida really should be recognized

[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:35.460]
Those people apparently weren't on the street this week along the sidewalk cafes businesses and park benches along Young Circle in Hollywood

[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:40.180]
Boulevard the majority of about a dozen people questions said the city and South Florida in general should be recognized

[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:45.940]
I'll write but not for politeness people are rude people don't say excuse me they run you over with their shopping cart in the store

[02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:49.980]
It's crazy. Say Chris Serrato all of the Hollywood ice cream and sandwich shop on Hollywood Boulevard

[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:55.460]
Serrato cities from New Jersey and that's no stranger to Il Manor's but it was still shocked when exposed to the South Florida brand of

[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:56.140]
Courgiality

[02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:57.100]
Mayor Marge

[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:02.140]
Glanty or she's a that's the one with the t-shirt band right? Yeah

[02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:07.260]
Acknowledged the region isn't known for its open-handed friendliness a lot of us were a little surprised that any place in South Florida

[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:12.440]
Run Carly GZ South Florida is not known for that kind of thing still the listing is extremely good for the city

[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:16.220]
And may even be noted in future city literature the mayor said it's all a bunch of bull crap

[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:19.920]
Okay, and especially when the proxeter like right now forget about it

[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.760]
Let's do that one over again show okay I don't like the way that would probably

[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:34.900]
You

[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:36.700]
All right

[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:43.040]
Goodbye Bernie Kerrick

[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.680]
I'm in the service

[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:52.540]
I've got to know you and if you ask me that's why okay because you're bad and ugly and in the state

[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:56.540]
You have no problem getting laid

[02:35:57.780 --> 02:35:58.540]
Oh

[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:03.360]
Sure knows how to pick up you were banging you to drink in and a broad

[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:04.060]
Browse

[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:08.140]
Egg with door and then you may to sleep on the floor

[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:09.740]
Absolutely

[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:12.340]
Don't deserve it

[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:17.580]
But this song I will sing and that's awfully big of me

[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:21.820]
Too many rhymes with the poor

[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:23.840]
And the problems

[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.260]
He's that

[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:35.700]
I'm sure the next one they choose for hold my security

[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.120]
One 18 at five sixty WQA and let's see who or what is the most disappointing flash in a pan

[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:53.260]
We got John Kerry 84 and Howard D. 83 Scott for rals got 44 what a he just fell right off the end of the table

[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.080]
Beginning of this thing he was right up there. He was in the lead. He was a neck and neck nose to nose

[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:03.860]
And I was just petered out kind of like he showed it Ross p-ro 24 Howard Stern on QM 23

[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:05.300]
How many minutes was he on the station?

[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.620]
Damn it vanilla ice 21 the WMD's in Iraq those elusive WMD's

[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:18.560]
Remember the song elusive butterfly by Bob Lind no good the WMD's in a red sucked in Iraq and Quentin Tarantino

[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:20.740]
Weach have sixteen maybe Quentin's got him

[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:24.620]
Cecil Collins and Mark the Red Fidrid's 15 Andrew Dice play 14

[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:31.000]
Also the very pious Kurt Warner 14 Phil Henry's got 13 votes. Are you sure? Harold Miner a dozen

[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.440]
Alien Gonzalez 12 Brian Bosworth a dozen the Catholic Church molestation cases which was big news for about 10 minutes 11

[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:39.660]
Timmy Johnson 10 we got a shot Jimmy

[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:45.460]
Millie vanilla eight set away seven George Lucas seven the Florida panthers. We love him a lot

[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:50.120]
Ashley Simpson Ricky Martin Buster Douglas hoody and a blowfish Ashley band for leach have six

[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:56.940]
The SFL five new coke five Aaron Summers has four twin peaks three Karen K2 old John Rockers got appear

[02:37:56.940 --> 02:38:02.400]
Kato Katelyn two Denise Rybman two one a piece for Captain Kendall like I was see must have voted for it

[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:07.900]
Well, I know you're laughing, but at least see unlike some of these people like call and something and then I has no roles at least

[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:12.140]
He voted for it. That's good. Yeah or someone else did otherwise. It's such a waste

[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:17.740]
Captain Kendall Kathy Willetz. Maybe she was Captain Kendall bring Bernie Kerrick's Bay City Rollers John Bobbitt

[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:22.020]
Backspeed boys Jerry Rafferty with one and no boats see what I mean the silver dollar

[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:28.440]
I thought we weren't putting a silver dollar on there or the was never popular. Whatever whatever who cares. It's got the big

[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:29.900]
Hey justice also as

[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:33.360]
Johnson's got W.H.A.s got Frank Reese. He's got oh

[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:35.460]
Drew Michaels eight tracks

[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:43.160]
And think his got 98 degrees. Oh, I'll look at Lechay. He's see he's hanging on by the bootstrapped to Jessica

[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.720]
And now he's gonna be on an Ashley show and he's all over the place now

[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:50.180]
And like I said the sad part of it is that about all those groups and all those

[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:55.500]
No talent little punks. He was the only one with talent. He really can sing but nevertheless who cares about that right? Right

[02:38:56.340 --> 02:39:00.420]
Well, whatever now this story you I think you sent this to me a couple days ago

[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:06.620]
And I never got around because it's very long about this cabala cabala cabala the great con exposed it might have been me

[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:11.700]
Well, maybe I found it like I said you didn't send this to me. I think I found it now. Yeah, I think you sent it

[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:18.700]
Using a secret camera cancer patient Tony Donnelly went inside the cabala center in London to reveal an organization that charges

[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:21.920]
860 pounds for dinner a pound is almost two bucks

[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.440]
Healing water and some books in a romantic. How do you like that? Oh

[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:29.620]
Not another bunch of and this of course is the Madonna thing who else is into this Brittany now?

[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.120]
A lot of people it's embarrassing. Oh boy

[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.460]
This is the Jewish Scientology and most of the people in it were in Jewish in the first place

[02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:40.800]
The surgeon at the Ruhm-Martin Hospital at Wornby after I went out of the knife for bladder cancer

[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:43.660]
That's the third month after the operation would be the most frustrating

[02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:47.380]
I gotten through the chemotherapy course and the good news was I was still alive and ticking

[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:49.440]
But while nowhere near my original fitness

[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:53.380]
I was desperate for something exciting anything to break me out of the boredom of convalescence

[02:39:53.380 --> 02:39:58.320]
John Swainey the BBC reporter who knows me of old had visited me at the hospital

[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.280]
And knew that I had done covert camera work before his call was like a tonic

[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:06.000]
This job he explained considered a curious religious outfit called the cabala center

[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.920]
Which claimed among other things that it's cabala water is how do you say?

[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:10.340]
Cabala that it's

[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.920]
Cabala water was blessed with miraculous powers of restoration and healing and then it's zoahar books the court

[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:18.880]
Testive cabala which they marketed did you good too?

[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:22.880]
They operated from a three point sixty five million pound property off

[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.120]
Bond Street and center London and named such as Madonna and Britney Spears were mentioned to supporters

[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.180]
Some people said the center held people to understand ancient Jewish mysticism

[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:33.960]
But others who've been inside a cold today called a cold and they are absolutely

[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.800]
Correct my task was to test its claim that the water and the books could help cure cancer

[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.080]
I was to play the wealthy business man stricken with cancer, which was at least half true anyway

[02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:45.660]
After picking up my I'm not going to read this whole thing

[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:49.240]
It's was on for pages this is a little bit the way I do what a bunch of shifters these people are

[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:51.900]
Fakers like all the religious man their fakers

[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:57.540]
After picking up my secret camera I headed off to the London cabala center on hearing of my cancer and that money was no problem

[02:40:57.540 --> 02:41:01.560]
Miriam at reception filled me in that's probably the same mirror needs to cut my hair at i.o.d

[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:06.960]
Miriam said we had the cabala water that has very strong healing powers would it help my cells?

[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:11.600]
Oh, it's a very good possibility she said we have one girl who works here her mother used to have cancer

[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.260]
And she doesn't have it anymore because she drank the water she comes here for a shabbat

[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:20.620]
There are a lot of connections you can do the water is very very good because it affects the cells

[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:26.820]
It pendered the cells she arranged the meeting that day for me with chagai shuster chowster

[02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:29.340]
But it should be shister a senior figure in the center

[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:34.020]
See when a when a guy that runs a place his name is shister that should tell you somewhere off the bat right run

[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:38.100]
He told me he lived there and explained that his possessions were fit into one suitcase

[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:40.820]
He'd also didn't have money to buy clothes, but received gifts

[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:43.520]
He said that for at least nine years he'd only been given what he needed

[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.180]
He struck me as an intelligent man

[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:48.880]
But for his devotion to the cabala center would be holding on a worthwhile career in the outside world

[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:50.280]
We talked about my cancer

[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.580]
Shouster shister was very careful to stress that he wasn't promising miracles

[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:57.240]
But he said there were tools that could help including the water and the zohar

[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:01.360]
The cabala books in her make and Hebrew you need to let go of what the doctors told you

[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:04.920]
We said drinking the water while meditating on the places that we have a problem with the bladder

[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:06.900]
You say we'll clean and strengthen those places

[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:09.040]
Also, you can put the water on your stomach as well

[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.540]
How much water will I need in your situation right now about three bottles of day to drink and to meditate and to scan the zohar

[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:16.760]
There are a few items I'd like you to get right now in the bookstore

[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:17.960]
They're lucky to have if you want

[02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:21.320]
Expecting money might raise its ugly head. I asked the water is not a gift

[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:24.920]
No, nothing is a gift the water is not a gift the zohar is not a gift as you know

[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:31.840]
There is the water cost a case of 12 boxes cost 45 pounds 90 bucks and the zohar is 289 pounds by 500 bucks

[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:36.500]
And the shabbat meal is 26 bucks 56 pounds 50 bucks and it goes on and on

[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:37.120]
It's another

[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.340]
Faker a bunch of crap man

[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:44.040]
All you gullible people out there that get sucked in and taking it with this garbage man

[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.880]
The Jews and the Christians and the Muslims and the

[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:51.180]
Scientologists and the Christian scientists and the Mormons and the

[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:54.420]
Cabalists to all this crap the Buddhists

[02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:55.180]
Man

[02:42:56.020 --> 02:43:00.780]
Why don't they just send us their money? You know if you've got so much money to spread around to give away to a bunch of con artist

[02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:04.200]
Just send it to us. I guarantee they'll go to heaven or double their money back

[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.820]
All right, listen you're gonna get 45 virgins in my heaven forget about those seven man

[02:43:07.820 --> 02:43:12.100]

[02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:27.900]
As many as you want you won't get any weight you won't be your soul won't get fat over the face all size

[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:33.160]
Bunch of garbage. Nino says. I don't know if he's oh yeah, this is a good one

[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:36.540]
In fact, I haven't had a little thing here somewhere for now is it there it is

[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:46.980]
The room is actually

[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:55.260]
but

[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:18.260]
When

[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:22.860]
So

[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:28.120]
a lesbian. Alright, that was him, scholar, right? I guess. You don't know? I don't know.

[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:31.760]
I'm sure that was him. Okay. Well, you really are slipping, man. I think I was really

[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:35.360]
thinking about that. If you go back to those nice crappy donuts, the ones that are like

[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:39.720]
real cake, see cake is cake. There's nothing wrong with it. We have good moist like a chocolate

[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:43.140]
and a killer cake or whatever that is. But cake is cake and donuts are like a different

[02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:47.700]
product. Right. The donuts are supposed to be like cake. Okay? Cake? I still, you know,

[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:52.140]
it's being diabetic myself and that is so many ridiculous things that got five or

[02:44:52.140 --> 02:44:56.540]
three and that was one of them. Here's his Michael who is not only just diabetic, but

[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:01.220]
goes into diabetic colmas, you know, and he's like eating cake and offering it to K. Or

[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:06.820]
it sounds like K. 27 after 1 and 5, 60, WQM. Anyway, tiny tin. We got it on there. Yeah, we

[02:45:06.820 --> 02:45:12.960]

132 adjacent and sunrise faction says for those clowns out there that have those useless yellow ribbons on their car of which zero dollars go to support the troops. There is a great website, opt truth.org, OP truth, opt truth.org made by an active marine. It has laced other websites, domation sites for the troops and their families. Also as addresses and phone numbers for congress and representatives in New Districts. Also they're working with a filmmaker at groundtruth.org who's making a documentary on returning soldiers. You can see the movie at information clearinghouse.com.

[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:33.740]
What is it? www.information clearinghouse.something. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry this was so long. You couldn't get your phone. Okay. Thanks Jason and sunrise. I'm going to put that away so we still have it. I'm going to keep it in my pile. 56670560.560. I'll tell you that the clipper that hair clipper I got from what you call right. Sharper image. Okay. Great. Okay. Seriously. What a job it does in your sibrins in about two seconds. Yeah. If you're like, you know, either you do your barbarous omnication, which mine happens to be. You want to like

[02:49:33.740 --> 02:50:03.720]
trim it up a little bit in between haircuts or maybe you're like really cheap like some of you bastards out there and you want to like, you know, stand like a few extra weeks in between haircuts. Especially when you have so little hair as some of us hold for us, right? Right. Who the hell needs to go get a haircut. I'm still thinking to shave it all off. Not as well. I mean, it's good enough for Carmella. Why not for me? 56670560. It's good enough for a Gerolito. Well, that movie was so bad. I'm embarrassed to admit. Especially after going through that lecture about not sitting there watching TV just because somebody hot happens to you. But you know, there he was. You know, how do I know there was going to be like a one

[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:24.660]
mile sexy naked scene late in the movie? Thank God. I mean, Dominic, you a hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, well, the restaurant on 160th earth street. Right. Like they've been saying most of them are gone. I know that Coney Island had a fire and they reopened. I guess they weren't the same. So they closed down after that. Probably burned all of them.

[02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:40.300]
They're not from our commission to pieces. Probably true. Yeah. I know that the Franko pizza is still there. The unicorn. They get for that. I'm not too long ago. They used to be like the Greyhound bus station there and the big bill TVX pharmacy there now. Right.

[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:54.100]
And I guess people who's across the street, they've been trying to build something there for a long time. Nothing's there. They haven't opened anything there. So that's a bad hood, man. Nobody wants to go out of business there. No more. Yeah, it's changed a lot of. I've lived there my whole life.

[02:50:54.100 --> 02:51:08.940]
I'm just waiting for the day I can get out of here. Let me ask you that was the basket. Robbins with the drive through there right on 163rd. You know, I've been trying to wreck my brain on that. I don't remember about the robins. I remember a swinton down down the road and further down there. But yeah, I don't remember.

[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:17.840]
I'm on the side of a US one. Now this this was just when you come off the expressway on 163rd. And on the left hand side is you're going used. There was a basket. Robbins with a drive through.

[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:29.180]
I believe you mean many a day after work after a stressful day of work at IOD, drive it up to Brown. I would like to pull off that exit. Yeah, I know there is a basket. Robbins over there, but I don't remember the drive through definitely long gone.

[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:58.220]
I'm going to go back. I can't go back. Baby can't turn the clock back. Oh, it's only that would be good pull to take one day. What's that? Although it's kind of like what was your favorite, but but no, it's different though. If you could turn a clock back and bring back one South Florida restaurant that's no longer in business. What would it be? Not a good pull? Okay. It's a poll. You don't think it's fine. You're lucky. You don't sound like you know, now wouldn't be the clock restaurant. I saw a clock restaurant. What how did I see it?

[02:51:58.220 --> 02:52:27.980]
In plantation somewhere, I believe a clock restaurant. Can you believe that? I think they were around anymore. No. They're okay. They're better than Denny's George. I just mentioned that in Tanning College. Just for reference for next time. I'm going to what we didn't have in my nursing home. I'd like to really allow this Perkins pancake house. Do we have all of those? I haven't seen a Perkins in ages. All good on the West Coast and Tampa or other areas. Why isn't that so many of these damn good places are not in South Florida? We suck. Thank God for two jays, man. Have you ever used your coupon and go there? No, no, yeah.

[02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:41.820]
I see this. Hey, I'm telling you you will love it. Trust me. I can't wait to I'll bet you I'll bet you right now. Gary Surner's life on it. That you'll rave about it. That you'll love it. How's that? Okay. You're in T.

[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:56.020]
How many QA am hello? Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. On one sixteenth third, remember Sandy's drugs. No. It was right as you go halfway down with the road bends a little bit. It was Sandy's drugs on the right heading east.

[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:06.840]
East of Peaches. East of Wolfees. No, before you remember where you remember where Wolfees used to be and then it became a peaches right across from the 163rd Street shopping center.

[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:24.020]
There was a big wolfies there and then it became Peaches record store. It was before that. I'll come in. Before that. And you remember the pink islands. The pink. Oh, sure. That was a what was that coupons name? The designer? What was his name? Oh, I can't remember. They did. They made a song about that.

[02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:36.300]
Crystal Crystal Crystal Crystal Crystal. They kind of Crystal. Why I heard used to use crystal. They cover the islands in pink. Yeah, that was a big flash in the pan. Oh, yeah, that was great. Yeah, the pink islands. That would be good one for the pool.

[02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:54.320]
And speaking of coming off that 163rd Street and turning into basking robins after a stressful day, I had to do the same thing, but I would turn right. If you know what I mean, across the street from basking robins. Oh, yeah, I sure do. Go there. I just wanted to run into Don Cox over there too. I tried not to. Okay, have a great day, pal.

[02:53:55.260 --> 02:54:06.960]
Yeah, he's staying out over there. Well, he's dead anyway. And to make a difference. He was just having a real party. Yeah, there you go. 5.670560.

[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:24.200]
Tom 560 under Verizon and singing the right of slides. Why we're living in the past man. You're right. Mo is right. Too much of this old time. We got to get with it, man. All these whipers. Now there's all the good stuff from today. What is it? Where is the good stuff? The shield? I'm done. I'm not talking about. I'm talking about food places. I'm talking about restaurants. I'm talking about.

[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:32.500]
They were like something before they, you know, before they go under before they become like one of those restaurants that was good and then they go away. They're still good.

[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:48.380]
What was that? I was on 441. No. I don't know. Going north. Yeah, I'm 441. Round here. 125th street used to be Rocky, Graziani's right. And it was a shanty sea shanty. And it was at Hungarian Charter.

[02:54:48.960 --> 02:55:16.940]
Well, anyway, why are we doing this? It's depressing. It's depressing. If I could turn a clock back and have one restaurant we open in South Florida that I love like crazy. There were many good ones like the studio in the Gables. It would be the famous on Washington Avenue. I don't care what anybody says. Even the goiom love the famous man. It wasn't just a deli for Jews. It was for anybody with a healthy appetite. The famous. You ask the Humper tomorrow. He'll tell you ask the Humper about the famous. Like Joey Zaza. Maybe he'll make you famous someday. 20 till two at 5.60.

[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:19.700]
Your food intensive station QIM.

[02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:25.460]
You will need Rogers. And school. I'm going to have you.

[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:31.680]
Just you Gordon Lydia. They don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:49.680]
You will be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be the only

[02:56:51.540 --> 02:57:01.700]
Only one who can be the only one who can be the only two who can be the only two who can be the only two who can be the only two who can be the only two who can be the only one who can be the only one who can be their only two who can be loved and blessed together

[02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:12.720]
One deserve thousand's in the name of our blue heart to have served the reason we are human beings

[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:17.340]
Look at the victory that's going to rise at the end the race for us

[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:20.180]
I'm a little bit more than I ever did.

[02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:22.240]
I'm a little bit more than I ever did.

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:35.100]
You know, that hand pro that we had, I've been taped it.

[02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:37.360]
I put it on Chrisette and maybe I'll listen to it 8,000 times later.

[02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:40.280]
But it seems to me that was off the TV telecast.

[02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:42.680]
I'm pretty damn sure that was Dick Stockton. Am I right Josh?

[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:43.360]
Sure.

[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:45.500]
Now did you see that play live like I did?

[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:47.060]
That was an exciting play and I pumped return.

[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:48.200]
That was a crucial play in the game.

[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:49.140]
I did see it.

[02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:49.200]
Yeah.

[02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:49.920]
It was exciting.

[02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:51.660]
He didn't make it sound that way.

[02:57:51.900 --> 02:57:52.520]
Oh man.

[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:54.420]
I mean, just pathetic.

[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:56.100]
You know what I mean about these old hacks?

[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:57.320]
Old hacks.

[02:57:58.100 --> 02:58:00.020]
Don Cricky, Dick Stockton, man.

[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:03.120]
Even Sam Rosen, which, you know, Sam's okay on hockey, but geez.

[02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:05.780]
You know, get some new blood in there, man.

[02:58:06.100 --> 02:58:09.300]
That's why we got old hacks around because they're not any new sports casters.

[02:58:09.540 --> 02:58:12.520]
We got to get a whole bunch more puns to that connected school of broadcasting, George.

[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:14.680]
Don't you think?

[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:15.380]
Yeah.

[02:58:16.120 --> 02:58:18.580]
Put down the bottled and put it in full throttle, man.

[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:21.160]
All you, well, well, would be sports casters out there.

[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:24.660]
You can be the next Lenny Martez or the next Yelp God forbid.

[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:25.800]
You got a nice squeaky voice.

[02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:30.320]
Or you can even be the next mic Rosenthal from VOM.

[02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:32.240]
Oh yeah, Lorenzo's.

[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:33.380]
Lorenzo's was so sensational.

[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:35.380]
Let's not forget.

[02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:36.800]
See, we're already starting on tomorrow's poll.

[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:37.980]
I don't know if I'm going to do that tomorrow.

[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.000]
You think it's a good idea or what?

[02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:39.820]
That's okay.

[02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:42.860]
You're seeing pretty unenthusiastic and the little similar.

[02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:43.160]
The younger.

[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:43.740]
You think that or the what?

[02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:46.260]
It's very similar to that other one that we took.

[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:48.280]
That that was a long time ago.

[02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:49.500]
That's more than a week ago.

[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:51.000]
Then it's long enough.

[02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:53.000]
Well, and it's long enough.

[02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:54.040]
I never heard that yet.

[02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:56.840]
But nevertheless, Moon right along.

[02:58:57.060 --> 02:58:57.860]
You were the China.

[02:58:58.180 --> 02:59:02.060]
Speaking of that, join George McGill and Boca-Brion 5-7 happy hour, Tragedy Rival and the

[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:03.080]
Seth Noon off the palm metal.

[02:59:03.200 --> 02:59:04.780]
Just know that the 120 seconds speed exit.

[02:59:05.140 --> 02:59:08.700]
Stop by to win some very low budget QM prizes and enjoy dance specials all night long.

[02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:15.180]
And maybe, Boca-Brion McGill will pop a few ping pong balls out of his leg bone years.

[02:59:15.740 --> 02:59:21.340]
And now the FITICU M bandit 8-10 at the Bruce Room located at 54-66 West Hamperwood and

[02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:21.700]
Marguerite.

[02:59:21.940 --> 02:59:23.800]
Stop by for LeBat Blue Hockey, baby.

[02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:26.240]
A dollar and a half pipes of blue and some lockouts over.

[02:59:26.580 --> 02:59:28.440]
I wish we had the LeBat Blue theme.

[02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:42.460]
I'm also LeBat brought to you by Motovalevats.

[02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:43.760]
Access it all.

[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:44.480]
I'm LeBat.

[02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:49.000]
My board of Canada, where quality is job one.

[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:50.220]
It's worth it.

[02:59:50.740 --> 02:59:55.980]
I am Muriel Oil and Desu Associates, proud to be one of the leading sponsors of Utah Key and Canada.

[02:59:56.600 --> 02:59:58.420]
And by Tepley, I am the CEO of the United States.

[02:59:58.420 --> 02:59:58.420]

[02:59:58.420 --> 03:00:01.840]
God, I have it.

[03:00:06.500 --> 03:00:08.740]
That's going to do it, but that's enough for the Canadians.

[03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:11.880]
They've keyed all they want to see here in the Red Wing.

[03:00:12.060 --> 03:00:13.040]
Time's going to run out here.

[03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:13.640]
It's Constantine.

[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:15.540]
I won't make it back to Santa Right, sir.

[03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:18.200]
Oh, that's that obnoxious Mickey Redmond, man.

[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:19.200]
Boy do I despise him.

[03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:20.480]
You're like anybody right.

[03:00:20.980 --> 03:00:22.900]
5'6'7'0'5'60".

[03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:25.000]
Oh, man, he's bad.

[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:26.480]
You know who he used to work with?

[03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:28.800]
Dave Strader, who's going to be the Panthers TV announcer.

[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:30.540]
Replace him remember if they were playing.

[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:31.340]
You think they're going to play?

[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:31.560]
No.

[03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:32.520]
Sorry about that, Dave.

[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:33.320]
I hear times are tough.

[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:34.700]
W.A.M. Hello.

[03:00:35.220 --> 03:00:36.040]
Neil, how's it going?

[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:37.160]
Pretty good, Pellie.

[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:39.460]
The basking Robbins was on second avenue.

[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:41.140]
Right on 163rd.

[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:42.080]
It was derived through.

[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:43.000]
You're not absolutely.

[03:00:43.420 --> 03:00:47.400]
And I used to drive through that thing like I get a three-school pot flood someday on a way home.

[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:49.220]
He did right around my driving up the turnpike.

[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:51.600]
And the clock is in plantation.

[03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:53.140]
It's right on 441.

[03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:54.280]
Yeah, I saw that.

[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:55.540]
I could have knocked me over the feather.

[03:00:55.720 --> 03:00:56.720]
But that's how I was calling.

[03:00:56.840 --> 03:00:59.140]
How about here's one of the Marlins fans really.

[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:00.440]
Like, how about Don Trell?

[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:01.820]
There's a flash in the pan.

[03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:02.380]
Yeah.

[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:04.500]
So start out like a house on fire.

[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:05.700]
You can't get arrested.

[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:07.240]
Whatever happened to him.

[03:01:07.660 --> 03:01:09.140]
Well, he saw the team, but he ain't you?

[03:01:09.140 --> 03:01:09.940]
Yeah, you're under team.

[03:01:10.100 --> 03:01:10.100]

[03:01:10.140 --> 03:01:13.640]
But he was hotter and episteler for a few months and then that was the end of that.

[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:16.800]
And if anybody thinks Dave Van Boring isn't boring,

[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:19.460]
all you're going to do is listen to the game's six-of-the-world series.

[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:20.000]
Yeah.

[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:23.040]
And the Marlins, the Marlins are the world champion.

[03:01:23.460 --> 03:01:23.620]
Oh, everybody.

[03:01:24.060 --> 03:01:25.840]
And the fact that we actually played that in a promo.

[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:28.020]
I mean, when you think when you have an embarrassing call like that,

[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:30.760]
just like that dictastic thing we had, why would you put that in a promo?

[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:31.280]
It's so great.

[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:36.020]
I understand the point in the promo is that they had the prediction right about a pot return touchdown.

[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:37.480]
But Jesus, to play that.

[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:43.440]
I mean, when the world series in Yankee Stadium, they kicked their ass and that's the best he's...

[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:46.360]
I mean, that's the way you get managed going crazy, you know?

[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:46.580]
Right.

[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:47.220]
Exactly.

[03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:50.880]
And anyway, for Paul C, I know you're listening.

[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:52.300]
Can I get to Toronto weather tonight?

[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:55.980]
It's, let's see, it's toasty.

[03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:58.160]
It's like, well, let me get into the weather just a second.

[03:01:58.360 --> 03:01:58.620]
Hang on a second.

[03:01:58.620 --> 03:01:58.980]
There's more.

[03:01:59.180 --> 03:02:00.040]
There's a big jackass.

[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:03.340]
We had a quarter of an inch of snow on the ground and the weather, what is it?

[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:04.800]
It's minus four, 26 degrees.

[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:05.580]
Maybe it's toasty.

[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:06.020]
Come on up.

[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:07.060]
It's murky.

[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:08.700]
It's cloudy, but I'm sure a lot warmer than yesterday.

[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:10.020]
Man, it was brutal.

[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:12.760]
It was minus 23 Celsius when I woke up.

[03:02:12.820 --> 03:02:13.700]
But you have no idea what that is.

[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:15.100]
But Dan Coul is what it was.

[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:15.420]
Man.

[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:16.500]
Am I complaining now?

[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:16.840]
No.

[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:17.220]
No.

[03:02:17.420 --> 03:02:18.180]
No bother me.

[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:19.460]
It's going to be all the way up to 28.

[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.820]
28 Fahrenheit today.

[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:21.280]
That bad?

[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:21.800]
No.

[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:23.340]
A little bit of snow for reactivity.

[03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:24.820]
I think about this time of the year.

[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:25.400]
No, seriously.

[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:26.320]
I think about this time of the year.

[03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:28.900]
I'd say we had about a half inches snow overnight in this morning.

[03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:33.780]
And because the streets and the sidewalk are fairly relatively speaking, although after yesterday,

[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:35.140]
you wouldn't think that they would be, you know?

[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:38.020]
But for whatever reason, it didn't stick around too long.

[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:39.560]
Who cares about that?

[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:41.800]
Castor Nova, though, I know he's listening like the guy says.

[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:46.100]
He's going to be doing his beaded curtain tomorrow and then he'll be doing the Toronto weather.

[03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:49.160]
And then he'll be doing the, you know, farting the same flavor that I did.

[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:50.980]
The good news is it'll be stuff that we've already had.

[03:02:50.980 --> 03:02:53.660]
Then he'll be talking about how we miss all these great restaurants that used to be in town.

[03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:54.640]
Paul, get a life.

[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:55.680]
Okay, get some material.

[03:02:56.220 --> 03:02:56.480]
You loser.

[03:02:57.200 --> 03:02:57.600]
You loser.

[03:02:57.600 --> 03:02:58.320]
I'm going to do a little rocket.

[03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:00.200]
I'm losing weight.

[03:03:01.220 --> 03:03:02.020]
I'm 560.

[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:03.060]
I'm 560.

[03:03:03.060 --> 03:03:03.620]
I'm 8am.

[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:06.880]
I'm 560.

[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:06.880]

[03:03:07.060 --> 03:03:08.360]
I'm 560.

[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:09.420]

[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:09.640]
I'm 560.

[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:09.720]
I'm 8am.

[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:09.920]
I'm 560.

[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:09.920]

[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:10.240]
I'm 8am.

[03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:10.620]
I'm 560.

[03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:14.580]
I'm 560.

[03:03:14.860 --> 03:03:15.100]
I'm 560.

[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:16.740]
I could tell he was in a dog.

[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:23.580]
So I acted out my puncture in with my arms the trees I made.

[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:26.300]
No bunkers speaks English and a mom.

[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:34.700]
I went down to my, yeah, I met with each weather business and she knew.

[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:40.240]
I walked into a little store but the guy there talks real fun out.

[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:43.460]
I asked him for a pint of cordium beam, he says,

[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:45.540]
no one to end up, what does that mean?

[03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:49.120]
Nobody speaks English and a mom.

[03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:52.260]
Got the cornered deli.

[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:57.520]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan speak English and mail it.

[03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:00.300]
Oh, you think I'm going back to Iraq?

[03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:11.260]
I came here many years ago.

[03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:13.260]
Learn my ABC.

[03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:18.440]
I don't say much as grossy as I say pretty much.

[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:24.880]
So get yourself to a classroom quicker American now stop making mistakes there.

[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:26.780]
We know about it speak English.

[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:30.340]
156.

[03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:31.120]
It's 560.

[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:36.320]
We got Mad Dog standing by and then we got Mohawar Davida, like a knock between four and seven.

[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:39.100]
Oh, you got that UM basketball crap.

[03:04:39.980 --> 03:04:47.020]
I was just thinking speaking of speaking with smelly that hold deal about the packies and Indian people and the curry thing we've talked about.

[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:53.600]
When you smell, for example, when you fart, I don't want to get too gross choice but when you fart, I mean you can, okay, you can smell it.

[03:04:53.820 --> 03:04:54.280]
Sure, right.

[03:04:54.320 --> 03:05:00.240]
Unless it's one of those very fragrant ones that one of those benign ones.

[03:05:00.460 --> 03:05:01.400]
Right, no, this one's malicious.

[03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:05.680]
But one of those malignant ones, man, 99 times that 100, you can smell it.

[03:05:05.680 --> 03:05:09.040]
And of course, when you're in, if you were alone, you can smell it.

[03:05:09.180 --> 03:05:10.660]
But when you were with other people, you can smell it.

[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:12.180]
But the bottom line is you can smell it.

[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:13.700]
Now, how come when you stink?

[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:20.440]
Whether it's either from too much curry for dinner or the last 20 years in your body or because you haven't taken a bath in the last 20 years.

[03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:24.320]
Whatever the reason being, if I can smell you, why can't you see what I'm saying?

[03:05:24.420 --> 03:05:25.300]
Why can't you smell yourself?

[03:05:25.460 --> 03:05:26.500]
You get used to it.

[03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:28.560]
That's the fact that we studied it in health class.

[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:32.620]
You get immune to a particular smell if you're exposed to it for a certain amount of time.

[03:05:32.620 --> 03:05:35.500]
So in other words, if you farted nonstop, right?

[03:05:35.900 --> 03:05:37.000]
Or you're always farting.

[03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:42.800]
Well, like fat people who don't, you know, they can't reach areas and they smell like that to other people all the time.

[03:05:42.980 --> 03:05:43.240]
Remember?

[03:05:43.820 --> 03:05:45.240]
They don't smell like that to themselves.

[03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:46.060]
Really?

[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:49.940]
I had the discussion with like Rest and Peace, my fat friend.

[03:05:50.140 --> 03:05:50.440]
Yeah.

[03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:54.280]
You walk into his house and he comes into your house and you say, hey, you smell like crap.

[03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:55.000]
Yeah.

[03:05:55.340 --> 03:05:55.800]
Like, totally.

[03:05:56.020 --> 03:05:56.740]
And he'd be all offended.

[03:05:57.120 --> 03:06:00.440]
And I said, look, it's right, dude, I smelled it before you walked into the house.

[03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:03.140]
And he was, you know, not aware of it.

[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:04.120]
I went to a fat guy.

[03:06:04.180 --> 03:06:06.520]
I don't want to mention any names because he would be known.

[03:06:06.880 --> 03:06:10.800]
But a fat guy, and he used to like take cashmere bouquet, you know, like talcum powder.

[03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:16.000]
Because he was so fat that his thighs would shape, you know, in the summertime on his oven, 80s.

[03:06:16.020 --> 03:06:16.140]
Sure.

[03:06:16.540 --> 03:06:22.200]
And so he would like take cashmere bouquet and like, smear it on it and all that does is make it smell a thousand times worse.

[03:06:23.400 --> 03:06:23.760]
Right?

[03:06:23.820 --> 03:06:24.580]
You follow what I'm saying?

[03:06:25.180 --> 03:06:26.080]
Oh my god.

[03:06:26.080 --> 03:06:31.440]
I have something that was rather than bathing, rather than washing away that mung, whatever you'd like to call it.

[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:31.700]
That's an example.

[03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:32.840]
Oh, geez.

[03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:33.660]

[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:34.820]
There you go.

[03:06:34.820 --> 03:06:35.220]
Yeah, oh, geez.

[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:43.200]
Here's a fast that says about 25 years ago, I drove to Jackson Memorial with my dad for an appointment or had to fast before my blood work.

[03:06:43.580 --> 03:06:45.220]
On the way back to Bokeh, we stopped off.

[03:06:45.220 --> 03:06:47.340]
I was still in Miami and found a place called Wolfies.

[03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:49.200]
I don't think they took his credit card.

[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:52.000]
He only had a couple bucks of cash enough for a sandwich, but no drink and no tip.

[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.800]
The waitress caught on and brought us a coastline pickles.

[03:06:55.420 --> 03:06:55.740]
Awesome.

[03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:57.940]
And set us up with the best astronomy on right-ever head.

[03:06:58.220 --> 03:06:59.040]
Great memories of Wolfies.

[03:06:59.300 --> 03:07:00.020]
Well, how do you like that?

[03:07:00.140 --> 03:07:01.520]
Because that's the opposite of my memory.

[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:06.140]
Remember I told you about that one on 163rd where I was on a holiday, some kind of bank holiday.

[03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:08.540]
And I go there for lunch and I didn't have any cash.

[03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:13.260]
I had a couple of bucks, but the check was like $9.85, whatever I had soup in a sandwich.

[03:07:13.580 --> 03:07:15.760]
And I take my American Express card and give it to the brought it.

[03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:19.740]
Oh, for a lousy $10, I'm going to take a credit card.

[03:07:19.740 --> 03:07:22.660]
We don't take the credit card for a lousy $10.

[03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:25.500]
So I said, what's the minimum for credit cards?

[03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:26.260]
He says $15.

[03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:31.640]
I said, OK, I'll leave a $6 tip, a lousy $6 tip for your lousy $10 check.

[03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:33.440]
I'll never see your lousy as place again.

[03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:34.280]
How do you like that?

[03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:39.640]
That was more likely the story, the kind of story I heard at Wolfies and Pumpernix and some of those other old,

[03:07:40.120 --> 03:07:41.600]
old fart places, OK?

[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:43.680]
Thank God they stole all the sweet and low.

[03:07:44.540 --> 03:07:46.100]
It wouldn't be bad to have one of those around anymore, right?

[03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:48.520]
Is there any, what happened to that Pumpernix Wolfies and Hollywood?

[03:07:50.060 --> 03:07:51.560]
Oh, the one, yeah, no, a golem.

[03:07:51.980 --> 03:07:52.580]
The name's easy.

[03:07:52.800 --> 03:07:53.320]
And you want to know why?

[03:07:53.860 --> 03:07:54.960]
Customers were too damn polite.

[03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:55.780]
Bye, bye, bye!
