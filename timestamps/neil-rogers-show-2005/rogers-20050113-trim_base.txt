[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]
All right, Neil Rogers is going to be here for the next four hours, and Neil will provide

[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.020]
a mirth and some serious talk as well. Nobody combines it better than he does. This is like

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.380]
an honor to be a lead into Neil. This is not exactly something I dreamed about, you know,

[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.200]
getting up at this hour, but the pre-seed Neil show, that's fantastic. I've known Neil.

[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.980]
We've worked together at stations for a long time now. I remember the first time I met Neil.

[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.520]
I was a guest on his show when he was doing a show in South Miami at night.

[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.560]
And somebody had asked me something that I was in the newspaper about what my favorite radio show

[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.120]
was, and I said I never missed Neil Rogers. I wound up in those days, Neil had guests,

[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.260]
and I had more fun doing that show with him that night. Now I'm going to have fun listening to him

[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.680]
for the next four hours, as usual. I'm sure he'll have a pretty good spin on what's going on here

[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.480]
at 5.60, QAM. By the time these people get done with it, it's going to be

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.900]
280, 60, 280. Excuse me, I messed that up. I'll get it right.

[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.860]
280, QAM. Hello. Hello. The first time you met me was not on that show. Was it at the track?

[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.980]
No. It was on the Larry King show in IOD. Really? We were both guests. There was a panel of

[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.580]
the Generic Gamera. Still, Salsman was on it. Sivishai in one night. Wow. How do you like that for

[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.320]
memory? I don't remember that. Yeah, I remember it as a kind of everybody in town out of their money.

[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.420]
Did we loan them any that night? Thank God no. But I don't even remember I came down to the U.A.

[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.860]
I'm from the U.S. Yeah. And I also run with Tony Cigarette on I.N.Z. Yeah. That's right.

[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.360]
But I had more fun doing that show you that night. Well, I'm glad you did because I hated that place.

[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.600]
Yeah, I know about the place. Yeah. But if you were doing a much different kind of show in those days.

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.200]
Oh boy. I want to apologize to everybody for it too. Oh brother.

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.740]
Hey, it didn't matter. You've done all kinds of different formats within your own. Just give me the money, man.

[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.740]
Give me the money. I'll do whatever you want. Okay. Yeah. I'm doing this for the money.

[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.940]
You know, he said something to me yesterday. But you don't love us. Oh boy.

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.280]
I could do the next four hours on that. I just want to see the check. You know.

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.580]
Hey, you told me to add a couple of years ago. You said money in one day.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.640]
Exactly what you said. You don't let stuff follow you. Right. Well, it's not easy with this crowd.

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.780]
No, it isn't. They push it to the limit. So who's on from 4 to 7 today?

[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.320]
I have no idea. Any do today. Don't lose too much today. I'm just, you know what?

[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.200]
I'm, but I'm not going to go on stream. So I'm okay.

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.440]
Oh, I got to tell you a little story because it's on our dime anyway. Yeah.

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.180]
I'm at Woodbine last night at the slots, which of course, George Cortes says, real guys don't play slots.

[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.820]
And the woman next to me who's a nasty brother, nasty as bitch in the whole place, she hits the,

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.080]
and I had played that machine. I'm sitting to her right because it got cold. I thought.

[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.300]
And she had the three real fortunes for 128 grand. Oh, God.

[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.160]
And I like an hour. So what a come up an hour before I would have had it. I wouldn't be here right now.

[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.100]
No, we call. Yeah. You get that for sure, don't you? Yeah, right.

[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.580]
Yeah, 128 bucks per show. You got how many people go out there? You know, they've got this.

[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.520]
You know, they're going to vote on slots here very soon, probably in March.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.680]
Although there are people out there who are already trying to stop it. Yeah.

[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.640]
But I don't think they're going to win this. They are. You got to board again,

[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.320]
looted ticks and you got the dog racing people who aren't fooling anybody.

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.520]
I mean, the dog racing out the, in the business, but I mean, the opponents.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.080]
And then you got the Indians who, you know, wanted all for themselves. Right.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.260]
Donald Trump is doing them. You guys see that? I hope the Indians watch it or we're going to stick

[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.140]
default on him again. I don't teach them. Have a great day, Hank. You're too new. See you. Yep.

[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.920]
I found a hoe.

[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.300]
And you I'm listening.

[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.860]
Go go go. What does that mean?

[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.120]
I had a chick named Dave.

[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.980]
One day she flew away to Tijuana where the moon is.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.380]
The moon is.

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.860]
What did I write when censorship there are words in mustard slip?

[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.240]
To truly tell you how I feel.

[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.160]
Parking.

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.420]
Yeah.

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.980]
Parking.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.580]
So.

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.920]
Oh.

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.000]
If you see K.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.580]
If you want to.

[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.580]
I'll see you.

[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.380]
What are you?

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.060]
Now if you see K.

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.220]
Tell her I'm a service day.

[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.380]
And the SBC won't let me sing this song. I will.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.220]
Okay. Now if you see K.

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.500]
Take her hand.

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640]
That after this transmission.

[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.560]
I'll be out in 90 days.

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.980]
Oh.

[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.080]
If you want to.

[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.920]
Then I'll see you.

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.620]
You want to go.

[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.000]
I got to see you.

[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.480]
You want to.

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.860]
Yeah.

[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.220]
Why?

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.980]
It's 103 and 560 W.

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.200]
W.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.260]
W.

[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.360]

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.460]

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.520]

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.740]

[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.880]
W.

[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.360]
W.

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.380]
W.

[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.420]
W.

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.480]
W.

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.680]
W.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.840]

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.840]

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.840]

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.840]

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.840]

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.120]
W.

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.120]

[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.800]
W.

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.560]
How can this be.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.800]
Every day we have this conversation before the show.

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.440]
And I just scratched my head and my ass.

[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.360]
How is it that any company, any group of management people

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.540]
can be this idiotic?

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.020]
If it's anybody, anybody, does it take a genius to figure out?

[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.900]
Whatever it is, give it to them.

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.040]
Get the deal done.

[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.980]
Sign it and stuff.

[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.540]
Drag it.

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.260]
It's not amusing anymore.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.100]
It's embarrassing.

[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.360]
It's humiliating.

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.580]
It's degrading. It's debilitating all the rest of us. The sponsors haven't got any idea who'd help

[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.180]
See this is another reason we've got nothing on the log on this show anyway. I don't know about the rest of the day

[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.820]
We got nothing nothing right?

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.160]
Nothing. Well, that's the nothing.

[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.300]
Well pretty damn close not enough to pay your salary. What does that tell you? Nothing. Not enough to pay josh's salary and

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.060]
Less than nothing and that's because you'd like to got a call a couple of days ago

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.180]
How can you forget that call a sponsor no less and advertise it who likes

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.560]
Who's on the station? But he would like to know what he's buying

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.860]
You know is it just a pig in a poke maybe he's buying the fat boys show

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.120]
Poke the pig don't get me started on fat boy. Why do I Jeff?

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.040]
Hi is the anti Christ. He's the fat anti Christ the end of the world is right deep inside his film balls

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.520]
I'm trying to hurt me. You think the tsunami was bad

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.340]
That's what we start on leashing the torrent

[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.520]
You think those people have died in a month so I had to pay it. Oh, yeah

[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.460]
Start caguring this up in your mind

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.300]
Just a walking piece of elephant dog next fat boy. Let's Jeff. Hi for you

[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.400]
Hi, a pali you idiot you loser loser loser man first of you zero and then loser

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.420]
Anyway, here's a fact from Keith who says and regard to yesterday show which we had a phenomenal response Keith

[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.500]
By the way Keith your full of crap

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.720]
I did mention the monkeys in Josh Gordon's Hill

[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.500]
I'm sure he'll admit it right now is an oversight. He was he was inundated with thousands of theme songs am I right?

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:23.000]
That's right. I was just you know too overloaded he was overloaded man just like fat boy overloaded just like me and Hank in the

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.400]
Moe overloaded with fat all the good old Jews anyway, so it says

[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.040]
Gene you know I can't believe no one put the theme from the monkeys in the pool

[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.140]
This is by far the one or only theme song that everyone recognizes instantly

[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.640]
Well guess what everyone you're full of crap because anybody out of the age of a hundred don't remember the monkeys anyway

[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.120]
Is it the best? Yes the most catchy yes people people give the monkeys their due Hawaii 50 oh please says Keith

[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.380]
Good that in fourteen dollars of my six cups of coffee okay at Tim Hortons or the monkeys my

[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.960]
Here's the winner. I'm yesterday's pool

[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.240]
He has the house for baby Joan

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.620]
Or Peter's

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:28.640]
Solid

[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.020]
Please

[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.360]
Oh!

[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.800]
Too late.

[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.660]
Sorry, he lose.

[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.660]
It's news you lose.

[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.100]
And that was number one without giving the Arunda, which will take another half an hour.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.420]
And number two, right on the ass of that one, is a pretty good battle, and that connect

[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.780]
nose to nose all the way through.

[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.960]
Number two.

[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.040]
Speaking of fact, one.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.060]
Yeah.

[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.500]
No, right.

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.740]
Two of the thing with this thing is, it just doesn't mean anything.

[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.360]
Right.

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.160]
Right.

[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.380]
Part of it.

[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.420]
That's a building.

[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:23.920]
Yeah.

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.660]
It's going to.

[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.360]
I think I ever get to go in with my gun.

[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.220]
It's going.

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.120]
Is there?

[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.820]
There too, Miami Cubs with a hot new beach.

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.360]
There on the streets fighting crime.

[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.040]
They pop at the end of Captain Face Air.

[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.320]
In Allenville, Vice.

[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.700]
We got a problem.

[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.720]
The great game sets the world of tricks.

[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.100]
We can't admit that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.180]
early bird special after seven.

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.880]
Let's go get them.

[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.480]
Stop it, nothing.

[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.020]
Clean up the streets.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.160]
Hey, lady, you can't cross the area.

[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.420]
You'll have to cross in the light.

[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.660]
There, there, there, there, there.

[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.720]
We clean up the smoking business.

[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.780]
All right.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.100]
Just get out of the ass.

[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.340]
Oh, so now you're arresting my wife.

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.100]
Watch the charge.

[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.420]
You can touch it and powder.

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.840]
I'm going to press time.

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.820]
Let's see that wife stuff.

[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.660]
Yeah, just a thought.

[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.800]
She's got over her under bags in here.

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.560]
Of what?

[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.880]
Wait and love.

[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.060]
My restaurant is paying out of the government.

[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:46.060]
Yes, they're coming in, by the cuts of a hot movie in Allenville, Vice.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.240]
We're being disformed on MBC.

[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.800]
Let's talk it off of Clean Sweat, Frawley, Old Farts, and SoundFroader.

[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:52.940]
Right?

[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.800]
They put every deli.

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.960]
They put puppardish out of business.

[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.260]
They put wolfies out of business.

[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.720]
They put anything else.

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.300]
The original corkies out of business.

[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.240]
That made a bit of changing neighborhood situation.

[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.520]
But nevertheless, you know what I mean by changing neighborhoods?

[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.520]
I do.

[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.320]
Good.

[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.980]
And anyway, that's what the old fart stood.

[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.860]
Those were the days, man.

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.400]
The Allenville Sunny Rosenberg stuff.

[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:10.900]
That was good.

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.420]
Good stuff.

[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.860]
Allenville City.

[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.260]
Come on, here.

[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.660]
You want to get a Roger's off the air.

[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.860]
They were going to build a big shield.

[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.520]
They should have talked to Bush and Aldi and the O'Connor's about building a big,

[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.040]
a missile defense, a radio defense shield around Allenville to keep the signal out.

[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.560]
And of course with our signal, you don't need to build any shield.

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.120]
You can just hold up your hand.

[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.640]
Hold up your hand in front of the radio, folks.

[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.500]
That'll block us out.

[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.480]
That's the QAM safety guard.

[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.440]
Just told anything like a piece of onion paper.

[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.180]
What do they call it?

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.840]
Onion skin.

[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.180]

[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:37.800]
Yeah.

[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.740]
Hold your foreskin in front of the speakers.

[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.780]
Here is the poll from yesterday.

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.800]
What's your favorite TV theme of all time from any kind of show?

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.120]
Like I said, Hawaii 5.0.

[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.140]
About two seconds.

[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.260]
That's it.

[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.880]
169 votes.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.640]
Miami Vice.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.720]
136.

[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880]
Pretty good battle all the way through with Hawaii 5.

[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.660]
Oh, finally pull her way in the stretch.

[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.560]
Sanford and Sun 79.

[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.520]
That's pretty interesting.

[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.260]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.800]
Move the fast.

[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.240]
All in the family 56.

[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.860]
Mesh 54.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.260]
Peter Gun 50.

[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.420]
So Prano's 49.

[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.620]
Actually, these votes are pretty, I like the way this came out.

[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.200]
Cheers for cheers 49.

[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.000]
Sorry Tom.

[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.140]
Tom Jekot says cheers.

[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.540]
Maybe in honor of a little Tommy, we could play just a couple of seconds of the theme from cheers.

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.180]
Oh, I hate it.

[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.660]
I hate the theme that I hate to show worse.

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.160]
Which is worse, the theme or the show?

[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.660]
The theme.

[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.860]
Oh, it's not.

[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.960]
I think it's good show, but it's not.

[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.140]
Not here.

[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:38.680]
Suck.

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.280]
Magnum PI 44.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.340]
The Simpson's 33.

[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.620]
The Rockford Files 33.

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.880]
The greatest American hero.

[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.460]
I like that.

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.700]
Joey Scarborough 32.

[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.560]
William Cat.

[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.680]
He was the son of the Jefferson's 31.

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.280]
Well, a lot of people don't know that.

[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.960]
In fact, most people don't know who he is either.

[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.240]
Okay.

[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.320]
Ducca has a 29 with the very pretty John Schneider and all those other, those have to be the worst

[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.040]
characters of any show it's ever been on the air.

[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.780]
Yeah, and the Ducca has it.

[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.900]
I mean, just for days.

[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.200]
Well, what kind of mentality does that appeal to?

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.320]
I guess middle America now, the red states.

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.020]
On a Twilight Zone 27, but Anza 27.

[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.960]
Lauren Green, I'll see you with Michael Aiden, he's dead, Dan Blocker, he's dead, and the

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.660]
other one's dead too.

[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.160]
What was his name?

[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.680]
I'll print out.

[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.240]
I'll rob it.

[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.940]
Well, I don't remember your mind, man.

[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.760]
It's pretty damn good.

[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.460]
But Anza 27, Fish and Impossible 26.

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.140]
That should have been better than that.

[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.060]
Absolutely.

[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.080]
And I outta here, what is with you people?

[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200]
I thought they were doing pretty good.

[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:29.960]
Better than that.

[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.920]
And then I take a look at that.

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.800]
Mission Impossible is way down on the list.

[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:33.760]
Jesus.

[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.700]
Tasting your Tuckish, man.

[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.840]
Just like Greg Green took us to hell on a hand-basket and didn't bring us back.

[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.460]
Nice going, Greg, you idiot.

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.620]
Get man to decide and cut the crap already.

[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.820]
Okay, it's not funny.

[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.880]
It's not on using.

[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.740]
It's disturbing.

[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.060]
It's just stressing.

[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:50.900]
It's idiotic.

[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.500]
It's pathetic.

[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.300]
It's embarrassing.

[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.340]
It is absolutely unacceptable.

[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.860]
Okay.

[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.040]
Jesus.

[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.540]
These people are running a radio station.

[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.140]
Who the hell are they?

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.480]
James Bond and Good Times 23.

[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.500]
Oh, I love that Good Times.

[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.080]
Where is it?

[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.740]
Let me find it.

[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.740]
That's just a Fissue of it.

[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.020]
I don't think it's honest, is it?

[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:08.620]
Oh, thank God.

[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.900]
Isn't that a good break for you, huh?

[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:11.700]
Good times.

[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.220]
I don't know.

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320]
I don't understand it.

[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.260]
I just for the life of me.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.240]
Even Josh thinks it's okay.

[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.880]
And of course, you know, I don't know what you will show.

[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.380]
I hated the theme.

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.520]
I think I was a little kid.

[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.340]
I hated it.

[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.320]
No, you see, I got the other way.

[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.260]
I didn't like to show it all.

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.640]
No, the show was horrible, but I was a little kid.

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.240]
I don't know what you're saying.

[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.000]
I mean, I think J.J. Walker should have played Ray Charles, don't you?

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.600]
The bad can.

[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.220]
No, not me.

[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:29.740]
Yeah.

[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.620]
That would have been great.

[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.480]
I'll finish the rest of the full after we do the break, because we got so many spots today.

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.300]
Nice job by the sales department, by the way.

[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.580]
I got a story about from my teddy bear.

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.360]
What the hell happened to them?

[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.580]
I'm going to start making real,

[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.840]
the normal people that used to be on here or are supposed to be on here or want to be on here.

[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.660]
And art on the year because our crack sales department is too busy with their crack problem, you know what I mean?

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.180]
Rack, yeah.

[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.140]
And that's their crack problem.

[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.300]
Like Oprah had that big crack problem when she was all ballooned up most of her life.

[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.060]
Every time she'd been over she had a big crack problem.

[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.760]
There she's got a little sales department's problem.

[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.460]
I think they're snortin' it.

[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.260]
1013 at 560 WQMU.

[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.300]
Meal.

[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.500]
Yeah.

[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.860]
Would you really better have a farmer?

[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.700]
Stop laughing and we'll be public in commerce.

[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.440]
Oh, for now we won't be able to get any dollar.

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.720]
If the vacuum's in for those prestige.

[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.720]
Yes, wouldn't you really rather have a farmer?

[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:31.580]
We can get away with maybe the vehicle like that, because we're a giant mega-billion dollar corporation with different contracts but for sure we're moving people.

[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.220]
We can move people, we can't tell us like any.

[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.100]
So get out there and find one of these top-of-the-twigs.

[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.740]
Would you really rather have a farmer?

[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.400]
A neo-con farmer not a farmer?

[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.180]
Nothing more impressive than a farmer?

[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.640]
Well, we're public in that big weird.

[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.580]
I wonder if our Prince Harry wants to be a Republican Nazi queer.

[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.020]
What do you think?

[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.880]
We're good to that story.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.340]
I told you, the real name is not whatever it's supposed to be.

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.960]
Windsor or whatever the House of Wind could write.

[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.880]
Their name is Battenberg.

[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.080]
There are a bunch of joymins, man.

[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.840]
The whole royal family, you brits.

[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.000]
You sell your ass brits.

[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.140]
I think the other cent Prince Harry to Auschwitz all write and give them a little shower would be good.

[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.640]
He looks like he could use a shower.

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.520]
No, don't you tire those people, man.

[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.160]
The brits, they did the laundry for tomorrow.

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.040]
I got a pull for tomorrow, but I don't want to sproo it.

[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.780]
I don't want to tip it off because then they'll be combing stuff today.

[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.260]
In the meantime, today is just, here's two names you can put on there to get it started, Josh.

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:24.920]
Okay.

[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.740]
Before I give the rest of the result.

Also, I heard a commercial for the comic Richard Jenny on the stage normally. I don't find him that funny

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.640]
But there's part of the commercial. I like he said something

Chico or Chico was in Chico Marx's name was pronounced like Chico

[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.040]
Even grow up your pronounce that way because his groucho told it

[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.660]
Chico was called that either because he chased the chicks or because he ate a lot of chicken as a teenager

[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.680]
It was originally spelled CHIC K. Oh Chico

And when those three wheel of fortunes came up she didn't know what else she had

[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:49.340]
politicians and Jewish groups reacted with outrage to the photograph in which the 20-year-old royal was seen holding a cigarette and a drink and wearing a

[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.720]
Swastika arm band. Oh

[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.540]
Right, Nazi-filled smoke and drink

[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.380]
Right, that's what you think

[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.620]
You guys you ever saw those pictures of Hitler with a party on the balcony of that

[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.440]
Palace or the way that where the party had he was a panic at a party. They said the

[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.260]
The picture of the third in line to the throne

[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.780]
Yeah, he had to be on the throne all right now to flush his ass down it in Nazi regalia was published on the front page of Thursday's

[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.040]
Sun newspaper in England

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.020]
Clarence house the office of Harry's father Prince Charles, you know the one that likes to Clay Aiken

[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.700]
Issue the statement late Wednesday night in which Harry apologized running off fancy may have caused that's what they see

[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.580]
He of course the Brit way and of course the Canadian way because the Canadians just can't cut that on billiard

[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.920]
Concorde already get that damn queen off the currency

[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.200]
I can understand put the queen on the currency, but not her especially here

[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.420]
Believe you me if any if any city in the world needs a queen on the currency. This is the one

[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.440]
Are there any straight people in Toronto?

[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.860]
Uh, but opposition conservative leader Michael Howard said Harry the younger son of Charles and late princess Diana should apologize in person

[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.740]
I think a lot of people will be disappointed to see that photograph

[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.420]
It'll cause a lot of offense at Howard who happens to be

[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:57.240]
Jewish prince Harry is apologized. I have no doubt that his father and family will have a good deal to say to him in private

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.960]
I think it might be appropriate for him to tell us just how it can try he is now how we're told BVC radio

[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.500]
I think there are various ways in which that can be done

[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.180]
I don't think the precise form it takes matters

[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.140]
But I think it would be appropriate if we heard from him in person about how can try he is

[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:17.380]
Yeah, how can try what a joke the Simon Viesenthal Center worth a largest international Jewish human rights groups

[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.540]
Branded the act shameful and urged the prince to visit Auschwitz death camp to see the full horrors of Nazi media

[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.260]
What let me ask it is what is it going to accomplish for him to go out?

[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:30.320]
That's like telling a clansman the other visit Opalaka. What does that mean right? I don't know

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.240]
Like telling a southern Republican white guy the other visit Liberty City. I mean I ain't gonna accomplish much

[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.420]
I'll give you a chance to lynch his ass anyway turn things around a little bit turn around like a Peter Marshall who stayed turn around his fair play

[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.380]
Remember that no you don't because you never watched the original Hollywood square

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.020]
Well, then how come my name?

[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.640]
Rad by Marvin Hire founder of LA based center the Wiesenthal center called on Harry to accompany his uncle prince Edward

[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.540]
To the Earl of Essex the Earl of Westix the Earl of Weston is what I heard prince Edward. Oh, yeah look out for that girl

[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.040]
To the camp later this month to commemorate these 60th anniversary of the camp's liberation

[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.340]
Yeah, that's all he was doing was having a libation and the celebrating liberation and he ought to get a citation

[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.980]
Well, enjoying it when the triple crown no, in fact

[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.460]
I think citation was last horse before Secretary a 25 years before to win a triple crown in 1948

[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.940]
What a memory man never in being on a show with Hank and Larry King show even he didn't remember that

[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:26.480]
Of course when that fat starts getting up in your neck hammer. That's you know, it's effective your your mental process

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.340]
He's not the pudge enough now these in the morning. Is he what he means?

[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.480]
Well, I think you guys are gonna be like monitoring in there if somebody has got to watch that

[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.520]
Always do it. I know how I know how

[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.500]
Life threatening that is when all that good food starts coming to a one

[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.800]
Whatever that place is if it gets included with huh? I see the how he's boxed out here in the morning

[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.380]
Yeah, well if he's gonna be different in the how he's box you better have the Hank box waiting out there too

[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.300]
Because you're gonna put the man in his grave. Okay. I'm ecstatic to have him on air. It's just great

[00:40:53.300 --> 00:41:00.420]
But uh, why don't we is that interesting to have somebody on the station is a lead in who actually talks about the rest of the station and the you know

[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:07.180]
Is somehow involved with all the rest of us? Yeah, I just mentioned that in passing not a shot at Stern because you know Stern is he's stirring

[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.320]
He's gone. This was a shameful act displaying insensitivity for the victims not just for those soldiers of their own country

[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.240]
You gave their lives to defeat Nazism but to the victims of the holocaust were the principal victims of the Nazis hire said

[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:25.720]
We strongly urge Prince Harry to accompany the British delegation on January 27th to the Auschwitz death camp to commemorate 60 years since liberation

[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.320]
There he will see the results of the hidden symbol so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear and by the way

[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.180]
P.S Prince Harry Cox a hoist that's what he said the Nazis murdered six million Jews and millions of other

[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.380]
Including polls homo-sexuals gay Soviet prisoners and gypsies

[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:45.060]
Millions more were in prison their forced to work his slaves Harry's grandmother the queen is commemorating the 60th anniversary

[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.280]
That day by inviting Nazi death camps survivors and British veterans who freed them to a reception at St James palace St. James palace

[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.660]

Old bags all over the world the Sunset Harry wore the

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.040]
Desert uniform of general urban Rommel's German Africa core to a party in Wiltshire west of London on Saturday

[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.460]
Oh, yeah, Irwin Rommel. He's probably one of Harry's favorites

[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:27.580]
Hermann Gehring Irwin Rommel Joseph Gerbels Dr. Joseph Mangala Rudolph Hess

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:35.220]
He probably buys his gas at his the photoshoes and wearing a swastik armband in the bags of the German vermouth or defense force on his collar the vermouth

Oh, yeah, I apologize. How do you like that? Everybody in a brother like that?

Anyway, the son photo shows him wearing a swastik armband in the bag to the German vermouth on his collar and a statement

[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:38.280]
Harry said I'm very sorry and the oddie oddie oddie home secretary Charles Park told BBC radio the young world had a

[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.160]
Polarge eyes the matter should be left there bull crap bull crap

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.260]
I think you ought to be like cardin feathered

[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:49.200]
I think the other take his ass to Westminster Abby or just a dear Abby. She's dead. She did I don't know

[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.280]
Yes, he is the latest. It's most important for Prime Minister Tony Blair said clearly an error was made

[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.640]
You just kind of like that invasion of Iraq you make a lot of mistakes these days Tony you idiot that has been recognized by

[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.460]
Prince Harry. It's better that this matter is dealt with by fucking impalas. Oh, yeah, so we've got over the carpet

[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.760]
Just sweep that over the carpet. Well, I'll tell you one thing if anybody needs dry concepts. It's that royal family

[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.500]
We did the break in 20 of them. We yeah, okay, I never crossed it off course today

[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:17.000]
We would yeah a lot of difference with it. Yeah, we could like fact what we're gonna be doing now

[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.320]
We'd like to get more we were gonna explain this morning get better rates for the spot

[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.280]
So what we're gonna do is a service to the audience and disservice to all the advertisers out there the new rate on the show is

[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.720]
145 thousand dollars for a 60 second spot. So we're only gonna run like one spot an hour

[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.320]
Would it be great?

[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.600]
Get a lot of show in right by Jonathan Romaine a spokesman for the reform synagogues of great Britain said the fact that the

[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.100]
Palaces issued an apology indicates this was a mistake by the Prince but having been given the apology should now be accepted

[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:52.220]
Right, we do not accept your apology. How do you like that a spokesman for the board of deputies of British Jews echo the words of Romaine saying the

[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:56.680]
Board is pleased that he's apologize for the incident but as ready for an interviewer still by Shalom who's real far

[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.620]
Bison was less than that extent the use of Nazi symbols was intolerable. It was unacceptable

[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.340]
I think anybody who tries to pass it off his bad taste must be made aware that this can encourage others to think that perhaps that

[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.820]
Period was not as bad as we teach the young generation in the free world

[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:17.080]
Reuters quotes shalom is telling reporters. There's that Shalom Shalom to you, Sylvan former press the world press officer Dicky Arbiter

[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.080]
Oh

What's his name the short little British actor?

[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.840]
I heard they all okay

[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:39.740]
Anyway, I gotta bring for it on him. I got that bit that we're playing about him. I do not always do not he's short former

[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.520]
Yeah, he's about it comes up to your waist. He's about two feet tall

[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.620]
Former world press officer Dicky Arbiter who's here to apologize public down radio or TV telling the BBC

[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.940]
It's not just good enough to behave like that

[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.560]
We all know history and at 20. There's no excuse a 20 years old. He's running around the swastika, okay?

[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.760]
Because he's a spoiled miserable rich brat. That's why

[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:03.200]
The whole world family man that'll be like Tarden fed it and then they ought to put them all on a new male Gibson movie

[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.960]
That's what they ought to do stick their ass up on a cross. What do you say? Huh? Let's crucify their ass now

[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.900]
Now there's Frank's back says two for the pool Meredith Faxter Bernie. We find a guy to woman and dated Bernie

It says words to me walk around a podium JJ Walker get him on there right now, okay?

[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.960]
Horrible talk about a one-trick pony and don't not read an actor, but does Donald L. your fire trump sure?

[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.840]
He's a actor on TV now, right?

[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.140]
Yeah, even though he's playing himself. He's on a TV show sure

[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.520]
Okay, talking about orange here in fact

[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.700]
We ought to apologize to David Caruso compared to Trump Caruso's hair is lovely when you agree. Oh, yeah, well

[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:58.000]
David Caruso I don't I don't understand the appeal there. What can you explain that to me? Well, I can't he's a bad actor

[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.840]
He's very bizarre. He looks like a spaceship

[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.220]
He's like the giant ego orange here, but I didn't add he's Dino might oh speaking of JJ Walker Dino

[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:10.660]
Might see how that works. It all just kind of like slides in there together. Yeah, that's what Prince Harry said

[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:17.240]
You talk about Queens and Buck and Ann palace man. I'm gonna tell you right now many years ago when that era that Hank was talking about

[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.540]
That he just knew when I did guests I had one of the chief butlers from Buck and Ann palace on the show

[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.540]
Boy, you talk about a flamer. He was really

Screamer and during the break that was before I got like so, uh, yeah

[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.500]
I'll rage just the Lucrone used to get upset and I said to him I said boy

South Florida because it's all written together. Who's account is this?

Who's who's account didn't even say on here? I don't think about because it's so poorly done

[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.180]
But the words are like written together on here. Our sales department blows

[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.080]

[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.260]
You know that that way you go for the men. I don't go for those

[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:56.660]
So it's not true. I'm gonna be the king of England

[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:01.280]
Yeah, I'm worried about it. Oh, you worry mom

[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.460]

We play games together. I've got to go to have them

[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.740]
Stop crying stop crying

You might mention my name to rights master Gary. Yeah, not a bad idea

[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.080]
It's 1103 at 560 wq. I'm not see the lineup looks like this. We got more Howard David

[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.540]
They don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. I don't know

[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:57.060]
I think it's a little late that his advanced a to get him a sense of humor see the character that Vokabran created the

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:02.680]
humorous mole right? He just isn't in the way. I mean the mole thing. He's finally accepted that

[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.780]
For the mole man, but the rest of it. I don't know how to explain it to him. It's just that's it

[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.220]
But blah blah blah blah that's how he started right? You know, you know, I'm understanding absolutely good

[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:19.140]
Anyway, he'll be all right then we got the mad dog at 4 to 7 if I hear one more time that it's like a filling in

[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.760]
I don't want to hear it. I'm not gonna listen to it. I can't stand that there has got to be some mental illness

[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.880]
That's in fish back in the day before Janet Jackson and Michael Powell had a nervous breakdown of her nipple

[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.960]
They kind of nipped all our good stuff in the blood

[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:39.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 out of a rise. I'm just rambling on and on. I have no idea why I should be really depressed

[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.740]

Bips from the TV shows. I had a name for you for your post today

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:39.420]
Kelly Ripper. Oh Kelly Ripper is a fantastic source not only can't she do anything. She's useless and she's not too good looking either

[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:45.180]
Exactly. I can't stand the side of her anymore. She's like the Jackie Johnson of uh network TV

[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.120]
Thanks a lot, Polly. She's it now she's I should take that back Jackie Johnson's a donkey face kind of like

[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.800]
What's your name again like Amber Fry? Amber Fry. That's it. Well, I mean when you say donkey face, when we need to

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:01.260]
Comes to mind anybody want to watch Amber Fry? Yeah, we can get a two-seater for her and Scott they can be together again

[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:07.020]
She can set on his lap when they pull the switch. Yeah, Kelly Ripper. I don't care what you say. I heard she she's got in fact

[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.720]
I guarantee if you put them side by each you think that AJ

[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:14.640]
Feelie and her are the same person her nose point. Oh, I think there's no points in the other direction. All right

[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:15.840]
WQA and hello

[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:23.880]
Yes, sir. I got a couple. I don't know how they're not already on there. Okay, let's get to them John for voting from welcome back Carter

[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.320]
right and

[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.060]
As far as there's old overall captain Kirk will you be shouting out? But he's pretty good. I'm bossing public

[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.420]
He was good and there was a show about a hundred years ago called medic

[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:40.120]
I don't know if you're old enough to remember that there. I think that was his first TV show where you played a doctor young doctor

[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.980]
And he you're right. He couldn't act then either. Okay. Thanks a lot, Kelly

[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.000]
Weed him shatter, but he's your cans he can belt out a tune

[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.520]
Yeah, if they pay or a land oh man soos priest and bishops charging negligence and sex abuse

[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:58.820]
I think you just keep making these things up. I write them myself an attorney for the Orlando man accusing your Catholic priest of years

[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.140]
Of sexual abuse by the law so years today against the priest and two bishops

[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:07.960]
I wonder if one of who was Ann including leader of the diocese of Orlando the suit says the Reverend Richard Emerson

[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.080]
sexually abused the man during a seven-year period in the late 1980s early 90s

[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.700]
I wonder if he's keen to Ralph Waldo Emerson you think no or maybe he's the guy that invented those Emerson radios like that

[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:22.360]
White radio I had when I was a kid it also names Orlando Bishop Thomas Wensky and Gary Indiana Bishop Dale

[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:29.940]
This is a bad copy is that Melchick as defendants says the diocese took no action when they were there complaints from it against Emerson

[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:34.120]
Attorney Joe Saunders described as a 29 year old Orlando man who works in a local hotel

[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:40.480]
Saunders said the man chose not to attend a news conference in front of the Orange County Courthouse because of his anxiety about suing a priest and two bishops

[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.180]
Emerson a priest in the gay of the Gary diocese served in three central Florida churches between

[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.700]
1987 and 91 including St. Charles Vodarmale Catholic Church in Orlando

[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.140]
Barol Mio. I don't know what that is whereas accuser was a student and personer

[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:59.700]
We hope that this lawsuit will protect children Saunders said the lawsuit claims that Emerson was removed from his Indian Church and placed on administrative leave in December

[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.700]
Allegedly used alcohol and pornography to lure the man into a sexual relationship. It sounds like a

[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:10.920]
Michael Jackson of the Claw to lure the man into a sexual relationship that started in Orlando when he was about 11 years old

[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.940]
But continued after Emerson returned in the enemy brought the boy on trips

[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.300]
It alleges that both diocese received other complaints about Emerson without taking action

[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:25.280]
Sister Lucy Vesquez who's writing in the fourth race at Gulfstream the Orlando diocese victim assistant's coordinator wrote in an email

[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.820]
Response to a report his questions that a family going through divorce and complaint that Emerson was interfering in alienating family members

[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.780]
But there was no obligation to sex abuse and they knew nothing. We didn't know nothing. That's what they always say

[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.200]
We didn't know not and right just like cardinal law. We didn't know not

[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.240]
He's another one. They have a string his ass up there right along with Prince Harry. What do you say good?

[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.860]
Crucify him right there in the right in the front of fangirl hall

[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:52.600]
And then after we'll go across the street to Quincy Market, get some wood chowda and clam strips as that sound. Okay. You'd love the food in Boston man

[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.000]
Yowda

[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:58.420]
Wow, wow, wow. That is a place where the food. I would say the best to my New York

[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.580]
There's no place in the country compared to New York, but after New York

[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:06.820]
I would say Boston and Chicago and then they say San Francisco, but I can't stand San Francisco

[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.640]
So everybody stayed there long enough to eat you're just a little queen there. I'm just it's not my kind of place

[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.220]
but

[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.840]
Chicago and Boston man, oh man. I would say reopen Prince spaghetti house

[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.620]
WQA and hello. Can I shoot good WQA and hello

[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:33.540]
Hey, how are you pretty good? Good. Hey, um, I know you know a big Danny. I love fan. I'm obviously, but obviously he was in one very very good movie that I really love called

[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:40.200]
29th Street. Yeah, it was an absolutely awesome movie. It was a true story about the guy who won the first New York State lottery

[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.980]
Uh-huh. It was really good. I mean you should check it out

[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.640]
I said they must have a stunt actor doing his part because I

[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.420]
He's just gonna act a lick. Yeah, he played the father

[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.460]
I mean I'm telling you the absolute phenomenal phenomenal movie. Yeah, and you know

[00:57:54.460 --> 00:58:01.440]
With all the polls and everything I thought either Monday or Tuesday's poll. I thought Jess McKay was gonna win one of those

[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:03.600]
Okay

[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:10.180]
See ya see ya. What do you used to say? See ya buddy. See ya. No, I buddy. See ya

[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:14.940]
See ya, paly. Yeah, we'll combine him with the fat stuff. By the way fat stuff. I'm gonna tell you right now

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:19.040]
I'm gonna like go on a warpath. I'm sick and tired of it because you're such a wimp. Yeah

[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:24.720]
Well

[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.500]
But definitely the only reason you're here is because I like you and I want you here

[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.000]
And I made a very good that they rather be in there because he didn't such a fine

[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.400]
Fat job, you know, filling it. He is like a vulture man

[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.480]
I wouldn't trust him as far as you can throw his fat ass

[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.980]
He's just a vulture and keep in mind that him and your program director are real real tight

[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.660]
You know

[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.800]
God paid you

[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.200]
She's not too bad

[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.760]
Senna's okay

[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.140]
When you get in bed with her

[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.380]
The minute you find she's cold when you're hot

[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:16.520]
Then you can start to dump her for someone better

[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.940]
And when your relationship with them

[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.740]
Made you begin

[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:32.580]
You know for someone who slightly older

[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.320]
5-11

[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.520]
But turn him back

[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.860]
And be bold if you win

[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.740]
The sexist man can go hunting

[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:47.380]
You might find someone with bigger

[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.240]
Bolder

[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.260]
Hey dude

[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.840]
Merry life get sad

[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.060]
Take the end

[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.200]
Why should like people matter

[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.580]
The minute you hit the nagging dog

[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.540]
Then break the pop

[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.120]
And sign your divorce paper

[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.040]
5-11 my ass or you can mean it must be on stills

[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.900]
Of several lies

[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.380]
So why would you get that propaganda?

[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.780]
Several websites have his vitals to tell you

[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.340]
Well, let me just take one thing about you law

[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.840]
Oh, he's a little jai kai in the funny look

[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.200]
Yeah, maybe he just does movies with tall people all the time

[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.020]
Is that what it is?

[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.080]
I don't know but I've seen him on interviews

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.000]
And maybe he was like crouching down or something

[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.040]
Maybe he had gone his knees

[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.600]
Of course he was having Mr Ripley that would have been good

[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.940]
He let that thing and down

[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.340]
You got to see that movie I'll say it too

[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:54.880]
I'll see it

[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.460]
No you won

[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.620]
Oh if you said it to me especially

[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.220]
I will say to you now that I got that FedEx thing

[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.180]
Let's see L&D Generate that's good

[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.720]
He's been a lot of polls

[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.920]
And John Johnson

[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.160]
And that's the movie

[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.560]
I never understood that

[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.900]
Although he was good in the boy and his dog

[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.140]
He was very good in the boy and his dog

[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.380]
With Jason Robards

[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:13.980]
When I was a great movie

[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.620]
That movie reminded me of the prisoner

[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.220]
Right

[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.120]
That same kind of setting you know

[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.880]
That same uh

She's uh she's an embarrassment

[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.580]

I get to say she's kind of like a bitchie guy

[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.440]
I don't know I could be wrong

[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.780]
She might be very pleasant and very nice

[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.560]
She's no rosy

[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.440]

[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:28.500]

[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.240]
We could put her on there too if you want

[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.380]
Oh she's not really an actress

[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.880]
See I think she's only done the movies

[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.440]
And the only TV she did was that

[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.080]
Sure that awful awful talk show that uh just just the most desperate fat

[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.100]
Shut-in-broad from coast to coast for watching that piece of crap only

[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.620]
Because they felt better about themselves after seeing her

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.680]
Can you imagine any other reason for watching her?

[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.080]
No

[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.400]
Tendative deal on slot machines could bring

[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.100]
Dade County $10 million a year

[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:52.960]

[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.980]
About 30 man

[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.900]
30 year agreement yesterday that calls for a four million dollar upfront payment to the county

[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.180]
That would in effect offset the cost of a referendum on Las Vegas style slot machines

[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.580]
And he presented gross revenues that can be worth up to $10 million a year voters approve

[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:13.940]
Which they will the proposed agreement which much passed the county commission vote next Thursday to set up a March

[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.640]
Eighth referendum

[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.580]
It also means as much as 300 million dollars

[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.040]
Ain't really the state's public school system official said

[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.840]
The needle would permit up to 6500 Las Vegas style slot machines at flagry greyhound track

People will be coming in from all over the place to play

[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:37.140]
State voters in November, probably know that the amendment of our state legislators to set such rules as how many machines are permitted

[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:42.860]
Who operates them but both counties are moving ahead with agreements with to establish rules before the referendum votes are held

[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.260]
In a two-page memo yesterday county manager George Birgis pointed out the commission chairman Joe Martinez

[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.660]
Several negative aspects of bringing gambling to the community. Well, you know something

[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.560]
This the voters have already spoken right on this issue

[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.860]
So the idea that we got people like Jim Noggle and you know that born again and for Lauderdale mayor and Broward

[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.760]
And this goofball and they it's pointless

[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.140]
Bernie still knows that he sees the proposal is away for the struggling

[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.940]
Permitials to supplement their correctivities make themselves a destination point. He called them Rossino's

[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.620]
It's tasteless. It's the same. I keep telling you about certain other things without any accoutrements

Trump suits and they'd become partner with seven old hard rock casinos speaking of slots

[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:41.600]
I kind of separated these stories which is my bad. Sorry, but hey, we got a heavy duty spot load there today

And you're gonna get screwed

[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:05.060]
Donald Trump has found the lawsuit against the Baltimore based courtish company and its partners in the seminal hard rock casino project

[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.940]
claiming the developers fraudulently represented themselves as Trump associates to land a liquid of deal with the trap

[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.140]
You know, I don't know what's going on with these Indians man

[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.880]
I don't want to suggest that he's telling the truth

[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.700]
Man, I'm getting really a sick entire between the cigarettes with a holes in them and that whole v-fold business

[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:24.520]
And then of course trying to like put all that propaganda under about slot machines are gonna like destroy tourism

[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.620]
And they're bad for the community and then the meantime all they want to do is grab up all the business for themselves

[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:33.020]
You you know, and in this business about oh well, you know chief thunder thought whatever his name is there

[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:38.220]
Oh, well the Indian man has been getting a screw about a white man ever since so they came to this country and we got to protect ourselves

[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.060]
Yeah, right

[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.000]
The nice if the white man got a little slice of the action okay

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.180]
That's what we need the money for as opposed to just to let no new people sit around smoking your peace pipe

[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.780]
Whatever you're smoking at peyote

[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.360]
Ever see a coyote smoke peyote love

[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.900]
Trump spent three years and great expense tried to negotiate a casino development deal with the seminal travel

[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.100]
Was told by former confidant Richard T. Fields that such a deal would not be possible according to the lawsuit

[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.620]
Then the lawsuit led just field

[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.940]
Left Trump's organization and formed a partnership with quarters company officials

[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:10.880]
David as courtesan Joseph Weinberg who conspired to mislead the seminal trial by agreeing the impression that Trump was still behind the reference

[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.460]
aha

[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:18.220]
The courtesh team and negotiated contracts to build hard rock hotel and casino complexes on seminal reservations in Tampa and Hollywood

[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.160]
That are estimated during the developers 1.3 billion dollars over the next decade

[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.880]
But evidently that's not enough. They want it all they want more

[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.100]
Court issue was out of the country yesterday issued a statement denying the claims and lawsuit as a ludicrous work of fiction

[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.220]
And said that the suit have been filed in the name of a Trump company that is literally in bankruptcy

[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.700]
Trump's hotel and casino company which includes three resorts in Atlantic City and casino operations in Indiana, California

[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:43.800]
File for bankruptcy. We are in the station in November and anybody whoever's in charge in them

[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.060]
Casino is like kind of board of directors should look him right in the eye and say you're fired to did

[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.420]
Donald you're fired to did

[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:53.660]
Trump was busy planning his third wedding later this month's Slovenian model millennia crowd in house

[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:58.600]
They're trying to comment and analysis by the Sun based on public documents and marketing studies of the two

[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.800]
Casinos estimated that the quarters team can expect to be paid about 120 million by the seminal travel the first year of the project

[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.980]
With revenues increasing annually and totaling more than 1.3 billion after 10 years

[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.840]
How do you like that?

[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.760]
The engines always in the middle of some kind of a contract. I'm seeing that for D. Fo man

[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:21.100]
Yeah, that was anybody wonders why we didn't put D. Fo one from two to four because he insisted the poly man

[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:26.280]
And they've gurgled he had to be on with them. Who was that it? Huh? Was that it? Yeah, that was the deal

[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.180]
Plus they had to do it from the Indians

[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.820]
Let's see my voters for Don knots. Oh come on

[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.280]

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.460]
Okay, it was on the Steve Allen show back in the glory

[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.600]

And then it says three company Andy Griffith. Well, what is that he's he's

[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.660]
I'm not sure yeah, well, he's supposed to be like a Yahoo

[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:56.820]
He was a good Yahoo as opposed to Andy Griffith. We have Andy Griffith. I didn't think had act

[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.400]
That was in it what you saw is really in that matte lot thing when you mentioned that yesterday

[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.060]
Just about lost the Sunday's lunch

[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.760]

[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.840]
Lucky the blood didn't come from my father because he was a cold humorless fish

[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.580]
I mean he was as cold as a block of ice

[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.200]
You know who knows what he was doing outside the house what now I'm not talking about that

[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.020]
I'm just talking about his whole ambiolicy and certainly a wit was

[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:38.880]
Wit was not us in his case and my mother well

[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.580]

He sure he's got a pretty mouth, but he could act as loud of a paper sack

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.060]
And then that's screamer. They got on that 70 show. Wow. Yeah, what is history?

[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:54.340]

Looks like I like your people directly brown. I just think okay. Okay. Okay. So he's main con always Chicano. Whatever he is

[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.460]
Maybe Chicano from Chicago

[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.500]
Like your buddy Miguel from Chicago. What was that awful thing that Miguel came up with yesterday that theme that nobody ever heard her before?

[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.980]
I forgot high school. See you forgot high school reunion. Yeah. What is that?

[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.700]
It's one of these reality-ish shows. Yeah reality-ish like real life-ish. Yeah

[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.960]
Well, I never saw the show so I couldn't tell you about the theme, but it's sir. Did they even get any votes? No

[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:24.560]
No

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:32.580]
A British Airways flight with 239 passengers flying from London's Heathrow Airport to New York was turned around a mid flight after a passenger flying on a French passport

[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.700]
Was found to be on the US no fly list

[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:38.240]
US government sources said the pastor was placed on the no fly list in late December

[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.280]
But that British Airways did not have the latest no fly list in a statement

[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.700]
British Airways said the pastor on Wednesday's flight was a man. Well there you go

[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.300]
That narrow is it down officials to try to identify him or say why he was on the list

[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.940]
Which contains the names of suspected terrorists and those who helped them

[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.240]
It was also unclear why British Airways did not have the latest no fly list

[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.440]
But US and that's because they too busy running around with Nazi R bands on that's what's wrong with a Brit

[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.900]
So okay to give me the schmitz prince Harry your dude you're done. You're done

[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.140]
We're gonna send the foxes the hound's are gonna go after you man. You bask your will

[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.340]
It was also unclear what didn't have the list but US government official tools see it in the myth of it

[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:14.260]
Distributing list changed recently and may result it in the laughs. Oh, I sure hope the terrorists are listening to that

[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:18.340]
A call to the airline was not immediately returned. They were too busy on the way to Auschwitz

[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:24.460]
Flight 170 for probably to have a party flight 175 landed the Baton Bergs my ass. Can you believe that the Baton Bergs?

[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.200]
I believe it. I think everybody ought to go on television right

[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:32.800]
First chance to get a newspapers on radio TV and announce to the world that the royal family are a bunch of frauds

[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.420]
There are a bunch of Nazi bastards is what they are okay the Baton Bergs

[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:40.440]
What was the allured lord Mountbaton? Was that his name? I guess I forget

[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.120]
You know what they're thinking the chain there. He was in the daisy chain somewhere. If you ask me

[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.200]
They were all like bending over that whole royal family

[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.760]
At least to find I guess these to find shillings and pence and coins on the ground

[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:57.360]
They're always in that bent over position the royal family flight 175 landed back in London without incident

[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.620]
And the pastor was taken in the custody by Metropolitan police dearline said police said they questioned released the man 840 pm

[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:08.860]
A US government official said the man's name was on the list because of a potential affiliation with no one terrorist that were working out of Morocco

[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.360]
Oh don't trust those people from Morocco man. They are an Algeria

[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.660]
He was not under investigation for carrying out any terrorist act

[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.600]
They said nor was the man born in France. That was carrying a legitimate French passport in the US

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.460]
TSA official said federal authorities asked British Airways that I've heard they're playing to bang or main

[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.600]
If you like your bang or main after the positive match was discovered British Airways opted instead of returning to Heathrow

[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.040]
Official said there was never threat to the airplane the statement said well there you go

[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.620]
The only threat was you might land in England

[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.180]
On 560

[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.980]
Here's a little number I wrote the other day while not duck hunting with a judge

[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:52.520]

Clear channels appear channel so how it's done must go

[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.780]
A term a general astronaut doesn't like strong words and so

[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:24.540]
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rushly mo

[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.140]
So

[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.720]
So you very much the mr. Bush

[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.180]
For your rowy curly sitting on your tush

[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.400]
For halibut and n-ron all the companies

[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:47.620]
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail. She's an uppity rich rich and at least she isn't

[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]
So you are so very much

[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.260]
So you take

[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:58.840]
You and everything you do

[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.220]
Your pace maker must be a fake you haven't got a mark

[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:07.420]
As far as I'm concerned you're just a face to face all phone

[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.340]
And as per con the leaves the she's a intellectual

[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:13.780]
So you won't show very much

[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.820]
So you very much

[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.800]
For giving all the laskers oil away

[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.580]
It really is a bummer when I can't film my hammer

[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.320]
He owes us and now goes on now that Arnold's here to say

[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.000]
The nuclear inter game are going to take place in LA

[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.580]
So you also very much

[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.040]
So what the planet fails

[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040]
Let's say the great white males

[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.840]
You also very much

[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.740]
It's 1145 speaking of Arnold by the way whose was it his father his grandfather was an aunt's yet

[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.860]
He was his father wasn't it sure. Let's say it was his father maybe he can go there and hang out at Auschwitz with Prince Harry in a whole

[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.040]
World clan they get a party. Yeah, they have a big

[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.160]
I'm not see party there

[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:06.660]
No way they call it the Nazi party. Oh, and less moonbes the SCOO of CBS

[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:11.300]
Who's you know got that egg on his face now where it was fired employees and then rather getting shoved out

[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.340]
I got good news for him because on radio and records. There's a story. I just found here

[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:19.260]
It says via comment executive says expectations for radio must be lowered

[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:24.300]
Well, less I got good news for it because here at QAM our manager is working feverishly to live up to your standard

[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.440]
Isn't that great? That's great. So he ought to be very proud of us

[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.380]
That's right. It's for radio must be lowered several notches

[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.380]
Vernon who obviously he's got serious problems with his boyfriend

[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:39.040]
Uh, it says my two elections to the pull are the reason I say this because it's just a little of gay

[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.200]
You know bobby is gay and Adam is gay and Vernon you're the one I think is really

[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:49.180]
It says my two elections to the poor are mr. T from the 18 which is fine now did he die or not?

[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:53.060]
I know he had AIDS no, he's running. I saw him on like that religious channel

[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.260]
Oh, I got religion on it. That's so what happens first name

[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.640]
And then okay, and then it says this is really amusing because it says Hulk Hogan is Hulk Hogan an actor?

[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:11.240]
Yeah, he's on shows he acts Hulk Hulk Hogan no, no, it says some corny maybe seals show from the 80s that sucked

[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.980]
Yeah, he was on it Hulk Hogan. That was his name. That's the name he uses

[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.880]
That's his special hug. Hulk Hogan was the actor on that stand ever watch that show. I never watched it

[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.600]
But I know he was on one some boat show. Yeah

[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.060]
Oh, cool. I see I've read you water even noon and I learned something really dramatic today

[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.120]
beside the fact that Jeff Hyzen piece of crap

[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:33.000]
A walking mound of elephant excrement

[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.400]
56705 60 pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless lines. We did do that break your 20 of them

[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.940]
I don't know what it is. See I guess it's because I feel so hopped up or something

[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.480]
But I keep coming across these usually it's the other way around across the breaks out ahead of time

[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.200]
I get ahead of myself

[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.440]
But now I'm having such a great time. I'm like I don't know what that's all about. See my deal is done

[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.660]
Okay, with a lot of grief a lot of aggravation a lot of angst a lot of unnecessary

[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.900]
agitation and manipulation and palpitation

[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.040]
destroying I think I should take off another week right now you're on you. Oh

[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.180]
No, seriously. I didn't have a vacation

[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:12.920]
I know and that's supposed to be the nice long extended you know starting with all those holidays you get to bonus days and your Christmas and New Years and Christmas

[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.220]
Even New Years even whatever

[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.180]
Um, whatever those are

[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:23.940]
Thanks to Greg and Joyce and who's the other man Carolyn Beasley man. Hi, they case. I wouldn't wish it on the Prince Harry

[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:28.160]
That's how bad it was that series with whole Cogan was called thunder and paradise. Oh

[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.800]
Oh, you know what the problem is I'm confused because of the themes we did yesterday

[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.040]
I'm thinking of Hogan's heroes. Oh, that's why I got all confused excuse me

[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.880]
Hey listen if I if you can be I think that the Jude Law is seven foot two

[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.640]
Pretty soon you'll have none in the NBA we plan for the heat. Have we team it up with

[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.320]
Before the show is over he's seven foot five is a monster. I mean, he's pretty good actor though

[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:54.760]
And I'm still the thing that universe uh, and I remember Abba. Abba remember Abba

[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.880]
Yeah, now they were Swedish and they didn't speak English

[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.980]
What are that for the most part in the beginning certainly? I think they ended up all of their records

[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:06.340]
Of course they sang in English released that's a we heard English French and Spanish among others

[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.780]
Were you getting can I get to the point all right?

[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.460]
That's important and the same with Jude Law he speaks with a very heavy British accent

[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.200]
You hear him like an interview or something?

[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:18.380]
But in movies like in the town that mr. Ripley he didn't have like the slightest

[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:23.400]
None right. How do you do that? He's an actor. Oh, I see that with a call it

[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.540]
That's what they call it. That's what he calls it that would be like George W again up there and speaking like an intelligent human being

[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:31.240]
I mean, how do I do that? I guess nobody can act that good

[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.540]
W.A. Q.A. and hello

[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.320]
Yes, sir. Hey, mr. Keated have eight cancer. Oh, excuse me. I'm pretty the fool. I have

[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.940]
I think you're wrong. I think you didn't have eight. I'm pretty sure you look it up. Huh? I don't think he had eight

[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:50.040]
I'm telling you if I'm telling you I'm smelling you okay right now. I think he had something

[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.780]
What do you think the eight team what is it that stood for?

[01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.860]
W W Q a Q a M hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Did anybody I'm calling yesterday with uh, no?

[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.380]
Are you doing the themes again? Yeah, go ahead. I don't care. We don't listen. We're laid back. We don't

[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:11.540]
have our dear eyes, Georgia's secure and spread the fact they hit him like poison and they want to give the beast

[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.880]
Is your eye because the beast is doing clearance? Did anybody call him with bread? Yes, today. Yeah, they did

[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.260]
They said but don't do the crime if you can't do the time. That's what they said

[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.800]
Yeah, all right. Thank you. And then we had to dump the car because he said something about

[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.420]
Robert Blake's cockatoo

[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.660]
567 is never what it was

[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.280]
That's what it was okay

[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.520]
567 O5 60 pound 5 60 under Verizon and sing it over us lines as we're looking for the if you join the smith stream

[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.460]
And you missed one hell of a show in the first hour

[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:42.980]
We reveal all kinds of interesting stuff. I don't remember what it was, but it was great about the engines and stuff

[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.900]
And then I learned about Hulk Hogan. Yeah, now I know Hulk Hogan

[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.460]
See I had that Hogan's heroes thing on my mind because it was such a bad all of those shows like mash

[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:55.200]
I know mash is very popular in all these people watched the last episode because it was hyped listen in America

[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.440]
You can hype anything anything look at freaking McDonald's for Christ sakes

[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.780]
There is nothing if you use the right approach man. You can hype and look at sure herbal life

[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:09.720]
Even though that guy is still dead. How do products prime apart look at Ron Popeel with his pocket the fisherman thing there

[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.820]
Right, right? How it's done?

[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:17.500]
Now see now just because he's out on a stage now just keep I like you to keep one thing in mind. Okay, not that we're gonna suck up

[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.300]
But it's still very possible that the serious people if they're serious and if they're smart

[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:27.360]
They could pick the show off just like XM has picked up oprian Anthony does that mean I have to pretend to like the show with that

[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.020]
No, you don't have to pretend like the show, but don't do these gratuitous riffs of stir just because it's show enough for us

[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:36.820]
And we didn't like it. But it's very appropriate to the subject we were to say what was that a hype things that are all

[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.700]
Haven't I said that Howard is the master of hype no matter what else you say about him

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.040]
You're the like him you dislike him. You hate his show or like his show

[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.980]
There is nobody in the history of mankind

[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:50.580]
I don't think it was ever at least in the broadcasting industry was ever a master at hyping everything

[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:56.260]
He goes on letterman he there he has a press conference out in front of the studio there's handing out serious radios

[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.200]
I mean he just that's his thing man

[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.220]
He's not the king of all media is the king of hype right and that's not a knock

[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.320]
That's a compliment. I believe me if there's anything

[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.540]
I'm jealous of he said the 30 million years making and the 50 million is gonna be 100 whatever he's making with them

[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:15.400]
It's that work on this stage. I mean the only reason we got any press out of this my signing that deal at extension is because

[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.260]
In orma can't he sent out the press or I mean I realized that's awfully difficult

[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.040]
You know sent out a press release to about 20 or 30 different media outlets that probably took him about 10 minutes

[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.860]
I mean when Norma can get something done these people can't what does that tell you because we all know about her

[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:34.460]
He's too busy doing all those old sad sorry runaway tricks of his but in between he took him inside of his busy day

[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:37.840]
I mean he did that and we got a whole lot of press out of it which was fine, you know

[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:42.040]
But not this outfit. Oh, you got those billboards. What do you know what now? Let me ask you this

[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.200]
I'm glad I stick weight in that. What's the story with the billboards? They're still there

[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.820]
There's still there to want to say following Howard Stern in a morning. I see them every day

[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.360]
We don't now and again. I want to make it very clear yesterday

[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.780]
We had another little problem there at the end of the show it's not my fault. No, not my fault. Here's the new legal ID

[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:06.420]
440560 WQ. Oh, yeah, Miami Fort Lauderdale. So it doesn't say Howard Stern in a morning. Yeah, yeah

[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:11.040]
That that's just being disorganized and late and by the way some of the stuff you sent me clearance

[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.920]
I wouldn't wish on Prince Harry boy

[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:18.660]
He sent me a CD of this that's got some of the most distorted idiotic crap and then that one about

[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:24.140]
What's the one about the hammer? What does that thing say? Oh, I forget but it's pretty much like I'm talking about it

[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.460]
It's trying to be cute. Oh god and the guy that does our all of our production for the station is usually very good

[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:33.800]
So you can be sure he didn't have a hammer. Oh, yeah, if I had a hammer. Oh god

[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:42.100]
Family of break if you had a hammer you'd bust that CD into a million pieces and then probably a tackled over it was responsible for right in that crap clearance

[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.820]
Boy, it's such a you know why I'm such a good move because I don't have to be there

[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:50.640]
I just I just don't know how that place continues with all these two faced

[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:56.540]
Fony baloney back stabbing knife wielding assassins running around you know and you're the victim of a lot of them there

[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:02.000]
They're like the Gary Sarner Maddie Bells in fat boys in the world who and clearance who you think is your buddy clearance

[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.960]
Don't be a sin. In fact, I'll tell you one thing next Christmas or holiday. How do you want to your scenes gets with him?

[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.440]
Give him some arsenic and all these without the old lace. Okay. How's that? Okay. I'll buy it for you WQM. Hello

[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.680]
WQM. Hello. Neil yesterday show was with Trina

[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.300]
WQM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I want you to kneel. Skigging

[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:33.300]
You know Rogers. No kneel down. Oh, what do you got pali? Yeah, I want to tell about a theme song you wanted to put on the

[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.200]
folder

[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:42.840]
You know who you think this is who you're speaking to ask what who also would be such an idiot is to say kneel down. Who asked

[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:46.300]
Could this be come on? No, I don't it's me Neil Rogers

[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.800]
The old house

[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.260]
What's the theme since that was yesterday's pull anyway. What was it?

[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:59.660]
Uh theme songs. Yeah, maybe we'll do it all over again. What which one was it? Oh, you missed the best one. The better the deal building. Neil

[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:06.860]
Got it at the let's see Beverly Hills. We did I go. I bet I got it. I hate. Well, did I hate that show you never watched it?

[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:12.360]
They already visited it. I seen it. Listen. There's no show back because that was on how we didn't have like people

[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:18.640]
Everybody they didn't have a man and a man and a man and a man and a man. Where is it? You got it? No, that was one of our bits

[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.460]
Well, where the hell is Beverly Hills? Oh, don't tell me like it like make us search through this whole thing to find it really isn't worth it

[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.400]
I'm sure most of the audience would say oh please they'd rather hear

[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:44.760]
I

[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.740]
Just come to conclusion you ain't got no soul man. That's just a great theme song. I don't get it

[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:55.340]
I think it's a racial thing. I probably I mean the show sucked. There's no question about that. It was a horrible show

[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:04.520]
I don't like you know if I have to see him one more time. Oh, you got Beverly Hills. I get a whole album over here. Oh, yeah, I don't know

It's embarrassing that I'm here today to be caught up in a situation like this. He said on there you go

[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.480]
I think the whole thing is probably a publicity stunt to butcher up his image after you've been like a scene these terrible things about him

[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.660]
Yeah, I think so shame on him. Oh, and the British boy band busted are going their separate ways

[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:14.100]
The raw table of company said yesterday, and that's one of our fine sponsors

[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.680]
I believe I wonder what Adam's doing with that account. I sure hope he didn't blow them out of the water

[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.980]
They've been out with me on this show for how many years now?

[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:25.220]
Yeah, our sales department man they're a wall they're like Bush and Cheney were during Vietnam

[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:28.660]
They're a wall. They're nowhere to be found. They're like doing the old Greg Reed

[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:33.640]
Heiden Seek deal mostly Heiden and we're seeking we're seeking some answers, okay?

[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:38.780]
Adam, see this is what happens when you got a bunch of guys they all hang out together back in the room and what they do is

[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:43.540]
You know, they they all plant the seeds. They well, this is what we're just gonna avoid doing with yeah, they just

[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.000]
Hide they don't make an appearance

[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:52.920]
The Vermont teddy bear companies they'd yesterday would continue selling its straight jacket and crazy for you bear through valentines day

[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.160]
Despite protests from mental health advocates

[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:00.400]
We recognize that this is a sensitive human issue and sincerely apologize if we've offended anyone a company

[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.220]
Said in the statement that was certainly not our intent the bear was created in the spirit of Alan Pines

[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:10.360]
Day was all our beers was designed to be a lighthearted depiction of the sentiment of love and added the bear being marketed for valentines day

[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:13.380]
Comes with commitment papers and is meant to convey out of control love

[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:18.940]
Metal health advocates believe the bear is a tasteless use of marketing that stigmatizes persons with mental illness

[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:24.880]
Jerry Gossel the executive director to march after the national lines for the mental ill wrote to the Shelburne based company

[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.360]
A straight jacket is not as simple as we want to associate with sales of a teddy bear for loved ones over valentines

[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.120]
They Gossel said and the use of commitment papers legal documents committing an individual to a voluntary treatment is not something to be taken

[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:40.600]
Casually, I think we got have this guy Baker acted talk about a guy with no sense of humor all these people from all these

[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:46.480]
Organizations in all the pet of people in this guy the answer to the $70 bear be pulled from the company shows

[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.680]
Gossel said he has support for removal of the bear from other mental health advocates

[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.360]
The company said it would discontinue the bear but not before valentines day February 14

[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:58.420]
This bear was developed just for valentines day is not a permanent edition of our product line the company statement said

[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.540]
The bear will remain in offering for valentines day and that's it you go by boys guys

[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:08.000]
The complaint is the first to see about the company about the bear which began selling the 15 inch creature days ago

[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:12.920]
Always something to do in a wood pile out there. We don't like this. We don't like that. We know what my new business

[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.700]
So what's wrong with stigmatizing the mentally old their day? I know

[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:20.580]
Is there a lot of challenge we have many mentally challenged people working at QAM right?

[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.520]
Well in fact, I would say that a lot of people would think I'm probably mentally challenged for resigning with these people

[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.080]
Which I think they probably have a good point

[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:33.400]
WQAM. Hello. Hey, pal. How are you today? Okay, palmy hey listen

protesters plant a mark bush inauguration speaking about rages people like the a rural family and our rural family

[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:17.640]
The bushmeisters which include of course your fat ass governor Jeb

[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.000]
protesters from arch to Washington staged a die in across from the White House and turned their backs on President George W

[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.060]
Bush's limousine during his inaugural celebration next week organizers be saying yes today

[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:32.340]
In fact, that's a great t-shirt. I'm seeing there it says turn your back on bush click here for the inauguration day action

[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:39.620]
And of course the guy standing with his back to the camera as U.S. authorities prepared unprecedented security for the January 20th event

[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:41.480]
I wish by the way they're gonna blow 50 million bucks

[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.080]
Organizers said thousands of protesters will stage a noisy counterpoint to the leverage here

[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.640]
It says 40 but it's 50 million dollar celebration one group of anti-war activists said it would cure a thousand

[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:56.660]
coffins to the White House and stage a die in to protest the lives lost in Iraq. They're gonna be in the coffins yell and

[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:02.560]
Another group said it obtained a permit to protest along the two hundred foot section of the parade route

[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.580]
But planned to sue for more access to the large sections of Pennsylvania Avenue

[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:10.260]
Set aside for bush supporters the Bush administration and conjunction with the National Park Service is rather

[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:16.100]
Stage managed democracy said Mara Vera Hyden Hillard a lawyer for the anti-war group international answer

[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:20.380]
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Secret Service which is overseeing security for the event they're trying to meet you comment

They were too busy interviewing Michael Moore process street when I want what embassy was that Chinese wasn't I don't know now

[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:29.360]

Damn it. I don't know who's back to stand there must have been in U.S. authorities planted with all thousands of police troops and bombs to pick dogs in the first and

[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.240]
Auger events since the September 11th 2001 attacks

[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.460]
Spectators will pass through metal detectors before attending any inaugural events or watching the parade from the street

[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:48.720]
Organizers said the protest would express opposition to a range of bush policies from nowhere in Iraq to economic programs

[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.040]
That's the war in I

[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.640]
Or fake I just can't do that the war and I

[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:59.400]
Rock there it is we're facing the right way in future that has no sympathy for the concerns of black people in the poor in this country said

[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.180]

Milk into Wayne, the Zingha father of the national lines of black Panthers

What organization called turn your back on bush wants people to stay out spots along the parade route and turn their backs on bushes

[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:24.100]

[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:30.280]
Sarah Kaufman said who says he's expecting bus loads of participants from all across the nation and a separate black clad

Bush's inauguration plans have also drawn protest from the district of Columbia government

[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.760]
oh

[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:31.780]
Rock...

[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:35.940]
This time we're going to composed four or five devamesome crimes.

[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:37.260]
And they all...

[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:38.020]
They all still pretty...

[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:38.940]
1232 or fivelichads.

[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:38.940]

[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:40.220]
60 W.D. Q.A.M.

[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.900]
And not more on Harry's.

[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:43.280]
I was wondering during the break.

[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.860]
Is Prince Harry?

[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.380]
Oh, they're British.

[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:47.200]
Do they say?

[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.120]
Prince is British?

[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.720]
But before we get to that, yeah.

[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:53.880]
See, I'm so far ahead of you, man,

[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:56.140]
that you're just trying to, you're like Teresa Heinz-Curie.

[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.260]
You're trying to catch up all day.

[01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:58.000]
What's the pills?

[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.280]
Of course, that's what it is.

[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:01.760]
Oh, that's why Tommy's doing the spot.

[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:02.740]
You sound too stone-owned.

[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.700]
Did that book come in and explain anything to you yet?

[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.580]
No, Miguel went into the cost of them

[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.480]
and got the other story.

[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:09.480]
And what's the story?

[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.220]
Is it something we can discuss in the air?

[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:12.020]
I guess.

[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:15.840]
We're doing appearances for a while and not spots.

[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.040]
What do you mean we, Tonto?

[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:20.200]
What are the people that go down and do the appearances,

[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:20.980]
myself, Miguel?

[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:21.760]
Right.

[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.000]
By the way, if I were to break him to 25?

[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:25.380]
Yeah.

[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.540]
No, this is just unlike me.

[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.260]
I don't know what this is.

[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.760]
I just keep forgetting the cost of breaks out.

[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.200]
Which is bad, because then I write the law in my mind.

[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.620]
One break, you write it's only 12-15.

[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:35.000]
What?

[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:36.520]
We'll cross the next one out and then you'll be ahead.

[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.280]
Okay, good.

[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.560]
Well, quite frankly, it won't make too much difference.

[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:41.040]
Kind of breaks we got.

[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:46.000]
Before we get back to a prince, Harry, in a bid to dramatically cut costs,

[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.800]
South Florida's chief federal services proposed

[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:50.000]
closing the US courthouse in Fort Lauderdale,

[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:53.660]
and splitting its caseload between Miami and West Palm Beach.

[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.580]
That is outrageous what that is.

[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.600]
It is absolutely unacceptable.

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.040]
Yeah.

[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:02.200]
Chief US District Judge William J. Lock said in the recent memo to another senior judge

[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.440]
that shutting down the courthouse on Howard Boulevard

[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.500]
could save federal taxpayers more than 100%

[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:09.760]
million dollars in the first year and about 7.6 million each year thereafter.

[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:12.780]
This last proposal to do a sharp objection from elected officials

[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.240]
and community leaders in Howard County.

[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.020]
In the...

[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:15.240]
Wow!

[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:15.900]
...County.

[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.080]
Broward leaders made the courthouse as an important part of Fort Lauderdale's role as the county's seat,

[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:22.360]
and it's driving to become a thriving urban center.

[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:25.600]
The courthouse offers jobs, attracts law offices, and brings prestige.

[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:30.560]
It will be a devastating move to the community since state represented Jack Southern Democrat of Wilton Manners.

[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:31.400]
Oh, Wilton Manners!

[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:31.600]
Gay!

[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.920]
Your average juror, Olydigan, would have to travel an hour and a half to three hours to get their case.

[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.640]
He said that concerns me, he said.

[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:42.340]
The move could also cost jobs for courthouse personnel and forced the US Marshall Service,

[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:45.800]
Federal Public Defenders and Private Law firms to reconsider their Broward operations.

[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:50.720]
Carlos Lorente, a civil law litigator in Fort Lauderdale, was not pleased with the prospect

[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.140]
of longer drives for court appearances, but he added advances in technology could reduce the burden

[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:59.340]
as he now files documents electronically and downloads information from the court's computer system.

[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:02.360]
It wasn't clear from his last memo how soon the courthouse might close

[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.460]
of whether he's still open to staying in Fort Lauderdale, he's been looking for a new site for years

[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.980]
in part because the existing courthouse at the corner of Broward will run on third avenue.

[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.500]
Since close to the street, where Federal officials say it's vulnerable to a car bomb or other attack.

[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.560]
The proposal first before yesterday by the Daily Business Review comes as the Federal Courthouse

[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.540]
system looks to cut cost nationwide in the face of growing case loads,

[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.400]
discerning expenses, and limited congressional funding.

[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:24.440]
Oh, yeah.

[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.220]
We got too many other fish to fry, too much other pork that we have to pay for.

[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:35.100]
Now, getting back to this is from, I don't even know what this is, a London website called thisislundin.com.

[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.880]
It says, and this goes to show you what kind of people were dealing with, okay?

[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:46.100]
If Hitler wasn't a bombed London, they probably would have been okay with all of that, you know?

[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:46.760]
Okay.

[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:48.200]
I'm telling you, right?

[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:53.320]
Just like the Austrians, man, they were more rabid than the Germans ever dreamed of being.

[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.320]
The Austrians, aka Arnold Schwarzenegger's family.

[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:02.520]
A snap pool that they showed that most people are not outraged by Prince Harry turning up to a fancy dress party, dresses and Nazi.

[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:10.580]
In the Thisislundin survey, 63% of the 1500 devoted felt Harry had either been badly advised or just made an innocent mistake.

[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:16.240]
How can you make an innocent mistake when you're 20 years old and you put a swastik on your R band on your own thing?

[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.440]
He didn't realize that Jews are so touching.

[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:23.440]
Only 37% of those taking parts that they've been disgusted by his actions.

[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.120]
The full result seemed to provide support for Harry's apology over making a poor choice of costume.

[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:34.260]
So in other words, if he would add a coup-cloth's can after that with a pointed cap, it would have been a poor choice of costume, huh?

[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.420]
Figured it's bastard, huh?

[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:37.400]
You talk about racist.

[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.060]
Oh, forget about the mugwumps in the south of the US.

[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.000]
Everywhere that they went, as they were colonizing the world, and they even need to go into it, do I?

[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:45.660]
What the British knew?

[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:46.260]

[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:48.520]
Of course, everybody, they weren't just Tuesday.

[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:49.220]
It wasn't all in the dark.

[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:55.240]
Everybody looked basically had slave status, but the darker you were, the more slavery here.

[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.020]
Yeah, right.

[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.680]
Former British Army commander Bob Stewart has criticized Harry saying,

[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.620]
Prince Harry must be an enormous idiot with minimum common sense.

[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:03.980]
He's made a grave mistake.

[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:05.760]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:10.660]
Colonel Stewart added, if I had an officer who went to a party dressed as a Nazi, I would have him dragged in front of me

[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:14.540]
and as his commanding officer would have given him a punishment of 14 days extra duties.

[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:15.800]
Well, that'll teach him.

[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.860]
So 14 days extra duties used so he asked Brits, man.

[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.440]
Probably would have cut down on some of the rations of the food too, probably to cut back on some of that,

[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.140]
toden a hole in spotted dick.

[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.460]
Other people I've different views, but it's bad taste.

[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:30.000]
You don't want your officers seen like that.

[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:33.200]
It's likely he would have been punished for bringing the officer to court in the disrepute.

[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.380]
Yeah, 14 days extra duties.

[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:37.460]
Man, how's he going to be able to put up with that?

[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:41.940]
Much of pampered, prissy-ass, candy-ass, baguette, Brits.

[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.240]
Who now know you, kid, man?

[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.780]
Now get my putt across your what?

[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.600]
No, I say it again.

[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:47.940]
Faaaaming!

[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:49.620]
Yeah, that whole row of family.

[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:51.940]
Not only are there all a bunch of Germans, they're all a bunch of...

[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:54.260]
Like I said, they spend a lot of time bending down, hunting.

[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.960]
You know, the hunting is a big hobby over there in England.

[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:57.440]
That's right.

[02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:57.920]
That's right.

[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:01.280]
And if the foxes aren't around, they have to kind of bend down toward the ground.

[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.660]
The worst TV actor ever is, or was, or actress.

[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.120]
Not too many women on this list.

[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:10.380]
Tony Danza 61, Chuck Norris 51.

[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:13.320]
Maybe the moral of the story is that if you're a woman,

[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:16.280]
because Hollywood, like every other institution in America, is sexist,

[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:17.720]
if you're a woman, you can act.

[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.200]
It's hard to get a job, right?

[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:22.100]
Unless you got big basumbas, right?

[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:25.620]
But if you're a man, because there's so many men on TV, you know, you can get in there,

[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:26.880]
depending on who you know and who you.

[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:32.260]
Tony Danza 61, Chuck Norris 51, Donald Trump 46, with that orange hair.

[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:35.720]
David Caruso 31, you see the orange hair, guys, are back side by each.

[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.120]
Rosanne 24, Will Smith 20, J.J. Walker 15, Mr. T-14.

[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:40.880]
I think he had the hiccups.

[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.760]
William Schandler and Anson Williams each have 13.

[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.460]
John Stamos 11, you're picking on Blackie, shame on you.

[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:48.540]
What do you people think it about?

[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.640]
Is he still on the show that he did awful show he was on?

[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:52.420]
I wouldn't know.

[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:53.320]
What do you know about?

[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:58.140]
I mean, another one was horrible sitcoms like Family Ties or whatever those are.

[02:05:58.480 --> 02:05:59.560]
I never watched any of the shows.

[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.940]
Donnie Most 10, although that is a good radio name.

[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:03.640]
It's Donnie Most.

[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:04.920]
It is Kamagdani B.

[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:07.440]
Kelly Ripa 9, Hulk Hogan 7,

[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.480]
Aston Kuchi Kuchi Kuchi 7, L.M.D. Gen. 7, Danny I.L.A. 7.

[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:14.400]
Couldn't act if his life depended on it.

[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:18.620]
John Ritter 6, Andy Griffith 6, Freddie Prince 5, without the junior.

[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:24.540]
Don Johnson 4, Vincent Donner 304, but he Epson 4 died last year at the age of 90 something.

[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:28.560]
5, John Revolta 3, Joliel White 2.

[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:29.540]
Joliel White?

[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:30.360]
That's Erkel.

[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:31.500]
Is Joliel White?

[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:31.980]
Yeah.

[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:32.300]
No.

[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:34.740]
Meredith Baxter 2, Alan Thick 1.

[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.460]
He's married 2 or at least he used to be married.

[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.840]
Maybe he still is a Revo from Griding White.

[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:39.740]
I think whatever.

[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:41.400]
Can I write about that?

[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.880]
I don't know who Reva is.

[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:44.420]
You wouldn't know Reva from Little Eva.

[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.060]
How do you like that?

[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:45.760]
I do like you.

[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:46.800]
I believe it though with locomotion.

[02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:49.280]
And the cookie who don't say nothing bad about my baby.

[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.440]
Remember the cookies with a little Eva?

[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:50.880]
Nope.

[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.040]
Well get with it.

[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.460]
Your taste in music man is just...

[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:54.620]
A lot.

[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.000]
Alan Thick 1, no votes for Max Bair or David Bernie.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.120]
Now what about...

[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:00.300]
Let's see Meredith Baxter Bernie.

[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.120]
Wasn't she on 8... 8 is enough?

[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.340]
No, Family Ties.

[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.000]
Nah.

[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:04.820]
Yeah.

[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.280]
That's the only show she was on with Family Ties?

[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:09.040]
Probably not the only show she was on.

[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.420]
Do it during the break I'm going to do an IMDB.

[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:12.020]
Okay.

[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:12.560]
Okay.

[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:15.060]
And the DB of course stands for Donnie B.

[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:18.140]
You are listening to me, you mean me, you're Roger's.

[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:21.780]
And I'm going to say...

[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.320]
And of course it makes a lot of bad times too.

[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:25.040]
Like lately.

[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:26.720]
Meredith Baxter, here you go.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:27.880]
Here's 6 pages of stuff.

[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.900]
And I'm going to tell you right now even though I had the wrong show.

[02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:30.840]
But very similar genre.

[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:31.500]
Yeah.

[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:32.640]
What show did I say she was on?

[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.220]
Don't tell me.

[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:33.960]
8 is enough.

[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:35.300]
8 is enough.

[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.500]
She was on Family right?

[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.280]
Which was a very similar series.

[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:40.720]
Every family was like...

[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:41.020]
You would think.

[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:44.140]
There was Sarah...

[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:46.180]
Not Sarah Jessica Parker that fat whatever.

[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:47.020]
She's a very good actress.

[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:48.200]
And James...

[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:49.120]
Who I think died?

[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.020]
James Earl Jones.

[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.400]
No, not James Earl Jones.

[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:52.240]
Little lighter than that.

[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.780]
What was his name?

[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:55.280]
You know who else was in it?

[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:55.760]
She was Willie.

[02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:56.900]
Gary Frank played Willie.

[02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:58.340]
That's probably why I watched it.

[02:07:58.540 --> 02:07:58.900]
He was alright.

[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:01.640]
Anyway, Meredith Baxter, June 21st 1947.

[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:02.820]
Not that way.

[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:03.920]
She's not on the beat of Curtin.

[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:05.320]
Today we got Elmer First name.

[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.040]
Much better picture.

[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:06.880]
All the Meredith Baxter.

[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.080]
She's back in the days she went to bed.

[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:09.300]
She was cute.

[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:09.860]
Yeah.

[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:10.720]
I think I've worn a...

[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:11.980]
Have a one-boob picture ever.

[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:14.100]
Well, let's get around her one day next week.

[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:14.960]
I'm going to take her in her back.

[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:17.120]
I mean, the boob is big, but the picture is big.

[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:20.760]
She was born on exact same date as family ties coaster Michael Gross.

[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:22.060]
Holy Toledo.

[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:24.360]
June 21st, 47 in South Pasadena.

[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:26.120]
Now, she was in the...

[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:26.500]
Oh, let's see.

[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:29.580]
Post-production most on Family of the Social Life of Ethan Green coming out this year.

[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:30.860]
Angel in the family.

[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:32.060]
A TV thing.

[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:34.080]
Devils Pond, a Christmas visitor aftermath.

[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.000]
The mother's fight for dresses.

[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.280]
Murderer running around expressed a Wednesday woman elevator seeking.

[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:38.680]
Miracle on 17th green.

[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.900]
Down will come baby.

[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:40.920]
Holy Joe.

[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.220]
I wonder how holy Joe is in the days to have a show back in the days Hank was talking about.

[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.000]
Holy Joe.

[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:45.400]
Who?

[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:46.460]
Dog's best friend.

[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:47.920]
Some preacher, lunatic.

[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:49.260]
Let me call you sweetheart.

[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.440]
Miracle in the woods.

[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:50.980]
The inheritance.

[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.180]
Oh, she's got this list.

[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:53.160]
It's not my breast.

[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:53.980]
Uh-oh.

[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.320]
Yeah, that's what I got the picture from.

[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:57.080]
It's about a great history of three women.

[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:57.960]
One more mountain.

[02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:58.840]
For love of Aaron.

[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:01.800]
Let's see her final fury woman scorned.

[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.480]
Blump in the night.

[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:03.940]
Jezebel's kiss burning bridges.

[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:04.860]
She's been...

[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:05.640]
She is good.

[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:07.800]
If she weren't good, she wouldn't be getting this much work.

[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.580]
She was too much to die with a badminton eve.

[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:09.980]
Winnie.

[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.140]
That's song about my dog.

[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:12.260]
The long journey home.

[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.040]
Kate Secret.

[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.260]
Family ties vacation.

[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:15.660]
The rape of Richard Beck.

[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:16.740]
That was a good living.

[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:17.360]
Yeah.

[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.300]
And the sequel, The Rape of Todd Beck.

[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:20.500]
Take your best shot.

[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.400]
Family ties.

[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:22.820]
Devils TV series.

[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:23.320]
1982.

[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.040]
Vanities.

[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:26.160]
Two lives of Carol Letner.

[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.460]
I'm coming to one of the other ones.

[02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:27.860]
I said,

[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.200]
You will end the family man little women.

[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:31.540]
November plan.

[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:32.640]
But as we love all the presidents,

[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:33.720]
then she was in.

[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.220]
And 1976 family.

[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:37.480]
The TV series.

[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:38.900]
Nancy Lawrence Maitland.

[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.300]
Was the character that you played?

[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:41.160]
Okay.

[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.000]
Sarah.

[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.300]
Oh, jeez.

[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.420]
What that was her name.

[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.380]
I have to do it.

[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:46.840]
Do a Google on family.

[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:47.280]
Okay.

[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:48.180]
And the TV show family.

[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:48.900]
Sarah Toded.

[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:49.740]
Come on.

[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:50.440]
Let's get with it.

[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:51.920]
The night that panicked America.

[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:52.920]
The imposter.

[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:54.160]
The stranger who looks like me.

[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.360]
The invasion of Carol Enders.

[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.160]
The cat creature.

[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.020]
Virgin loves Bernie TV series.

[02:09:58.200 --> 02:09:58.460]
Ben.

[02:09:58.900 --> 02:09:59.940]
She was in Ben.

[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:00.840]
Oh.

[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:02.880]
Let's play Ben by Michael Jackson.

[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.160]
Oh.

[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:03.480]
Not.

[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:04.920]
And stand up and become it.

[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:05.500]
She's been there.

[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.280]
She's fine.

[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:07.540]
She's a fine lady.

[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:08.620]
Meredith Baxter.

[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:10.440]
Who used to be Meredith Baxter Bernie.

[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:12.120]
But that's the end of that.

[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:14.000]
She threw his ass on the gurney.

[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.320]
Oh, and you'll be pleased to know.

[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.500]
And I say this very sarcastically,

[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.400]
which is unusual for me.

[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.800]
We did do that break in 40, didn't we?

[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.700]
No, this has never happened.

[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:23.840]
There's been a show that I'm like.

[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:26.380]
A lot of times I'll get ahead and cross one out.

[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:27.160]
And then I'm all confused.

[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:29.380]
But I've never like not crossed them out when they're playing.

[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:31.120]
Because that must be because you've got such long breaks.

[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:32.040]
That's it.

[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.680]
I don't have time to cross them out.

[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:34.760]
Let's see.

[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:36.500]
Suzanne Summers and Martin.

[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.500]
Martin Short is short.

[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:39.820]
I would agree.

[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.240]
It's just that no telling me.

[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:42.320]
He always made to know.

[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.100]
He's annoying.

[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.440]
He's Canadian A.

[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:45.180]
Yes, he is.

[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:45.940]
S-E-T-B.

[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.360]
Suzanne Summers.

[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:48.240]
But she's got.

[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:48.700]
She's got.

[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.340]
Summersizing though.

[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.060]
She's got the great.

[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:50.600]
The scam.

[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.480]
I mean, the great diet.

[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.640]
Let's say here's the fact that says Neil Grog,

[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:54.600]
you're the best in Zoet George,

[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:55.780]
but he's pretty good not the best.

[02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:57.940]
Well, if he were the best, what the would they need me for?

[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:01.380]
I would like to nominate the no talent of Reactress.

[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:02.440]
Tori Spelling.

[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:03.720]
Hmm.

[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:04.540]
I had a man.

[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:05.580]
Well, I don't want to read that word.

[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.680]
I'm a lawyer listener for over 15 years since the Janet Jackson crap,

[02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:09.600]
you have a Mr. Step.

[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.640]
You've also been able to say,

[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:12.120]
Faggot and all of that fun stuff.

[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:12.680]
Faggot.

[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:13.020]
Right.

[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.240]
And even once in a while.

[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:15.360]
Bye, man.

[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:17.700]
And Marie Kohn and Vogueirao and things like that.

[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.480]
Because America's a...

[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:20.460]
See, life without a scapegoat isn't worth a damn.

[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:22.400]
The kind of like paraphrase that line of Madeline O'Hare

[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.200]
is religion without a hell of a worth of damn.

[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:25.940]
Life without a scapegoat isn't worth a damn.

[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:29.020]
It says, so please, please, before it's too late,

[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.820]
play Bokobrins, junior number one hit.

[02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:31.800]
You can't.

[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:33.320]
What does that mean?

[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:34.300]
Mexican love song.

[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:35.220]
We can't play that anymore.

[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.440]
Oh, Bokobrins, junior.

[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.720]
Of course we can't play that.

[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.460]
And it's got 85,000...

[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:40.040]
Yeah, all it is.

[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:43.480]
It's not about a series of foul, Hispanic words, man.

[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:44.240]
It's fun.

[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.240]
You know, that's why we love it.

[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:46.760]
It says, thank you, you're the number one fan.

[02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:47.740]
Piancestos, Shema, request.

[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:50.200]
Nobody will be riffsin' but...

[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.240]
You know, also, I know you love Cervestos.

[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.460]
But I'm sure you'd love to get a Hummer.

[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:54.460]
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:55.340]
I'm so impressed.

[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:55.760]
RR.

[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:57.960]
Here's another one that says,

[02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.240]
Jimmel Beyond Today, too.

[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.320]
I have an announcement to make in case there was any doubt.

[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.360]
This station stands for nothing.

[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.160]
I don't even want to read this.

[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.980]
Is this for serious or is this like a game that's a plane?

[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:38.420]
Is this like to try to create some contrivacy and excitement?

[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:43.900]
This has got to be the dumbest Mother Scratch in Pile of Garbage I have ever seen in my

[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:44.880]
Pathetic Life.

[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:47.060]
I just can't believe it.

[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:47.620]
Can you?

[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.080]
Yeah, I can believe it.

[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.520]
By the way, that is the biggest pile of horse crap I have ever seen in my frickin' fracking life.

[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:56.920]
Hey, man.

[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:57.880]
By the way, what?

[02:12:58.100 --> 02:12:59.100]
Were you thinking about St. Thompson?

[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:03.540]
St. Thompson and James, uh, I'm sending you the cast, but no.

[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:05.220]
Oh, he was a good actor.

[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:07.620]
I think he also was a prison of Daisy James Roddrick.

[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.060]
James Roddrick, that's it.

[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:09.800]
He was very good.

[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.760]
And then he went blind for a few weeks in the show, but then all of a sudden I'm miracle

[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:13.080]
happening.

[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:14.560]
But, uh, yeah.

[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:20.860]
The fact that I just picked off the machine from Clarence Darrow, our program director, says,

[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:24.120]
I've just turned it to pieces, but I can't remember pretty well.

[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.900]
In fact, these are words that are indelibly etched into my brain and probably will never

[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.720]
leave, because I'm just, I'm in such incredible disbelief.

[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.600]
This radio station is in such a state of chaos and is in the process of trying desperately

[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:38.400]
to self-destruct.

[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.760]
I have never, ever dreamed in my wildest nightmares that a bunch of incompetent idiots

[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.200]
could sit around and screw things up.

[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.080]
This has got to stop.

[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:48.300]
The day has got to come.

[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:49.400]
This must stop.

[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.100]
I know that's kind of humorous when you deal with this outfit.

[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:57.980]
But this jerk in the audience around and changing and moving and playing games, and this is

[02:13:57.980 --> 02:13:58.500]
what happens.

[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:00.780]
You wait till the last minute when you don't have your ducks in the row.

[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:03.580]
When everything is done, like I said, shooting from the hip, you know, about to see the

[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:03.900]
pants.

[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:08.360]
Instead of having like intelligent discussion and sitting down and planning what they're

[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.780]
going to do, you know, everything is like, oh, gee, we screwed up with this.

[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:11.720]
Now we're going to try to cover up.

[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:15.320]
But, uh, they're just, it's like, like I told you, like a dog in a backyard, taking

[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:18.860]
on a huge dump and then running about 10 yards away and kicking up the dirt to try to

[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:19.420]
cover up his mess.

[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:20.260]
Same thing.

[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.140]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised right now if a lot of people are on the building or

[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:26.100]
doing this, as I said, taking a big dump right on somebody's desk and then running

[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.500]
like down the hall and kicking up the dirt.

[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:28.300]
Wouldn't you think?

[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:29.060]
Like who?

[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:33.100]
This fact says Jim will be on today two to four.

[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.080]
Moe Howard David, four to seven.

[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:38.580]
Tomorrow is not determined yet, says Clarence.

[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.800]
I think, no, sir, I think there's only one way I'm going to, I'm going to survive.

[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:47.860]
I don't give a sh**.

[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:48.300]
There.

[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:48.900]
There you go.

[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:52.740]
I'm going to have to take the, uh, Chris Garden approach to this whole deal, you know.

[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.880]
I don't give a sh**.

[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:57.340]
Which I do, but I can't, I can't afford to because they'll put me in the loony bin,

[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:57.600]
you know.

[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.160]
Right.

[02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.500]
They'll put you in one of those.

[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.500]
You're going to spend anywhere in the race.

[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:05.660]
One of those Vermont teddy bears with the Baker, the Baker act, the papers.

[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:06.960]
Wow.

[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.620]
I mean, well, what, what can you possibly say about that?

[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:11.620]
I don't know.

[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:13.540]
Here's the, uh, cast of family.

[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:13.860]
It's good.

[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:18.180]
Here's on 76 to 80 James Broderick, uh, also directed.

[02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:19.020]
I didn't know that.

[02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:20.420]
Willie Ames.

[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.980]
Willie Ames was on that show.

[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:23.440]
Oh, no wonder I liked it.

[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:23.880]
Okay.

[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:25.900]
I don't even remember him being on the show.

[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000]
I know Gary Frank was on it.

[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:27.440]
He played Willie.

[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:27.980]
I don't know.

[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:28.660]
Willie Ames.

[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.860]
Well, just the first year Meredith Fax, your James Broderick, Mary Grace, Mary Grace

[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:38.580]
Canfield, Quinn Cummings, Louise Foley, Gary Frank, Elaine Hylvill, Tile Pittler, Dennis

[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:41.100]
Howard, season of Hubley, Kristie McMickel.

[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:41.580]
That's right.

[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:45.120]
Kristie McMickel was on air, boy, they don't come up much, butcher than she is.

[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:45.620]
You say boy.

[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:48.420]
And her brother, Jamie McMickel, they don't come more fake.

[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.800]
Anyway, John Rubinstein, Sada Thompson, who played the cake.

[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:52.740]
There's good show.

[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:57.100]
Well, a corny, very corny, you know, like apples weigh and that kind of stuff.

[02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:59.780]
Vince Van Pan, Van Pan was in apples weighed, by the way.

[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:02.920]
Now this, I just, I have to let it go.

[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:03.480]
I just, let it go.

[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:03.900]
Let it go.

[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:04.600]
Yeah.

[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.860]
Just hook away.

[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:09.340]
A group of billionaire philanthropists started to donate tens of millions of dollars more

[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:12.280]
to develop progressive political ideas in the US and effort to counter the conservative

[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:12.820]
ascendancy.

[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.220]
And boy, are they doing a good job?

[02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:19.520]
Oh, George Sarros, who made his fortune in the hedge fund industry, herb and merriens

[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.700]
sandler, the California couple who won a monthly billion dollar savings and loan business.

[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.340]
And Peter Lewis, the chairman of an Ohio insurance company donated more than $63 million

[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.520]
in the 2004 election cycle to organizations seeking to defeat George W. Bush, they did

[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.100]
a hell of a job.

[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:34.460]
But as well, I flushed it down the turlid.

[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.060]
At a meeting in San Francisco last month, the left-leaning billionaires agreed to commit

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:41.760]
an even larger sum over a longer period to building institutions of positive, aggressive

[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:45.500]
ideas and people far from being disillusioned by the defeated John Kerry, the Democratic

[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:48.640]
presidential candidate, the billionaires who resolved to win their best further in the

[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:51.460]
intellectual future of the left, one person involved said.

[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.040]
Their commitment to provide new money comes amid criticism of the efforts of high-profile

[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.000]
donors such as Hungarian foreign minister Sarros to sway US politics, as well as doubts

[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.480]
about the effectiveness of rocket fundraising and helping the Democrats cause in 2004.

[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.820]
Oh, they did a stellar job.

[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:04.440]
Look at a great job.

[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:05.180]
They didn't set it.

[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:08.060]
And the Ohio's pathetic.

[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:09.400]
Just pathetic.

[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.480]
Well, what?

[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:13.140]
I'm telling you, I just don't know what to do at this point.

[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:14.520]
Except maybe like plain music for now.

[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:19.940]
I just think, seriously, this is so unacceptable and so insane.

[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:22.780]
It can't possibly for real.

[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:27.020]
I mean, the audience a lot of times thinks that we do things we can try to think like

[02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:32.880]
the technical V-Day, the most recent day we had the major technical problem.

[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.820]
But we don't.

[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.920]
And this is, huh?

[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:38.140]
We don't have to make things up.

[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:41.060]
We don't have to make them up because management takes care of it for us.

[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:46.720]
If it's a never-ending cornucopia of Smith, it's just never-ever stop.

[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:49.980]
Magnus, lunacy, insanity.

[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:53.340]
And then like we were saying before about the sponsors, I wonder if we got an empty log.

[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.620]
Well, let me just say one thing.

[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.700]
We're on every day 10 or 2 so far.

[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:57.680]
Over here.

[02:17:58.040 --> 02:17:58.280]
Yeah.

[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:00.920]
So it's, thus it is written, you know, like the Pope said.

[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:01.600]
So it is written.

[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:03.040]
As it is, it is.

[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:03.420]
As it is, it was.

[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:04.120]
It might be.

[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:05.560]
It could be, you know, it is.

[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:07.440]
How's the poll coming?

[02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:07.840]
Anything.

[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:08.880]
We're like, get off of this.

[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.780]
So I can't believe even semi that fact.

[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:15.440]
That is just to say disturbing would be the greatest understanding in the history of my

[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:15.780]
life.

[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:19.720]
It's not bad enough that that bitch 120 at grants him an estimate to slot slice, neither

[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:20.100]
would mine.

[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:21.160]
That wasn't bad enough.

[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.860]
Talk about adding insult to Inuri.

[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:23.500]
Man.

[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:25.180]
Do you believe it?

[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:26.440]
It's got to be for real.

[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:27.660]
Of course it's for real.

[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:30.000]
So how'd you like to buy some spots on the show, huh?

[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.300]
On the afternoon show.

[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:31.780]
Right.

[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:40.420]
I want the afternoon shows the worst TV actor actress ever is Tony Danza 63 is opening a

[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.060]
fairly comfortable leadover Chuck Norris who is 54.

[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.680]
Donald Trump 49 David Caruso 34 by the orange hair.

[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:47.440]
Rose and 32 will Smith 26.

[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:54.980]
Mr. 18 J.J. Walker 17 William Schentner 15 and some William is a 14 John Stamos lucky 13

[02:18:54.980 --> 02:19:00.560]
tall Cogan 10 as in Kuchiku 10 Kelly Rippet 10 Johnny most 10 and everybody else with

[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:01.200]
a single digit.

[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:04.500]
It's a movie.

[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:16.660]
I

[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:22.900]
At first Jim said he built a little bit cool

[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:28.060]
But now he says I like it

[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:37.440]
The mad dog just can't piss it up with that cottage cheese, but if he wants me to sing God bless America and pasteies in the G string up here

[02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:48.140]

In that it sings you it's available now at all blocks us your stories

[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:05.820]
Yeah, remember I remember our good time that recently though on this place

[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.080]
Wow, this is so nice man

[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:13.260]
You know what it's like it's like being caught in the light like you're watching

[02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:17.500]
Cooquusness, but all of a sudden you find that you're inside of it in other words you're like you tried to screen you know

[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:18.920]
You're involved in the movie in the camera

[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:25.140]
Right and then that's how I feel with this this this started back in when it puts sternum like basically

[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:26.360]
totally

[02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:31.740]
Invillation of everybody's deal and then it proceeded with that which after I was willing to accept it in the

[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:36.280]
Fact we started whenever to help somebody felt like it and wanted to read and extend the contract and then you know

[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:42.020]
Certain people went into like a hiding and nervous breakdowns and then we evolved into that famous through the day before the

[02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:45.060]
Second sushi summit between Greg Readon or McKin the

[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:47.700]
Inquisition with George over a

[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:53.380]
So yes a counting thing and then of course the sushi meeting in which we were told all sorts of things most of which

[02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:57.340]
It turned out to be bull crap and then of course the tremendous vacation I had in Florida

[02:21:57.340 --> 02:22:05.080]
I would just and even coming back here butchered and destroyed and ruined by Joyce and Carol and this one and that one and people were in hiding

[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:08.940]
I don't want to mention Greg again, but it's just and now all of this

[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:14.240]
It's like we're kind of middle of some kind of a nightmare like these people are like insane and we're like

[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:19.620]
In bed with them so to speak yeah, but on the bright side. Yeah, once they've got power smoothie food in here

[02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:25.840]
So we're all happy. Oh, thanks. I'm gonna get ice cream today. I have I mean you see you said serotonin before

[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:30.920]
Think about it. Gonna release some endorphins. Oh, I got it. I got a smooth. I got a

[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.080]
Spooky and a power smoothie. I got a smoothie my brain. It's power smoothie in the adventurer shops. Oh great

[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:40.000]
Probably what they bring just smoothies through these end up and wraps. They have wonderful wrap

[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.000]
You wrap you wrap. Yeah, great. We're wrapping it. Let's play some rap music till two o'clock

[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.200]
I just mind with marquee mark, which is what does and believe me mark. I see this last name here

[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.560]
Mark I seen you in your underwear you ain't no marquee mark

[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:58.400]
But anyway, he says here's to show what a good theme song and bad actor chips with Erica strata excellent choice for bad actor

[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:02.380]
Erica strata who's also made more than one pull this week. Oh, yeah, yeah

[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:09.220]
Flamer so they say rumored if it is less than spoken five six seven. Okay, let's just take some calls

[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:13.520]
I got all this whole pile of stuff here. I'm not reading any of you. I'll save it for tomorrow just I don't care

[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:16.140]
I just don't care because this is so

[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.760]
There are no words to describe it now

[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:24.580]
What what they was it wasn't it on Monday? We thought that this was all pretty much a done deal and then we had to change

[02:23:24.580 --> 02:23:25.520]
Oh, it's gonna be a

[02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:29.680]
Mad Dog a two and then Howard David at four and then oh here comes then okay

[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:33.960]
That we got no mad dogs at four and we got it all straight now and we don't have it straight enough

[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:37.400]
And if I'm managed I'm talking right now just stick by your guns man

[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:42.800]
You'd used whatever you want they should give it to you period. That's it. No ifs butts are ends no butts

[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:48.020]
I'm gonna say it for the record one last time if they lose him if they let him escape

[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:51.020]
Just like the little Joe Rose blown him off the door, which is a horrendous one

[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:53.180]
See they can laugh about the fan you know

[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:59.160]
1700 and make a laugh about Pete Bolger and RFX from Fox 940, which is a piece of crap with the fraction

[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:03.320]
You know and right now ESPN radio 790's got fractions except for Joe Rose

[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:07.700]
That's all I ever had because they have no story they have nobody else. They got one guy

[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:13.860]
They got a good guy, but they only got one guy one guy doesn't the station make but if they wind up with your rose

[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:17.360]
Jim Manage and the dolphins then all of a sudden as far as this whole sports deal

[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:21.840]
Which now it seems like the beesleaves and this whole company running back to the safety and sanctity of sports

[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:24.680]
You know to run away from all of their previous mistakes in last year and a half

[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:29.300]
Well now all of a sudden it's not so we're cozy anymore with lackable competition

[02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:34.620]
You see what I'm gonna say and I do and if Mad Dog should the walk out and go across the street

[02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:40.240]
Who we gonna put on there between two and six or two and seven we're gonna put more on for five hours from two to seven

[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:41.260]

[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:15.620]
We're all caught out or not. I mean what are we gonna do with this thing?

[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.300]
This is just although I tell you one thing I'll be listening to it too. I can't wait to hear this

[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:23.940]
I can not wait to decide I've been kind of avoiding it last couple of days because it gets really ponderous to me

[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:25.000]
Well, we're here temporarily

[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.820]
You know, I understand where he's coming from the mad dog because I've been through it

[02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:34.200]
They break me over the calls with all this crap, but it's just it's not amusing anymore. It's not entertaining

[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:39.440]
It's not interesting. It's not provocative. It's just embarrassing. It's humiliating and degrading

[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:44.700]
This is a way to run a radio station is a way to run a business and what have I been saying from last three years now

[02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:47.980]
About somebody who like to hump the dumpy broke the egg and can't put the pieces together again

[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:51.600]
But a worse team deal, huh? That was the beginning of the end and somehow

[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:54.040]
Magically because that horse who still hasn't fallen out yet

[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:57.620]
Magic we continue from that our way along here. I don't know how do we do it

[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:02.500]
But you stop and think about it. Oh, oh no, it just came to my mind. Oh, please

[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:05.820]
Hmm. I know who they would stick on there. You know who would be oh?

[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:08.960]
No, yes

Great day those are two fine choices. We'd have been really remiss indeed if we would add them on their Bill Cosby

[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:37.740]
Which I still can't figure out his appeal and

[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:43.900]
Pass law which there really is no appeal or shouldn't be because he's just the old the trolls what he is

[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:49.280]
Old troll hanging around with some hot the chicks and guys on the beach, you know everybody's scantily clad and he's running around

Psychotic calls there was a day Thursday, December 23rd a day that will live in infamy the calls started at 10 o'clock in the morning

[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:07.580]
Between Norma Kent and Joyce and back and forth this one and that one and the water Nazi

[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:14.380]

Seven o'clock that night and we're still going on

[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:20.940]
It's hard to believe but that's the kind of madness that goes on and there was nothing complicated

[02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:26.640]
It was just a very simple two-year extension not a lot more money a little signing bonus, which is standard and all the deals

[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:28.740]
I've done extending with these people not nothing

[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.900]
But oh we want to assign this we want to assign that and we want you to credit

[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:38.660]
I'll be honest with all these like I said the other day I really mean this with all the stuff that we can't play and can't say anymore

[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:44.700]
With all of Joyce's restrictions, which are way over the top as far as FCC restrictions are concerned with all of that

[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:48.480]
Which we've invited by very well nobody's done it better than we have or more immediate

[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:53.500]
But if I would agree to any of the stuff they put it there would be no show there be nothing left

[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:55.840]
There'd be no reason that you can do the show or listen to it nothing

[02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:57.880]
There you go

[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:03.760]
Instrumental lonely of course and the remake of Noxious Soundies that's it got only knows more kind of sounds

[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:06.840]
I'll be man no sour notes from the tubas because that you know sounds like yeah

[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:08.180]
I got that bit with Jack Nicholson

[02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:11.000]
He was like doing very sanitary, you know without any no cheese

[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:14.580]
28 past one at 560 qa m

[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:27.240]
I never

[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:28.540]
I

[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:30.460]
Must

[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:31.700]
I

[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.500]
Can

[02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:33.980]
I

[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:34.120]
Can

[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:34.200]
I

[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:34.200]

[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:34.580]
I

[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:34.740]
Can

[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:35.140]
I

[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:36.280]
Can

[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:36.820]
I

[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:44.640]
Can

[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:50.140]
I

[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:53.520]
Can

[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:53.520]

[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:53.600]
Can

[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:54.300]
I

[02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:54.580]
Can

[02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:55.040]
I

[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:55.300]
Can

[02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:55.300]

[02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:55.640]
Can

[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:57.380]
I

[02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:58.480]
Can

[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:00.480]
I

[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:19.580]
May

[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:20.360]
And

[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:26.480]
I have

[02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:36.880]
And my rabbi too, I get no surprise that doesn't, for a hick in a swing.

[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.720]
Up for a sandwich of night, today, oven, and a cup of liquid.

[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:47.900]
I love beating and cold those books.

[02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:54.860]
I must offer to you, I'm offered to face the foundation of truth.

[02:44:54.860 --> 02:45:01.320]
I must offer to you, they won't show for me, they'll be up to three times the game.

[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:08.000]
So I'm going to try it on you, see it's all I've got, saw it, did you?

[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:12.680]
Oh, for what?

[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:18.680]
29-2 at 560 and WQM2 at class, we got the show followed by at core.

[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:20.720]
I already threw the schedule out.

[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:22.780]
I mean, what's the point? I just smirk handed.

[02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:25.500]
As a matter of fact, look at the schedule for tomorrow.

[02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:26.220]
Why bother?

[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.480]
7-10 pm, TVED to be determined.

[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:34.560]
Whoever I'm hurting with this, whoever I'm hurting with such a place, a thing, huh?

[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:36.580]
I just, I can't deal with it.

[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:41.100]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 and a rising singular wireless line.

[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:42.700]
WQA and hello.

[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:43.940]
Hi, how are you?

[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:45.180]
Pretty good, how you doing?

[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:48.580]
Good, I just wanted to tell you that was Jane Wyman, who was on FalconCraft.

[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:51.620]
Oh, not their Claudette Colbert, but she was on some soap.

[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:53.380]
But she Claudette Colbert, do you see her dynasty?

[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:56.780]
No, I don't think so.

[02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:01.340]
Jane Wyman was on it, Ronnie Reagan's former wife.

[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:01.900]
Yeah.

[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:02.900]
Okay?

[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:04.320]
Okay, have a great day.

[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:05.160]
You two, thanks.

[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:05.860]
All right, bye.

[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:08.520]
Claudette Colbert, I'm sure was on this somewhere.

[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:09.220]
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

[02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:09.640]
Look it up.

[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:12.520]
She had a cosenovated 8-Minute movie on her if he looked her up.

[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:13.560]
But she's very dead.

[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:15.960]
She ain't even like Luke Warren at this point.

[02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:17.640]
Speaking of Luke, how's Luke kelp into it?

[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:22.700]
560-70560, Tom 560 on the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:23.700]
How's Ranger Ricks doing?

[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:25.160]
How's Ranger Ricks doing?

[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:25.680]
How's Ranger Ricks?

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:26.540]
I think it was Ricks.

[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:26.940]
Ricks.

[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:28.480]
WQA and hello.

[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:32.240]
Yeah, the other guy stole my son, when he said, don't cause you.

[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:34.500]
But I'd say who I think is the worst is Mary Tyler Moore.

[02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:36.080]
Oh, yeah, she couldn't know.

[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:37.480]
And another one is Dick Van Dyke.

[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:38.280]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:41.520]
But Mary Tyler Moore reminds me of the queen of an old ice cream.

[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:42.620]
Yeah, right.

[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:46.880]
And the cause be, dude, I swear I could not even crack a smile.

[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:49.940]
A guy could not make me laugh if it's my life suspended on it.

[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:50.840]
Absolutely, right?

[02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:52.020]
Nothing funny about him.

[02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:52.820]
Thank you, Sally.

[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.120]
So we got Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, got those?

[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:56.960]
We got them.

[02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:57.420]
Okay.

[02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.200]
I mean, more amps to them was on the show.

[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:01.240]
He was funny, but of course he had like a very minor role.

[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:02.480]
Not that I watched that.

[02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:03.820]
So I don't want you to think I watched it.

[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:04.380]
I've seen it once.

[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.340]
Because you keep saying, what you never watched Beverly Hills,

[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:09.920]
back in those days when there was no cable, no satellites, no,

[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.420]
you had like maybe three choices at best.

[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:16.580]
And so any show that would come on, you'd watch it once or maybe like part of the show.

[02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:17.300]
You've been to Hamlet.

[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:18.260]
And that would be it.

[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:21.180]
Why would you, why would anybody with a half a brain situation,

[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:22.840]
an entire episode of Beverly Hillbilly?

[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:23.720]
Because it was funny.

[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:26.560]
And it's a good, funny, or green acres.

[02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:27.980]
Totally different.

[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:29.460]
Oh, man.

[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:30.540]
Beverly Hillbilly's was brave.

[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:31.740]
They couldn't play that on the air now.

[02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:33.120]
Or the Duke's a hazard.

[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.060]
They chopped that up when they played on TV.

[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:36.020]
The Duke's a hazard.

[02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:37.120]
No, no comparisons.

[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.580]
Actually, like I said, that show must have been so bad for me not to watch it.

[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:44.120]
It was about as it gets.

[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:45.900]
And it couldn't get much worse than that.

[02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:47.300]
W.A. Q.A. M. Hello.

[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:48.760]
Who I am?

[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:49.700]
Madness Central.

[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:50.020]
Hello.

[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.060]
This is 560.

[02:47:51.580 --> 02:47:52.560]
No, this is 560.

[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.180]
Hey, can I talk to George?

[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:55.680]
Do you want to talk to who?

[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:56.340]
George.

[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:57.880]
George Rodriguez?

[02:47:58.260 --> 02:47:58.460]
Yes.

[02:47:58.820 --> 02:47:59.620]
What do you want to talk to him about?

[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.060]
About the airport.

[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:02.500]
About the airport?

[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:03.200]
Yes.

[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:04.440]
What about the airport?

[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:06.400]
They're not paying their bills.

[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:09.240]
The airport isn't paying their bills to whom?

[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:10.480]
To whom?

[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:13.100]
We're waiting.

[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.780]
You're killing some good.

[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:15.840]
Good time here, man.

[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:16.620]
You're a bushman.

[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:18.280]
Hey, George, just go out and talk to him about the airport.

[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:19.040]
They're not paying their bills.

[02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:20.900]
Let's take it to do it with me.

[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:22.480]
Yeah, let's take that out of the way with George.

[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.520]
I think we just had an exploration right on a show.

[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:31.320]
I think he just croaked right on the show.

[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:35.240]
Which hopefully he and Bob Lincoln sound like I will do the same.

[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:35.860]
Oh, brother.

[02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:36.480]
Wow.

[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:38.560]
W.A. M. Hello.

[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:39.460]
Hey, Neil.

[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:40.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:42.280]
Alan Alde, anything with him in there?

[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:43.480]
Is there any of those other douchebags?

[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:44.220]
Very boring.

[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:45.560]
Unbelievably boring.

[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:46.680]
Yeah, I can't stand him.

[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:48.360]
Thanks, Cali.

[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:48.940]
Hang in there.

[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:49.900]
Hang in.

[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:50.700]
We're hanging, man.

[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:51.500]
Hang in by our thumbs.

[02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:53.580]
Look at a guy in the Apollo Harvey bit.

[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:54.580]
We're hanging out to dry.

[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:56.360]
I think we've been hanging out to dry, don't you?

[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.840]
I should never have signed out.

[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:00.620]
I mean, what was the hurry?

[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:02.000]
You know, that's certainly how stupid I am.

[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:03.600]
I'm going to be the first to admit what an idiot I was.

[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:05.000]
Why did I hurry into that?

[02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:05.540]
What was the rush?

[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:07.160]
I don't know.

[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:07.820]
Seriously.

[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:08.720]
What was the big deal?

[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.260]
Of course, I got to protect everybody else.

[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:11.100]
I've got all these people.

[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:14.760]
These appendages, you know, like George and Bokobrine and Josh Cordis.

[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:16.960]
So of course, what he's making, you can go out in like on a street corner.

[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:17.580]
You have more in a cup.

[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:20.380]
But, you know, not all these people that depend on me.

[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:25.000]
Okay, so I have to just keep on until I just just expire myself right in the air.

[02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:25.640]
Like, Cali.

[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:26.760]
So we're going to try to help him out.

[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:27.980]
You're going to sell your bits on eBay.

[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:28.700]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:32.820]
But I mean, you know, at the time it seemed like a fine idea.

[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:34.800]
And it would be going along.

[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.060]
But in the meantime, little did I realize that all this other crap would be going on.

[02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:39.300]
I mean, just what's it got to do with you?

[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:40.160]
You're getting paid on.

[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:41.440]
It has to do with everybody.

[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:42.520]
I know.

[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.460]
There's radio stations.

[02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:47.640]
Look, I'm trying to, you know, you're trying to like blue sky yourself, not me,

[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:49.040]
because you're not fooling me for a second.

[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:54.080]
Your everybody is disturbed and distressed and distraught and, well, psychotic as I am.

[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:54.600]
There are people.

[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:55.600]
What are you going to do about it?

[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:57.240]
And then there's nothing I can do about it.

[02:49:57.280 --> 02:49:57.760]
What am I going to do?

[02:49:57.880 --> 02:49:59.440]
I'm going to say, if you can, I'm going to end it.

[02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:00.340]
Anyway, I'm going to walk out.

[02:50:00.380 --> 02:50:01.220]
I'm not walking anywhere.

[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:04.300]
I'm walking right into the studio every morning at the, you know, whenever I come in.

[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:05.540]
What am I going to do?

[02:50:05.900 --> 02:50:06.660]
I'm going to like make threats.

[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:07.620]
I'm going to walk out.

[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:08.640]
I'm going to burn a building down.

[02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:09.780]
I'm going to like having nervous breakdown.

[02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:11.300]
I'm going to take a dump on Griggs desk.

[02:50:11.380 --> 02:50:12.160]
I would like to do that.

[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:13.280]
Oh, the man.

[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:18.680]
I would like to, you know, I'd like to do, I'd like to go to the lights and I'd like to stock

[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:21.660]
up on every one of the, you know, because they got a lot of great stuff there, as you know.

[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:24.840]
But a lot of it's got like sorbitol and maltitol and I happen to have irritable bowel.

[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:30.700]
And so as a result, when I eat any of those products, as we've discussed before, I am just a run and fool, man.

[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:35.020]
I am just in that, on it, in it, around it.

[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:35.280]
Yeah.

[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:38.860]
It's like my life is flashing before my eyes.

[02:50:38.860 --> 02:50:46.600]
So I would like to just consume for about eight hours all of that stuff and then just run into his office with him, of course, sitting at his desk and then just let it loose.

[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:48.160]
Let it all hang out.

[02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:51.240]
Oh, that's one of my, the ultimate fantasy.

[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.820]
I'd rather do that than with like $10 million in the lottery.

[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:55.440]
I really would.

[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:58.560]
I'd rather just go in there and like just mess all over the place.

[02:50:58.800 --> 02:50:59.520]
I'll get the camcorder.

[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:00.960]
Oh, can you imagine?

[02:51:01.060 --> 02:51:02.520]
We can, in fact, forget about the 10 million.

[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:04.220]
We can make 100 million so on the tape of that.

[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:04.980]
Don't you think?

[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:05.880]
Oh, he's easy.

[02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:08.840]
Boy, what are we going to do about that?

[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:09.380]
I'm just dumb.

[02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:11.360]
5, 6, 7, 8.

[02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:14.640]
What have we got here on the facts machine?

[02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:15.920]
Oh, I can't go through this.

[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:20.820]
I really, I'm just about, let's see, please put Bob Faggot from Full House in America's funniest to honky's.

[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:21.640]
Oh, yeah, what's his name?

[02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:22.900]
Bob, um, Saggot.

[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:23.660]
Saggot.

[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:24.620]
Ram's with Faggot.

[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:25.760]
Bob Saggot.

[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:27.800]
I got new respect for him because of that movie.

[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:28.620]
What's that?

[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:29.480]
What's that movie, Josh?

[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:30.800]
I can't think of it.

[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:31.440]
Half baked.

[02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:32.200]
Half baked.

[02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:35.000]
He did a cameo in there that was possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen.

[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:35.380]
Really?

[02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:36.220]
Bob Saggot?

[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.020]
What are you stupid of fooled me?

[02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.060]
Turn me around completely.

[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:38.660]
He's an attorney.

[02:51:38.660 --> 02:51:39.320]
Turn you around, well.

[02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:39.540]

[02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:43.400]
And this, uh, Fag's also says, all hail Britler.

[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:44.260]
I like that Britler.

[02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:46.580]
Yeah, the, uh, builder burgers.

[02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:50.620]
I mean, the, uh, the, the builder burger, the Batonburgs.

[02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:52.940]
Maybe they are the builder burgers, huh?

[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:54.720]
Maybe they're part of that evil empire with the trial.

[02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:55.400]
There you go.

[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:56.220]
There's a listing.

[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:57.080]
Illuminati, huh?

[02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:57.820]
The Illuminati.

[02:51:59.060 --> 02:52:02.600]
Here's a Fag's that says, a frustrated QA minister in Broward.

[02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:06.080]
Thank God somebody cares enough about this insanity that just continues,

[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:08.420]
whirling around like an out of control hurricane.

[02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:12.780]
Neil, all of the QM programming issues in the progressive downward spiral of the program,

[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:15.400]
we're going to be tutelage of the mugwomps you have behind the scenes at the station,

[02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:19.880]
can be traced back to one single event, the upstart of that new radio station, WQM Cuba.

[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:23.980]
Ever since WQM's Cuba signal has been overriding the Miami QM signal,

[02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:27.640]
as soon as the sun goes down, all the troubles really began to snowball a QM Miami.

[02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:29.260]
Well, it must be if it else fault them.

[02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:33.440]
Olding in Miami, can you have one of these supposed leading radio stations sit back,

[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:36.380]
and a lot of this program to go to Schmidt, and then flip off the listeners and sponsors

[02:52:36.380 --> 02:52:40.000]
by allowing some rogue Mambo and Rumbos station to hijack your signal.

[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:41.880]
A lot of sure we're doing a lot about that.

[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.480]
We're out there peeing on the tower every day, that's what Bomber Moots is doing.

[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:47.340]
How the hell am I supposed to listen to Ed Kaplan give the scores eight times

[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:50.440]
and I want to talk about sports lines with really bad salsa music in the background.

[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:54.100]
Screw Greg Reid says a frustrated QA listener in Broward,

[02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:56.240]
which we can only say, amen.

[02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:58.980]
You are a seated me in Roger's home.

[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:00.020]
Yes, congratulations.

[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:01.840]
We are on 560-60.

[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:03.500]
QAM.

[02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:06.200]
It's Paul Harvey.

[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:07.940]
Stand by for news.

[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:14.120]
An elderly woman sitting on her front porch rocking away the last days of her long life.

[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:18.800]
Suddenly saw a very godmother appear before her.

[02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:22.080]
The godmother informed her she would be granting three wishes.

[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:28.060]
Well, now, said the woman, I guess, I would like to be really rich and poof

[02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:32.960]
with a wave of the magic wand, a rocking chair turned to solid gold.

[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:38.160]
And she said the woman, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful princess.

[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:46.160]
Poof again, the magic wand world, and the elderly woman turned into a beautiful young lady.

[02:53:46.680 --> 02:53:49.060]
Your third wish, said the very godmother?

[02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:53.960]
Well, just then the old woman's cat wandered across the porch in front of her.

[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:57.960]
Oh, you can change him into a handsome prince, she said.

[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:03.720]
Poof, there before her stood a young man, more handsome than anyone could possibly imagine.

[02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:09.500]
The woman stared at him, smithened, with a smile that made her wheeze naked.

[02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:12.700]
He saw her to cross the porch and whispered in her ear,

[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:15.080]
that your sorry you had me neutered.

[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:16.220]
Paul Harvey.

[02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:17.740]
Good day.

[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.660]
One of 44, that's one of the great things that's happened in the years we've been

[02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:22.300]
Paul Harvey Jr. from the show, that was good.

[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:24.680]
See, already it's only the 13th.

[02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:25.460]
Well, tell your blessings.

[02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:26.740]
And some good things are happening.

[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:29.320]
Well, I was inspired by you, of course, being a hard-ass that you are.

[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.080]
I don't know what you have against him, even though he's terminal.

[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:33.140]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:35.060]
How about Bob's second?

[02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:36.800]
We just put him on there, Bob's second.

[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:37.520]
You must be psychic.

[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:38.820]
I missed it.

[02:54:39.140 --> 02:54:40.420]
But we just stuck him on there.

[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:41.060]
We just stuck him.

[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:42.100]
Well, I'm a daily.

[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:43.080]
Okay, thank you.

[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:43.920]
Thanks. See ya.

[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:45.780]
How about Bob's third?

[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.580]
We have a flurry of lady here at the tourney in the Shownetskut.

[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:51.760]
Well, they care enough to send a very best or whatever it is.

[02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:52.040]
Right?

[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:53.120]
Something they got.

[02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:55.320]
I think everybody thinks I'm joking.

[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.440]
They never take me seriously.

[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:57.940]
Well, seriously, you don't take me seriously.

[02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.720]
When I'm joking, it's like, oh, do you hear what he said?

[02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:00.620]
You know, like that.

[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:02.540]
This is serious businessman.

[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:04.040]
This is the same thing.

[02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:04.860]
I'm going to roll tape.

[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:05.900]
So who's doing the headlines?

[02:55:06.100 --> 02:55:06.920]
Rust today or Ken?

[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:08.620]
Probably Rust at two.

[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:09.440]
Yeah, Rust.

[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:13.420]
As soon as he starts those sports nerd headlines,

[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:15.720]
which I hope he, I don't want to like, you know,

[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:18.680]
interfere with his duties there, because he does a good job.

[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:19.780]
But just do it fast.

[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:21.240]
You know, get over here, cut to the chase.

[02:55:21.700 --> 02:55:21.820]
Right?

[02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:22.300]
Right.

[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.200]
And let's see what the hell is going on here again.

[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:26.260]
I mean, this business of well tonight, I'm going to,

[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:26.840]
that was Monday.

[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:28.940]
That's right. Monday night somebody was going to decide, right?

[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:29.420]
Right.

[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:31.440]
And then here it's Thursday.

[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.160]
And we thought it was decided.

[02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:34.960]
And we thought somebody was on like in a certain time.

[02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:36.540]
We thought we had the people locked up.

[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:37.420]
And now it's Thursday.

[02:55:37.500 --> 02:55:38.740]
It's like, oh, well, I guess what?

[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:40.260]
You got mad dog back to 2 to 4,

[02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:41.720]
which is original contract called for.

[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:44.740]
And mow 4 to 7, because we got to fill that empty slot with a moment.

[02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:45.600]
Do do do do do do.

[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:46.320]
Do do do a man.

[02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:49.240]
Maybe you could cover up and send with a do do do do do do do do.

[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:49.420]
Me.

[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:50.600]
Do you?

[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:51.180]
Huh?

[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:54.200]
I just got that big ball spot where that muskrat used to be.

[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:55.220]
You know, I never said that.

[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:56.560]
You see the treatment what?

[02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:57.400]
Do do do do do.

[02:55:57.720 --> 02:55:59.500]
No, but he has to have a ball spot right?

[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:00.540]
Never put the piece back on.

[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:01.620]
No, it looks great.

[02:56:01.900 --> 02:56:02.740]
Well, there you go.

[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:06.540]
You see, look what I do at the tremendous power of Neil and Steve Ziggler

[02:56:06.540 --> 02:56:09.120]
and I OD made him flip off that ridiculous looking thing

[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:10.240]
and the same with a moment.

[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:10.440]
And he's a man.

[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:12.360]
Embarrassed and humiliated and be great.

[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:13.580]
He's all the better for it.

[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:14.600]
Nice going mow you're welcome.

[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:15.160]
Absolutely.

[02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:16.640]
WQAM, hello.

[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:17.420]
Hello.

[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:18.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:19.220]
Neil, how are you?

[02:56:19.540 --> 02:56:19.640]
Good.

[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:22.100]
What about that, Danani?

[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:23.980]
And, you know, for the better.

[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:24.600]
Fran Drescher.

[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.720]
Fran Drescher, let me say again after we got the 75 delays.

[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:30.920]
Yeah, amen.

[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.320]
She is not just a bad actress.

[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:35.060]
She's just walking in.

[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:37.260]
In fact, I'll tell you, Prince Harry probably likes her.

[02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:40.900]
Because she's like a big billboard for anti-semitism and Fran Drescher.

[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:43.240]
She is just annoying, man.

[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:44.780]
And that has to be an act.

[02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:45.280]
Doesn't it?

[02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:46.200]
Please tell me it's an act.

[02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:48.700]
Maybe she exaggerates a little.

[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:49.360]
I see.

[02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.900]
Well, in that case, WQAM, hello.

[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:53.820]
Yeah, I want to talk to Neil.

[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:54.200]
Please.

[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:55.220]
Speaking, please.

[02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:56.060]
Hey, Neil.

[02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:01.120]
I wanted to put my vote in for Henry Winkler as the Farns.

[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:01.540]
Okay.

[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:02.200]
A good choice.

[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:03.600]
A lot of bad people on the show.

[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:03.980]
Thank you.

[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.660]
And also, what about Tom Bosley?

[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:06.120]
Huh?

[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:07.540]
We already got Tom East.

[02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:08.840]
We got Anson A.

[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:09.200]
Hold on.

[02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:10.200]
Let's put it on there.

[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:10.340]
Yeah.

[02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:11.600]
Well, now let's not do the whole thing.

[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:14.220]
Now, don't be putting what's in Scott Baill on there.

[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:15.860]
Keep it your act.

[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:16.780]
Wait a minute.

[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.060]
Who was he married to?

[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:19.460]
Jony.

[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:21.540]
No, no, no.

[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:22.580]
Jony and Chalki.

[02:57:22.660 --> 02:57:23.140]
Come on, get serious.

[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:24.820]
No, he was very do while we did that.

[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:26.000]
Nicola Chardonn was that career?

[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:26.700]
I had no idea.

[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:28.240]
She was also married to Harry Hamlin.

[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:30.320]
Now, Kenneth Vos Macho.

[02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:31.060]
I'll tell you.

[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:31.500]
Well, never.

[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:33.600]
I don't want to go into it.

[02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:33.860]
Okay.

[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:34.520]
Harry Hamlin.

[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.100]
I think it's because he was in that movie.

[02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:37.960]
With Michael O'Kee and Kate Jackson making love.

[02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:38.960]
We played that screamer.

[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:43.120]
And just after that role, I just looked at him and I think, wow, wow, wow.

[02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:45.720]
But I think about the Harry Hamlin.

[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:46.980]
Did too good of a job, did he?

[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:47.860]
Plus, he was also.

[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:50.320]
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think he was in the boys in the band.

[02:57:50.440 --> 02:57:51.280]
I could be wrong about that.

[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:52.820]
That's an old movie from the 70s.

[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:53.680]
He couldn't have been in that.

[02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:54.560]
I don't know.

[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:55.800]
Never saw it.

[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:55.800]

[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:56.360]
You ever saw it?

[02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:56.880]
I don't know.

[02:57:57.080 --> 02:57:58.080]
It was too faggy for you.

[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:00.360]
But you do want to see the teller Mr. Ripley with you law.

[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:03.140]
And my thing is, you have to bug up your ass about Mad Damon.

[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:04.360]
No, no, I like Mad Damon.

[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:04.920]
He's good.

[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:05.580]
He is.

[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:06.920]
He's over a piece.

[02:58:07.020 --> 02:58:08.700]
He's looking to use a little tan in the can.

[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:11.220]
Although I heard that he is kind of tan on the can.

[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:12.760]
Come to QAM, hello.

[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:14.020]
QAM.

[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:15.340]
Hey, it's Mad Damon.

[02:58:15.940 --> 02:58:16.920]
Come to QAM, hello.

[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:18.580]
QAM.

[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:20.280]
Yeah, I got one for the poll.

[02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:21.040]
Okay.

[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:24.400]
The old lady from Golden Girls.

[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:25.420]
Oh yeah.

[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:26.180]
Be Arthur.

[02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:27.140]
Be Arthur?

[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:28.180]
No, no.

[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:29.380]
I'm going to play the ball.

[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:29.700]
Be Arthur.

[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:32.100]
The only one that I know is that he was going to play the ball.

[02:58:32.300 --> 02:58:32.500]
Be Arthur.

[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:33.960]
I know the one you're talking about.

[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:34.400]
Look it up.

[02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:36.240]
Look up that horrible show, Golden Girls.

[02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:37.280]
He should have to know the name.

[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:37.600]
Yeah.

[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:38.120]
Boyish girl.

[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:39.120]
No, he should not have to.

[02:58:39.180 --> 02:58:40.940]
How hard is it to Google Golden Girls?

[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:41.840]
There was only three of them.

[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:42.680]
Too hard for him to do it.

[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:43.380]
No way, man.

[02:58:43.500 --> 02:58:44.240]
How about Room of Clanahan?

[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:44.760]
Okay.

[02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:46.200]
How many of them were there?

[02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:47.460]
We don't know what he's talking about.

[02:58:47.720 --> 02:58:49.820]
He said the mother, the mother, the oldest one.

[02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:50.740]
Figure the name is out there.

[02:58:50.740 --> 02:58:52.380]
Room of Clanahan, which I hated that show.

[02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:54.080]
I didn't watch it, but somehow I know who's in it.

[02:58:54.420 --> 02:58:55.580]
Um, the Betty White.

[02:58:55.940 --> 02:58:57.360]
Who don't even know who I mentioned before.

[02:58:58.280 --> 02:58:59.340]
The mod, the art.

[02:58:59.340 --> 02:58:59.600]
Right.

[02:58:59.600 --> 02:58:59.680]
Right.

[02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:01.780]
And somebody else.

[02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:03.260]
The one that looks like Aunt B.

[02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:03.880]
All right.

[02:59:03.980 --> 02:59:04.560]
I'll look it up.

[02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:05.820]
You look at it.

[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:06.900]
I'm a wild fiddle.

[02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:07.240]
Okay.

[02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:07.560]
Okay.

[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:07.700]
Okay.

[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:08.900]
Somebody cue A and hello.

[02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:10.280]
Hello, man.

[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:11.140]
You're speaking.

[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:13.380]
You know, how about her baby delicious?

[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:15.740]
Is it playing?

[02:59:16.140 --> 02:59:16.500]
Is it playing?

[02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:17.980]
He was a good and those short subjects.

[02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:18.380]
You see, okay.

[02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:19.120]
We'll put him on her.

[02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:19.800]
Her baby delicious.

[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:20.580]
He was an amateur.

[02:59:20.940 --> 02:59:22.780]
His family family was a midget, you know?

[02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:24.940]
And of course, it was, uh, what was his name?

[02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.180]
Johnny Pileo, who played the harmonica from the harmonica.

[02:59:27.340 --> 02:59:28.940]
I think his name was way before you were born.

[02:59:29.220 --> 02:59:31.760]
You know, people that are like midgets that run around looking for you.

[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:36.580]
For sympathy, you know, you know, those two guys that the twins, the midget twins,

[02:59:36.580 --> 02:59:38.920]
that sell like real estate and stuff.

[02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:40.020]
You have seen it like me.

[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:40.120]

[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:40.880]
Oh, the real estate guy.

[02:59:40.880 --> 02:59:41.100]
Yeah.

[02:59:41.220 --> 02:59:41.540]
Yeah.

[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:42.920]
What the hell is their name?

[02:59:42.920 --> 02:59:46.280]
I mean, that's got nothing to do with this, but it's just the idea that they're like midgets, you know?

[02:59:46.820 --> 02:59:47.040]
Yeah.

[02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:48.180]
They're twin midgets.

[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:50.600]
And they sell, uh, I think it's real estate.

[02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:50.900]
Isn't it?

[02:59:50.920 --> 02:59:53.500]
They got some kind of a scam pyramid thing that they sell on TV.

[02:59:53.600 --> 02:59:56.020]
They're, uh, bizarre because everybody else is still getting.

[02:59:56.500 --> 02:59:57.160]
It's still getting?

[02:59:57.400 --> 02:59:59.400]
That's the old, uh, the only other one that you didn't name.

[02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:01.440]
Uh, well, we don't need to put in any money.

[03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:05.860]
And Betty White, she, you know, she was married to Alan Ludden, so give her some slack, okay?

[03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:08.720]
The most, uh, Alan Ludden, you know, gay.

[03:00:09.220 --> 03:00:15.000]
The worst TV actor actress ever is Tony Danza 72, but he's got some stiff competition there.

[03:00:15.460 --> 03:00:20.740]
Chuck Norris 61, Donald Trump 60, Rosanna Stern, aged up with 41, when she gets, uh, behind her, look out.

[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:27.340]
David Caruso 40, Will Smith 26, Mr. 28, Will Smith, uh, Mr. T-26, JJ Walker 23.

[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:30.360]
William Schatner 19, Hulk Hogan 18.

[03:00:30.820 --> 03:00:32.040]
How about, uh, Hogan zeroes?

[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:33.840]
How about Tory spelling 17?

[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:36.600]
Uh, Anson William 16, famous and Anson.

[03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:38.900]
I do like to this famous saying his cookies though.

[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:40.060]
Stay with him.

[03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:40.820]
Aren't they good?

[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:41.620]
Let's talk about the shit.

[03:00:41.820 --> 03:00:42.460]
They're good. Don't eat them.

[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:43.920]
Mmm, he'd be a whole bag full.

[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:45.880]
Like if I could do it right now before I finish the show.

[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:52.780]
John Stamos 14, Kelly Ripa 13, Ashton Kuchikuchi 12, Ellen D. Generith 11, pasty died.

[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:57.320]
Uh, John Ritter 10, Donnie Moes 10, Andy Griffith 9, uh, Dan,

[03:00:57.320 --> 03:00:58.940]
E. I. L.O. only eight. Come on.

[03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:00.140]
Get serious, man.

[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:01.560]
Maybe they don't know who that is.

[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:04.520]
Bad Guita actor, Danny I. L.O. awful.

[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:06.680]
Susan Summer 6, Freddie Prince 6.

[03:01:06.940 --> 03:01:08.300]
Uh, and it just, uh, did that thing.

[03:01:08.420 --> 03:01:09.440]
I hate when it does that to me.

[03:01:09.500 --> 03:01:10.240]
Rent them in the sentence.

[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:17.300]
Uh, Lorenzo Lamas 5, David Hasselhoff 5, Vincent Donner 305, Don Johnson 4, Dr. Volta 4, Buddy Epson 4,

[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:18.780]
and a rest of them, uh, not too much.

[03:01:19.020 --> 03:01:20.080]
Single digits for the rest.

[03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:23.460]
I feel like I've done a marathon here today.

[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:24.200]
Everything was going on.

[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:25.140]
What time did that thing come in?

[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:25.840]
About 12.30?

[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:26.120]
One.

[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:27.080]
One o'clock?

[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:27.720]
What o'clock?

[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:30.920]
Oh, it seems like we've been mourning this whole situation for like hours now.

[03:01:31.260 --> 03:01:33.680]
My, my stomach, my kishtis are all twisted now.

[03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:38.960]
I feel like I'm going to puke my guts out, like I'm going to get on my hands and knees and crawl around just puking and muttering to myself.

[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:40.440]
But I'll be taping it too.

[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:42.860]
It seems a new Roger.

[03:01:43.540 --> 03:01:45.260]
The rest of them, five sub-bikes.

[03:01:46.860 --> 03:01:48.360]
Also, please solve a debate for me.

[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:51.640]
It was, you were so vained by Carlisdend about Warren Bader, Mick Jagger.

[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:54.160]
Mick Jagger, I always thought it was Bader until I heard you talk.

[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:55.580]
But I said everybody says, huh?

[03:01:55.880 --> 03:01:56.620]
She never confirmed it.

[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:59.420]
No, but that's the, why I don't ever even heard Warren Bader.

[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:00.800]
That's what Tracy and Kenne want to know now.

[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:02.220]
You know, that's what we say, that's what we think.

[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:04.300]
Hey, Neal, it says you mentioned Don Notser.

[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:07.520]
We are posted a link of a really funny bit of Don Notser's W on my website for the poll.

[03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:08.360]
Good choice.

[03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:10.700]
Mario Lopez, saved by the bill.

[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:11.840]
Maybe one of the words.

[03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:13.780]
That should be on our work show thing the other day.

[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:14.880]
Saved by the bill?

[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:15.300]
Okay.

[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:16.400]
Should only rotten hell.

[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:19.040]
Anyway, I'm rolling tape and good luck to us all.

[03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:19.840]
Bye, bye, bye.
