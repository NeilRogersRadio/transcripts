Carpet baggers all those outsiders and all those Ojohn provocateurum only those were glam and these are Yiddlaosh, okay

[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.780]
These are right wing Jewish extremist punks who came in from the outside as Ojohn provocateurus to stir it up

[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.320]
As they say on the sports shows the Joe Rose likes to say to stir it up

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.860]
Is that what you like to say I think?

[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.400]
Yeah, does it give it up? Well good to see that everything is under control in Iraq

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.020]
Yeah, at least 43 people were killed in 76 wounded when a series of car bombs exploded a crowded bus station central Baghdad

[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.500]
Yesterday sending debris and body parts

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.500]
Flying across the scene you know that you have things under control when you go outside you see body parts flying in all directions

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.000]
That the Burnt Fire Survivors fleeing on foot the assault the deadliest interactions made you lie took place at the

What is the Iraqi equivalent of Manhattan's Port Authority terminal hours later the Charlie mains of those buses

[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.220]

[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.440]
Tattered pieces of clothing

[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.740]
There were a lot of bodies a lot of smokes had for Raj Lido aught 37 the police officer in charge of security at the terminal when the explosion happened

[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.080]

Rosie O'Donnell 33 Roseanne Bar 22 she's read on Rosie's ass and the two of them are obviously having a great time

Yeah, she wore the pants in that family

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.580]
Oh boy, she really annoyed the hell out of me. She's just over the top

[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.980]
Another walking air for anti-Semitism kind of like Jerry Seinfeld and he's Getskies over there right now

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.100]
So

[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.980]
I don't know if he's rocking back and forth. He's got the old uh whatever it is in the pants

[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.860]
Creatures with that huh you know that he's got a bad uh, so maybe a little pepto bismill couldn't hurt

[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.800]
Civil libertarians and the Pentagon appear headed for yet another train wreck in the ongoing dispute over the so-called second batch of photos from

[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.580]
Aburgar

[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.520]
Reprizin in Iraq and

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.560]
Response to a lawsuit by the AC or you the Center for Constitutional Rights at a number of medical and veterans groups demanding release of

[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.980]
87 new videos and photos

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.340]
Bepicting detainee abuse that's now in from his prison the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff

[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.240]
He's probably smoking well right now general Richard Myers said the release would be would result in riots

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.660]
Violence and a text by insurgents

[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.080]
In other words if they saw this grotesque stuff in court papers filed a contest the lawsuit general myers city consultant with general

[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.380]
John P. Abbasade headed the west central command and general George W. Casey Jr

[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.820]
Commander the U.S. forces in Iraq both officers also opposed the release

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.660]
He believes to release the photos would inside public opinion in the Muslim world and put the lives of american soldiers and officials at risk

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.860]
Oh, thank god. They're not a risk right now, you know it's only 1860

[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.660]
The situation on the ground in Iraq is dynamic and dangerous myers and I thought the injurgency was in its waning days

[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:43.500]
I thought it was well over there coughing up blood with 70 oh and they pointed out yesterday that there was a piece about the fact

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.500]
It's like 40 degrees so it's like over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.520]
And most of these people don't have

[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.820]
Air conditioning because they have an electricity

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:57.460]
Nice the situation on the ground in a right in fact they show for one home and the woman had candles on her kitchen counter

[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.060]
And the candles were like melted in like the lean tower pizza

[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:09.160]
Also myers said there is evidence that the Taliban was gaining ground because of popular discontent in Afghanistan

[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.440]
Well, thank god that could be any of the merkins fault or the right coalition of the unwilling mission accomplished

[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.460]
Right just like that

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.880]
Rebs robin for myers said what would your pull be without merlin chambers

[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.480]

[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.240]
She just wasn't ugly but she wasn't one of the ugliest celebrities of all time. She's in the same

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.520]
I'd tell you I put him I ain't giggled on there, but I never got my bokeh brindis this weekend

Seriously, I think they need he needs a doctor right away. Maybe doctor Ruth could help him out

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.240]

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.260]
Uh, so we'll get some more offer that pull obviously. Oh, yeah, Judea park I wrote that down because you wanted me to play that

Or you maybe saw this issues

[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.480]
No, it's it's also in star magazine that picture. I'm sure it's the same picture of the burger or the picture of Barbara

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.420]

[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.100]
This burger is a hell of a lot better look in the net bitch

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.560]
So we'll get to that you'll be shocked. It's right in your hood as a matter of fact. Maybe you've even eaten there

And you're going back to Canada you cute bastard. They were creatures from another time

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.300]
Cloned in a bold scientific experiment

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.780]
But then something went horribly wrong

[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.700]
Gentlemen, I have invited you here for the opening of the most amazing wildlife preserve the world has ever seen

[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.180]

[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.160]

[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.700]

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.840]
Two day at park coming soon. This thing is everywhere.

[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.900]
film didn't summarize laces when I'm here in

[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:05.020]
10 18 and 5 60 WQ AM boys it a treat to have Gelly and Voa in the morning. Oh boy

[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.480]
Yeah, Gelly sounded surly during that little no one not like a crossover

[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.380]
But whatever he was because he heard in the background. He sounded very surly humorless

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.100]
He you know he's like

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.820]
In and out in and out

[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.700]
So I get back to the best bookers in America after Chris crossing the country in a quest to discover America's best hamburger

[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.160]
author Alan Richmond Richmond

[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.740]
He does Jews everywhere from gastric paradise in the tropics

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:38.000]
Oh, yeah, well, I think I Hollywood Florida. I think of the tropics the old the tropics

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.180]
Richmond taste tested some 160 do before I do that. I just got to play because I forget about it

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.780]
That read a cosmic thing or a play. This is it from last night and speaking of sick perversion

[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.980]
We have just a stunning picture of the work in show here for the first time. I've Dennis Raider

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.940]
Pretty graphic stuff. This is actually Dennis Raider basically naked right hanging upside down

[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:04.820]
Yeah, there you go. No, she can't speak. She's as wrote test as a your ass on a bad day after about of

[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.620]
After having a bad stomach and she just I don't want to think it about

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:14.120]
She can't speak. No, anyway getting back to Alan Richmond and his burgers. Yeah, come on

[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.360]
Richmond tasted some 162 burgers and his 24,000 mile trek and during that trek

[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:27.220]
He probably tasted some really bad trek and declared in GQ GQ magazine of all places that the best conglomeration of beef and bun is at

[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.040]
Lake tub

[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.580]
There we've been an open air eatery in Hollywood Florida. I have no idea where we're gonna have to find out

[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.800]
How are we going to find out? Somebody don't have to talk

[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.860]
Huh some will call him sure running a close second was the Luger burger at Peter Luger steakhouse in Brooklyn

[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:47.740]
Richmond note in Brooklyn of course were a Jews attack other Jews. Hey, this business that Jews know to attack other Jews

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.240]
Ask you it's Hock Robin

[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.600]
How's he doing time you see him

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.760]
Richmond notes that the burgers and the two restaurants were equal

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.980]
But Lake tub scenic location tip to scales

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.820]
Given a choice between looking at the intercostal waterway and looking at the East River Richmond says it's not a hard choice

[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:11.080]
Third place honors went to the aptly named not just a burger from the Spice Parastron at the Chandler hotel in Newport, Rhode Island

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.600]
And forget the chief steaks until it off you two fully burger joints rounded out the Richmond's top five

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.780]
What does that mean forget oh? I see in other words for good cheese stick it burgers

[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.180]
The Rouge burger at the Rouge restaurant came in fourth and Kobe sliders at Berkeley Prime

[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.760]
Was fifth Kobe sliders

[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.560]
Slider right down just like oysters feeling for our country

[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.620]
And when I see the people the wonderful people of these areas and I see how they rose to the occasion with all their pain with all their feelings with their families being involved

[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.360]
I'm very proud of them. I'm very proud of these people look good. Have a nice to be in

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.780]
So there you go. You got to check out Lake tub and Hollywood maybe so be aware of where it is

[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.700]
And then you can like taste test it yourself. You know it Miguel came in before to show this morning was raving about

[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.220]
That ice cream cold stone creamery

[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.440]
How come we don't have the money? There's a sponsor, you know

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.660]
I just thought that's the department is so stiff man. It's like like a like our cardboard like a brick

[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.160]
They are dino might or maybe they ought to be dino might at our sales department

[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.000]
They're the absolute embarrassment of disgrace, but we don't care

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.220]
I just mentioned that in passing just to aggravate them because they deserve it

[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.540]
Especially your close person

[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.880]
That one the one that's

[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.240]
We're down the piano case any day. By the way, let tub is on ocean drive and Hollywood

[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.640]
Ocean drive and Hollywood baby and it is and what did it say? It's an outdoor

[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.320]
Let's see an open-air eatery in Hollywood some of us kind of like

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.520]
Tell them to be some of those huh tell them to be you can probably watch the boats go by or something

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.960]
Well, isn't that great? Let tub and it's got a picture of the burger man

[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.280]
There's no way. I don't care how big a mouth even the stevey taler couldn't get his mouth around that thing

[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.840]
I have this wow it is just huge just dry

[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.620]
Can't it can it looks unbelievably good and it's got like

[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.040]
Slice the tomato. It's got a poppy seed roll

[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.160]
Slice the tomato then a bunch of like really anifty looking lettuce and this ring of onion and then your cheese

[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.660]
And then your burger and then the bottom of the bottom man. Oh man

[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.500]
Anyway, oh look at this wqa. I am hello

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.780]

Let's tell the old let's up restaurants on a1a right around Johnson Street on the interco

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.880]
Okay, thanks pali

[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:21.300]
Okay, it's right around Johnson Street on a1a on the other coastal side. I understand I see that what somebody told you they tell

[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.320]
Let's give a nice bug there because they made it national. I got a really big

[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.180]
And now that team of receiver got screwed over at least have one location. Yeah, just that one location in four-loader

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.300]
Dale

[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.320]
I mean, I don't want to say that throughout a business because they have other locations that are still open

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.220]
But they got their lease yanked they got yanked in four-loader Dale, which I'm sure they're not the first ones

[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.340]
WQIM hello

[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.580]
QIM

[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:46.140]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I was just wanted to comment on the top that place was really nice. Yeah

[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.120]
Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's like real underground. It's got like

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:56.900]
Just a laid-back atmosphere underground underground. Yeah, it's real dark and dank and smelly and oh, I kind of place. Yeah

[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.660]
That was great. I'm going right now

[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.420]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:13.460]
Oh, I bet you've been in places like that before. I love the stink of dank. Mm-hmm WQIM hello. Yeah, Neil

[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.880]
Yes, it's really nice man. The only thing is cash only no credit cards and

[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.560]
There's only one. Let me ask you what kind of a person pays for hamburgers with credit cards. Schlepper get out of here

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.380]
Casually no credit card

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.140]
Now what's upon the time? Uh Mickey D's was gonna start taking credit cards. They didn't do that. Did they? I'm sure they do

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.320]
Do it yeah, I'll have a big Mac a coke and a small fry. Here's my visa

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.340]
Uh-huh, and then and then the best part then you could turn down

[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:46.840]
That would be embarrassing. Yes. WQIM hello. Hey, yeah, I want to tell you about Celia Cruz for that poll

[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.840]
Celia Cruz man, there's a guy. Good choice. Yeah

[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.220]
Celia she's a lovely thing of course. It goes to show you. I have Celia Cruz and I am dead now

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.380]
I never even know when I was alive

[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.100]
I would

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:14.120]
But WQIM hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I know you're getting a look of what's up reports everywhere, but

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.520]
Yeah, it's on the other coast starting to chip north of flickers

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.100]
The flicker light pizza joint components flicker light. Okay, you know, they don't advertise

[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.320]
They just they'll barely have a sign even out front and at all

[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.380]
You can barely see it from the road because it's it's overgrown in the front and they got bad cuts

[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.320]
It's like really rustic and and the whole place apparently if you read the history of them

[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.780]
Because then he was the guy built it from

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.420]
He on the land and he'd go down every day and he'd pick up the jets and then flops them from their coast of waters

[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.420]
And all the word and everything's built from that

[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.300]
Um, and like I said rustic guys that is okay because the drinks there. They're not even so

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.760]
In bottles of all cans and if you go at night expect a 45 minute wait

[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.100]
Really? Yeah, the service is really bad

[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.360]
I mean if I tell you let's say you know

[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.360]
Sit down don't take a drink. Well, you're not gonna get your food 45 minutes

[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.840]
All right, because there's just one little guy. It's like a six by eight pitch underneath

[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.440]
Back there on the grill

[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.300]
Now just wait till after we do this today

[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.080]
Yeah, so yeah, exactly

[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.740]
So you know

[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.980]
About this about two weeks ago

[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.920]
That's the word came out and at the end my buddy actually when he was there

[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.160]
I mean aren't you guys excited and they said no we're not excited

[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.900]
We don't want anybody to think that we got the best burgers because we're having a problem

[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.260]
Yeah, they can't have everything now okay, so everybody go down or in the jammed place

[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.640]
No, seriously why not if it's they got a really good product why not you know

[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.100]
I have to hire a second guy or something like that make him a fortune sure

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.260]
I just can't I can't deal with that when people like turn down a free plug you know

Don't give it up before it's a last in a tease.

[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.340]
Don't wanna catch no night time to see these and waste away.

Vokobrion says FedEx F'd up.

[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.540]
He mailed the package at the regular time.

[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.560]
He's calling them now anyway.

[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.120]
He yell at them.

[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:30.980]

[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.520]
He's calling them to yell at them because he mailed the package.

[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.060]
Same time he always does.

[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.020]
And it just didn't get here.

[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.020]
Oh, that's not a big deal.

[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.320]
I'm sure the stuff wasn't that good anyway.

[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.820]
Here's Will says you report on it.

[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.820]
He told me to be dated.

[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.620]
Male or hide in the SunCentral.

[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.680]
Oh, hold the male please.

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.680]
It's trache.

[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.040]
Male or hide the SunCentral wrote an article that said the GQ story swamped them with long lines.

[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.880]
It even ran out of meat.

[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.320]
Well, you know, it's not like we're trying to scoop anybody on it.

[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.580]
It's just a half-to-the-scene event.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.960]
That's all I figure it was a local interest.

[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.260]
And maybe we can just kind of like pile it on, you know?

[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:02.860]
I know.

[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.160]
Come on, just calm down.

[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.020]
Oh, yeah, Phyllis Diller.

[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.640]
She's lovely.

[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.940]
The most gorgeous Phyllis Diller for the pool.

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.880]
So many of you wrote test bitches.

[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.500]
How about Tammy Faye?

[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.000]
I don't want to get your boyfriend out in front Carlos upset.

[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.640]
Hey, Carlos.

[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.300]
You fairy.

[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.260]
Tammy Faye.

[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.840]
Sounds great.

[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.100]
With or without the makeup?

[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.140]
Let's see.

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.800]
Now, what is this thing?

[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.400]
Somebody just jet bush F's Florida once again.

[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.500]
Florida homeowners will pay to bail out the state.

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.860]
Backed insurers $516 million deficit.

[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.540]
Wow.

[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.940]
The state, back, nonprofit companies board a governor's voted

[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.700]
Wednesday to meeting in Jacksonville to take a one-time charge

[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.300]
under all homeowner insurance bills.

[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.400]
Anyone with homeowner insurance policy will have to pay a 6.8% assessment

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.180]
to satisfy the citizens property insurance corporation shortfall $516 million.

[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.680]
Regardless of whether citizens insures their house condo town, home apartment, etc.,

[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.400]
they're whatever.

[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.360]
They're pub-tenth.

[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.060]
For someone with a $2,000 annual premium, that means an additional $136 bucks.

[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.220]
This is a special assessment that will be applied to whatever rate increases

[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.440]
have been or will be approved by state regulators.

[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.900]
Nice going, fat ass governor.

[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.740]
You're doing it, baby.

[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.340]
And thank you again to his brother for those low bargain basement gas prices.

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.720]
It's a gas baby.

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.300]
And of course, back in the day, we can play a little sound effect.

[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.700]
And you know, give me the real gas.

[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.680]
Can't do it no more.

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.120]
The best we can do is that.

[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.620]
Just pretend that's some gas.

[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.860]
Just pretend you heard one of them ripper and fart sounds.

[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.800]
Gainesville.

[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.600]
This is so typical of what we forewad you that.

[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.820]
That's some good news for you.

[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.660]
President Bush's job approval is dropped to 41% nation.

[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.100]
Why, according to the results of 50 separate but concurrence state, why public opinion polls conducted by survey USA.

[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.940]
Bush's approval rating ranges from a high of 59% in Idaho to a low of 29% in Rhode Island.

[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.120]
Bush is above 50% in seven states.

[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.700]
Bush is at 50% even in two states.

[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.860]
And he's below 50% in 41 states.

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.900]
Oh my God.

[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.200]
Compared to last month's poll, Bush's approval number dropped five points or more in 10 states.

[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.680]
The single largest drop was in Minnesota where he fell and where it fell 10 points.

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.860]
Bush also fell nine points in New Mexico.

[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.460]
Of course, they're pretty close to Texas.

[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.460]
They're right there on the edge.

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.420]
So they know they can smell it there.

[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.200]
What do you say?

[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.700]
Now, getting to what Gainesville, why is that there's so much crap in Florida?

[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.880]
They should stop comp for the sunshine.

[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.200]
They can call it just the the crap hole state.

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.020]
The dissent of the labor union Florida.

[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:31.740]
A controversial museum exhibit of human corpses preserved and scripted their skin to reveal muscles, organs, and even blood vessels opens today in Gainesville.

[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:38.260]
Despite the state anatomical boards refusal to approve it, the exhibit promoters promoters said that yesterday.

[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.360]
Whatever that is.

[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:48.420]
Premier exhibitions of Atlanta are used at the board which oversees the use of cadavers at Florida Medical Schools has no jurisdiction over the Tampa Museum.

[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.700]
Well, why does it say Gainesville?

[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.580]
Maybe that's where the board is, you think?

[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.880]
In Tampa.

[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.680]
They're showing Stys in Tampa.

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.200]
They just can't make up their mind what they want to be.

[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.080]
Those mugworms over there.

[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.380]
You know, they got your mom's weenus and all of them strip clubs.

[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.200]
And they even have a bunch of crystals and steak and shake.

[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.380]
But then on the other hand, they got all in mugworms.

[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.560]
All those right when fundamentalists who are all pissed off about the devil raise.

[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.100]
We will fight for the right to present this exhibition.

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.020]
And we'll fight for the right of the people of Florida to see this exhibition said Arnie Geller,

[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.400]
premier president and CEO.

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.800]
If that requires a court battle, so be it, he said, bring it on.

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.140]
Just like your president said, bring him on.

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.080]
At the heart of the controversy over bodies, the exhibition is the question of authorization to display the bodies.

[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:41.900]
The Florida anatomical board members who voted for it to against the exhibit plant for Tampa's Museum of Science and Industry said they were uncomfortable at either the deceased or their family's granted formal permission for them to be used in a museum.

[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:48.860]
The corpses belonging to Chinese people whose bodies went unclaimed or unidentified before being turned over to a medical school in China.

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:55.600]
Company attorney Brian Wanger said, a wanker, said a letter to the board saying that the bodies were obtained legally and handled properly.

[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.740]
Well, how do you handle a dead body properly? I guess you have to ask Quasimodo.

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.320]
Gingerly.

[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.880]
Dailin Medical University, which handled the body, certified that all died of natural causes and none were prisoners.

[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.760]
Lin Rommel, chairman of the anatomical board, said he didn't know how the board's decision would be enforced.

[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.320]
He suggested it would fall to attorney general Charlie Chris, you ferry.

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.620]
Who, last week, he shouldn't have been giving me board jurisdiction to regulate the show.

[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.960]
Chris spokeswoman Joanne Karen said, you ferry.

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.140]
It's up to the board to seek enforcement through the courts or the museum to seek permission through the courts.

[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.800]
The board could seek a court injunction. Oh, who cares?

[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.920]
Let him go see the stiffs in Tampa for crying out loud. At least if we give him something to do, right?

[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.480]
Get him off those tractor poles and all that other crap.

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.800]
Okay, what's the all time, who is the all time ugliest female celebrity, movies, TV, radio, etc.?

[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.920]
Sandra Burrner, of course there aren't that many radio people, you know?

[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.500]
And most of the people on radio like Shirley Peters and Debbie Ellis, most of the people have never seen him anyway.

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.300]
So what do they know? Right? Right. Got a lot.

[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.420]
226 Sandra Burrner, 85. They're not going to catch her ass.

[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.860]
Rosie O'Donnell, 48. Rose Ann Bar. Look how many Rosie's got.

[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.280]
But third man. Barber stress and 17. They obviously haven't seen that picture yet.

[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.220]
Imaging coca-12. See that cruise? He's, see that zooming up the list.

[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.280]
Oh, great. Did he just tie with Oprah 8? Ever seen together? Oh no.

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.700]
Same bitch. Be Arthur 6th. Tony Fields 5. Betty Davis 5.

[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.880]
Tennis Bay Baker 2 and Phyllis Diller has got the big, oh!

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.560]
So far.

[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.880]
This is Neil Roger, rock solid. This is 5.16 Q.A.

[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.100]
Fourth, we're radio. It's what the Q.A.

[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.340]
He's back.

[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.940]
Hello, I'm Sol. And I'm Harry.

[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.940]
Here to tell you about a special place.

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.380]
Just a short resort.

[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.780]
I'm New York, he's the Poca-Nose.

[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.620]
Let's come. That's where I wanna go.

[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.820]
I can't wait for it all.

[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.440]
There was that in the Poca-Nose.

[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.460]
He can feel empty.

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.800]
He thought that stuff.

[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.400]
Ways of a boy they could win.

[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.500]
I got a nine. Go for sat any bunch.

[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.320]
I'll fly the food on top of your tin.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.800]
I hope it's kosher.

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.800]
In the Poca-Nose, Kite-Up and Buck Hill.

[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.740]
Camel, back in Wushill, Malarie and Sonny.

[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.480]
They've even Mickey Rooney.

[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:16.960]
I know.

[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.740]
Slit rock and pressle.

[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.020]
Oh, we let's go Poca-Nose.

[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.440]
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show.

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.980]
With Tony Orlando.

[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.280]
In the Poca-Nose.

[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.760]
Get a hot shaytah.

[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.360]
You put a champagne.

[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.220]
Shit, buy the pool and act like a shop.

[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.580]
Let's get the chicks.

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.160]
You get me and a girl.

[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.360]
Over by the exercise club.

[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.980]
Hey, cutie, oh, we ain't in the Poca-Nose.

[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.660]
Kite-Up and Buck Hill.

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.640]
Camel, back in Wushill, Malarie and Sonny.

[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.580]
Don't forget Mickey Rooney.

[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.620]
Slit rock and pressle.

[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.860]
Oh, we let's go Poca-Nose.

[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.020]
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show.

[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.960]
With Tony Orlando.

[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.980]
In the Poca-Nose.

[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.540]
Let's go if we get your teeth.

[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.260]
I know, I got my teeth in the little bag with the water in there.

[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.580]
And the efferent, oh, hey, so anyway, Sonny Orlando became a boarder in Christian long time ago.

[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.800]
We know that and that's one of the reasons,

[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.940]
besides the fact he couldn't sing as loud of a paper sack,

[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.240]
that we hit him like poison.

[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.940]
Ty E. L.O. Ribbon around his neck, I think, is a good idea.

[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.500]
And then hang him from an ol' oak tree.

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.480]
Think a good idea?

[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.020]
Okay.

[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.440]
Let's give it a shot.

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.280]
Here's a fact from Mark.

[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.660]
All chronic Mark who hates you like poison.

[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.080]
Yep.

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.760]
Your good buddy, Mike Mayo, Mark says wrote a piece about late tub last month.

[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.940]
I'd send it by a fast but since it's three pages long, I might press off George.

[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.200]
Hey, any facts that you send, this is off George Mark.

[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.160]
He hates you.

[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.100]
He likes Nick Bonne County better than you.

[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.620]
And this guy's name is close to that.

[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.240]
Here's a shortened link and he sends me the link, tinyurl.com.

[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.980]
I would like, what do I need to see that?

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.080]
I also, maybe I will check it out during the break.

[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.660]
In fact, maybe if it's three pages long, I'll read it.

[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.580]
Maybe we'll have them lined up all the way to Daniel Beach.

[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.540]
What do you say?

[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.240]
Let's get late tub really cranked.

[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.660]
Maybe they got the best burgers in America, according to the national examiner,

[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.480]
and according to Michael Holda-Mail.

[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.300]
Also, I've been out of town a while since Mark, so perhaps you've heard this.

[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.080]
No, I haven't heard it and I couldn't care less Mark.

[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.020]
But freaking Ron and Fez are going to be on XM now.

[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.680]
The same channel is OP and Anthony, well good for them.

[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.620]
Please, Neil, fire that Finglor agent you supposedly haven't got somebody competent.

[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.840]
Why would I want to do that?

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.620]
Why would I want to get somebody competent?

[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.020]
Somebody who's not like a wannabe, like Norma.

[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.940]
If Ron and Fez can be on XM, you should own the place.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.540]
Well, thanks Mark and that's true.

[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.960]
This is the greatest show in history, mankind.

[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.020]
But you know what?

[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.720]
Nobody wants to hear it.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.660]
Just our crowd.

[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.780]
Thank God for our crowd.

[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.020]
Got a big crowd out there.

[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.300]
Because we're not doing some stupid ass sports show talking about all the time and at crap.

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.280]
And Ricky and Ricky and Ricky and Ricky and...

[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.000]
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.500]
Yeah, crap.

[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.900]
How about those panthers?

[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.300]
Oh!

[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.320]
Did I mention that Rimmer called the other day?

[00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.800]
Yes, I did.

[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.620]
And that he hates the panthers like Poison and Witches.

[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.460]
They would lose every game.

[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:03.800]
Yes, he did.

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.160]
Martin'sburg?

[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:04.980]
I beg your pardon?

[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:05.540]
Yes, he did.

[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.220]
I know I did.

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.980]
It was a rhetorical question.

[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.820]
Now let's see, what's this?

[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.280]
You have to stop talking about late time before they get mad at you.

[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.340]
Oh, I sure wouldn't want to have anybody mad at me.

[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.660]
Yeah, they might cut you off for supply.

[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.280]
When that article came out in GQ, they stopped selling the burgers, even placing a sign outside saying no more cheeseburgers.

[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.180]
The hero ran an editorial by Fred Grimm, which I was going to pay to the boy.

[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.480]
Everybody's writing about late time, but only because the examiner had it, see?

[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.700]
It's just by...

[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.360]
I never buy the national examiner, but there was something on the front page.

[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.900]
Oh, I got the real story about who killed the John Veney and about Bob Barker's new sex accusers named their price.

[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.380]
And Marilyn Monroe's sex secrets in her own words.

[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960]
And Barbara balloons up like, oh, there's the Barbara story.

[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.780]
And there is... where's that picture?

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.400]
Ryan Filippe.

[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.540]
Oh, excuse me, I'm busy now.

[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.760]
Well, he sure looks good.

[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.060]
Now, what does that movie he was in?

[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.540]
54.

[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.860]
54, what?

[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.420]
Now, studio 54, but the movie he was called 54.

[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.220]
And also, the way of the gun.

[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.080]
He actually packed on 25 pounds of lean muscle for the movie way of the gun in 2000.

[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.180]
You know how old he is, Ryan Filippe?

[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.000]
Fuck, third man!

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:05.800]
That's the answer.

[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.140]
Okay, anyway, getting back to this.

[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.460]
Will you stop with a Ryan Filippe stuff?

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:08.920]
Sorry.

[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.760]
The hero ran an editorial by Fred Grimm, which I was going to pay to this back, but it was printed over a month ago.

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.320]
I had to retrieve it.

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.860]
I'd need to pay to search the archives.

[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.900]
Oh, we sure wouldn't want to have you do that.

[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.060]
Right?

[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:21.840]
Right.

[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.000]
And why should they?

[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.180]
Why should they have to pay to search some stupid-ass papers archives?

[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.280]
Should not.

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.880]
Well, what does it cause them?

[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.340]
I mean, you can check our new archives in time.

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:31.640]
You want it.

[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.380]
You can look at anything you want in our marginal website.

[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.280]
So, what will you tell me about Eric is opposed to Ask Friday?

[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.940]
Yeah, he thinks it might be, I don't know, cause the concern over the line, not kosher.

[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.660]
Ask?

[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.700]
Ask is over the line?

[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.120]
I don't know.

[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.140]
Beer-ass?

[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:47.960]
Prins?

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.380]
I'm embarrassed by that.

[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:49.960]
I'll tell you that.

[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.420]
Oh, okay.

[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.600]
Let's just just forget about it.

[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.780]
I thought it was a really nifty idea and a little bit of fun.

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.200]
But I know Eric, you know, I'm just responsible.

[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.160]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.540]
It'll teach you.

[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.580]
That's payback for that crappy pull on us a few years ago, remember that?

[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.760]
Yeah.

[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.320]
You and I hope you're a little bit kind of Lisa, huh?

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.400]
But basically, the article was about how a one-page ad in GQ would, and don't email me about it, Eric.

[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.220]
Just forget about it.

[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:11.500]
Okay?

[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.780]
Obviously, you don't want to do it.

[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.860]
It's a little bit too much work for you.

[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.800]
Just forget about it.

[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.320]
One page ad would cost 75 grand.

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.800]
The story in GQ is basically worth 10 times that.

[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.920]
And the guys basically were pissed off that we're getting all this free publicity.

[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.720]
How do you like that?

[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.660]
Fred Grimm, it says, his words admitted to blasphemy considering, I'm getting a gagging over here.

[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.020]
It must be something in the ear.

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:34.600]
Poison gas?

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:35.660]
Ah.

[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.580]
Considering that shameless self-promotion has become the new religion.

[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.300]
We don't want any more publicity.

[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:46.000]
I don't think a little restaurant tours would mark naked down Hollywood Boulevard to garner what lay tub businesses as a damn nuisance.

[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.900]
But you're on the bartender with the expression of a battle where he sold your shakes and said,

[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.300]
we don't want any more stories.

[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.120]
No more free publicity, thank you.

[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.040]
No more newspaper stories.

[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.620]
No.

[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.000]
What are you saying about it on the ear in the mere Roger show?

[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.720]
Sorry, I don't apologize.

[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.820]
How would I have any way of knowing that?

[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.320]
I don't ordinarily read Michael Holdemail.

[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.480]
And I certainly don't read Fred as a mighty Grimm.

[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.620]
He ain't no Bob Grimm.

[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.880]
So how would I know that?

[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.200]
You didn't keep me posted on that.

[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.760]
I'm out of touch.

[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.180]

[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.260]
So I apologize to the guys at the late tub.

[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.400]
And like I said, the food there is crap and no co-there.

[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.980]
And that should make them feel better, right?

[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.080]
It's a horrible place and nobody wants to go there and just even it out.

[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.500]
Right, and it's a dank.

[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.280]
Dark and dank and they got like a big smelly bathtub.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.580]
How many QAM?

[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:25.800]
Hello?

[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.540]
Hey, Neil.

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:26.920]
How are you doing?

[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:27.540]
Pretty good.

[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.080]
Hey George, did you ever get the scotch number for your set?

[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:30.920]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.560]
We're good.

[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.900]
How good do you get when you get into the zone?

[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.760]
I don't know.

[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:34.900]
Give it to all, man.

[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:36.640]

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.460]
You're doing a great job feeling it for George.

[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.540]
Yeah, okay, great.

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.200]
One of your people.

[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.720]
Yeah.

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.420]
Really funny.

[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.480]
72 A.M. Hello.

[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.460]
Hi Neil.

[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:45.320]
Yes.

[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.720]
Sounds like your friend, another one of yours.

[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.100]
72 A.M. Hello.

[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.200]
Thank you Neil.

[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.260]
Please don't talk about that place anymore.

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.060]
It's so good.

[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.780]
I don't want anybody to know about it.

[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.160]
Okay?

[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:55.920]
Okay.

[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.540]
A woman faces two counts of kidnapping in Martin'sburg West Virginia after allegedly paying two

[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.160]
boys for a long job with a fake $50 bill and then holding them hostage when they caught

[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.520]
on.

[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.360]
Tracey Lynn Clinton, 39, remained in the Eastern Regional Jail yesterday, where she's been

[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.940]
held on $12,000 bail since her arrest on Monday.

[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.920]
Police say she has no known address.

[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.860]
Well, who's long?

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.220]
I say I guess they're worth any loan.

[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:23.380]
Martin'sburg Patrolman EC Nealey said Wednesday that hey, hey, I've speaking to Nealey.

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.400]
How's Candyley doing?

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.080]
Too farry.

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.740]
Said Wednesday the victims were too slightly built boys.

[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.220]
They just 12 and 13 who told investigators that were terrorized by Clinton.

[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.400]
That's Tracey Lynn Clinton, not any other Clinton.

[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.820]
She allegedly screamed at them, threatened physical violence and exhibited bizarre behavior

[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.180]
that included publicly urinating on offense.

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:41.720]
Okay?

[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.060]
That is a little bit bizarre.

[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:43.800]
Sure.

[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.980]
The boys told the police they'd been cutting lawns around Martin'sburg when they saw

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.080]
Clinton sitting on a porch.

[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.740]
She offered to pay $30.

[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.320]
I got 30, man.

[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.380]
But she said she needed change for what turned out to be a fake $50 bill.

[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.560]
The boys did the job, but questioned the currency.

[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.640]
Clinton allegedly talked them into going with her to another location, then made them wait

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.220]
for more than an hour and threatened to harm them if they tried to leave.

[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.340]
Nealey said Clinton punched one child in the back when he finally ran away, but neither

[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.360]
were we seriously injured.

[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.560]
If convicted Clinton could eat life in prison on the kidnapping charges, and as much as

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.960]
a year in prison on the counterfeit bill charge, she also faces two kinds of hanging

[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.800]
gopher in court for unrelated incomes.

[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.860]
In other words, he's got a little bit of a little bit of a problem, crazy person.

[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.860]
Thank God she's not a drug dealer.

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:23.660]
Oh, Anthony.

[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.980]
Oh, here's one for the poll.

[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.760]
I'll give you a clue.

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.960]
Randy Freakin' Rhodes, it says.

[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.100]
Yeah, Freakin' Randy.

[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.600]
She's, uh, it's not a pretty sight.

[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.580]
Here's one from Mike.

[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.540]
It says that what's not politically correct to say, you know, that the Neocons are indifferent

[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.140]
to the 1800 plus dead in Iraq.

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.880]
That is true.

[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.880]
To them, the number of dead, see, oh, don't forget their slogan, choose life.

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:45.520]
Maybe.

[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.880]
You got to promote a culture laugh.

[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.440]
To them, the number of dead in contested other major wars is nothing.

[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.460]
It's a drop in the bucket.

[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.480]
So just, they probably think they're doing great.

[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.080]
Please use a couple of minutes or a segment to give us idiots.

[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.080]
The condensed laymen's terms version of the whole Israeli versus Palestinian thing.

[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.220]
Why the eviction?

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.420]
Oh, geez.

[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.060]
Oh, it says actually that's more Georgians and won't maybe hold them.

[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:06.780]
Yeah, you do it.

[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.640]
Yeah, well thanks.

[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.600]
You know, you got that nice, very concise article on there that gathers a reality check

[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.160]
that you posted on the website.

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:13.640]
Right.

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.000]
And I don't want to talk about it.

[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.460]
Short and sweet.

[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.160]
No, I don't want to try it on the window.

[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:18.420]

[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.200]
The Arabs and the Jews hate each other like poison, okay?

[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:21.760]
That's it.

[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.180]
That's all you need to know.

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.940]
The Jews hate the Arabs and the Arabs hate the Jews.

[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.380]
That's all you need to know.

[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.020]
And the Israelis and the Palestinians could get along just fine except for the fact that there's

[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.520]
a slice of both populations that are crazy, fanatic or religion is so key.

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.620]
And both populations, they're crazy fanatics.

[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.860]
And of course, when you do know with crazy fundamentalist fanatics, let's get back to Neocons, Mike.

[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.460]
Anyway, Susan Sermand needs to be on the list.

[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.520]
She's average at best.

[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.200]
But we're not talking about average.

[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.780]
So you don't understand that.

[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.340]
Don't you?

[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.000]
I know.

[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.140]
Like, yeah, yeah, I do.

[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.600]
Or maybe Joyce DeWitt.

[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.700]
Who's Joyce DeWitt?

[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.420]
From Threes Company, the other one.

[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.700]
I don't want Threes Company.

[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.200]
He's still dead by the way.

[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.000]
Hey, John Ritter, you fairy.

[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.900]
Was that his show?

[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:01.640]
Yes it was.

[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.680]
In spite of the intolerance you do, please play Thai Tommy.

[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.980]
Now, see, here's a guy that wants to know about the Israelis and the Arabs while they hate each other.

[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.420]
How old?

[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.780]
I'm Tommy from Thai Tommy, saying for the best Thai food and the best service.

[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.560]
As long as you're not black, come on down to Thai Tommy or South East.

[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.260]
We know like black people.

[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.440]
They don't keep well.

[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.240]
Besides, why black people want to eat Thai food anyway?

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.300]
We don't have fried chicken on the menu.

[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.220]
Oh, wait.

[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.080]
I forget.

[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.740]
We have spare ribs.

[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.020]
No, Ching, I saw.

[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.240]
What are spare ribs on menu?

[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.160]
Take out the top.

[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.420]
So, if you're not black, come on down to Thai Tommy.

[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.580]
Come to think of it.

[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.040]
Those damn gay people.

[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.440]
We know like them either.

[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.480]
Should they keep food?

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.700]
But they talk too loud with funny lists.

[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.880]
They serve other customers.

[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.620]
No come back.

[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.720]
So, no gay, no black.

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.100]
And while we're at it, ladded people.

[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.160]
You make reservation for 715.

[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.520]
Don't show up at 820 and explain your table.

[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.140]
We get to somewhere else already.

[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.940]
Ladded people are always lame.

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.520]
No black, no gay, no ladded in Thai Tommy.

[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.380]
And Jewish people, you stop figuring all of them.

[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.500]
Who cares who have what?

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.400]
Take away the anger.

[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.300]
Set it outside.

[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.200]
Take 45 minutes to try to divide up the bill.

[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.540]
We know what you hear.

[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.840]
No Jew, no black, no black, no Cuban.

[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.880]
And white people, you think you better than everybody else.

[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.000]
Come plain too much if we don't kiss your eyes.

[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.140]
You will not come back.

[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.060]
No white, no black, no Jew, no Latino, no gay.

[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.880]
Everybody else for the best Thai food.

[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.420]
Come on down to Thai Tommy, undefeast.

[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.660]
Hurry before we have to close.

[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.160]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.820]
We got skis out there.

[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.840]
All your religionists that won't keep your own furry tails to yourself.

[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.860]
They're always trying to impose on everybody else and pointing at the finger.

[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.560]
They're not going to be any Arab living in my house.

[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.460]
Adam and Adam.

[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.640]
You know, all crazy people.

[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.120]
Yeah.

[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.160]
They're all part of it.

[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.500]
They're all part of it.

[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.440]
They're the cause of it.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.920]
Just like these people that continue to support the most corrupt institution on the face of the globe,

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.080]
being the Catholic church, of course, without any doubt, make the Bush family look like a bunch of Sunday school preachers.

[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.560]
I'm sorry.

[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.180]
In Ramadi, more bad news from Iraq.

[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.100]
I think I like that.

[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.240]
It just doesn't stop.

[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.360]
And you notice how the media gives us a dictating of free pass.

[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.860]
Oh, the insurgency is in its death throws and everything is coming up roses.

[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.480]
They were even playing the song in the background.

[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.480]
Stephen Edy were singing everything is coming up roses.

[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.620]
How do you like them, apples?

[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.420]
In Ramadi, West of Baghdad, gunman open fire with a song.

[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:26.100]
The bell, rifles and rocket propelled grenades at a mosque where the governor of the province was meeting senior Sunni-Muslim clerics witnesses said adding that they were,

[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:26.800]
casualties.

[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.180]
We don't know how many yet, but there's a bunch of dead people.

[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.340]
North of Baghdad, four more US troops were killed today by a roadside bomb.

[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.180]
Raising the US debt told them more than 1860 since the war in Iraq began.

[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.880]
Insurgents appeared to have developed more powerful bombs.

[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.860]
These are the same insurgents that they were just all fallen apart.

[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.620]
That's right.

[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.180]
And kind of Alisa was lying about that.

[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.760]
Of course, that's her speciality like that thing with a mushroom cloud.

[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.560]
You're a liar.

[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.180]
You bitch.

[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.060]
You slut.

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:50.860]
You skank.

[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.480]
You're furry.

[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.080]
In Surgeon Superior, and like they're going to put this show on X-Samon on Sirius, get Sirius.

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.340]
See, they don't mind some guy and they're talking about body parts.

[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.000]
They're about, you know, sexual.

[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:02.960]
So that's fine.

[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.820]
But they don't want anybody under tone.

[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.100]
The truth, they want just fun and games is what they want.

[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]
So Norma can't, it wouldn't.

[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.940]
All the King's horses and all the King's men aren't going to give this show syndicated, including Greg Reed.

[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.720]
Oh yeah, we're working feverishly.

[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.880]
How come I'm not on the station in Vegas, Greg?

[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:17.280]
Huh?

[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.460]
You phony.

[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.240]
You liar.

[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.100]
You...

[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:20.580]
You furry.

[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.280]
Insurgents appear to have developed more powerful bombs, people will appear seeing newly armored US vehicles.

[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.160]
How do you like that?

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.020]
For same insurgents like I just said moments ago, who are like, oh they're just about done.

[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:30.700]
They're finished.

[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.500]
They're going away.

[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.500]
See how they're put there?

[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.500]
They have to go get new bombs.

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.200]
Yeah, we're recruiting for them.

[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:41.020]
We're not doing too good recruiting military at home because people don't want to be human sacrifice instead of going to be killed in it.

[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:46.640]
But at the same time we're doing a great job recruiting for Osama and every other terrorist lunatic organization in the world.

[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.920]
How are we dealing with Osama?

[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.440]
Got him yet?

[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:48.640]
No.

[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.220]
How about the ala Zarkawi?

[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:50.420]
No.

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.640]
An ala...

[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:51.780]
No.

[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.700]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:51.660]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.980]
OKY.

[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.460]
Auto род.

[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:55.460]

[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:55.460]

[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:55.700]
you are.

[00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:03.780]
You know that was that was the stew goods doing a voice stew gots.

[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.440]
The missing leg serial.

[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.000]
The business partner business department note armors.

[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:21.520]
Here we are focusing on you.

[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.380]
demonstration near President Bush's ranch. The vigils were urged by our close

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:29.060]
personal friend Cindy Sheen or is that she-han? Maybe that's the rhymes

[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.320]
would like Bill Freehan used to be the catcher for the Tigers. Remember Bill

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.420]
Freehan, Josh? Of course not. Now, who's become the icon of the anti-war movement

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.580]
since he started or protested August 6th in memory of her son Casey who died

[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.820]
in Iraq last year? She and Cecil Kamp outside Bush's ranch until his month-long

[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.400]
vacation ends or he meets with her and other grieving families. Don't hold

[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.360]
your breath Cindy. Vigils were playing from coast to coast yesterday according

[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.340]
to organizers liberal advocacy groups move on or political action true majority

[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.200]
and immigrant democracy for America a large vigil was also said at Paris's

[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.100]
peace wall a glass monument near the Eiffel Tower that says peace and 32

[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.060]
languages shall own as the sun set in Crawford about a hundred protesters

[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.260]
lived candles and placed them in plastic cups to shield them from the breeze

[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.320]
they gaffed around a wooden flag-raped coffin. Oh, maybe they can put that on display

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.040]
in that Tampa at that museum. In Concord, New Hampshire that's conquered as

[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.060]
opposed to Concord, Michigan. Got it. Got it. In Concord, New Hampshire, about

[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.800]
150 people stood shoulder to shoulder yesterday outside of the state house

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.160]
holding candles and signed supporting she in Karen Brass 50 brought a pink

[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.340]
votive cup. What is that? What's a votive cup? Decorative. I see. Shape-like flower

[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.140]
petals and a sign that reads moms for peace. My son is 26. It could have been

[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.400]
him she said for voice breaking. So, Frederick Casey, I don't think she said that

[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.480]
but that's probably what she was thinking. In other words, people always feel bad

[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.580]
about somebody else's tragedy but in the back of their mind they're thinking, well,

[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.100]
better you than me. Right. I mean, you know, it's not

[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.800]
nice to say that but it's true. It's exactly right. It's like when you go to a

[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.020]
woodbine and the people, you know, pretending, oh, come on, get a big one, you get a spin

[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.160]
and they're hoping you get like 20 and that you leave the machine and they can

[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.340]
go and grab up all your cash because they think it's a good machine, man. Yeah,

[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.300]
they pretend to be rooting for it. I mean, in time that they're all

[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.100]
falsies. They want to come in and throw in three bucks and get like, you know,

[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:16.160]
16,000. Some of you wouldn't be big. That really fries their end. Yeah. Limbaugh's

[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.640]
lawyer is speaking of big. Win ruling to fight questioning of doctors. See, it's

[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.520]
not all good news. Palm Beach County prosecutors wanted to ask what a

[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.620]
West Limbaugh's doctor is Tuesday morning about the radio host prescription

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.380]
drug use for Limbaugh's attorneys won a last-minute court hearing that could

[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.520]
jeopardize the future of the investigation. Palm Beach County judge ruled

[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.300]
to do that unless you talk about this yesterday. Do you talk about this yesterday?

[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.500]
No, I did not. Oh, I don't want to waste anybody's time repeating the same crap

[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.480]
you put on. Palm Beach County judge ruled to did it. Prosecutors couldn't question

[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.400]
any of Limbaugh's doctors about first notifying Limbaugh. That would give Limbaugh's

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.240]
lawyers a chance to fight the subpoena issued a question to the doctor and

[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.800]
raised privacy concerns before a judge. Limbaugh 54 of Palm Beach

[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.780]
whereas Peranto has not been charged with any crimes. He's been under investigation

[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.180]
for suspected doctor shopping but a beep but a beep but a beep. Palm Beach County

[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.900]
state attorneys office spokesman Michael Edminson would not comment on the

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.180]
development and he spoke for Limbaugh attorney where black said black would not

[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.240]
comment so it's quite a stray nobody's nobody's saying nothing. Three-and-a-two

[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.180]
votes were almost halfway to our 700. We don't get 700 you're gonna see you're

[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.060]
gonna see some real action that Jackson babies they say Jackson and

[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.460]

Betty Davis five hope a Goldberg has got a pair and look who else has got a

[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:53.660]

[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.880]
kind of looks like a guy. No comment. No I mean is that bad to say that? She looks

[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.660]
like a guy. Here's the fact that says with regards to the story about the

[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.660]
lady who paid the kids with a fake fifty dollar bill when you care to

[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.560]
explain how a woman is able to pee on offense just wondering.

[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:13.820]
You got a fratical acrobatic. I don't see why not. Maybe she was like a

[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.860]
hovering on it over it. Yeah maybe she had squatters rights maybe she was

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.960]
squatting on it. I don't know. Jesus that's the most important thing you've got

[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.580]
to worry about. I have no right. Although it is a good point. I did wonder that

[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.060]
as I read it you know. Maybe like on an angle. Maybe you know what I'm under back.

[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.960]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and he provides them a singular

[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.020]
wireless line. Let's talk about laytub for four hours today and get them all lined

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.820]
up over there. I tried to find that Mike Mayer story online doing that couldn't

[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.360]
find it too far back I guess. And then also I guess Citilink also had something

[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.460]
in there because I did a little Google on laytub and Citilink must have also

[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:54.040]
given him a you know I can't help it that they don't want any more business all

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.280]
right. If you got a good product like when it does branch out a little bit

[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.860]
right right people want it if it's good they want it. How dare you have

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.100]
something so good like try to withhold it from the public out there. Well they

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.780]
must have Zidians of people lined up. So we do need to find out. Do they really

[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.240]
do they stop selling the cheeseburgers? Maybe somebody from there who's close

[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.260]
to them. No, now somebody will know. Call it fast. Somebody will either know

[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.000]
where they'll just make it up and we'll pass it along. I am about that

and they make a record number one. They get a laptop, they're a Playstation

[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:43.900]
around the world. Most musical guy but I'm not surprised. That's a record guy.

[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:51.440]
He's pale. Big face, big face, pale. Big face, big face, pale.

[00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:00.340]
I'm 18.5.62 A.M. In the National Examiner, boy it's good that I got these tablets.

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.760]
You know I got some really good craft. You got to remind me I got out of the habit of doing that.

[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.760]
Right. Don't forget the tablet. It's in the tabloids. It's in there. Like late tub.

[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.880]
Maryland's sex secrets in her own words. Secret audio tapes release 43 years after

[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.380]
Maryland Monroe's death reveal sensational new details of her sex life and her

[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.460]
relationships with some of Hollywood's biggest stars all in her own words.

[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:24.220]
The screen legend makes a series of scandalous confessions such as how Joan Crawford

[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.720]
turned on her after they had lesbian fling and Maryland refused an encore performance.

[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.700]
I mean was there any doubt? You just you knew by those shoulder pads about Joan right?

[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.660]
Shockingly the some like at hot star also revealed she faked orgasms with all her Hollywood lovers

[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.140]
until a psychiatrist taught her how to climax. The previously unknown. Can we say climax?

[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.960]
Did you run it by death? Ah taught her how to put the context.

[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:51.420]
The previously unknown Maryland secrets are revealed in transcripts of tape recording she made for her psychiatrist Dr. Ralph

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.300]
Greenson which have recently been on earth. The tapes recorded just a month before the

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.940]
blonde bombshell's death August 5th 62 before a murder.

[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:02.120]
He had no indication that she was suicidal and took her own life as famous LA corner

[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.320]
Dr. Thomas Nuguchi concluded well he's full of it and the tapes Maryland says of these famous

[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.160]
characters Joan Crawford we went to Jones bedroom Crawford had a gigantic orgasm

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.380]
and shrieked like a maniac. Next time I saw her she nodded another round.

[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.900]
I told her I didn't much enjoy doing it with a woman after I turned her down she became

[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.620]
spiteful and said some mean things about me. She wanted it. Clark Gabel in the kissing scenes I kissed

[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.720]
him with real affection. I didn't want to go to bed with him but I wanted him to know how

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.740]
much I liked and appreciated him. When I came back from a day off the set he patted my ass

[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.820]
and told me if I didn't behave myself he gave me a good spanking. I looked him in the eye and said don't

[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.900]
tempt me. He burst out laughing so hard he was tearing. It was different when I got to know him

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.460]
and then I wanted him to be my father. I wouldn't care if he spank me as long as he wanted

[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:47.500]
as he made up for it by hugging me and telling me I was dead he's a little girl and he loved me.

[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:51.940]
Of course that's a fantasy. Frank Sinatra what a wonderful friend he is to me.

[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.600]
I love Frank and he loves me says Maryland. It is not the mirroring kind of love it's better because

[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:01.280]
marriage can't destroy it. How well I know marriage destroyed my relationship with two wonderful men.

[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.100]
Joe DiMaggio. Well how come he wasn't on our that's right he wasn't a radio or TV or movies.

[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:11.860]
Boy you talk about ugly she always he made everybody she married but yeah was just gruesome.

[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.000]
Oh Joe D loves Maryland we're always will I love him and always will but Joe couldn't stay married to

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.840]
Maryland or the famous movie star she said Joe has an image in suffered his

[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.780]
stubborn tagging head of a traditional tagging wife she had to be faithful to what he tells her to vote all

[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:31.360]
herself to him. Doctor you know that's not me says Maryland and Arthur Miller talk about ugly.

[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.260]
It's different with Arthur marrying him was my mistake not his he couldn't give me the attention once in

[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.440]
a fraction I need it's not in his nature Arthur never credited me with much intelligence.

[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:45.260]
He couldn't share his intellectual life with me as bed partners we were so so he wasn't that much

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.160]
interested you know I think his little Jewish father had more genuine affection for me than Arthur did.

[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:55.720]
And on the subject of sex he says I would win overwhelmingly if the academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms.

[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.420]
I've done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throws of ecstasy after explaining

[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:07.620]
that therapy has helped her reach climax she said bless you doctor I never cried so hard as I did after my first orgasm.

[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:14.040]
I like that well and there's some old guys out there thinking yeah I know how you feel Maryland I never so

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:22.120]
cried the cry so hard it's after my last orgasm. That's bad that's terrible by the way the o-word is definitely out.

[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.740]
I've been you part you keep using that o-word it's in a new story oh what do you mean that word is out.

[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:44.320]
You're full of crap yes I am orgasm is out my ass now you know something we've been playing you own apology to the Ramzis of sorry yeah you own apology because you have been playing that bit.

[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:57.880]
I'm sorry I'm sorry I was killed by my daddy

[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:39.520]
and my dad was the only one who did it.

[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:55.520]
So the examiner has a world exclusive so they say of course the tabloids always have a world exclusive did I say about Lee Tubby I didn't

[00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:10.520]
know what about it this man murdered John Bane and there's a picture of Michael Helgoth but it's a high school photo of the Indian strange looking the twisted Sikko who exports believe murder tiny beauty queen John Bane Ramzis will never be brought to justice because he killed himself.

[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:17.700]
See the one thing about this is that Patty and John whatever his name Ramzis I still hate him yeah I can't stand them.

[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:47.680]
I just they give me spiel keys I can't handle looking at him I like the investigation discovered compelling to evidence and the examiner can now name the killer how do you like that oh my god he is Michael Helgoth a tattoo 26 year old salvage yard operator obsessed with young girls guns and violence what a combination sounds like the duks of hazard and top private investigators on a grand David Williams have worked the unsolved zombie murder also believe Helgoth had an accomplice who was still lurking out there he's out there just like full of sports.

[00:57:47.680 --> 00:58:17.660]
He's out there somewhere 60 year old John Bane was found beaten strangled and molested in the basement of repair while we know that I ironically Helgoth apparently shot himself to death on Valentine's Day 97 the day after boulders history attorney Alex Hunter Asian to public statement designed to shake up John Bane's killer and flush him out into the open I want to say something to the person or persons who took this baby from us the list of suspects and narrows Hunter said soon there will be no one on the list but you message was put together by FBI experts specifically to put pressure on the killer making the story.

[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:30.320]
He's went and hopefully turned himself in what's that turning himself in he did himself in or maybe just did himself items that Helgoth suicide seen also point to him as the killer say sources police found a pair of high tech boots and an air tater stump gun in the house.

[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:47.140]
And it goes on about how he had the weird stuff he was fixated with young girls Barbie dolls guns and killing him routinely shot to the stray animals he decorated his body with grizzly tattoos one of the grim reaper with the word next and another of blood dripping skull.

[00:58:47.580 --> 00:59:17.120]
It sounds like you're a starter to me you know you can have no tattoos so anyway there's the deal supposedly he did this it's a long story gone by the example of anything we're all about late pubs in Hollywood on Hollywood Beach and what a great fantastic cheeseburger do we ever get any verification are they still are they still serving them making them sell them no word yet why not all these people that are fashionist about late tub let's get an update okay let's find out we don't want to send people all the way over to the A1A in Hollywood I would abide by your Johnson Street and then have a

[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:31.800]

[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:13.900]
I noticed that the right way is using this broad hey man to fair to Schmier Sinti Sieni you know the Schmier and Schmier the queer thing yeah that's what they're doing and it's not going to work because all you're doing is preaching the same right

[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:23.620]

[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.460]

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.820]
supposed to be a calmness who doesn't have any opinions of his own he has no opinion anyway getting back to iron

[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.180]
Mike your favorite Mike Tyson is denying charges that he grabbed a woman off an attacking dance floor

[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.780]
dragged her to her in his yacht and pummeled her when she refused to indulge in sex and drugs police

[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.860]
questions I said after we returned to his yacht summer wind after he just spent the night at this

[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.940]
saying he was a good boy and not a killer and Italian police officer told the Scotsman newspaper

[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:46.140]
he's a good boy now if you call him a good boy he'd like uh by yeah or have an issue or something

[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:52.240]

[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:13.400]
I prefer La Quaria de La Sera myself uh do you know that a bunch of mobsters and uh

[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.600]
Vatican people I bought that newspaper years ago and uh so they could brainwash the public with

[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.000]
right wind crap then that was before the current owner here our Quaria de La Sera like I said I

[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.920]
just like saying it but totally alleged Tyson 39 brought out of the hundred foot yacht and

[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.140]
punched her when she refused to do drugs and have sex with him Tyson kept shouting at me until

[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.120]
his bodyguard told him to calm down and stop because he was going over the top which I think

[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.320]
is probably what had in mind she said a bodyguard man in fact maybe he was gonna pee on the fence

[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.860]
she said a bodyguard helped smuggle her off the yacht in a dinghy and she came in and

maize crops that the 40 tons of marijuana had been planted among his vestia daily reports there

[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.540]
silly and around somewhere speaking of that an army intelligence officer said yesterday he

[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:38.200]
told members from the 9-11 commission that a secret military unit had identified two of the three

[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.080]
cells involved in the 2001 terrorist rights more than a year before the attacks lieutenant

[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.380]
Colonel Anthony Schaeffer who said he was associated with the able danger unit said that during

[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:52.920]
a 2003 meeting in Afghanistan he mentioned that the unit identified 9-11 ringleader Mohammed Ata

[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.920]
along with three other hijackers is terrorist suspects this is the little more on the

[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.380]
story that we had to do the commission is denied that aftaz name or the name of any future hijackers

[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.920]
are mentioned during the meeting three months later in January 2004 Schaeffer said he was back in

[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.600]
the USA and offered to follow up with the commission but his offer was declined i just walked away

[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.720]
shocked that they would kind of change their mind but i figured someone with equal or better knowledge

[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.360]
probably came and talked to them so they must have taken care of it Schaeffer said he said he was

[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:23.300]
told the commission obtained only two briefcase sides loads of documents from at least 15 plus boxes

[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.020]
of information on able danger lieutenant Colonel Chris Conway a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday

[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:33.660]
an investigation into able danger was underway and of course most people would know able danger from

[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:39.820]
Sid Abel am I right who absolutely absolutely by the way don't forget Mohawar David special hockey

they were gonna blow you out of that building like you you wouldn't know what hit you

[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.220]
i said i'll see you the guys got a squeaky voice but he's got a wife and kid yeah see that's me

[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.480]
on the air are real bastard but you know under the under the uh skin a real old softly you know

[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.920]
Well, the Doi Myster himself will be along with a duily honest hit.

[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.900]
I guess in honor of what's happening in Gaza strip, when you say, sure, that's appropriate.

[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.980]
Good news is they finally got an offer that all the, even the BBC finally got off that crap.

[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:50.140]
We've seen enough of those extremist lunatics and let me just say this is if there was any doubt, brainwashing really works.

[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.840]
Sure. Just take a look at those crazy kids there, brainwashing.

[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.140]
They're like flailing and they're wailing and they're crazy guys with the boxes on their head and the schmata.

[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.660]
The brainwashing really works. See, a brainwashing didn't work.

[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:06.460]
There wouldn't be any religion in them and we wouldn't have all these people killing, people killing each other.

[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.600]
Speak in a killing. See, I guess that must be out, out of touch really.

[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.460]
Because like all this business about the BTK killer, I still thought that the BTK had sent into a sandwich at a fast food joint.

[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:22.980]
That's right. Do you know anything about that? Did you ever hear the BTK killer before all this media hype started?

[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.180]
Oh, once before.

[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.240]
I never heard of it. I don't even know who he is or what it's all about or where it happened.

[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:36.040]
I don't care. There he is. I mean, that's what the media keeps, oh yeah, you better care because they just had the trial and he just got, I don't care.

[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.400]
Here's a couple more for the list. Bob and Fort Lauderdale suggest Kathy Bates.

[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.320]
And I thought of another good one that we could never leave off our list.

[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.760]
Somebody who said more face jobs and Carter's got pills. Yeah.

[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.280]
Joanne Rivers. Oh yeah. Man, talk about you, Glee. Man, she's the poster child for you, Glee.

[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.160]
With or without the face to lift. Man, Joanne.

[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.940]
So I did a little research there online. Thank God for the internet. Thank you, Al Gore.

[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:05.580]
And I looked up, I did a Google search on Laytub. I know they don't want to publish it. I'm definitely not recommending you go there.

[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.120]
Right. No. That's the fact.

[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.860]
1100 North Ocean Drive in Hollywood, average price 20 bucks, special features outdoor seating.

[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.160]
And then it's got some reviews from TripAdvisor. This is TripAdvisor as the website. Got it. Got it.

[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:25.300]
And Tampico, Mexico says burgers met expectations huge and juicy grill of perfection.

[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.960]
Chili was also great. Let's see. This is how a burger should be.

[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.560]
Says somebody from Voka. This place is overflowing with character.

[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.340]
Those who don't get it don't belong. The burger was incredible.

[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.080]
Voka, like that. Here's some member from Fort Lauderdale.

[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.780]
So they've been going to this place for years. Love the food, the view and the atmosphere.

[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.120]
Somebody in the member of Miami says, having sea icing. In fact, I printed that one out.

[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.260]
Oh, no, I think I got a spider bite. I'm not.

[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.100]
Oh, no. You're not.

[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.440]
Having seen the rating of Laytub as the best hamburgers in the area, we decided to go there with

[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:01.160]
friends to somebody in Miami. The place looked funky but nice. And then the horror show started.

[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.400]
We waited 15 minutes for our drinks. Then we were told it was shift chain and our waitress could

[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.820]
not take our order for dinner. We waited another 15 minutes and told that we couldn't order till 7 p.m.

[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:14.000]
15 minutes later, we finally got a waitress on the new shift and we're told that it would take

[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.680]
from an hour to an hour and a half to get our order. When we complained, we were told it was bad

[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.060]
timing. We left and went down the street to Capone's Flickr Life where the food and service were

[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:28.520]
great. How do you like that? All right. So see, there's a negative. Here's a member in North

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.000]
Miami Beach who says, try the seafood salad and seafood gumbo. It is delicious. We go to

[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.560]
a tub out of regular braces. If I can't get the seafood salad, I don't want anything else. Try it.

[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.580]
You'll like it. Here's somebody in Fort Lauderdale says, a cute place with an atmosphere that is

[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.240]
very cool. Have a few drinks and watch sunset on the intercoastle where you're probably better

[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:50.180]
off going elsewhere for food. Service can be downright horrible, so save your food money for more

[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:56.400]
enjoyable dish. Although the burgers are good, it's 99% bar and 1% grill. So maybe they did do this

[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.640]
continue the burgers because maybe just got to be a pain in the grass. Maybe. Here's one in

[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.320]
the Miami Lakes. It says, I'm not a tourist. I live in South Florida. They tell me it's one of the

[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.740]
coolest places to enjoy a great meal and a margarita. How do you like that? It's a little hold on the

[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.020]
wall hidden away behind vegetation. The restaurant is located on the intercoastle. So you have a beautiful

[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.100]
view of the boats and the sunsets. Many of the tables are situated on a wooden walkway right on the

[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:26.060]
water. So you can feed the fish from your table. Yeah. Do you understand that? Feed the fish from

[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:31.800]
your table? No, it's just feed the fist. Oh, sure that's a type of fish. Sounds fishy to me.

[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.860]
Late tub serve is basic good food. My favorite is the burgers, chili, fish,

[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:41.120]
and nachos. Wonderful, a key lime pie. The staff are just a cherry on the top of the dining

[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.680]
experience at late tub is what that guy says. So you know, all the pans it's like everything else

[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.060]
alive. It's timing. When you went there, how long you had to wait? Whether they had anybody working

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:56.800]
out all of these things. How many QAAM? Hello? Hey, how you doing? I've had one for Neil. Yeah.

[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.500]
Oh, good morning, Neil. How are you? Good. But, um, Belkies, Narei.

[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.840]
Schokies, Narei. She's grotesque. She is grotesque. Okay, thank you. Have a good time.

[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.340]
It's big on a channel seven. What's that woman doing with a bitch with a cat eyes? What's her

[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.620]
cinnamon stofr? Maryland, Nitsl. Oh, Maryland, Nitsl. And also cinnamon stofr, although I do like

[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:22.280]
her frozen peppers. You're gonna have to have green peppers stuffed peppers like jalapeno peppers?

[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.160]
No, it's the big, the big get out of here with like, oh, brother, stuffed green peppers,

[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:32.080]
stuffed green peppers. Yeah. Beef, man. Sure. Yummy. Love those stuffed cabbages.

[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.860]
Oh, here may be the winner, Greta van Sustorin. Oh, yeah. And, speaking of that, how soon I forget,

[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.700]
you know, I give you like a little audio as to Wells Bologna's on there. She was on one of our

[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:46.540]
polls the other day. That's pretty graphic stuff. This is the dentist rater. Basically naked, right?

[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.720]
Hanging up, died down. Yeah. You ought to be naked hanging up. That's a horrible thought. Just

[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.960]
hanging upside down. Rita. Rita Cosby on MSNBC is they've reached the bottom. Get her ass on her.

[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:03.800]
She is grotesque and Greta van Sustorin. I don't think she's a hottie. But then he got hit

[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.260]
in the head so many times playing football. What does he know? He can't see well. I always saw.

[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.120]
I guess he wasn't playing football when he got married because he saw pretty good there.

[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.540]
But nevertheless, Ellis Henneken in Newsday writes, now you've been hearing all the stuff about

[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:19.260]
the president about his reading material this summer. They've been trying to pass him off as

[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:24.200]
like some kind of an intellectual. Like, uh, Abu Gharra. Yeah, right. Yeah, I'm convinced.

[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.080]
Did you see that? No. Oh, yeah, they've had that surround regular. Now more part of the propaganda

[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.720]
that CNN more just gleefully passes along. So Ellis Henneken writes, Bush, a bookworm,

[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.040]
Bush, take it with a grain of salt because one of the books he's supposedly reading is salt.

[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.120]
Come on. What is George Bush really reading this summer at the ranch? And don't say

[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.260]
Middle East for dummies or where's Waldo? Those WMDs have to be here somewhere or duck for

[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.320]
president of Bridged. The White House is trying to put an end to Bush Jad just like those,

[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.700]
which is why Bush's people just put out that official presidential summer reading list,

[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:00.320]
three smart guy books supposedly being devoured by a man who almost never gets accused of excessive

[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.620]
vocationists. Alexander the second, the last rates are by Edvard Brzynski, the great influenza,

[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.780]
the epics story of the deadliest plague in history by John Ambiri, and salt, a world history by

[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.860]
Mark Kohlanski. That's some presidential reading, huh? There we say a downright Clintonesque.

[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.260]
Obviously, we're a long way from car and driver magazine. Quite a distance from those

[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.640]
kinky Friedman Texas mystery vegouts. This is clearly not what is known in New York publishing

[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.460]
circles as your typical loan star ranch read. Heck, any one of those titles would rank as a high

[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.960]
fallout in this August on Georgia, Japan and Bush's hunkered down and Crawford pouring through all three.

[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.860]
So the White House told the LA Times generating the big Bush read scoop. These are the other

[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:43.200]
kinds of books that serious world leaders are supposed to read. Heavy on history, be speaking in

[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.100]
intense intellectual curiosity and long, definitely long at 480, 446 and 484 pages. Okay,

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.080]
not as long as the New Harry Potter, but pretty darn long, especially for President of the

[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.160]
League five weeks vacation, a lot of brush to clear. But there is one question bubbling like a

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.120]
tense cent pot boiler in the Texas dry air. A question that a single slow news day is made

[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.400]
impossible to ignore. Is George W. Bush actually reading any of these big brainbusters?

[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.580]
Oh, or are they just, you know, sitting there? There is a difference as every American sixth

[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.320]
grader knows between the books on the summer reading list and the books that actually get read.

[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:20.320]
And Bush is lucky here in one crucial way the American presidency is far more forgiving than sixth

[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.860]
grade. There are no pop quizzes for presidents and no tedious book reports. Just official White House

[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:31.080]
spokesman passing out eye popping book titles to the press. So for now at least we'll have to take

[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.700]
the president's people at their word. Either that or turn to whatever it is available and speculate.

[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:38.920]
Perhaps there's a reason no one ever referred to George W. Bush as America's first bookworm.

[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.220]
Could the reason really be were we never told what was stacked on his bedside table?

[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.240]
Believe it if you want to. It's a grander political literary issue I'm focused on.

[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:50.760]
Who exactly is Bush trying to kid? A man who still can't pronounce nuclear. A man who thinks

[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.280]
misunderestimated an English verb. A man who wants to go about the C students at Yale graduation

[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.460]
and declared encouragingly. You two can be president of the United States. This man wants a

[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.860]
America to believe he's reading a densely researched history of the troubled reign of the Tsar,

[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:08.060]
who ruled Russia from 1855 to 1881, translated from the original Russian. Without a bunch of

[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:12.500]
pictures to light in the literary load life is full of surprises isn't it? Some people might say

[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.400]
it's a sign of intellectual insecurity for president to align himself with such a rainy reading list.

[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:20.420]
Ronald Reagan's people never did that. No literary errors for the great communicator. We so

[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.520]
need to pretend he was scouring heavyweight tomes. When asked about his reading habits he mentioned

[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.660]
Tom Clancy's the Huffa Red October and readers digest magazine. Now that's communicating.

[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:33.080]
But of course it's always a mistake to accuse George W. Bush of being dumb. Whatever his real

[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.500]
reading habits might say about him. People who say he's dumb almost always regret it. This is a man

[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.160]
after all who somehow managed to get himself elected president twice, well at least once.

[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.580]
And looking back how much did the brainiac vote help carry in Gore? There has to be a book there.

[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:53.200]
There's somewhere. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.6.2.8.

[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.560]
Listen to Jamie. I like to relax by having Mary Magdal and recite my balls while listening to the

[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:05.400]
Neil Rogers welcome one hour. Okay. The makers of rock star in excess. And all you the girl

[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.120]
is another unwatchable reality show looking to replace a deadly singer. Mark Bernan

[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.460]
brings 15 and a best undiscovered talent from around the world to New York City.

[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.520]
The opportunity of a lifetime. Bravo for the end.

[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.880]
The two remaining living members of the group are making a comeback. Here's Genesis guitars

[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:47.500]
from my brother. It was your I completely awful rock when he died. I mean I couldn't get over it.

[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:53.960]
I'm not dead. When I heard the news I was like dead mistake. Right here the Charlie Brown looking

[01:20:53.960 --> 01:21:00.400]
guy. It was crushing. Here's Genesis keyboard player Tony Banks. What was bleak bleak

[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.720]
was brought by the whole thing. I can't even remember the funeral. There was no funeral.

[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:12.480]
I see you guys. It was just all down here. All drug and alcohol and I was so upset.

[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.360]
What's wrong with you guys. I'm right here. I'm not dead. Here's your chance to replace the late

[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:26.600]
great filled cowards. Late great watch. Pop star Genesis from Mark Bernan. Why are you doing this to me?

[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.200]
You're dead. No, not. I'm not dead. No you're dead. We could not show up if you were dead.

[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.440]
I'm a guy. I don't need that. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Step on him. It's a 1202 or 560 WC.

[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.160]
We got 418 votes on him. We're gonna make 700 a day. I'm telling you I can smell it.

[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.160]
Man. Can I smell it? Are you sure you're smelling that? Frank says one of the greatest moments in

[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.640]
News Media history was the night of the runaway bride turning up in New Mexico. I woke up in the

[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.040]
middle of the night to see the breaking news that she was found alive. I breathed the sigh

[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.720]
relief like everybody else. Oh, thank God. But watching Greta was making me sick because she was

[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.200]
doing what our news media seems to be doing a lot lately. Pushing God down our throat is the

[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.760]
savior of the runaway bride. The great moment was reported after an hour of constant God this and

[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.640]
God that it came to a sudden of halt when the truth was reported. So God must have saved all those

[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.260]
people on the air France plane that went off the runaway here at Pearson Airport. That must have

[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:21.860]
been God doing it. But God don't like them Greeks. So when they had that little problem over there,

[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.520]
they all like they ran out of air and out of oxygen. God could easily like put a little hole

[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.480]
on the side of the plane so that the air could get in. Well, they looked at them Greek Orthodox.

[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.080]
Oh, I know. He don't like them at all. He don't like them smelt as they were. Very bad dresses.

[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.500]
Now, here's the fact that it says, oh, it's about late tub. What's that?

[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:44.300]
Late tub could be eaten. We need late dump. Oh, no. Well, this is good. They probably sent

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:48.040]
themselves to discourage anybody from going there. They're probably just overwhelmed. It says,

[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:53.720]
it sucks. Dirty hot, surly no parking, nasty, service of any. Slow average food at best. The

[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:58.820]
last time I was there I threatened to feed the waiter to the fish. He sleeps with the fishes now.

[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:03.960]
Just like Luca Brasi is one of those places that think it's cute to abuse their customers. Oh,

[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.920]
kind of like the rascal house. They definitely had that if you don't like it, get lost mentality.

[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:14.200]
Never ever again. It's perfect for mass, massacrific suits. PSI've been there by boat and by land.

[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.880]
They're equal opportunity a hole. Oh, boy. How do you like that? When you come by boat or by land?

[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.220]
I'll throw it out of the sky. Maybe you can do like a skydive like that, broad and Wyoming once.

[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.000]
Ooh. Is rainy troops storm the synagogue? See, they're taking up all this news like this is

[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.520]
really big stuff all the time with this new so-called news because now we don't have to talk about

[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.520]
what's happening in Iraq and all the dead people. That's right. And the murder and bloodshed

[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.600]
and about Carl Rove and Valerie Plame and about all that stuff, all I abled danger with all these

[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.980]
things. I have to crack about that because we can keep showing this. Oh, look at those

[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:53.160]
Israeli troops. Look at those crazy Jews. I got through a very difficult time and the protest.

[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:58.020]
I wonder if the BPC is that's fixated with this crap, you think? Outside that door.

[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:04.460]
This is a court struggle here. There were others in the synagogue, the base inside the synagogue

[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.580]
that have already been evacuated in a moment. I wonder if you see if the BPC is a-

[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:14.080]
I'm sussing over this crap, huh? Yes, they got the BPC on there because CBC is on strike.

[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.920]
Do you know that? No, I did not. Well, that's why they're not doing their own news right now.

[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:20.980]
We're seriously would be so they got the same BPC on there, but better audio.

[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.160]
The Carl Rove settlement or have some come from other settlements even in the West Bank?

[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:31.120]
Yes. Oh, and if you think this is exciting, just wait. This is just child play. What's going on

[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.700]
there now? Oh, yeah. Anybody count your kosher chickens before they lay a big one? Just wait

[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:41.700]
until they start to try to disband the settlements in the West Bank and host Jerusalem. Then

[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.920]
they're going to be shrine and crying. Then you're going to see some real heavy duty crap.

[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:51.620]
But nevertheless, brainwashed, sad, pathetic. You know, some of these people could be nice people.

[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.700]
They need to be deprogrammed. Some of these is- most of these people are kids, they're pumped

[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.540]
out. They need to be deprogrammed. Maybe they could have a real life ahead of them.

[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:02.080]
Send them to Brooklyn so they can show rocks at the conservative Jews.

[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.100]
Michael Jackson find for a mist hearing. Oh, he's got more tourists, baby.

[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.800]
And I rate judge in New Orleans, Smith by Michael Jackson's favor to have his lawyer show

[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:18.480]
for a hearing in a civil case, find the singer $10,000 yesterday. Jackson was a no-show and had no

[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.960]
lawyer president at his lie hearing in the case accusing him of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old

[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.380]
man during the 1984 World Spare Jackson that dies the accusations. Jackson attorney Charles F.

[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:38.080]
Gay Jr. that Charles F. Gay Jr. told US District Judge Eldon Fallon. I wonder if he's

[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.060]
for the court date was lost in the confusion of Jackson's Channel Station trial in California.

[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.920]
The sentence for the New Orleans Court appearance arrived on June 13, the day that the jury

[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.580]
acquitted Jackson even though there was two on a seller books. I would like to point out that

[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.200]
June 13 was probably the most anxious day of Michael Jackson's life. Gay said,

[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.360]
Gay told the judge that during the trial Jackson was not eating or sleeping and was worried about

[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.080]
his and his children's futures. The order of June 13 did not get in the proper people's hands because

[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.880]
of the chaos in Michael Jackson's life. Gay said. The judge said he did not feel it was

[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.080]
appropriate to find Jackson for contempt but said he was not sold on gates. Excuse either,

[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:16.680]
so he levied other fines related to court costs. It strains my understanding of the facts that

[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.280]
Mr. Jackson didn't know this matter Fallon said. In the federal civil lawsuit Joseph Thomas

[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:27.460]
Bartucci Jr. Coochie Coochie, let's molest Bartucci, claims he was learned in Jackson's limousine

[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.420]
by one of the singers and boys in 1984 held against his will for days and sexually assaulted

[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:37.600]
Bartucci claims he repressed the memories until 2003 when he saw the coverage of the

[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.640]
child molestation charges against Jackson. Bartucci is seeking unspressedified monetary

[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.640]
compensation from Jackson on a variety of claims such as emotional distress. Bartucci's attorney

[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:55.080]
William A. Pig, being a gay and pig, said he was with two G's, said he'll push for an early

[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.080]
trial date. My kind has been under a great deal of stress. Pig said he's been the victim of

[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.420]
character assassination. This is kind of like starting to remind me of animal farm by George

[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:08.580]
Orwell now. Even the pigs are talking. Jackson's lawyer, that's the case, we'll go to trial.

[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.820]
There is a one year statute of limitations from the time Bartucci claims he regained his memory.

[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:17.660]
But gay, I'm sorry, but gay, said Bartucci allegedly discussed the allegations with his wife in

[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:22.740]
the 1990s. So you believe whoever you want. All the people are liars. They're just all looking for

[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:28.240]
money, right? No, right. Not that's not what those two jurors said. They want you to buy their book.

[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.280]
426 votes. We're not going to make it, dammit. You better lean on that poll. Real heavy duty,

[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.920]
Josh. We're not going to make it. And then then they're going to get that all music.

[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:54.580]
And the best part of it is we got all those old QM Jingles too, you know. Yeah, we piece a cake.

[01:27:54.580 --> 01:28:00.160]
428 votes on the poll. Who is the all time ugliest female celebrity radio TV or the movies.

[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.860]
And we got Sandra Bernhard 133 votes. Rosie O'Donnell 66. Syria cruises moving to the third place.

[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:11.520]
Nice go and see you. You go boy. A girl 57. Roseanne bar 35. Barbara Streisand 31.

[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.420]
Wopey Goldberg 26. Tammy Fevaker 21. Imaging coca's got 14. Phyllis Dillor 11. Oprah 10.

[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:21.880]
V. Arthur 9. 20. Fields 5. Benny Davis 5. Randy Rhodes. The goddess. What?

[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.700]
Has four. She's got two pair. Oh, I believe that.

[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.260]
Yeah. Kathy Bates one. And so far none for Rita Cosby.

[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.800]
Greta Van Suster. And Spilke's Nere or Joan Rivers. Joan Rivers has no votes. Now, why

[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.440]
would that be? She's a Pike or compared to some of these people. She's a tiger. Are you

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.080]
start with an anti-Semitic stuff again? Yeah. Now, let me just say Rita Cosby,

[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.620]
maybe you need to have your memory refreshed picture that we're going to show here for the

[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:54.260]
first time. I've Dennis Raider. Pretty graphic stuff. This is actually Dennis Raider.

[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.060]
Basically naked, right? Hanging upside down. Okay. Casey, I don't know who he's the BTK

[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:03.580]
sandwich guy. This is he took one of the corpses to church. And that's a good place for where

[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:08.680]
you have to be a stiff to be in church to be that foolish. Stop subsidizing these petafiles and

[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:14.640]
lunatics and the peddlers of garbage. Okay. These liars or or not, you won't do it. Diversity

[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.220]
panel faces hiatus. Well, this is great from the Harold. In the wake of the bruising, embarrassing fight

[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.880]
over the we are a family video, the Broward School Board will likely temporarily dispatch

[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.780]
diversity committee next week while it brings storms ways to get the controversial panel on track.

[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:35.500]
As they say in China, Dothos Xavier Lothoncope, okay? Now, what they say in China? Every day.

[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.000]
Board members are tired of the bad publicity the committee is brought, but some community leaders

[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.240]
are concerned. The school board will derail the panel's principal task of monitoring and

[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.140]
equity lawsuit settlement. This will push us back months at Bill Retinger, the diversity committee

[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.240]
chairperson. He said the committee is currently conducting site visits to schools, making sure

[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.640]
that buildings are safe and clean. There were a lot of good people on the committee and they're

[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.620]
working hard, Retinger said. The diversity committee was tasked five years ago with monitoring

[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:06.300]
the district's compliance with the lawsuit settlement. Citizens concerned for our children

[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:14.020]
had filed a sue to ensure equity between predominantly black schools and white schools. The school

[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.320]
activists and CCC member Marty Furtig, I'm not sure how they're going to get it out on time.

[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.680]
Board members wanted to vote Tuesday and whether this is off the panel for two months, but

[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.940]
school board attorney Bob DiGnola said any vote needs to be advertised to the public. Many board

[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.680]
members were disgusted by comments made during the committee's discussion of the video, which

[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:35.300]
features popular cartoon characters teaching tolerance. The diversity committee rejected using

[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.840]
the video in schools as did a screening panel created by Superintendent Frank Till.

[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:43.700]
Former committee member Steve Kane, a conservative self-hating radio taught show host,

[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.720]
Carl Gay activist, devious, devious people. Mr. Hummalfold, and its August third meeting,

[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.460]
the school board reaffirmed its policies to her tolerance and diversity and distance itself

[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:57.140]
from comments made by some committee members. I'm tired of this board being labeled as big

[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.760]
it said board member Marine didn't in Tuesday. I don't want this committee to meet again until we

[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:05.040]
have a workshop on it. Oh, let's have a workshop. What do you say? All right, I'll bring the tools.

[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.220]
The board of schedule meeting again in September to discuss ways to revamp the panel. Two

[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:12.460]
days this in the schedule of what was meant was cheers by gay activists who said some members of

[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.020]
the panel have violated the school district's own policy concerning tolerance, which for

[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:20.360]
her hivots discrimination on a number of characteristics, including sexual orientation. You fairy.

[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:25.280]
Kane stepped down last week saying he didn't want his presence on the board to become a distraction.

[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:30.260]
Right. School board member Marty Rubenstein who appointed Kane two years ago, sadly,

[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:34.240]
said last month he removed came from the panel, but they didn't. Some activists said the board

[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.140]
needs the part to remove any member of any committee via a majority vote. Rubenstein didn't

[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:41.820]
speak it to his meeting with a seven-to-half-year-old. The president is a valuable member because he

[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:47.300]
cares deeply about equity issues and has adopted 75 black children. Melissa Foto of the dolphins

[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.840]
Democrats blasted Rubenstein for not taking Kane off the panel saying he's a puppet for a bigger

[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.740]
agenda. Board Chairwoman Stephanie Crabson, she's not sure how the board plans to ensure

[01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:03.180]
committee members respect district policy. Oh, very sad. Very sad, Mr. Evel, Mr. Homo Fobot,

[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:08.120]
and there's just a lot of people wasting a lot of time. It's basically what it's all about.

[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:13.000]
Now, there's no confusence with the real picture. The real task at hand here. Let's just get

[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.560]
all bogged down. In fact, we got some bigots on the committee, some homophobic. 12, 14 and 5,

[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:23.420]
60. Maybe Steve is still suffering angst over his previous homosexual experiences. They always

[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:27.820]
used to rave about and brag about when he was when he was, you know, his other persona was on

[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:33.780]
here. Mr. Prover. Now he's Mr. Born again. Goody Tushes, right wing. You know, for years, Armstrong

family plan today. Drive a little and save yourself thousands and thousands of dollars at Armstrong

[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:49.040]
Ford of homestead. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.69 AF.

[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:58.340]
Hello, Jenny. I just lost 15 pounds just 75 to go.

[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:03.360]
Cursey Ali. How do you know it's me to be a call ID?

[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:09.760]
Better put that battery in the down.

[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:13.040]
And it went from a TV.

[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600]
School.

[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:42.920]
I'll sell friends.

[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.200]
Let's go, let's break open the skirt

[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.880]
Actually not a little skirt

[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.800]
It's a torn feeling

[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.640]
Sexy isn't it?

[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.400]
I see what's the feeling

[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.040]
Have a hidden feeling

[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.540]
Go, go, go, just ignore

[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:04.440]
Take you, let us stop eating

[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.080]
All that rock who keep going

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.480]
Go, go, just ignore

[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.080]
Corgi, go

[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.280]
Make sure you think it's time

[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.420]
And you'll love your little girl

[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.340]
Corgi, go, just ignore

[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.180]
You'll find case

[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.260]
Corgi, go, we're real good boy

[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.960]
And we don't care how much you owe

[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.020]
Corgi, go, go, go

[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.740]
Corgi, I'll miss your baby

[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.320]
And then step down

[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.200]
Rack them

[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.680]
Corgi, go, go, pretty girl

[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.720]
And you got that all over six

[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.980]
Oh yeah, she's real sexy man

[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.660]
Just like an old squash watermelon

[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.860]
Yeah, anyway, Pat, the disgusting, crusty alley is

[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.200]
Somebody says in the facts, let's get her that bitch on there right away

[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.420]
And it says what the hell kind of a name is crusty anyway

[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.780]
I need like a pig to if I were stuck with that name

[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.480]
Good point, maybe it's the name game

[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.440]
Maybe that's the problem

[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.240]
Who's the name game?

[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.060]
We better play that one of these days soon like today

[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:58.480]
Okay

[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.400]
The Obonic's name game

[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.380]
Thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices

[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:05.400]
Before I do that, though, we got 455 votes

[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.260]
We need to get realistic rate of 550 by 1 o'clock

[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.140]
Want to have a shot at 700?

[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:10.120]
When you say that Josh?

[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:10.860]
Yeah

[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.280]
You're paying no attention

[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.760]
Now you got to have a tight fit in crusty alley

[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.300]
Come down

[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.440]
Just relax, boy, he hostile man on man

[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:18.800]
Go around

[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.300]
Holy cow, talk about hostile

[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.880]
Brother, wait till you see where the decimal point is on that next check

[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.560]
In fact, when you open the envelope

[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.300]
Oh, gee, that thing must have fallen out

[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.580]
Let's let's let's let's

[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:29.840]
Yeah

[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.320]
455 votes, we got to get to 550 by 1

[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.480]
457, so let's see, 43

[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.200]
We need about 90 some votes by 1

[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:37.800]
We can do it

[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.160]
There's the Gaza withdrawal

[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.520]
There's still a lot of soldiers on the roof, the soldiers

[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.000]
Of goods and people in and out of the gun

[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.380]
Best drag their asses out of there

[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.620]
They never lived there in the first place

[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.180]
There's a bunch of outsider, Ojohn Prabhakatora

[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:52.240]
Okay, in Florida we had Ojohn Prabhakatora Goim

[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.180]
And then they got Ojohn Prabhakatora Jews

[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:54.700]
Yilaf

[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.340]
Right wing brainwashed punks

[01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:59.040]
I'm not gonna leave, man, God

[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.240]
My favorite though, an old Getski's

[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.980]
With holding the Torah and the holy tablets

[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.440]
Shlip and those out

[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.900]
Oh, it's all fixed with the Torah

[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.360]
Wow

[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.940]
Anyway, thank you for those low gas prices, Mr. President

[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:11.760]
What a bargoon

[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.900]
Gasoline prices at another high today for their 6th-ray record-breaking day

[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.720]
Oh, yeah

[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.340]
According to Travel Club Triple A's Daily Fuel Gage report

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.620]
See, and if anybody doesn't believe that this is gonna like trash the economy

[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.060]
Just like it didn't 73 were made in the air of oil and bargur

[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.360]
They're dreaming, man

[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:30.500]
They're dreaming because every single thing from the food you eat that has to be transported

[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.440]
And the airlines, Delphinon, says they make you a belly-up producer

[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.240]
And they have to go bankrupt

[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:34.980]
Yeah

[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.020]
One thing you won't have to worry about fear of flying anymore

[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.320]
Because there won't be anybody flying the way it's going

[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.220]
The Nationwide average price for a gallon of regular on-lit

[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.020]
It hit 258.5

[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.500]
2.586

[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.240]
Up about 2 cents from the previous day

[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.020]
That's the best part of the deal is it's going up every day

[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.560]
In the last year, prices have gained almost 72 cents

[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.960]
Or almost 39 percent

[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.840]
72 cents in less than a year

[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.280]
While the average price for a gallon of gas is close to 260 gallon

[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.940]
President have jumped past $3 in some individual cities and towns

[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:09.460]
And here in Canada it's like a buckle-lea over a buckle-lea which is like four bucks a gallon, eh?

[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.920]
The average price for a gallon of regular on-lit is highest in California at almost 279

[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.400]
And lowest in Wyoming at 242 but then who the hell wants to go to Wyoming?

[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.460]
Who in the right mind will want to go there?

[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.140]
Except maybe your vice president

[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.300]
And his bulldy-

[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:22.820]
You fairy

[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.640]
And his VS wife

[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.360]
Why don't you still write in those steamy bulldy-like novels, you think?

[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:27.960]
Let's hope

[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:33.060]
56670560, pound-fobble, I sure have a lot of stuff here including all that

[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.480]
Ooh, tabloid, what?

[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.480]
I like stuff

[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.560]
Yeah, but you do, that's what I heard

[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:41.040]
Aging chickens plucked from the jaws of death

[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:41.920]
And guess what?

[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.200]
I never dreamed I'd find another story from Vacuville, California, isn't that where Cindy is from?

[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:46.820]
Vacuville?

[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:47.440]
Yeah

[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.260]
Cindy Sheen, that's where she's from

[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:49.860]
I know I did

[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.600]
Well, yeah, yeah you did, you just weren't paying any attention to that

[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.120]
More than, what is that?

[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.240]
Like her life story or anything, I'm following the protest

[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.160]
But more than 700 aging chickens have been plucked from the jaws of death

[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.960]
A Vacuville animal sanctuary in several human societies

[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.640]
Saved the old cluckers from slaughter after the new owner of a former egg farm reported not knowing what to do with the birds

[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.600]
He inadvertently purchased along with the property

[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.560]
Let's go to summarize Lake and say those old cluckers

[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.360]
Oh, I forgot to mention about what's going to be going on in Boken next week

[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.000]
Inspired by what's happening in Gaza right now

[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:25.340]
Certain groups in Boken decided that they're going to like forcibly come in and drag all the Jews out of Boken

[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.160]
Taking back to Miami Beach all the old Jews

[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.220]
Rescuers hoped to find good homes for the hands which are past their egg laying primes

[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:33.200]
This is the first rescue of this magnitude

[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.000]
I'm aware of California said Cindy Machado, animal service director for the marine human society

[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.980]
What if she's came to Gus Machado, are you think?

[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:40.580]
Sure

[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:46.580]
The developer who purchased the Vacuville land and used the house in the farm contacted the groups to see if they could find homes for the healthiest chickens

[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:51.120]
The new owner was just made to learn that the chickens were still roosting there and planned to kill most of them

[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.560]
While the hundreds of hands spared death is a

[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.200]
Paltry compared with the number of scrawny white leghorn chickens routinely slaughtered once they start producing eggs

[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.400]
The rescue groups were happy to have saved some

[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.540]
Most of the birds never seen sunlight but they're expected to adjust to like away from the farm

[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:10.440]
They've never seen a they were born incubators put in cages about double the size of the floor space of a record album

[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.700]
I don't like that

[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.560]
Poor poor chicken and you're eating that chicken

[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.360]
Yeah

[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.160]
Are you really all the time?

[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:24.100]
Just wait till that avion flu starts getting to South Florida just wait till that I don't think you're gonna be eating too much poultry then I could be wrong with that okay

[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.340]
Stick with that bratwurst man

[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.480]
I went out and bought me a bunch of sliced mushrooms yesterday and onions

[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.800]
Slice up what I do is I cook my bratwurst on my flavor wave deluxe

[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.480]
Mm-hmm

[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.760]
And then I heat up with some olive oil my mushrooms and onions

[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:44.820]
Put a little bit of that low carb sauce on it that pasta sauce and I slice up my bratwurst after it's cooked

[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.340]
And put that all in the fried pan and sort that all around and heat it up man that is just outstanding

[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:56.060]
See today is recommended something they fattening like that damn ice cream he's always raven about like hogging does banana nut

[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:02.840]
And that the stuff that Miguel was raven about again the cold stone creamery you'll be cold and stoned all right after you eat that

[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.580]
Not in that order

[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.660]
It's great stuff

[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:09.020]
Yeah you'll have a tombstone that's one of my favorite names for a product like tombstone pizza

[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:09.700]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:08.060]

[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:29.420]
I will rock it.

[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:30.800]
So slow

[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:43.000]
So slow

[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:08.100]
I'll be jacked up on the stout in service, I'll be ready to pray

[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:12.900]
I'll be standing now, my girlfriend's gonna be up there in the choir now

[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:17.240]
She'll be singing away, sing to her you shall

[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:22.040]
Yeah, it's fine, fine, it's fine, you're down and standing now

[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:26.560]
It's fine, you're shining, it's fine, fine, fine, you're shining

[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:47.140]
Yeah, it's fine, fine, fine, it's fine, you're shining, you're shining

[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:47.220]
Oh, wow

[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:54.720]
FBI

[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.740]
We got this solution maybe right on the right side.

[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:13.240]
Give it to me on Marge's dot com.

[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.340]
When you're voting on our poll, the uses of all of the 700,

[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.060]
I would take a peek on top there.

[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.180]
I forgot to mention that new picture today.

[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:20.800]
That's maybe one of the best of all time.

[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:21.900]
Middle East solution.

[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.460]
And there's your fearless leader with with their health,

[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.580]
Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas.

[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:30.700]
And they're like sitting around and bushes handed to me.

[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.040]
A sick shooter, which you'd expect from W, right?

[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:33.540]
Sure.

[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:36.360]
And he says here you two a whole shoot it out.

[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.820]
I'm tired of effing with you.

[01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:38.780]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.140]
I think that's that's it.

[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.160]
Kevin, I always said that.

[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.360]
Let them all kill each other and let's move on with life.

[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.560]
Let them keep arguing all three of factions.

[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.320]
The Christians and the Jews and the Muslims.

[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.440]
Oh, what at the piece of desert there?

[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:53.680]
Casa Hues, that's my, you know, if you want to kill each other great.

[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:54.920]
Good religiously.

[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.840]
Yeah, leave us out of it.

[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.740]
Just leave us alone and quit forcedness to pay all this 18 bucks a gallon for gas pretty soon, huh?

[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.320]
Have to take a mortgage out on you.

[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.260]
You pull up to the tech and you got to go probably the guy from Dietek will be there.

[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.180]
That guy lost that alone to Dietek.

[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:12.340]
He'll be sitting there right in the right and right in the second mortgage.

[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.540]
You can fill up your SUV.

[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:14.980]
533.

[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:19.700]
You see Josh Cornish didn't think we could make it to Senator votes today because he just doesn't care enough.

[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:23.020]
He's still used to sitting back with us boring guys up in a Marlin game.

[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:26.400]
You know, uh, uh, Marlins won the World Series.

[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.400]
You know, come on, come on crowd.

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.280]
Too many coma people in South Florida on the air doing sports, doing talk, doing everything.

[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:35.400]
Boring people.

[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.240]
There's nothing in the world worse than boring.

[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:38.100]
Got it?

[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.500]
That boring, like Dave Van and Rich Walsh.

[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:47.080]
Oh my, he's like a male reader, Cosby with a better voice and not much.

[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.500]
Where are all these people with these bad voices coming from?

[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.820]
Moring down had a great, see I don't have time for calls right now.

[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.740]
I know that breaks your heart.

[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.420]
Yeah, I'm weeping.

[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.340]
Well, no, because I've got, I've got a humongue.

[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.040]
I didn't realize I had such a big pile.

[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.040]
Well, get into it.

[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.200]
Yeah, hop on it.

[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.100]
Moring down had a great calm that we had on our website.

[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.900]
Did I remember that biking toward nowhere?

[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:06.900]
Was that yesterday, Josh?

[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:07.940]
Yes.

[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:10.020]
Were you going, did you read this on the air?

[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.440]
Yeah, well, no, I didn't read it on the air.

[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.660]
Oh, you did read it.

[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.900]
Well, I got a tremendous readership from our audience and I figured, well, maybe somebody might want to hear.

[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:17.760]
Cosby love Moring down.

[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:18.260]
She's great.

[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.960]
Little week on TV, but she's great.

[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.120]
You know, she's a calmness.

[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:22.520]
She's not supposed to be a TV celebrity.

[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.760]
Moring says, how could President Bush be converting around on a long vacation with American troops struggling with a spiral in crisis in Iraq?

[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:34.320]
Wasn't he worried that his vacation activities might send a frivolous signal at a time when he had put so many young Americans in harm's way?

[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:37.360]
I'm determined that life goes on, Mr. Bush said stubbornly.

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.420]
That wasn't a son, believe it or not.

[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:41.120]
It was the father, 15 years ago.

[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:52.660]
I was in K-Bunkport, Maine, then, to cover the President Bush's frenetic attempts to relax while reporters were pressing him about how he could be taking a month to play around when he had started sending American troops to the Persian Gulf only three days before.

[01:56:53.080 --> 01:57:02.060]
On Saturday, the current President Bush was pressed about how he could be taking five weeks to ride bikes and an app and fish and clear brush, even though his occupation of Iraq had become a fiasco.

[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.260]
I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, Governor.

[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.900]
You said to keep a balanced life.

[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:16.440]
Pressed about how he could ride his bike while refusing to see a grieving mom of a dead soldier who's camped outside his ranch he had it, so I'm mindful of what goes on around me.

[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:19.820]
On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've got a life to live and will do so.

[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:26.180]
Ah, the insensitivity of reporters who ask the President Bush's how they can expect to deal with Middle East fighting while they're off fishing.

[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:33.360]
The first President Bush told us that he kept a telephone in his golf cart and his cigarette boats so we could easily stay on top of Son of his invasion of Kuwait.

[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:41.780]
But at least he seemed worried that he was sending the wrong signal as his voting and golfing was just deposed on the news with footage of the frightened families of troops leaving for the Middle East.

[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:48.160]
I just don't like taking questions on serious matters and my vacation, the usually good nature Bush senior barked at reporters on the golf course.

[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:51.720]
So I hope you'll understand if, if one I'm recreating, I will recreat.

[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:56.420]
His hot tempered oldest son who was golfing with his father that day was even more irritated.

[01:57:56.420 --> 01:58:01.660]
Hey, hey, W. Stank that reporters asking questions on the first tee. Can't you wait till we finish hitting it?

[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.000]
At least junior always had his priority straight.

[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:13.840]
As W. His neighbors get in scraps with the anti-war forces coalescing around the ranch, as the Pentagon tries to wrestle up updated armor for our soldiers who are still sitting ducks in the third year of the war,

[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:20.540]
as the Iraqi police we train, keep getting blown up by terrorists who come back, who come right back every time U.S. troops beat them up.

[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:26.560]
As she is working on the Iraqi constitution conspare with Iran about turning Iraq into an Islamic state that represses women,

[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:32.780]
and as Iraq hurdles toward a possible civil war, W. seems far more oblivious than his father was with his Persian Gulf crisis.

[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:42.780]
This president is in a truly scary place in Iraq. Americans can't get out or they risk turning the country into a terrorist haven that will make the old Afghanistan look like Cypriamis.

[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:43.900]
What the hell is that?

[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:50.760]
Yet his war, which you see, she always does that, air every time. Yet his war, which has not accomplished any of its purposes,

[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:55.980]
swallows even more American lives, and inflames even more Muslim hearts as W. reads a book about history of salt,

[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.040]
and looks forward to his biking date with Lance Armstrong on Saturday.

[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:04.200]
The son wanted to go into Iraq to best his daddy in the history books by finishing what Bush senior started,

[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:09.240]
he swept aside the warnings of Brent's schoolcroft and Cole and Powell, and didn't bother to ask his father's advice.

[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:16.020]
Now he's caught in the very trap his father said he feared that America would get bogged down as an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land,

[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:18.920]
facing a possibly virulent outcome.

[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:23.360]
It turns out that the people of Iraq have ethnic and religious identities, not a national identity.

[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:30.520]
She hides and turrets want to suppress the Sunnis who wants to repress them and break off into their own states, smashing the Bush model kitchen of democracy.

[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:36.140]
At long last the senior Bush official admits that administration officials can no longer clean with their own version of reality,

[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:42.420]
were in the process of absorbing the factors of the situation, were in the shedding of the unreality of the dominated at the beginning,

[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.060]
the official told the Washington Post.

[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:48.020]
They better start absorbing and shedding a lot faster before many more American kids died,

[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:52.520]
or create a pawn of Iran, and they better tell the boy in the bubble who continues to dwell in delusion,

[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:56.160]
healing the fights and delays on the Iraqi constitution as a tribute to democracy.

[01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:00.040]
The president's peddling as fast as he can, but he's going nowhere.

[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:04.440]
I wonder a lot of people where that person said, damn good article about that and that she's great.

[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:07.180]
Oh, it's more than that left wing spin doctor crap.

[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.280]
You got it. You know what they're reading about today?

[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.420]
It's just a very short article that I read in the beginning about how Bush's numbers are sinking like the Titanic.

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.760]
And they're saying, oh, it's about time. Thank God they're saying.

[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.480]
Oh, God!

[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:21.720]
Yeah. Too bad it didn't happen before last November, which it should have.

[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:27.580]
546. I can envision 555 by one o'clock, can't you?

[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.520]
In fact, I can envision it in the next minute or two.

[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:36.080]
And Josh Cordes set there, Mr. Hachad, Mr. Rexpert, Mr. Noah, a guy who don't even know who Tony Kubak was.

[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.380]
That's right. He wouldn't know Joe Dodgeola from anybody.

[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:45.860]
You know Joe Garajola?

[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:46.720]
Not personally.

[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:47.800]
Dodgeola.

[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:48.420]
I do, yes.

[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:49.520]
Get a check.

[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:50.460]
Get a literate.

[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:53.300]
In fact, you know something, I think that was the beginning of the end for America.

[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:54.700]
Disney Dean and Joe Dodgeola.

[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:57.660]
That was the beginning of the end of any literacy in America.

[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:58.660]
It's all gone.

[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.180]
And let me ask you something, Joe Dodgeola, where you at?

[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:03.440]
548 votes.

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:08.260]
Stop and see, we're not supposed to talk about such stuff, but stop and think about that whole where you at spot.

[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:09.260]
Okay, think about that.

[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.820]
It's like sending a talk about a racist message.

[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:14.620]
It's like saying, oh, when you dark folks, you're all literate anyway.

[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:17.320]
So let's just kind of like joke about it, make fun of it, right?

[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.500]
That's what it is.

[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:20.840]
That's what it be.

[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:24.760]
All time, I'm with this female celebrity, Sandra Burdar 156.

[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.720]
See that crew is moving, moving, moving.

[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:28.080]
I'll tell you for a dead broad.

[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.120]
She's moving at 84.

[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.060]
Rosio Donald 78, Rosanne Bar 42, Tammy Febaker 37.

[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:36.520]
Barbara Streisand 36, Wippey Goldberg's God.

[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:37.540]
About 30, man.

[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.820]
Imaging Coke of still 15, because everybody knows who she is as dead except me and Bokobrine.

[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:47.380]
Phil Ziller 14, Oprah 11, B. Arthur 10, Toto Field 7, Schvokies N.A. 6,

[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.600]
Gritavan Suston 5, Randy Rhodes 5, Betty Davis 5, Joan Rivers 4,

[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.320]
Kathy Bates 2, Jocelyn Wildenstein's only got one, but once they see her, wow.

[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.240]
Krusty and I really caused me so far, I've got the big, oh, just like Marilyn Monroe did.

[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:03.800]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:07.680]
This is 5.16 Q.A.

[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.680]
No, this is honored.

[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:13.200]
This is not a tumor.

[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.240]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:31.940]
A rubak, a rubak, on the green, me, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, every day, young, the new, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, forehead, lines of powder, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, use for subdub fusion.

[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:36.500]
Keri Shiloh, Dan, Q.

[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:46.220]
And goes under investigation now, info that you must not know, and so the higher curtain must come down.

[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:56.860]
You have the theoretical, cover up 10 lines, be quick, you all, right before your eyes.

[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.800]
I wonder how you react when you discover you need real ID.

[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:09.560]
That's up to no sort of a trail, and trees and war without a reason.

[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:19.620]
Both in and they're from the growth and that we're from in the trainer and criminal, buyers who think that they don't want you to know.

[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:27.840]
One day you'll wake up and see your dreams go, for the ultimate reality show.

[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:43.060]
Let's get back to a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, a rubak, no more tearing and tear apart.

[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:43.640]
Cute!

[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:45.000]
Exactly, get it right.

[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.300]
Did he ever tell you what happened with his UPS? I mean FedEx conversation?

[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:52.080]
They messed up, they're rescending it or something.

[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:52.460]
They just...

[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:56.560]
They messed up, that's pretty unusual, because I do love FedEx. They're very, very good. I would never knock them.

[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:59.680]
But you know, they got 80 trade-in packages every day, just once.

[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:02.080]
Plus the stuff, like I said, probably wasn't that good anyway.

[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:05.500]
569 votes on the pool. We got a shot.

[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:09.180]
We're going to get 700 whether Josh likes it or 572. You sit down there zooming up.

[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:10.520]
They're coming through for us, baby.

[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.100]
You can just sit back there like a lump, you know? Don't be a lump.

[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:16.280]
Remember Jerry lumpy with the Yankees now?

[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:17.840]
Jerry lumpy with the Yankees now.

[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:18.540]
What about Bob Serve?

[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:19.300]
Jerry lumpy with the Yankees now?

[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:19.300]

[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.740]
What about Bob Barker?

[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:21.700]
Bob?

[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:24.280]
Well, it's my next story. I went on a like segue into it.

[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.860]
Will Bob Barker's legal lemurs ever end to ask the national inquiry?

[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:32.440]
The prices right MC who's been involved in no less than 9 lawsuits from female employees

[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:35.460]
over a 33 year tenure in a highly rated CBS game show

[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:38.100]
has just settled two suits that were slapped against by former staffers.

[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:39.340]
How do you like that?

[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:40.600]
Do you know that?

[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:40.940]
No.

[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:46.700]
Last September, model Claudia Jordan and production assistance Sylvia Clement Henry sued the 81-year-old

[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:51.680]
TV legend and three other show execs for a sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and wrongful

[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:56.120]
termination. The B.C.'s Barker managed to avoid going to court by settling the suits in late July.

[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:01.020]
If Barker wanted to vent, he's got more suits than Greg Reed, you know? If Barker wanted to

[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.680]
vindicate himself, he could have opted out of the settlements, if he wanted to court to prove

[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:08.060]
his innocence, but he always insists on getting his lawsuits dismissed, said Nick Alden, the attorney

[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:12.440]
represented Jordan and Clement Henry. In June 2004, the National Inquire report of that

[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:16.820]
Jordan who was fired in October 2003 after three years on the program was about to sue Barker

[02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:20.980]
and three other staffers. The price is right was the worst work atmosphere I've ever experienced

[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:25.960]
at Jordan 32. She said Barker fired her because she had complained to producers about racial and

[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:30.860]
sexual comments on the set. You are the button model I can fire your ass when producer kept telling me,

[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:35.180]
and I was also told, well what's wrong with being the button model? Nothing. I was also told to stand

[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.420]
between two Caucasian models to do a reverse Oreo, Jordan said, Bob was absolutely the boss

[02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:46.760]
from hell. A reverse Oreo? Huh, he went on the outside, dark on the inside. Yeah, I was just

[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:52.020]
thinking about Ocaran. Barker's publicist Henry Ballinger confirmed Jordan and Clement Henry's

[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:56.340]
panic, huh? And Clement Henry's lawsuits were settled, but Ed and Bob was not directly involved,

[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:00.460]
was not privy to any of the settlement discussion, didn't take, pay any of the legal fees. He was

[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:04.960]
named in law super, was not part of the settlement. Attorney Alden said, Bob Barker always placed

[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:09.300]
smart ass saying his name is not on the settlement, but the settlement automatically releases him from

[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:13.420]
further legal action. So he's a huge part of it. Barker still faces wrongful termination suits

[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:17.820]
filed by show model Holly Halstrom and production assistant Linda Ryger. Halstrom is waiting for a

[02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:22.340]
court date and Margaret's kids are good arbitration issue. For Bob Barker, man, oh man, before it gets

[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:26.740]
the name more trouble, why not just die right there on the set, huh? It was Jennifer Johnny Olson,

[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:32.040]
it was good enough for Rod Rodney who said, I'm dying over here. Hey Rod, you fairy. Now you know

[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:36.660]
what they call them, Rod Rodney. I see. Next joy Reynolds about him. Well, next time you see Joey.

[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:40.420]
Oh yeah. How's your buddy the guy? Don't you miss doing those appearances and you don't get to

[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:44.340]
see all your buddies anymore? Yeah, I miss him a lot. Especially the guy with his eyes and a guy

[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:48.260]
with a fanny pack. All the guys. By the way, the guy with a fanny pack is probably a terrorist. Look

[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:53.780]
out now. Oh my God. He was packing heat at the Macarena one night. He was a security guard there

[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:58.740]
for about five minutes. Yeah. He had a gun. His shirt was heat. I'm telling you seriously, I will

[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:02.280]
go to the game and he's standing there in the lobby and he's dressed up in some zoot suit and

[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:08.440]
he's got a gun. At any rate, Barbara balloons up like a cow. It's just a great story from a super

[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:16.200]
what is that? Balloons up. I keep looking at picture Ryan Filippe. At any rate, what is he doing

[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:21.240]
these days? Is he doing something? He played baseball and soccer at high school packed on 25 pounds

[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:27.840]
of lean muscle for the movie Way of the Gun. He also holds a black belt in Taekwondo. He's been

[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:31.320]
cute in this picture. I don't know why you're picking on her. She doesn't always look cute.

[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:36.240]
Keeps five-year-old daughter at Ava Elizabeth close to a start during workouts. That's her picture

[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.300]
around his neck. I wasn't looking at his neck. At any rate, Barbara, oh geez. And here's a picture

[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:46.620]
of Barbara from Meet the Fokers where she's like hopping on top of a nearly naked Robert De Niro.

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:52.540]
What a good match that is. But if you could, I tell you that what's your name?

[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:57.580]
Wallenstein, whatever, Larry Wallenstein, Jocelyn, No Wildenstein. She ain't got nothing on her.

[02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:03.820]
And that's without the facelifts. Oh my god. Stri-Sand is packed on a whopping 30 pounds.

[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:09.020]
But 30 pounds should say the star's bloated appearance is a far cry from when she played

[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:15.600]
Fanny Bryce in Funny Girl. And they got a picture of that. What kind of like behind Ryan Filippe's

[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:22.220]
Oh my god. Did you see this? No. This is in the Wilden CY. Yeah, you did.

[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:26.780]
I thought you told me you saw this picture. I saw the picture of Barbara. That's what I'm talking.

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:31.720]
I'm talking about Ryan Filippe's. I'm talking about Barbara. Jesus, you are so defensive man.

[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:35.360]
You're fair. God almighty. You're worse than your partner in crime there.

[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:41.920]
Hostile. Anyway, she's a just organic. She's huge and she's put on 30 pounds in six months.

[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:49.420]
And discussing another tribute to anti-semitism. Maybe she's a walking ad for it.

[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:53.900]
Well, one with a good good juice. They're turning up. Oh, I'm glad I segregated there. You want to know

[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:58.740]
why? Why? See the people over there at the minor league sports station over at the ticket.

[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:02.840]
They don't get it because see they keep talking about wow, you know, where the hip are

[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:06.540]
and younger, all the other great. They don't realize that we don't just have old people on

[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:12.900]
there. We have old Jews on the air. Hank and me and Moe and Eddie K, old Jews and even one

[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:17.680]
young viewer, a Jew, a squeaky one, right? Right. And they got what do they got? I'll go.

[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.140]
I'm naming one Jewish guy besides OJ McDuffe. Stoo got. Is he Jewish? Are you kidding me?

[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:28.960]
Stoo gots. Yeah, all the owners mark money marks. Sorry. I'm talking about on the air. Oh,

[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.880]
Martin, that's right. They got way out. But those are minor leagues. They don't have any big league

[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.160]
Jews. You want to have some numbers. You better get some big league Jews on here. Forget about age.

[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:42.000]
That's your problem over there. Too many goyem. Ted Rawl writes. I just love Ted Rawl. He writes

[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.360]
sacrifice. What is it? I said he's great. Count me out. Remember Gary Lewis and the playboys

[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:50.720]
and count me in. He says count me out. I'll cure that. First taxes before we get to that.

[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:58.920]
Please add heart. Nice going, Chris. Add Harvey Firestein. You're a list of ladies with

[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:03.600]
blood, blood plastic surgery. Also, I'll never forget the side of Steve King of the Cooper City of

[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.400]
Home Depot shopping with his multicultural children, his classic queen producer,

[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:12.260]
at the Cooper City of Home Depot, while his forehead was bleeding from his hair transplant.

[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:16.840]
Yeah. That's why he's always got to the end. He used to do the holes in the head.

[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:19.540]
First turned out he had a bigger one at the beginning of that. Nothing new with hair.

[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:23.220]
Hey, Gary Lewis and the playboy speak, Gary. Speak.

[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:28.320]
I don't know. I can really hear it and I talked it up. That was not good. Yeah.

[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.260]
The big dates. Oh, that wasn't what I wanted. I was looking for the big dates.

[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:51.780]
Now I make sure you think the four tops that were you at. I'm excited and say that.

[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:57.660]
Probably not. Ten Royal Rights if you supported the war, pay for it. If America is truly on a war

[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:01.720]
footing, Tom Shanker asked in New York Times, why I sold it all sacrificed as to the nation

[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.080]
in large military recruiters are coming up short of all in tears yet. Either party is pushing for a

[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.760]
draft. No one is proposing a tax increase to cover the $60 billion annual cost of the Iraq and

[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.900]
Afghan wars. There are no W. W. W. Two style war bond drives, no victory gardens, not even gas

[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:20.240]
rationing. Back here in the fatherland, only support our troops car ribbons indicate they were at war

[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:24.080]
and they aren't even bumper stickers. They're magnetic. Apparently Americans aren't even willing

[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.300]
to sacrifice to finish on their automobiles to promote the cause. Nobody in America has asked

[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:32.360]
to sacrifice except us the paper quotes an officer who just returned from a year in Rose Petal

[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.080]
Pave de Rack. Symbolic signs of support are just not enough grumbles of Brigadier General.

[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.740]
There has to be more he demands. The absence of a call for broader national sacrifice in a time of

[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:44.780]
war is to become a near constant topic of discussion among officers and enlisted personnel of the

[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:49.900]
general claims. North Western University professor Charles Moscow says the political leaders are afraid

[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:54.240]
to ask the public for any real sacrifice which doesn't speak to highly the seasonery. To which I

[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.680]
say, screw that. It's not my duty to suffer for this pointless war. I've been against it all long

[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.280]
and you can stick your victory garden where the deserts some can't penetrate. I was among hundreds

[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.580]
of thousands of Americans who marched against invading Iraq in early 2003. Tens of millions

[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:12.080]
cheered us on. The largest mass protest movement in history so that it doesn't made by the Guinness

[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:16.500]
Book of World Records brought together pacifist humanists and people like me. We knew Iraq had

[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.960]
nothing to do with 9-11. We didn't believe that the same White House that propped up dictatorship

[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:25.140]
in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia that had when it suited them supported

[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:29.480]
Sodom could possibly be interested in liberating the people of Iraq. When we scrutinized the coverage

[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:33.660]
of the CIA's pre-war analyses, we found that there wasn't any. There were only reports

[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:38.200]
standing back to 98 ancient history in the intelligence business. We absolutely didn't trust

[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:43.000]
Dick Cakewalk, Chinese breached predictions. Bush and Cheney ignored our concerns. Instead of building

[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.280]
a solid case and bipartisan political consensus, they bullied and lied to Congress and the

[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.320]
U.N. to scam us into this unwinnable war. Who can blame them? They worked for X on mobile and

[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.860]
halibut, not the American people, but they not us broke Iraq. It can't be fixed. It's not our fault

[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:59.340]
and it's not our problem. There's no reason to relinquish our creature comforts to back their

[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:03.940]
grubby little oil grab. The most galling aspect of this V.S. was that was entirely predictable.

[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:10.640]
I know I predicted. Here's my column written back in July 2002. Most experts expect Iraq to disintegrate

[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:13.940]
in the Civil War after an overthrow of Sodom's oppressive bad party. I wrote,

[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.960]
opinion of the United States is now at an all-time low among Muslims around the world,

[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.260]
going after Iraq will make matters worse. Why give radical anti-American Islamist even more

[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:25.960]
political ammunition with wits to recruit suicide bombers and track the financial donations

[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.920]
that fund their assaults? I'm no genius, but even I could see that this war was doomed

[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.660]
eight months before the invasion. The Kurds deserve a whole land sure would Iraq be better off

[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:38.440]
without Sodom probably. But if we're smart, we won't be the ones to blow over this particular

[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:42.040]
house of cars. We have too much to lose and too little to gain in that mess that would certainly

[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:46.800]
ensue, I wrote. Did I call that one or what? David Henderson, a scholar at Colorado College,

[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:50.660]
tells the times Bush understands that the support of the public for the war, especially the war

[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:54.840]
in Iraq, is conditioned on demanding little of the public. Of course Bush himself hasn't given up

[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:59.040]
a second of occasion or a single donated dollar, much less one of his hard-partying daughters to

[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.860]
the war effort. Sacrifice is a hard selldown here among the citizens and we, when we don't see

[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:07.160]
it starting where it should, among our leaders. I'm already sacrificing too much for war, I always

[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:12.180]
believe was stupid and wrong. I'm paying $3 a gallon for buck 50 gas and walking through

[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:16.420]
gauntlets of over-arm national guard boys at airports and bus stations. I'm in greater danger than

[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:20.440]
ever before getting blown up by a pissed off fanatic. And I've read the giant tax cycle of

[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:24.800]
insulin to pay off Bush's deficit. But these are enough sacrifices for Bush and his vain

[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:28.740]
glorious generals who are planning a civilian reserve, a sort of peace war for professionals,

[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:04.160]
prominent conservative political and religious leaders called Sunday night for a senate approval

[02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:07.960]
of a Supreme Court nominee is who will vote to end the constitutional right to abortion against

[02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:12.080]

matter what we think the court rules the Supreme Court he said the video broadcast has created an

[02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:47.000]
oligarchy it's governed by the few rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Borkhorn that the

[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:52.140]
high court is to find homosexuality as a constitutional right and once homosexuality is defined as a

[02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:56.340]
constitutional right there's nothing the states can do about it nothing the people can do about it

[02:31:56.340 --> 02:32:01.080]
the event was built as an attempt to awaken Christians those good loving Christians for the

[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:04.900]
importance of appointments of the Supreme Court but it also served as a televised rally supporting

[02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:10.140]
president Bush's nomination of John Roberts Jr conservative leaders here in Nashville said

[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:14.060]
they hope Roberts will be the first of three or more Supreme Court's assistance to be chosen by Bush

[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:18.680]
whose confirmations would fundamentally alter the high court and we can all go step to the sound of it

one in Italy and elsewhere like the u.s.a.

[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:46.920]
