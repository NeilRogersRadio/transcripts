[00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.600]
Not when the numbers are that low.

[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.600]
He doesn't have much to compete against.

[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.460]
He should raise you a lot of a job of competing.

[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.240]
As they say, yeah.

[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.680]
I guess he doesn't read numbers.

[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200]
But don't start on that note or you get a Joel Feinberg all upset.

[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.860]
Oh, I got some real good, some real good dirt on Joel Feinberg.

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.240]
Really?

[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.840]
You made the right choice by not going over there.

[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.300]
Who's going to work for a guy that gets so unbalanced every time he hears me mention his name on me,

[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.380]
or he starts throwing a furniture.

[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.200]
Next thing you know, it'll be putting his fist through the wall.

[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.440]
Why would that happen?

[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.520]
We can't do furniture from the inside.

[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.300]
All kinds of hysteria going on over there.

[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.400]
I like inside stuff.

[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.780]
I like inside stuff.

[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.160]
Well, this is inside, man.

[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.500]
You can't get more inside than this.

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.900]
Yeah.

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.760]
So Joel Feinberg, who fanciens himself as a regular radio guru now because he's got a lot of money

[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.580]
and he puts some horseball, Foni Bolognese, H.M.O. there has money.

[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.520]
Oh, there you go.

[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.320]
See, that's even worse.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480]
Just like Stu Gotts.

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.740]
Maybe that's what they have in common.

[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.000]
They got daddy's with a lot of money.

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.360]
That's it.

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.220]
Anyway, the word from inside the building over there is that every time I mention his name

[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.020]
and vein on the ear, he just throws a fit.

[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.220]
And actually, I was throwing furniture at one point, which I would love to have been a fly on a wall to see that.

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.900]
And also, also from what was that during the Joe Rose show over there that there seemed to be these intermittent screaming matches between Joe and Joel.

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.880]
I've heard that.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.940]
A lot of F-bombs going back and forth.

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.040]
I've heard that.

[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.480]
Yeah.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.580]
So this business about Joe Rose hates Q.A.M.

[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.680]
I think he's got that back with.

[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.040]
Maybe Joe Rose hates Joel Feinberg is what I'm thinking.

[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.560]
Absolutely.

[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.380]
That's what the word is on the street.

[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.860]
Well, I'm told the same thing.

[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.300]
Yeah.

[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.580]
Well, it's just about frustrating when you spend a lot of money and you give the dolphins four and a half million bucks a year

[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.500]
and come to find out that you're a loser.

[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.860]
You know, if they have the Mont Palemar telescope to see their numbers.

[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.320]
Although, and I noticed that they didn't hire Sid Rosenberg yet from the fan.

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.780]
I know that was that would be their secret weapon.

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.100]
Sid the kid.

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.480]
I didn't know they were doing that.

[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.940]
Well, they aren't hiring.

[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.580]
They talked to him because you got you know, we got dumped off the fan off I'm a so.

[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.800]
Yeah.

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.840]
He just a little bit of a boozing and gambling problem, I guess.

[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.140]
They had more problems than that.

[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.680]
Really?

[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.260]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.980]
I'll be damned.

[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.820]
Well, plus the fact that he looks and sounds so much like Vodetal that that's a 10 strikes against him right off the bat.

[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.420]
I think he's got a few problems.

[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.480]
I hope he works them out.

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.500]
He's not a bad fellow.

[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140]
Well, it's just, in fact, I hope they do hire him.

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.680]
That would be a real good place from the rehab.

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520]
Parts of Penn Station have been shut down in New York.

[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.900]
Yeah.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.020]
And like we really believe this stuff, you know, it's, it's talking about wagging the dog.

[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.680]
This is wagging the universe is what Bush is doing now.

[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.540]
It comes on yesterday and makes his 85th speech about the war on terror in last three days.

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.940]
So today they released this thing about the subway system and women and baby carriages.

[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.580]
Yeah, right.

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.020]
Try to, try to change the subject from the, from the attention from Carl Rove and Scooter Libby.

[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.060]
And Bill Frist and Tom DeLay and the fact that the whole, that your car is this crumbling apart.

[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.200]
So now it's back to safety, safety in the war on terror.

[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.940]
And just coincidentally yesterday we get this press conference on the same day that he's screaming about the, the great job we've done

[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.240]
of hurting three al-kind attacks.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.640]
And as soon as we find out that Jose Padilla, the so-called suitcase bomber, was one of them, you know it's all a bunch of lies.

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.740]
Because he isn't another damn thing.

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.100]
He isn't even accused of doing anything.

[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.980]
They're just holding him indefinitely like, well, let's hang on to him.

[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.740]
It looks good, you know.

[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.620]
For getting his drop, you sphere is a, right.

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.500]
But I just, I'm going to try that, I understand, I was going to try that attack.

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.740]
Is that what it is?

[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.760]
Oh my God, well, a lot of fear, fear factor.

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.920]
Fear this out of that voice.

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.940]
Oh, see you're always back to going.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.280]
Got you going, got you going.

[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.120]
No, you can give me going.

[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.920]
I'm tuned in on Joel Feinberg today.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.900]
I want to find, get it report when I come back from vacation and he picked up his desk and threw it back from what?

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.060]
Vacation.

[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.560]
Again?

[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.660]
Yeah, Monday.

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.640]
This is it for me for a week.

[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.660]
What do you mean again?

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.500]
Man, I've been working almost a month now five days a week.

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.660]
That's heavy duty.

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.240]
You're a good one to talk.

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.080]
You got more races and more, I think.

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.660]
Yeah, but I work.

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.880]
I think you make up half of these races that you're supposedly covering.

[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.940]
But I didn't think, well, yeah, yeah, that's right.

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.860]
That's not me, I thought.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.440]
That's others.

[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.640]
Well, I didn't find out that there were like five, at least close to 5,000 empty seats at the pan through open to the other side.

[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.520]
That's not a good sign.

[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.560]
I also found out that the game was a terminally boring.

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.360]
I thought they played a really good game from what I read about it, but the long, long, long, long, long, long.

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.160]
Well, he's always great.

[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.580]
He's the one that keeps him in all the games, but getting the inside reports, it was another coma inducer.

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.340]
So they better crank it up a little bit tonight against the lighting, because it looks like the lightning are going to be really good again.

[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.280]
That's the Stanley Cup champion lightning.

[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.540]
I guess the question or question is, is this going to become like a real rivalry in this?

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.340]
No, no.

[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.280]
The lightning and the panthers, I would put that rivalry on the same level with the devil rays and the marlins and the bucks and the dolphins.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.820]
It's just never materialized.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.340]
They keep that right.

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.560]

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.240]
This big cross-state rivalry, and I think most of the reason for that being that the people in South Florida couldn't give a flying crap less about Tampa.

[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.660]
We just, we don't care about Tampa and rightfully so.

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.200]
I mean, anybody cares about the only good thing in Tampa's Bernstake House in Donatello is that's it.

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.800]
Yeah, they closed the other place I liked over there.

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.600]
What was that?

[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.320]
Malleos.

[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.720]
I thought you were going to say, Mons, Venus.

[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.280]
No, that place is still open.

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.760]
I know.

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.780]
Malleos? I think I ate their ones.

[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.800]
Malleos is good.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.260]
Was.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.800]
God, the tellers is very good.

[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.360]
Yes, it is.

[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.900]
And of course, Bernstake House.

[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.240]
Wow.

[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.720]
It is something else.

[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.840]
Why is it that those mugworms out there got so many good restaurants and everybody able to figure that out?

[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.540]
Just a platter of great restaurants.

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.220]
Well, Bernstake has been there forever.

[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.700]
Yeah.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.000]
The town of Tellers, I think, is Malleos brother.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.600]
Yeah.

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.020]
He's a big fan of mine.

[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.640]
I'll tell you that.

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.400]
I've had an open invitation to eat freebies in the Donatello's anytime I want.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.640]
I would not bet I'm going to Tampa to go and just like me to tell you.

[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.740]
I'm not like good Italian food.

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.360]
I go to Rome.

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.760]
You know, when you're making a couple of bucks, you want a nice, like,

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.660]
I go to Antones or I go to Cafe Madurano.

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.260]
Antones run away 84, that is.

[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.540]
Yeah.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800]
What an ambiance, man.

[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.140]
I love it.

[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.300]
And guess who else loves Anthony?

[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.240]
They run away 84.

[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.100]
Do-do-do-do.

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.280]
Yeah.

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.440]
I saw him there once.

[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.520]
Get out of here.

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.020]
I did.

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.120]
And did he invite you to sit down at the table and, uh,

[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.320]
Are you congratulating?

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.180]
No.

[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.500]
Down?

[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.860]
Did he speak?

[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.260]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.900]
No, not certainly.

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.140]
Did you sky speak?

[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.780]
Hello.

[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.560]
Come on.

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.360]
Do-do-do-do.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.060]
That's bad.

[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.580]
What am I going to say?

[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.840]
I don't know.

[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.200]
I mean, I would think you'd at least fake a little conviviality or something there.

[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.720]
You wouldn't believe how fast I could walk at times.

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.260]

[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.680]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.260]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.640]
Run away 84 sensational.

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.520]
That's been there a long time.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.640]
Yeah.

[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.720]
It's very different.

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.580]
Before I've been in town, almost 30 years now.

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.500]
About 30, man.

[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.460]
And they're a very long time.

[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.260]
And they opened a pizza place on, um, well, they have two of them now.

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.240]
And really good.

[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.880]
If you can finish the appetizer, lucky, much less getting the entree,

[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.000]
they just bring enormous amounts of food.

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.060]
I've never seen anything like that.

[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.200]
And it's not just volume.

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.520]
It's really quality food.

[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.240]
Oh, that's the new pepper.

[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.980]
It's the peppers there are the best.

[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.540]
Yeah.

[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.820]
They have a fantastic food at Runway 84.

[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.400]
So anybody can get a freebie over there.

[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.020]
Go see my friend Derek at the track.

[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.700]
He'll hook you up.

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.740]
I pay there.

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.920]
I don't.

[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.040]
I always buy everything after a couple of times.

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.640]
Because I'm not in the market being diabetic and fat.

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.360]
Not that, you know, that relates to you.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.420]
But I'm not in the market for meals like that.

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.540]
One good meal like that could put me in the box.

[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.720]
You know, what you can go there, you don't have to eat like that.

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.140]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.360]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.760]
I know you can have veal.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.720]
And you can, it's easy to say they have great chicken dish there.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.620]
I don't have it.

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.240]
But again, old Jews forget about chicken.

[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.460]
When we were young, we were fed too much chicken.

[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.260]
Enough of that already.

[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.060]
No, seriously, if I, like when I go to Italy,

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.460]
do you think that I eat veal?

[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.000]
I don't eat veal or stuff like that.

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240]
I had to toss the man, mind your mind, Jim.

[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.820]
Or you have never had anything like that.

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.480]
Well, you've been to Rome.

[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.960]
Yep.

[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.720]
And you're right.

[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.380]
Wow.

[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.380]
Almost any trot to read in the city.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.000]
I mean, there's a couple that are just really special for me.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.920]
But almost any of me can just go in and it's always spectacular.

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.480]
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm ready for some heavy gambling.

[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.460]
Are you really?

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.800]
Yeah.

[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.160]
No, I'm not going to be gambling.

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.860]
I'll be in Europe.

[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.340]
Where you headed?

[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.100]
Berlin.

[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.760]
Whoa.

[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.360]
You know, that's a great city.

[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.140]
It is there.

[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.580]
I know that.

[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.060]
You have to tell me I've been here many times.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.620]
I love it.

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.260]
I like it.

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.300]
Who is great that people are friendly and wonderful and great and just a very modern because we

[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.400]
blew the whole thing up after WWII and they're toward the S&S.

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.520]
So they had to rebuild the whole city.

[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.260]
So we really modern.

[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.300]
In fact, anybody that has never been there.

[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.960]
I know the first time I went there, I was shocked.

[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.620]
I thought, gee, this is really a modern upscaled beautiful, fantastic place.

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.700]
Yeah.

[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.520]
Amazing.

[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.920]
I went there with the dolphins.

[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.820]
The last year I did the dolphins.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.340]
In fact, I flew back on the same plane with Mike Disney and I thought I was set.

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.100]
Really?

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.900]
And then, lo and behold, Gary Bruce got rid of me.

[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.540]
Yeah, boy, Gary.

[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.220]
My ex-nabour boy, Gary.

[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:25.800]
Yeah.

[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.220]
Never forget the day he came knocking on my door out.

[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.980]
As long as I live, I'll never forget that.

[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.360]
I would have.

[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:30.480]

[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:30.560]

[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.800]
To come in, he came in and told me that he was leaving.

[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.740]
And I guess I was supposed to be depressed and sad about him.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.820]
And after he left, I was like, high-fiving myself.

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.160]
I was just jumping to do a Kuzaskin living room.

[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.680]
I was.

[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.100]
Yeah, when I went there with the dolphins, I, you were there for a week.

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.120]
And I stayed in the eastern zone.

[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.740]
He stayed in the hotel over there that was really nice.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.140]
And it was a block away from a casino, in fact, on a roof.

[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.640]
Oh, no, don't tell me that I know there are Kuzinos there, but I've never been in one.

[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.300]
Oh, it was great.

[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.760]
They didn't have a slot machine there.

[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.040]
No.

[00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.580]
Good.

[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.380]
There's very civilized Kuzinos.

[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.280]
I see.

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.440]
As opposed to.

[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.440]
Oh, now, did you, did you hear that story that I read yesterday about that New Orleans survivor about the slots?

[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.060]
No.

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.900]
Oh, this, this, I thought, George Cortis was going to have an arrest breakdown because he's been so anti-slot for so long.

[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.540]
This is a woman who, uh, a 50-some-year-old black lady from New Orleans, and she's this place.

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.140]
She's staying with a lady friend of hers up in, uh, Opalusus.

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.840]
Is it Louisiana?

[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.060]
They have some racetrack there.

[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:27.920]
Yeah, man.

[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.760]
I've been to that track.

[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.520]
Well, whatever.

[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.320]
Who had, as soon as been to Opalusus.

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.480]
Anyway, she was staying there.

[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.540]
So she had her $20 bill in her purse, and she was going to the market to get a couple items.

[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.960]
And she stopped at, she stopped at that track, the racetrack where they have slots.

[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.940]
And she went in, and she had $20 bill.

[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.780]
She put in 17 quarters.

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.940]
That's $4.25, and she had to jackpot for $1.6 million.

[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.660]
Wow.

[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.960]
I mean, I was so depressed to read that.

[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.920]
I just wanted to jump out my window, and I live on a high floor.

[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.900]
I mean, I just couldn't, is that something?

[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.380]
17 quarters.

[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.220]
And she has $1.6 million.

[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.120]
That doesn't get you through life today.

[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:05.800]
It helps.

[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.980]
Hey, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.580]
I take it.

[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120]
Yeah, I wish yours helped take it.

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.940]
Now, if you hit for a million six, would I be hearing from you a week from Monday?

[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:13.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.040]
Now, that's not enough to do it.

[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.300]
Yeah.

[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.140]
Like I did buy an anticipation before I leave, which I'm leaving today.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.060]
But before I leave, I did buy quite a few 649 lotto tickets here.

[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.420]
Yeah.

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.660]
Because the jackpot tomorrow night is a 14 million.

[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.480]
Oh, 14 million.

[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.540]
I wouldn't see you in a week.

[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.740]
And I will go online, and they got a great internet cafe in Berlin.

[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.880]
So I will go online and check the numbers.

[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.200]
And I'm taking the tickets with me, so I can see if I won.

[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.740]
And of course, if I did win, I will become back for quite a while.

[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.500]
So I'll be making a grand tour of Europe.

[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.460]
Sour-broughton with red cabbage.

[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.860]
I'm Jones and for that now.

[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.920]
And the best bratwurst in the world and Venus Schnitzel.

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.700]
And the food there is good.

[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.480]
You know something about...

[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.040]
I did a feature while I was working for WTBJ when I was there with the Doffins that year.

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.020]
I mean, I did a feature.

[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.780]
That's when Ralph Redneck was still on it.

[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.020]
Yeah.

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:02.860]
And I did a feature about a guy from New York who opened the first chain of hot dog stores in Berlin.

[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.800]
You know, they didn't have hot dogs in Berlin.

[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.740]
They hadn't worse.

[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.420]
Right.

[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.720]
Oh yeah, they got the Korean worst and bratwurst and the hot dog worst in the world.

[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.640]
Yeah, this guy brought the...

[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.100]
He brought the high grades formula with him and opened up a chain of hot dogs, then.

[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.720]
And was doing very well.

[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.620]
And he wound up with the t-shirt concession at checkpoint Charlie.

[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.160]
Really?

[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.280]
And the guy gave me the greatest line I've ever heard in an interview.

[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.700]
I asked him, what inspired him to do that?

[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.860]
He said, well, he said, I was watching Tom Brokaw when the wall came down.

[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.280]
And I saw the handwriting on the wall.

[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.900]
He moved the Berlin.

[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.900]
I'll be damned.

[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.980]
And got all these businesses.

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.280]
Excellent move.

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.800]
Yeah, Western Europe is in many ways a lot more civilized.

[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.500]
Now they would just give... not in Germany.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.180]
They don't have a personal hygiene problem that I've noticed there.

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.280]
But in some of the countries like Holland, for example.

[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.940]
And in France, when they make the personal colleges, you know, body odors.

[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.380]
That's it.

[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:57.760]
All right.

[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:58.900]
GAMEY.

[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.180]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.840]
You know, how about a bar of coast or like that body wash?

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.280]
You don't even have to worry about dropping it.

[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.540]
Do something, but they just... not into it.

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.280]
And also Eastern Europeans.

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:08.820]
Wow.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.060]
Holy moly, man.

[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.260]
Really, earthy.

[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:11.720]
You know what I mean?

[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.640]
The salt of the earth earthy is in...

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:13.860]
Well.

[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.240]
I don't know if it was...

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.440]
When you...

[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.400]
In Germany, if it was that or I was traveling with Rick.

[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.280]
Yeah, Rick.

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.080]
Now that's interesting that you would say that.

[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.400]
Because now they audience knows it's not just me.

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.180]
Rick Weaver, really...

[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.360]
That was his big reputation beside being a hard ass.

[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.500]
That he didn't smell too good.

[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.920]
But he was great.

[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.920]
He was great on the airman.

[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.180]
You were.

[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:32.920]
Till what you will.

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.260]
Oh, I always say that.

[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:34.680]
Yeah.

[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.680]
He was sensational.

[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.480]
Well, you have a nice weekend.

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.400]
And we're in a wonderful strip.

[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.120]
I will.

[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.920]
I envy you.

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.340]
Well, I hope that you and Moa, you know, mend your fences and have dinner together at one way or two.

[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.320]
In fact, that would be a great place.

[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.880]
I could make a prediction for you.

[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.300]
And Tessio.

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.260]
Tessio, it was a great place to hide the gun in the tea room.

[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.160]
It was a whole-fashioned turret, man.

[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.780]
Yeah, right.

[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.020]
Now that we got the new lawn effect in Florida, that's right.

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.260]
I can give you one sure thing that won't happen while you're gone.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.840]
I can just hear it now.

[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.940]
Don't, don't, don't.

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.200]
Yeah.

[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:06.700]
That.

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.480]
Have a good time.

[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.580]
Hey, you two.

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.580]
Don't lose too much.

[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.100]
Thanks.

[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:11.660]
See you.

[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.800]
You first dude.

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.720]
Everybody's patenting, Matt.

[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.040]
The world is coming to an end.

[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.780]
This could be the best way to have the cars falling down.

[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.020]
We have three days of news this morning.

[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.780]
We have a yellow light that must be.

[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.400]
They have something to hide.

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.940]
That's how they...

[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.700]
Oh, a suspicious package near the Amtrak portion of Penn Station.

[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.700]
That's why they showed it down.

[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.880]
I got all the people in their hazmat outfits.

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.440]
You see that?

[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.340]
You watch this?

[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.660]
Yes.

[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.180]
In their yellow hazmat outfits in their...

[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.600]
And maybe even from the baby carriage too.

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.060]
When they do late at night,

[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.360]
What's really handy?

[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.660]
Kind of something new to you.

[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.020]
Like a yellow light.

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600]
They're kind of like a corporate fee of mine.

[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.680]
And that's why we have a yellow light.

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.420]
Oh, my God.

[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.280]
That's the explain.

[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.400]
The meaning of what these lights do.

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.400]
What is my courage?

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.240]
She's at his best with a set of clothes and noodles.

[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.220]
Her true.

[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.900]
It's been a time they've wanted to feel.

[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.920]
And they have a yellow light.

[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.180]
Oh, my God.

[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.940]
Something they can define.

[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.260]
That's why we have a yellow light.

[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.480]
A big time.

[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.200]
It's been a time they've wanted to feel.

[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.100]
Hey, Joel Feinberg.

[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.420]
Can you spell loser?

[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.480]
Look at the mirror, sweetheart, and loser.

[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.720]
1014, that's some great news that we've heard this morning.

[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.140]
It's just tickles my fancy.

[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.240]
What a great way to go out on vacation.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.860]
Knowing the fancy what you're getting to somebody.

[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.060]
I mean, what's he worried about?

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.120]
He's got more, you know, his daddy's got more money than God.

[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.840]
And if they lose that on a lost venture over there,

[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.700]
he can always borrow some from Stu Goss's daddy.

[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.180]
Huh?

[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.020]
Who's your daddy?

[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.060]
So anyway, look at a 1014 already.

[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120]
You don't tell me it's a great time.

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.240]
On a great Friday October 7th,

[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.160]
and of course, like I said,

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.460]
diverting attention from all these other Tsurries and all these scandals now

[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.020]
that the Dekka cards, the Bush House of Cards, is coming crumbling down.

[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.500]
Let's start getting back to safety, safety, safety.

[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.340]
And we got all this stuff going on in the way, babe.

[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:24.980]
Huh?

[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:25.900]
Oh.

[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.620]
And we interrupted three potential al-Qaeda attacks,

[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.940]
including that very dangerous suitcase bomber Jose Padilla.

[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.740]
And of course, the one in Buffalo and the one in Detroit,

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.420]
which have already been debunked, has been totally fictitious.

[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.460]
But nevertheless, three, I heard it was 40.

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.860]
I heard it was 400, but they just haven't given us the details yet.

[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.320]
Probably a Vavrovnoons.

[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.780]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.320]
I'm sorry, Folly.

[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.880]
Just a reminder for our radio listeners,

[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.460]
that the end of the world is going to come next Tuesday at 4.30pm.

[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.500]
And the Department of Health has requested homeowners to unplug all electrical appliances,

[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.120]
turn off radios and TV sets, and disconnect gas stoves and furnaces.

[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.760]
The post office recommends that you mail early in the day.

[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.280]
And for those with automobiles, alternate side of the street parking will be suspended.

[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.440]
That's the end of the world next Tuesday at 4.30pm.

[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.500]
Mark it down.

[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.020]
All right.

[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.420]
1018 at 5.16 WQA.

[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.520]
And we got Mohawar David.

[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.860]
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.600]
And two o'clock.

[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.360]
Curtison for the Mad Dog at 4.

[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.940]
And then you got your Panther preview at 7.

[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.440]
Tampa Bay Lightning, we stand the Cup Champion Lightning to play the Panthers at the Bank of Atlanta,

[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.280]
and the Panther Renta Center at 7.30pm.

[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.600]
And then Eddie K. after the hockey game.

[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.700]
Better fill that place up tonight, because it's kind of embarrassing here in about thousands of empty seats

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.720]
for the home opener after all that time.

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.560]
Wow, that's pretty weak.

[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.440]
Pretty weak.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.120]
Speaking of pretty weak, we got more dead Americans in Iraq.

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.560]
Bad news from Iraq.

[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.600]
Again, bomb blast killed six Marines in Western Iraq,

[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.760]
and US forces killed 29 militants.

[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.920]
And US offensive aimed at uprooting Al Qaeda insurgents and the country's vote on that new constitution.

[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.320]
The American deaths brought to total to a nice even 1950.

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.580]
That's easy to remember.

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.160]
That was a hell of a year, 1950.

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.140]
That's the number of troops of that since the beginning of the war of 2003,

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.240]
quite of the AP count.

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:12.780]
They're counting.

[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.060]
You have just numbers, numbers on a wall somewhere on the chart.

[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.400]
Not like people, not like human beings living and breathing, but just numbers on the chart.

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.220]
1950.

[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.340]
Mark it down.

[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:21.860]
Okay.

[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.640]
I notice on the poll of the poll we're doing today about presidential hopefuls.

[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.580]
I noticed that Joe Affineberg, we had it on their distance extra-aggravation.

[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.100]
At least you're consistent, baby.

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.060]
He's got-

[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.300]
Oh!

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.780]
Just like the numbers they have on their arbitraron rating.

[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.020]
Oh!

[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.660]
Point something.

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.580]
Oh, he's got old point.

[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.480]
Oh, old point.

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.020]
Oh, no.

[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.880]
Oh, man.

[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.760]
That is such great news.

[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.060]
And you know why?

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.820]
Because we would do anything to hurt him.

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.560]
That's what I hear.

[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.080]
Yeah.

[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.440]
We'll do anything to hurt them.

[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.300]
Except for Joe, we like Joe a lot.

[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.840]
And not to else, we can't stand him.

[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.240]
He's an idiot.

[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.240]
And Zach.

[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.160]
We like Joe and Zach Krants.

[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.980]
Other than that, the hubbmann dread, as they say, in Vietnam.

[00:17:59.540 --> 00:17:59.660]
Yeah.

[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.000]
What is the funniest TV show of all time?

[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.980]
That's what we asked yesterday.

[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.280]
How many votes do we get?

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.100]
2009.

[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.300]
How do you like that?

[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.740]
2009, a weekday poll.

[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.500]
This puts us in really very serious and dangerous territory.

[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.340]
Didn't we have like 1200, almost 1200 during the show, right?

[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:14.880]
Right.

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.380]
I'm pretty damn impressed.

[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.740]
And we already got 419 on the poll today.

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.000]
And we haven't even gotten close to getting to that.

[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.500]
Joe still's got-

[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.840]
Oh!

[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.440]
Wow.

[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.160]
Somebody please vote for him.

[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.560]
We'll start showing the chairs and brick a bracket and crap around.

[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.180]
Brick a bracket.

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.620]
Yeah.

[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.480]
Rift a bracket.

[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.780]
So the deal is, I didn't realize that.

[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.200]
Across the street is the broadcast studio.

[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.980]
But their business offices are in Hollywood.

[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.420]
I was at like, were we used to be with Paxon?

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.620]
No, I don't know.

[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.200]
Well, why not?

[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.760]
This is an important crap man.

[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.420]
We need to know.

[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.460]
I don't know a lot about that outfit.

[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.600]
Well, you better start digging pretty deep because I got some very good clothes this morning.

[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.580]
Some real dirt, some nasty dirt on what's happening over there.

[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.660]
They're coming on glued.

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.040]
And when the general manager starts throwing furniture and putting his fist through the wall,

[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.480]
you know he's coming on glued.

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.680]
Oh, not new about that.

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.580]
Over here.

[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.040]
What's the funniest TV show of all time we asked yesterday?

[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.920]
Signed fell 275.

I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:17.500]

[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:17.500]

[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.700]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:28.840]

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:28.860]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:28.900]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.320]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.240]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.240]

[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.920]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.060]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.740]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.280]

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.400]

I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.480]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.160]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.160]

[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.200]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.200]

[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.720]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.020]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.600]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.020]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:58.540]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.620]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.700]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.340]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.300]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.620]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.460]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.740]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.460]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.060]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.580]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:26.580]

[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:26.700]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.160]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.040]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.180]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:28.640]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.440]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.140]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.560]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.120]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.500]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.580]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.020]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.460]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.440]
I know I'm in fact the other way around.

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.920]
Let's see how Joel is doing on a pool.

[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.800]
He's got four votes already out of five seventeen.

[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:51.940]
So let's see.

[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.160]
They fear him the most.

[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:59.120]
That's Stugots, Jorose, Dan LaPastude, and Zach have all voted so far for Joel.

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.240]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.860]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.780]
Joel, you're fair list.

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.620]
He's five sixteen Q.A.S.

[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.180]
I asked it.

[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.260]
Absolutely.

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:13.620]
Absolutely.

[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:13.840]

[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.020]

[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.160]
Absolutely.

[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.520]
Absolutely.

[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.300]
Absolutely.

[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.620]
Finally, entitled Tom Delay.

[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.200]
Yes.

[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.700]
I hope they love it.

[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.780]
The cook is absolutely.

[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:22.720]
Oh!

[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.160]
It's here, Amanda, by a fire by a name ray.

[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.840]
Down it should, should.

[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.880]
Should, should, should.

[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.600]
Should, should, should, should, should, should.

[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.280]
Should, remain.

[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.180]
He was the leader of the GOP.

[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.140]
A greasy beat with a redistricting scheme.

[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.060]
And now he's gone a face of friends or he.

[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.760]
That is your Shushu.

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.600]
Shushu.

[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.060]
Shushu.

[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:52.440]

[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.000]
Should, remain.

[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.800]
He's called a hammer and pots of tongs.

[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.760]
Another pot of mainly Christian tongs.

[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.760]
This white peel from you can call her him gone.

[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.480]
That is your Shushu.

[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:10.920]
Shushu.

[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.420]
Shushu.

[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.960]
Shushu.

[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:13.320]

[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:13.840]
Shushu.

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.820]
Should, remain.

[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.620]
But in the mighty bush body.

[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.620]
My name is Amal Phil Brist and Brownie.

[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.580]
Brownie and Brist is where they all should be.

[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.600]
Brown, Shushu.

[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:30.440]

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:32.780]
Shushu.

[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.660]
Shushu.

[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:34.280]

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:34.700]
Shushu.

[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.700]
Should, remain.

[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:41.780]
Shushu.

[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.160]
Shushu.

[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:45.860]
Shushu.

[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.260]
Shushu.

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.260]

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.260]

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.260]
So, speaking of German food, I'm just wondering.

[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.040]
I've never had dawned on me before, but I think I figured it out.

[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.060]
Where they named after Stu Gottst, they named Viennese Nitzel.

[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.300]
Isn't that his real name, John?

[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:55.600]
Right.

[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.780]
I never thought of him.

[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.320]
And he sure lived it up to it, too.

[00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.660]
But he ain't no Joel Feinberry.

[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.080]
I mean, his daddy's got a few bucks, but I guess Joel's daddy must be loaded.

[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.420]
Especially to give away 4.5 million for the dolphins.

[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.720]
A year that is.

[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.580]
535 votes on the pool.

[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.600]
This is heavy duty now.

[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.700]
And Rudy Giuliani is going to go zooming up there.

[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.840]
Now, that's my bad.

[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.100]
I'll let him off.

[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.860]
What 2000 presidential hopeful do you fear the most?

[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.060]
And of course, with Bernie Kyrrick about his neck like an albatross, I'm just not seeing it.

[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.560]
Although an MSWC vest, they tried it out.

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.900]
Bernie Kyrrick is a guest expert on this latest threat in New York.

[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:28.760]
Not incredible?

[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:29.460]
Incredible.

[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.040]
And he said, use the apartment.

[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.960]
Use the apartment.

[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.280]
535 votes.

[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.720]
Jevvos, your fat ass governor.

[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.480]
They fear him.

[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.820]
And rightfully so, he's got some devious plans of his sleeve and deep inside his-

[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.660]
Don't leave me, your fat ass governor.

[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.940]
263.

[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.280]
How are slots coming, Jevvos?

[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.780]
The only slot he knows is that same-

[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:47.900]
Right.

[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.040]
Don't we just referring to?

[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.520]
Bill Fist 97, a far-bison if there ever was one.

[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.460]
Hillary Clinton 65, they fear her.

[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.880]
Maybe they fear her because they figure she can't win.

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.760]
Or maybe they fear her for whatever reason.

[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.240]
Congolese a 31.

[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.400]
Please a Congolese a just go away.

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.040]
Newt Gingrich 25, John McCain 16.

[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.020]
John Kerry 12, Al Gore 10.

[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.740]
Jill Biden 6.

[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.920]
Rudy Giuliani 4.

[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.140]
And Joel Feinberg 4.

[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.640]
Now there is a Quinella, right?

[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.360]
Okay.

[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.840]
And Barack Obama only 2.

[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.500]
So obviously if he would take the people on the bottom as the Barack Obama for president.

[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.080]
2008, that'll be great.

[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.420]
It's 5.10 times.

[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.420]
Do you want to hear that?

[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:30.300]
And I might even force some of the dark folks out there to force their way through and demand to be able to vote next time.

[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.220]
Just jam their way in through there.

[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.120]
Just jam on it.

[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.860]
And I'm confused now which break I'm supposed to be doing.

[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.560]
I did the 40 break, right?

[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:39.200]
Yes.

[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.420]
I just didn't cross it out.

[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.520]
Why did I give a little bit to this combined way of having these long commercial break?

[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.120]
I'll tell you one thing, man.

[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.520]
Our sales department, they are doing one hell of a job.

[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.020]
They're on top of it.

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.540]
It being course screw in.

[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.200]
Rudy Giuliani speaking to him said yesterday that he plans to return to politics,

[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.600]
but that it's too early to say that it'll be for the 2008 presidential campaign.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.620]
I think I'll return to politics, he said, in the speech to business leaders.

[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.020]
As to the identity political visions, he laughed and rubbed his forehead, his bald spot.

[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.360]
I have some political visions.

[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.700]
I just don't know what they are yet. They're a little foggy, he said.

[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.420]
Though he wasn't asked specifically about the next presidential campaign,

[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.020]
he mentioned the 2008 race, said it's too far away to make up.

[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.360]
Obviously, that means he's running.

[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.320]
He's running.

[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.680]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.660]
Project for Joe Pinebugs.

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.760]
He could use it by the fistful.

[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:27.960]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.240]
Forget it, I'm sick of myself.

[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.460]
Yeah, me too.

[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.160]
I don't blame you, by the way.

[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.220]
70 QAM, hello.

[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:35.860]
QAM.

[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.340]
We're the guys that reported live from a river where there are no Putin cops.

[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.260]
5.6.7, let's get a lot of those on because I want to keep those fresh in my memory on that.

[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:47.600]
That's right.

[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.040]
I'll make a tape for you.

[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.720]
An addition to which we can build you up for Monday, you hit start.

[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.760]
Yeah, build me up, buttercup.

[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.460]
It's part of our head start program.

[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.680]
5.6.7, I don't see any calls on there.

[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.300]
Though 5.6.7, 05.60.

[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.080]
Probably because we're in the middle of Ramadan now and we got to Russia showing out of the way we're all getting ready for the big fast next week.

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.180]
Thursday on Jung Kippur.

[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.520]
Gonna be fastin'.

[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520]
I'm gonna be eating traceman.

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.240]
I'm gonna be eating extra bratwurst over there just in honor of your own kippur as my rebellion against all the silly crap.

[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.560]
Oh, we have to attone for our sins.

[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.300]
Yeah, you first.

[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.400]
Sin my ass.

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.260]
WDQAM, hello?

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:19.980]
Hey Neil.

[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.440]
You kind of open my eyes about something.

[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.660]
You're talking about two gods.

[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.020]
And I wonder how this bad guy got his job.

[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.620]
And now you tell me this is, oh, there I know he has no sports background journalist, the cure as an athlete.

[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.720]
Nice and bored off.

[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.660]
Yeah, he's the boarder.

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:33.900]

[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.380]
Yeah, I forgot.

[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.980]
I hate you suboss around all the time.

[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:36.400]
Right.

[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.080]
You got it.

[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.800]
And then Italians, you got the interaction.

[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]
Maybe somebody can correct me on that but that's what I heard.

[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.240]
I'll be doing that.

[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:42.820]
Hmm.

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.560]
I'm out.

[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.140]
Okay.

[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.660]
Well, he is a stiff.

[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.740]
There's no question about that.

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.240]
WDQAM, hello?

[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:49.980]
QAM.

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.020]
Hi, Neil.

[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:51.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.320]
How are you doing?

[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.140]
Listen, I was watching the Canadian Ranger game yesterday.

[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.160]
I'm so sick.

[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.440]
Can you read all that one too, I think, didn't I?

[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.080]
Monthly all on.

[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.780]
What's with all these power plays?

[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.660]
Like, you can't even touch the other guy.

[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.420]
That's right.

[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.240]
They're opening it up and it's the best thing I ever did.

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:05.600]
It's normal.

[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.620]
Long overdue.

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.740]
There won't be all the power plays once these guys find to get the message.

[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.820]
No more talking.

[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.400]
I'm hoping you'll hold.

[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:11.840]
Because.

[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.360]
Don't start talking hockey.

[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.160]
You know, then that's a set up call from Joe.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:15.940]
You're not fooling me.

[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.540]
That's definitely a set up call.

[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.340]
Yeah, get him talking to some hockey.

[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.320]
That'll kill the audience.

[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.380]
They'll tune over to our very football intensive morons, you know, the OJ and toast and omelette

[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.100]
and sandwich and whatever.

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.160]
Meatball.

[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.100]
Yeah.

[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.920]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.600]
I saw a Jinsley Bullock leave Tom Krueger's apartment.

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.800]
Oh, boy.

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.440]
I think Tom can do better than that.

[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:38.960]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.220]
How's it going, Uncle Neil?

[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.080]
Pretty good, Polly.

[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.160]
What's the last day of Howard's contract, you know, when he's out here?

[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:45.840]
I have no idea.

[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.160]
Hi, now Howard Stern.

[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.940]
No, no, no, the monkey man.

[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.380]
The train monkey man, I don't know.

[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.440]
If you find out, can you announce it?

[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.460]
Because I'm playing on having a huge party.

[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.340]
I'm going to have everybody over by my play.

[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.820]
You can have it at Runway any 84.

[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.620]
We'll call up Anthony.

[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.200]
We would call Anthony the drug dealer, but he still did.

[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.960]
Unfortunately, the 23 year old guy who had that scale that this right thing came in.

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.060]
But I think he won the weight because he had a couple of pinnacles.

[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.380]
That's not the last scale.

[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.920]
He was a drug dealer.

[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.820]
Ooh.

[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.420]
Very sad.

[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.400]
Nobody cares, you know, stuff.

[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.960]
It's how outrageous stuff goes on.

[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.000]
And the American public just, you know, they got their own little agenda.

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.120]
They're trying to make enough money to fill up their tank with gas.

[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.960]
And thank you again, Mr. President, by the way, for these phenomenal gas prices.

[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.240]
This is really a bargoon affair if it was one.

[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:32.820]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:33.940]
Hey, man. How are you?

[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:34.580]
Pretty good.

[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.100]
Listen, you haven't had any gas keys yet today.

[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.820]
And he has chronicled the last 13 times that bad news came up for Bush.

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.500]
There was a terrorist attack or another attack or a fight.

[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.500]
A terrorist alert or a high alert, like systematic.

[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.900]
It's just so ridiculous.

[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.480]
People just don't realize that.

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.840]
Nobody's not finding it anymore. Nobody's paying any attention.

[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.560]
Did you happen to see who he's planning to put up to take the place about in Greenspan?

[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.960]
Ema Sumak.

[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.400]
Another corny, the guy who's only credential was that he put Jenna and Barbara through college.

[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.720]
He's never been out of the bank.

[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.520]
That's what it's all about.

[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:11.540]
Sure.

[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.600]
Crook is in cronies, baby.

[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.480]
That's what it's all about.

[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.460]
It's the most horrendous thing and a bit more on letting it happen on purpose in this country.

[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.100]
Impete sounds good to me, man.

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.020]
Oh, I love it.

[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.620]
He's a sort of beach ought to be impete like that vizzes.

[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.940]
I might just have to play pretty soon.

[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.840]
Have a great weekend, pal.

[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.340]
All right, Neil.

[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:27.640]
Bye-bye.

[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.240]
Calm down.

[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.100]
5'67", 05'60", 05'60", on the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.120]
Rolling Stones constant, the University of Virginia was interrupted the two in the last night.

[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.740]
While several police officers and three bomb-stiffing dogs searched the state.

[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.060]
The show we turned after about half our intermission.

[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.840]
University, state and city police didn't immediately return phone calls about the incident.

[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.180]
No one asked me what was made of the audience about the reason for the break.

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.500]
About eight songs out of the show, Mick Jagger announced the authorities and told them to take a break.

[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.200]
Take a break.

[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:03.640]
The state's at the University's 61,000-seat Scott State, even about the first 20 Rosa spectators were cleared until police finished their work.

[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.460]
The songs, it's interesting they're touring the promoter, ladies and gentlemen, a bigger bang.

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.620]
And they hit like a little incident.

[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.060]
I run a bigger bang.

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.720]
Well, maybe they're going to like, maybe it's just a blue-bow message to those guys.

[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.600]
Okay, the stuff, singing all of them songs in Ockin' L, president, and stuff like that.

[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.580]
Be a little bit too political these days.

[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.520]
Think that might be it?

[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:22.900]
No.

[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:23.980]
That sounds good.

[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:24.460]
Yeah.

[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.040]
572 votes were going to be on the Virgin 600 by the top of the air by 11 o'clock.

[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.760]
How do you like that hockey fans, huh?

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.720]
Holy moly, rat man.

[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.520]
Let's get really hockey intensive.

[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.680]
That'll let us set up more real good for a two o'clock.

[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.860]
Tough for the Toronto Maple Leafs to keep going without their leader.

[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.220]
Yeah, you'll be okay, Matt.

[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.880]
Just put a peg on it.

[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.620]
Do it there, Matt.

[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.400]
Double to QIM.

[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:44.760]
Hello.

[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.180]
Line 1 is actually still on there, but they're not talking yet.

[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.660]
QIM.

[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.140]
Go to lunch, charge.

[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.100]
Go to lunch.

[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.640]
Where you go to lunch.

[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.760]
I love to.

[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.320]
That was great.

[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:57.820]
I love it.

[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.280]
No, no, no.

[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.940]
Great idea too.

[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.560]
I wonder he was calling directly from a cell phone on his inner.

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.460]
You think?

[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.920]
Sure sounded like it.

[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.720]
Dominic QIM.

[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.080]
Hello.

[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.820]
Those are your buttercubs.

[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.780]
Definitely up.

[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.580]
Dominic QIM.

[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:09.980]
Hello.

[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.420]
Hey, you.

[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:12.880]
What's up?

[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.560]
You.

[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:16.940]
Dominic QIM.

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.240]
Hello.

[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:18.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.660]
The canola I got through and you know how you doing?

[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.400]
Pretty good.

[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.780]
A couple of things for you real quick.

[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.800]
Where are these idiotic Republicans going to realize that a greenhouse effect and that's

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:27.920]
going to be a lot of things that are going to happen.

[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.420]
And all these things that are contributing to these natural disasters worldwide are actually

[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.280]
going to happen.

[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.140]
It's bad for business.

[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:33.580]
They're not.

[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.480]
They will not ever fess up to it.

[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.280]
A lot of things that bad for business, though, you know.

[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.380]
It's just a county pico liberal omit.

[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.280]
It's just propaganda.

[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.540]
There's no global warming.

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.480]
There's no more these greenhouse gases or green span gases.

[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.480]
And it's just a liberal propaganda.

[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.340]
Between us.

[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.120]
It's between friends.

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:48.540]
Right.

[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.240]
One more thing for you.

[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.600]
It's a whole idea.

[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.680]
I don't think it's a whole building thing.

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.100]
There would be.

[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.040]
It has to be something that.

[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.980]
That's even better.

[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.240]
You would have just one day.

[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.120]
I want to know how to my own curiosity on, I don't know whether you're curious or not.

[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.240]
But I guess you can word it when was the heyday or when is the heyday of the neurotic.

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.300]
And I guess you can break it down into different.

[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:13.040]
Yeah, the only problem with that is that there are a lot of people listening now who weren't

[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.940]
listening before QA.

[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.880]
Am I been on here eight years?

[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.000]
So I mean, that's okay.

[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.340]
But it'll never be.

[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:17.340]

[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:21.460]
But I mean, my idea would be like to even, you can put from IOD from whatever time you were

[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.180]
there because I started thinking.

[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.400]
There won't be your vote.

[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.780]
When Rick and Todd and you and Phil, that's when I first I guess I was what 94.

[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.120]
Are you sure?

[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.280]
I'm positive.

[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:31.820]
Yeah.

[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.680]
So that would be my vote.

[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.200]
Okay.

[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.540]
But anyway, we're also thinking of how many people in the audience.

[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.400]
But I think that this show right now is a lot better than the show in IOD.

[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.420]
The show in IOD was pretty cool.

[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.800]
You know what it might, you know what it might have been?

[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.580]
It was just a lineup.

[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.840]
I mean, everything just sort of flowed together.

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.760]
I think if I could say that.

[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.900]
We've done that poll, whatever, however we worded it.

[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.120]
That's a different to poll.

[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:51.720]
Right.

[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.220]
But then you have the sports nerd station.

[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.820]
You know, it was an entertainment station and they were proud to say that.

[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.700]
And the sports was restricted to two hours between six and eight or whatever.

[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.380]
What sports talk?

[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.240]
And I was more than enough.

[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.540]
That was two hours was plenty and then some.

[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:05.940]
Right.

[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.340]
But then we didn't have a bunch of sports nerds running.

[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.220]
And have a great day, pal.

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:09.820]
You're too late.

[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.800]
Thanks for the poll.

[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:11.420]
Idea.

[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.800]
10.54, take a look at that.

[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.280]
And see, this is not a building pool today.

[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.160]
I didn't want to do one of those.

[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:17.520]
586.

[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.040]
Although we did Agile Feinberg.

[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.600]
He's right near the bottom though.

[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.140]
He's got four.

[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.820]
They don't hear him too much.

[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.240]
Although Dan La Bastard is a, got some nasty things to say about you.

[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.020]
I wouldn't be worried so much about Joe Rose.

[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.640]
It's that Dan La Bastard guy.

[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.320]
That's the Chigger in the Woodpile.

[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.620]
Joe, that's the one that ought to be real concerned about.

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.440]
Any guy that comes to work in those Guaya Barras, I'd be real nervous about.

[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.780]
Even George ain't too crazy about Guaya Barras.

[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:41.640]
Never had one.

[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.440]
Never wore one.

[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:42.860]
Didn't you really?

[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.540]
I didn't.

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:43.760]
Yeah.

[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.560]
That kind of was so fat I had to wear the shirt.

[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.300]
I can't put it all the way.

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.320]
Yeah, the fat guys, you can't tuck in my shirt.

[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.240]
So you wear it as big like my friend.

[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.540]
My fat rich used to be.

[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.620]
You know, you wear them like tents.

[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.520]
It's either Guaya Barras or Hawaiians, you know.

[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.720]
They're Hawaiians are good.

[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.540]
And I'm Dick Feinberg.

[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.200]
We're as Hawaiians and he's as skinny as a rail over there at Pompe and O'Park.

[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.000]
And especially lately probably after that unfortunate business they had in Belluxi with that casino company.

[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.840]
Probably a dick is restricted like one meal a month now at the track.

[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.280]
So times a little bit tough.

[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.840]
They'll be back.

[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.560]
They'll bounce back.

[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.500]
We'll get the slots in there.

[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.100]
Just hang on.

[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.080]
You know, when pigs start flying like crazy when they're all over the sky, then you'll see slots.

[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.300]
That's the story that I had to call Hank that.

[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.480]
About that lady who put the 17 quarters in the slots in Appaluchus or whatever that place was Louisiana at the race track casino.

[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.640]
And 1.6 million.

[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.380]
I could put in 1.6 million dollars and I'd get $4.25.

[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.540]
It's the other way around.

[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.340]
There's Rob Marciano in CNN with a nice suit and a tie.

[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.680]
I'm looking really spiffy today.

[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.140]
Wingland.

[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.060]
Tonight Boston might get their game in New York.

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.320]
He's my hero, man.

[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.120]
Rob Marciano.

[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.140]
He ain't no Rocky Marciano and then again he don't have cauliflower ears either.

[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.920]
See there's the tip off on boxing.

[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.880]
All you people are continuing supporting the barbaric so-called sport of boxing.

[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.060]
Cauliflower ears.

[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.200]
In fact, the poster child for my boxing ought to be banned is Mohammed Ali.

[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.000]
So where the fuck will they're like these days?

[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.020]
Okay, calm down Rob.

[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:01.720]
I don't get to the scene.

[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.720]
I'm taking.

[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.880]
Come on, chance.

[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.020]
Hit him.

[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:20.760]
Slug him.

[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.720]
Combination.

[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.420]
Combination.

[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.860]
Tell us what he's doing with the Rock Your Wings.

[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:36.980]
Proging may end of an action back in Brown and a match of fight is Neil Rogers.

[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.120]
This is 5.16 Q.A.A.

[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.020]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.860]
This is your brain.

[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.540]
This is your brain.

[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:58.840]
This is your brain.

[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.340]
It's your brain.

[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.440]
Fard, you can turn your back hand.

[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:25.440]

[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:25.460]
So when we talked about it, they handed us the MY better.

[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.820]
If we could have taken some advantage, we all would have turned our lives on and cut our lives to free.

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.020]
The incineries warning

[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.520]
Are

[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.720]
The government says we prove it

[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.580]
And I'm saying

[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.180]
They say not if but when now

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.820]
No specific criteria

[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.600]
Yeah, think there are hopes they give me a stroll

[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.600]
I think that I just will ignore it

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.980]
Yeah, live my life

[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.980]
Enjoy the ride in my life

[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]
I paint a bike

[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.120]
Terrorist

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.540]
Make it take a walk

[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.900]
I'll tell you, once I've been to a dangerous package

[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.960]
There's a Penn station because one of the hazmat guys

[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.540]
It's got a hot pot Sunday at Bansky Robbins and then

[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.140]
It was perusing the Hustler magazine at the newsstand right next to it

[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.140]
So how do you eat the all that heavy duty?

[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.640]
How do you eat that Sunday with that helmet on?

[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.700]
We got, never on a Sunday

[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.040]
We got 612 votes with a straw probably

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.960]
Do we put it in and have the nuke it for a lot?

[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.940]
I think we could play it

[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.000]
Second through a straw

[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.540]
612 votes which 2008 presidential hopeful do you fear the most?

[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.080]
Your fat ass governor, Jeb Bush is instilling fear into the hearts of all

[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.360]
303, look at that he's looking at play girl now that's bad

[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.700]
Bill Frist 104, Hillary Clinton 74, Condoleezah 38

[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.180]
She ain't too great, Newt Gingrich, Newy Boy

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.080]
He's starting to make a little bit of noise 32

[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.780]
John McCain 16, John Kerry 14

[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.360]
So John are you forward or against it today?

[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.880]
That's what I thought

[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.760]
He was before it and after worded

[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.260]
Al 411, Rudy Giuliani 8

[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.040]
He's stepped over a few people

[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.760]
Joe Biden 6, Joel Feinberg with 4

[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.700]
That is really Joe Rocksaw and it's so proud

[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.840]
And Barack Obama only 2, they want Barack

[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.340]
642 votes and it's only just moments after 11 o'clock

[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.220]
There is something in the year man you can smell a thunder clap

[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.740]
Newmen are going to do a song about it there is something in the year

[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.640]
Wow and it's us we're kicking some serious big fat smelly ass

[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.000]
How do you like that Joel? Huh?

[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.280]
See one thing about people who are wannabe

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.780]
He ain't no Greg Reed and of course Greg has a problem or two

[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.580]
But Greg Reed is like a monster, a giant in the broadcasting industry

[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.340]
Compared to what God it's got a lot of debt

[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.680]
He's money and wants to be a broadcasting

[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.900]
Oh he's not into broadcasting, he's more into marketing

[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.980]
That's about the only thing that the moment of

[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.200]
Lucidity that they hit over there when he said

[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.220]
Oh well we're not really so much into a broadcasting

[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.880]
We want to be more from a marketing

[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.160]
Well whatever that means and believe you me like I've told you before

[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.740]
I'm glad to hear that because broadcasting ain't them

[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.620]
Other than Joe they haven't got anybody on there over there

[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.080]
Belongs on here to say hello and goodbye

[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.960]
I mean the books you respond on the old play by play

[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.200]
And you know I know it's all consistent

[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.220]
I am I said that when he was on this stage and two tonight

[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.900]
Yeah about a zillion times

[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.380]
And that's the only guy that is Mayor Bloomberg

[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.900]
Rob the subways is usual today

[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.200]
But there's a panic attack and the world is coming safety safety

[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.800]
And look at the great Java, Bush is doing it keeping yours safe

[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.720]
Right

[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.120]
Look at the great Java he didn't know all the ins and all the wrong

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.300]
The Gulf Coast there in Texas

[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.520]
Wow heavy heavy duty

[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.560]
But nevertheless

[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.300]
Rob to give additional testimony and leave a leaf inquiry

[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.700]
Oh what the leafs

[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.140]
Federal prosecutors are accepted an offer from presidential adviser Carl Rob

[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.040]
To give the eleventh hour testimony in the case of Valerie Plains leaked identity

[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.880]
But if one day can't guarantee that he won't be indebted

[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.960]
According to people directly familiar with the investigation

[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.620]
Oh right

[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.040]
And a rumor I'm here and after reading a couple of things online this morning

[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.640]
There's an invite at least one coming down

[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.860]
The first one is a spoke of course on condition of anonymity because of grand jury secrecy

[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.360]
And because they've had either lives and those of their families and pets

[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.960]
So a special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald hasn't made any decision yet

[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.080]
And whether to file criminal charges against the long time confidant of President Bush

[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.480]
Or anybody else for that matter

[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.860]
The US attorney's man you will require prosecutors not to bring witnesses before a grand jury

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:20.840]
If there's a possibility of future criminal charges unless they're notified in advance that the grand jury testimony can be used against them in a later indictment

[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.500]
Rob has already made at least three grand jury appearances and his return at this late stage in the investigation is unusual

[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.640]
The prosecutor did not give Rob similar warnings before his earlier grand jury appearances

[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.000]
In other words you're going to have to let you come to testify again

[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.940]
But there's no guarantee that you're not going to be indebted your fat faculty ass

[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.780]
How do you like that?

[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.040]
Yeah

[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:48.120]
Rob offered in July to return to the grand jury for additional testimony and Fitzgerald accepted that offer after taking grand jury testimony from the formerly jailed nearer times reported to the court of june of the nor

[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:57.080]
Before accepting the offer of Fitzgerald sent correspondence to Rob's legal team making clear there was no guarantee that he won't be indebted at a later point is required by the rules

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.180]
How do you like that?

[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.600]
Oh, it's only

[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.140]
Yeah

[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:07.000]
Report has been called before a grand jury to testify about their conversations with Rob and scooter Libby by his president Dick Taney's chief of staff

[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.540]
Leaking the identity of a covert CIA agent can be a crime but it must be done knowingly and the legal threshold for proving such a crime is high

[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.440]
Fitzgerald could also seek charges against anybody who thinks lied to the investigation. How do you like that?

[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:25.980]
To a raid in a place called Messiah that I'm telling you this barbester that's a guy. I know a guy when I see one okay?

[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.180]
That is not a woman. That's a guy.

[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.500]
Nice glasses though

[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:41.120]

[00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.900]
And that's the best comment.

[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.380]
Who cares about yesterday and all even a Beatles don't care about yesterday. No more that's old news.

[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:13.120]
Let's go back yesterday. He's got a suggestion for yesterday's polls. If it F. Troop my ass do over horrible show you let's do that one over again.

[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:19.140]
What do you say? Okay, let me think that thing out for yesterday's pool. Now you are pathetic. I would do it right now.

[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:30.760]

[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.800]
Not a building pool today. So we are expecting a lot of very very a lot of meat today in the sand. Right.

[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.800]

[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.620]
Terror alert line. Hello.

[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.480]
Hey, how you doing pretty good? Two things. First of all this Harry of Myers is a insurance.

[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.440]
I like that insurance defense lawyer she used to take in orders. Yes, sounds like a choice.

[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.320]
And if you notice in the 10 years or so since promises been on the Supreme Court.

[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.160]
Not one such in the ruling has made has been different than Scalia.

[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:08.400]
Correct. So he's he just say he's token. She's going to be the third one third day. The chain here. Right.

[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.620]
Third line. The other thing is you know I was watching.

[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:20.260]
What after Katrina remember the most person who he noted the most with Harry Barber was all his peers and stuff.

[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.440]
No, he wasn't the one who he voted the most one of those in Orleans Councilman that went on TV was crying and the history.

[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.060]
Oh, Harry Barber was was right up there. But you know that in the back room.

[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.980]
I want to his main.

[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:37.460]
Cronies got six hundred million dollar no big contract. Yeah.

[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.100]
To do work down. That's why I hear these cheeks are all puffed up like that.

[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.680]
Oh, you should see this. This is such a.

[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:51.900]
They were trying to do a John McCain look alike on camera. They come out like they're so like insanely concerned.

[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.740]
Right. Look what? Look at the other.

[00:54:53.740 --> 00:55:03.520]
Of course not to mention that but he also you know I'm sure that he's got his hands deep in some of these pockets on that thing about to get the casinos back in on land and not out there floating out in the you know.

[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.900]
And most ironic thing is then they come out and go well how.

[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:14.260]
Oh wait a so wait a so many green substance was found in the soda can at Penn station. I think it was mountain do is what it was.

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:22.600]
Then they come out and they go how it's incorrect. It's forty million dollars. Look at all the money these guys have grafted away.

[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:30.440]
Yeah. The billions of billions and they come out. I noticed FEMA got so embarrassed that they had they're redoing some of the contract bids now some of those no big contracts.

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.660]
They're having to redo them because the investment factor that he was coming down so heavy duty now.

[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:40.900]
But how about all the billions that that he funneled to all these questions freaks you know over the years is on the.

[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:47.580]
I'll see the border pali calm down you just a little bit to over rock for me especially on the front and I want to get like all a so big.

[00:55:47.580 --> 00:56:03.720]
Did you see that I'm not making that up people may think I'm fun in which I would never do of course of course so big green substance was found in a soda can at Penn station that would cause me like absolutely going to a spastic fit to start doing like cartwheel right on the tracks wouldn't right right wouldn't.

[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:14.720]
So would green substance my ass what I heard maybe was like body wash probably mountain do I and you like mountain do know I do know I can do I can do without it in the mountains or anywhere else.

[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:33.900]
I think it don't like it very I don't know overly sweet and just I really have the best thing I've ever seen that I really wonder what part of the body that came from 647 votes on the pool man and we are it's just I bet you we like right around 800 again by noon like we were yesterday you see the pattern that's developing now.

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:58.440]
Of course you're going to be on next week to kind of slow down a little bit you know it now you want it'll be you'll see you'll see get all the young intellectuals on there and all these who hate me like poison like old you found a cone as you'll and all the Julio's of course just I just sure yeah just clawing at your footstacks they're going to want at it all right yeah they're clung oh there's the Hungarian president I'm sure they're having a wonderful conversation here in your prison.

I represent the case of democracy.

[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.660]
And I think we'll have here the same band.

[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.900]
The Degreeshoot down on the case.

[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.580]
Magyar Olsen.

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.400]
There you go now.

[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.800]
It's like in the bushes language.

[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.300]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.260]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.160]
Absolutely.

[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.000]
Wow.

[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.360]
Oh.

[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.400]
Much better.

[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.660]
I'm going to have to go.

[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:53.420]
Oh.

[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.080]
You're supposed to be this way.

[00:57:59.360 --> 00:57:59.960]
You're supposed to be the way.

[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.600]
I can't even trace you.

[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:04.400]
You're supposed to be this fatigue.

[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:06.980]
Very good.

[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.540]
I'll make a tenio.

[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.400]
Oh.

[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:35.000]
Rotterdam.

[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:46.400]

[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.460]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.080]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.040]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.320]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:08.620]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:08.820]

[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:08.820]

[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:08.820]

[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:10.360]

[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:10.360]

[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.740]
I'm thinking about that soapy green substance that was found in a

[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:15.940]
cell.

[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:16.960]
So to can.

[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:17.620]
Yeah.

[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.680]
That's a PlayStation.

[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.380]
And it means to be pointless like, oh, this is really

[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:23.760]
new.

[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.400]
It's okay.

[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.160]
Could be toilet green.

[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.440]
Yeah.

[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.360]
That could be it.

[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:29.940]
Or it could be more green.

[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.660]
How do you like that?

[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.340]
It could be more.

[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.080]
Rotterdam.

[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:32.420]
Green.

[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.040]
I'll be damned.

[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:36.380]
Anyway, there's your president with a Hungarian minister

[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.560]
who or whatever this guy is.

[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.680]
Looks like a real Nazi to me.

[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:39.880]
And the minister too.

[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.540]
Walmart turns in students anti-bush photo.

[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.060]
Secret Service investigates him.

[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.000]
This is Zain America, baby.

[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.400]
This is what's going on.

[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.840]
Oh, there goes the Hungarian guy.

[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.400]
He's got up to a distance red tie.

[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.260]
I'm not going to pick this extra value.

[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.340]
That's the right you shouldn't appear as you, your mama.

[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.220]
Selena Jarvis is the chair of the Social Studies Department

[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.420]
in Kurutuk County High School in North Carolina.

[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.820]
That's not where new year places.

[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.620]
It doesn't start familiar.

[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.620]
Kurutuk County High School, North Carolina.

[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.980]
She's not used to having the Secret Service question her

[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.780]
or one of her students.

[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.680]
But that's what happened on September the 20th.

[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.240]
Jarvis had assigned her senior civics and economics class

[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.940]
to take photos to illustrate their rights in the Bill of Rights,

[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.400]
she says.

[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.200]
Oh, I remember those.

[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.320]
One student had taken a photo of George Bush out of a magazine

[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.760]
and tacked a picture to a wall with a red thumbtactor

[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.300]
with his head.

[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.180]
Then he made a thumb sign down with his own hand next

[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.180]
to the president's picture.

[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.820]
He had a photo taken to that and pasted it on a poster.

[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:33.980]
Following this?

[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:34.560]
Right.

[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.820]
According to Jarvis, are you eating now?

[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:37.320]
Nope.

[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.600]
Oh, he's putting more paper in the ice machine.

[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.440]
According to Jarvis, the student who remains anonymous, of course,

[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.220]
was just doing his assignment and illustrating

[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.100]
the right to dissent.

[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.780]
But over at the Kitty Hawk Wal-Mart, where the student

[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.580]
took his film to be developed, that right

[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.500]
is evidently suspect Kitty Hawk.

[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.280]
That means they're on the coast.

[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.640]
An employee in that Wal-Mart photo department

[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.380]
called the Kitty Hawk Police on the student

[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.900]
and the Kitty Hawk Police turned them

[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.380]
out over the Secret Service.

[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.420]
How do you like that?

[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.040]
I don't, because he had a thumbed a red thumbtack

[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.720]
on a picture through the president's head.

[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.460]
On September 20th, the Secret Service came to Kurutuk High

[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.120]
and 1.35 in the PM.

[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.100]
The student came to me and told me the Secret Service

[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.380]
had taken his poster, Jarvis.

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.740]
And I didn't believe him at first,

[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.940]
but they had come into my room when I wasn't there

[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.740]
and taken his poster, which was in a stack with all the others.

[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.480]
She says the student was upset.

[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.480]
He was nervous.

[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.280]
He was scared.

[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.280]
And his parents ran out of town on business, said Jarvis.

[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.280]
She too had to talk to the Secret Service.

[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.940]
Halfway through my afternoon class, the assistant principal

[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.520]
got me out of class and took me to the office conference room.

[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.140]
She says, two men from the Secret Service were there.

[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.960]
They asked me what I knew about this student.

[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.280]
I told them he was a great kid.

[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.840]
That he was in the homecoming court

[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.160]
and they'd never been in trouble.

[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.060]
Then they got down to his poster.

[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.820]
They asked me, didn't I think that it was a suspicious,

[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.680]
Jimmy Carl's?

[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.500]
I said, no, it was a Billorite's project.

[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.660]
At the end of the meeting, they told her the incident

[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.380]
would be interpreted by the US attorney

[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.880]
who would decide whether the student could be indicted,

[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.400]
she said, oh my goodness.

[01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.700]
Do you hear this?

[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.600]
I heard it.

[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.240]
I'm shocked.

[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:01.740]
I love it.

[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.980]
Now, if it good, the student wasn't indicted yet.

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.060]
And the Secret Service didn't pursue the case further.

[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.920]
I blame Walmart more than anybody.

[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.620]
She says I was really disgusted with them,

[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.560]
but everyone was using poor judgment from Walmart

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.860]
up to the Secret Service.

[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.840]
A person in the folder, this is kind of like that woman

[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.960]
had the meat de focars t-shirt on the Southwest Airlines

[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.040]
plane and change one volume there.

[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.020]
She changed the, oh, to how you showed her

[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.140]
on the news last night about that.

[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:25.640]
Did they really?

[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.660]
And nice looking shirt, which I had one.

[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:29.480]
Yeah, right.

[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.440]
Well, let's start selling them while I'm on vacation, of course.

[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:32.920]
Of course.

[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.140]
A person in the folder department at Walmart and Kidney Huff

[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.820]
said he had to call either the home officer

[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.040]
or the authorities to get information about that.

[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.240]
Jackie Young, the spokesperson for Walmart

[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240]
at Company Headquarters did not provide comment.

[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.020]
She's mom.

[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.480]
Sharon Dempore, the Kidney Huff Police Department,

[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.560]
said we just handed it over to the Secret Service.

[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.960]
No investigative report was filed.

[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.860]
Jonathan Sherry, I wonder if he's

[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.560]
kind of Larry Sherry, who used to pitch for the doctors.

[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.920]
Jonathan Sherry spoke for the Secret Service in Washington, DC,

[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.220]
said we certainly respect artistic freedom,

[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.620]
but we also have the responsibility

[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.580]
to look into incidents when necessary.

[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.840]
In this case, it was brought to our attention.

[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.640]
Oh, look at that test revealed the Sophie Green substance.

[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.280]
His harmless.

[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.180]
Oh, thank God we were getting so worried.

[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.160]
That it might be Mountain Dew mixed with a little bit of a

[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:15.760]
burners.

[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.380]
Here you thought it was plastic explosives.

[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.260]
Or might have been worse.

[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.660]
It might have been some of that awful beer from Michigan

[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.560]
with us droz.

[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.020]
Oh, no.

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:22.580]
Oh, here.

[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.000]
Oh.

[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.360]
In this case, it was brought to our attention

[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.520]
from a private citizen, a photo lab employee,

[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.480]
said the Secret Service, Yuck.

[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.920]
Travis uses one word to describe the whole incident, ridiculous.

[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.160]
And people in our position can't be afforded to be made

[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.140]
to look ridiculous.

[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.400]
Like Joel Feinberg, every time those numbers come out

[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.600]
from Arbatron, he looks more and more ridiculous.

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.680]
When everybody in town finds out about that stupid voicemail

[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.820]
who left on Greg Reed's voicemail that time a few weeks ago.

[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.220]
Remember that?

[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:49.660]
Yeah.

[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.420]
Don't be sure you low-ball Kim Bull Campers,

[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.260]
because we're not going to try to hire him away from you.

[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.700]
So give him a like peanuts, OK?

[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.200]
Pay him in cracker jacks.

[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.280]
And don't give him too much.

[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.880]
Unlike Hank and Mad Dog that we held you up for, you know?

[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.660]
Sounds like sour grapes to me, Joel.

[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.240]
You would have given your left nut to get Hank into Mad Dog

[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.000]
over there, but guess what?

[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.960]
They were smart, not dumb like Frado,

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.420]
not like certain other people.

[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.040]
Smart.

[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.860]
Joe Rose, I can't blame him because he got screwed over by Greg

[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.040]
too many times so we can blame him.

[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.700]
But obviously he's smart enough to realize

[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.600]
that he's working for real dodo birds over there.

[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.040]
Because the F bombs are really flying.

[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.100]
That's the report that we're getting from inside.

[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:21.860]
Yeah.

[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.020]
That's what Daniel Maxx would have spread the rundown.

[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.900]
So between substance was a hoax at Penn Station.

[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.820]
Oh my God.

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.860]
And believe the language I hear on G-Re.

[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.820]
Every other word is an obscenity.

[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.920]
It used to be that cable was a horror on words.

[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.040]
But now the networks left their act.

[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:52.800]
Just turns.

[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.580]
Oh my God.

[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.840]
There's no end in sight to this obscenity.

[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.640]
All the dialogue and teeth for felixity.

[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.940]
And swear it like a sailor on a three day pass.

[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.880]
Words all up words that ask.

[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.320]
Welcome.

[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.860]
F bomb, F bomb, cow on with a face.

[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.080]
Before they drop the F bomb on a word TV.

[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.460]
F bomb, F bomb, there's no telling where.

[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.500]
They'll drop on a museum.

[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.680]
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about bombs at Penn Station

[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.980]
or anyplace else in New York today.

[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.700]
I'd be more worried about the F bomb.

[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.380]
That's why the FCC is working diligently.

[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.200]
And that's why they brought in that bitch there

[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.920]
that the Joyce looking sound alike.

[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.880]
To make them sure that we really, really cracked on.

[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.100]
On these word offenders, on these potty mouse,

[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.000]
on these evil people who are going to destroy

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.140]
the minds of our children for years to come,

[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.980]
for decades and centuries to come.

[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.860]
Forget about that global warming crap.

[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.880]
We got more important fish to fry like words.

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.080]
OK, who we at?

[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:51.980]
Like hockey game.

[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:53.680]
OK, who we at?

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.600]
675 votes on a pool.

[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680]
I don't know why they played that highlight

[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.460]
because you can't hear Bob Cool call it goal.

[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.380]
So it's kind of stupid.

[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.480]
What 2008 presidential hopeful,

[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.960]
you fear the most that's our pool.

[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.340]
675 means by 1130, we'll have about 700 votes already.

[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.320]
And commentators from coast to coast

[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.020]
and even some of the European writers

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.740]
are writing about the phenomenal response

[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.580]
we got on our pool here last lately, aren't they?

[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.680]
Yeah, sure, whatever.

[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.120]
They can't put it well for one little horse ball show

[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.940]
on one little teeny tiny radio station

[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.020]
with a really bad signal.

[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.340]
I mean, considering that.

[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.520]
How Stan and Tammy doing, by the way?

[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.020]
A lot of rain.

[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.380]
Oh, I thought you were talking about that country music act.

[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.460]
Because we have to sympathize with you.

[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560]
We got like some rain now and dreary and overcast

[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.840]
and not too warm like 56.

[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.720]
So we just don't want to make you feel too bad.

[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.740]
Yeah, it's fishy here.

[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:38.480]
Oh, no.

[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.360]
Anyway, jet bush 336, your fat ass governor.

[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.820]
They fear him and for good reason

[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.440]
because he has got devious plans

[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.820]
and a very highly dysfunctional family.

[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:47.860]
Oh, man.

[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.860]
Has he ever?

[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.940]
How's Neil Bush doing?

[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.580]
Is he still ripping off SNLs as much as he can?

[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.880]
Bill Frist 112.

[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.600]
Look out for the fist, myster.

[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.100]
Man, another goody two shoes and a doctor in the nose.

[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.140]
Those are the people who give you the magic pill

[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.020]
or slip you with that vial of porcelain or poison

[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.160]
or maybe slip it into a shoe.

[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.120]
Maybe some soapy green liquid.

[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.540]
When next time you're in a hospital,

[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.240]
maybe Bill Fist will come by and pay a visit,

[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.120]
turn off your IV or fix him, soapy green stuff in it.

[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.440]
It was a hoax.

[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.660]
It was much to do about nothing.

[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.780]
Not to think about everybody.

[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.180]
See, they sure accomplished their goal, man.

[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.280]
And now almost nobody is talking about all this other stuff

[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.660]
and right away it's, oh, New York,

[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.880]
or terror alert in the subway and everybody had pens

[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.660]
stationed in the eighties on the Pimple Needles

[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.880]
and the Ant-Traght Raya.

[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:30.400]
Right.

[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.940]
Like I said, they got wouldn't have been eaten

[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.600]
in bastard robins if he would have been all

[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.680]
that the word about some suspicious package.

[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.700]
I don't know, maybe he thought it was his last chance

[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.160]
to get some.

[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.700]
I've seen some suspicious packages.

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.200]
And I still haven't figured out what they are.

[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.120]
Jeb Bush 341, Bill Frist 112, Hillary Clinton 83.

[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.300]
And I wasn't caught a call in the Hasmed team either.

[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.700]
Condoleezza 40, Newt Gingrich 34, John McCain has got 18.

[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.640]
He's dancing cheek to cheek right now.

[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.140]
Oh, look at this.

[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.480]
New York City, but particularly the last couple of days

[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.480]
with a threat to the subway system

[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.800]
that was described as specific and directed right

[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.140]
at the New York City subway station.

[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.920]
This was the scene for most of the morning.

[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.580]
Oh, yeah, the Hasmed guys, that's so

[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.740]
pretty yellow and greenish P.

[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.240]
Newt Gingrich 34, that's probably where it came from

[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.300]
was the T-room.

[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.400]
John Kerry 17, he's read on John McCain's butt.

[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.840]
Rudy Giuliani 13, not a lucky number, Rudy.

[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.240]
Loan me the apartment, Rudy.

[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.080]
Loan me the apartment, Al Gore 11, Joe Biden 7,

[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.120]
Joe Feynberg got another way he's got five.

[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.160]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.520]
Joe and fact, you know something, there's only one person

[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.800]
that Joe Rose hates worse than Joe Feynberg.

[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.380]
You know who that is?

[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.080]
I don't know.

[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:36.800]
That's it.

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.520]
Oh, I was going to guess somebody else.

[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.320]
Joe Feynberg 5 and Barack Obama 2, you were going to say

[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.020]
Greg Reed, where he, that sounds like Sauer grapes to me.

[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:44.440]
Greg?

[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.560]
Oh, I think maybe you got to pull.

[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.280]
Maybe it's a tie.

[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.460]
What does it say?

[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.420]
When Joe Rose comes back to QM, which I understand isn't

[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.620]
the worst when Joe comes back to the station, we'll probably

[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.880]
have to put him on here and find out.

[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.280]
This is Neil Roger.

[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.020]
You tell me.

[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.440]
This is 5.62 AF.

[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.840]
We're still in value.

[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.580]
Here's the one you would say.

[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.640]
Here's your promise.

[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.020]
You'll end up me.

[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.280]
They'll ride in here.

[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.260]
Here's to the interest.

[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.160]
Got a hold on you.

[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:32.060]
What's this business that's actually a law priesthood?

[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.920]
Whoa, you're an unethical form.

[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.480]
Yeah.

[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:40.700]
Whoa.

[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:41.980]
Whoa.

[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.460]
With nowhere to run.

[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.460]
No one can save you.

[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.260]
Don't let you watch out.

[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.760]
Come on, the law.

[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.740]
What you say, no, but you give me positive.

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.100]
It's a bad day.

[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.540]
Let me say they'll rise and allow to change.

[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.460]
You can change it.

[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:01.700]
It's a bad day.

[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.660]
Come the way.

[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:07.580]
You can't question a bad name.

[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.320]
Another 30 is 5.62 AF.

[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.560]
And we're going to have to 701 posts on the pool, man.

[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.200]
You better get on the mountain tops, OK?

[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.360]
Get out your horn and shout it to the world.

[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.840]
Get on your bowl, horn.

[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.800]
5.6705.60.

[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.520]
You want to get a lot of these calls on between now.

[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.220]
And too, we got Moat II and Curtis for Mandol, or four.

[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.400]
Well, that Mandol, he's got a bitter deal and I or anybody else.

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.400]
He just, how many days of work does he, a year?

[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.200]
Does he want to be his year?

[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:32.540]
He has years on.

[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.860]
I've been with seven in the Lightning Panthers 730.

[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.080]
The Lightning looking pretty good from what I'm here

[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.640]
and then any care for the hockey game.

[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.540]
I mean, you know, when you got your home opener

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:44.140]
and you got 5,000 empty seats, it's a pretty sad situation.

[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.360]
Very, very sad.

[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.180]
I remember when we were like only 85 teams in the NHL.

[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.820]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:50.680]
5,500.

[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.660]
Q-A-M.

[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.980]
That, I knew.

[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:54.420]
I knew.

[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.240]
But, OK, whatever you say.

[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.580]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:58.540]
Hello.

[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.000]
Hey, Neil.

[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:00.640]
Good morning.

[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:01.440]
Buenos dias.

[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.260]
Buenos dias.

[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:06.120]
I just wanted to ask for your opinion on something.

[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.160]
You were reading about the article about the lady

[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.280]
that was wearing the T-shirt in the airport

[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.880]
with the supposedly F word on her shirt.

[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.700]
And Reno, yes.

[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:14.340]
OK.

[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.220]
I understand about whenever they show either nudity

[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.400]
or profanity on movies, television, even radio.

[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.420]
I can understand that.

[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.240]
I can understand your point about it and about censorship.

[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.540]
But don't you think that whenever someone is wearing something,

[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.960]
you know, with profanity on their T-shirt in public

[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.080]
where like kids are looking, isn't that just a little too much?

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.820]
No, absolutely not.

[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.180]
But then if I'm walking...

[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.860]
Kids are those words more than it does.

[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:48.060]
But then if I'm walking with my son and he's this shirt,

[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.000]
how can I explain to him, don't use this word

[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.760]
or prevent him from going to school

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.700]
and then start throwing this word around at a very young age?

[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.200]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.880]
Would you rather have your kid using curse words

[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.760]
or shooting somebody?

[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.180]
Well, I don't get it.

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:01.800]
Well, neither.

[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.980]
It was not a choice.

[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.040]
Words don't hurt anybody, OK?

[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.840]
And you just got through saying that's how you do it.

[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.500]
You explain them if you don't want to use those words.

[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.500]
Don't use them.

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.540]
It's a very vulgar word.

[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.880]
You ought to be not throwing it around.

[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.320]
That's all.

[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:13.820]
But that...

[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.940]
You see, this is what bugs me is that they're always using the children.

[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.480]
The children are the excuse to curb everybody's freedom,

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.760]
a speech freedom of expression.

[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.120]
We can't say things on a radio because it might impact the children.

[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.900]
Like the comedy bits we can't play anymore,

[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.260]
the children won't even understand

[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.400]
if we hand in children listening, which we don't,

[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.540]
they won't even understand them.

[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.820]
But that's always the excuse.

[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.860]
Oh, the children are going to be too bad, OK?

[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:35.960]
But then...

[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.420]
You can grow up.

[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.420]
But then if you hear someone say of one of these words on your show,

[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.940]
you hang up on them and you say,

[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.260]
oh, you got a filthy mouth.

[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.580]
No, I don't think you got a filthy mouth.

[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.940]
I believe you should be able to say any word you want on here.

[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.340]
I never said anybody had a filthy mouth.

[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.680]
We can't play them on the air.

[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.820]
We get fined.

[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:54.460]
No, I understand.

[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.820]
What if my child sees a Jesus bumper sticker that says Jesus saves?

[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.180]
Then I got to explain that to you.

[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.640]
Yeah, but it's not, but it's not profanity.

[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.460]
It is to me.

[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.520]
It is to us.

[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.360]
It's a false claim.

[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.320]
It's to me I've seen.

[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.760]
It's really I've seen when people...

[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.820]
Like, people who are...

[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.460]
Listen, listen.

[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.340]
Profanity is in the eye of the beholder.

[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.240]
Just like obscenity.

[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.220]
Not a thing.

[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.740]
Whatever offends you.

[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.140]
The emperor doesn't offend me.

[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.880]
This business I say you got a filthy mouth.

[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:21.440]
I don't...

[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.720]
What is this man talking about?

[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.280]
It's not anything on here anymore.

[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.840]
I believe in total freedom of speech.

[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:26.880]
You ought to be able to say,

[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.900]
every word has ever been a words don't harm people, OK?

[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.520]
Except Joel Feinberg gets all bent out of shape with anybody.

[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.960]
Rips him and a servant asks.

[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.280]
And he starts throwing the furniture around.

[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.560]
He starts tearing the place up like some kind of a maniac,

[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.120]
like some kind of a drunken jock in a hotel room somewhere.

[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.720]
712 votes on that pool and Joel's got 70s.

[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.420]
Time with Joe Biden.

[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.460]
Maybe Joel's Biden his time before they put something good on here.

[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.580]
I mean, that last call just...

[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.520]
It's so typical.

[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.440]
I'm so glad he called me too, because that's what they call today.

[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.280]
The children are going to see that t-shirt.

[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.320]
Big deal, OK?

[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.160]
There are people on the streets here, for example.

[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.640]
Well, of course, this is not America.

[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.200]
Thank goodness.

[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:05.800]
Right.

[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.200]
Walking around with the t-shirts and caps and they have the F-word.

[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.260]
And every other word you can have around.

[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.340]
But what's the big deal with that?

[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.400]
See, it's called parenting.

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.840]
You have to explain everything to your kids anyway.

[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.360]
The good, the bad, and the other people.

[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.640]
Yeah, I see how does he explain that.

[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.720]
And then he just got through.

[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720]
Tell me how he explains it.

[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:20.500]
Just tell him what you did.

[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:20.800]

[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.960]
You say, this is a word.

[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:22.600]
It means this.

[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.080]
You don't read it because it's going to offend people and a story.

[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.620]
Well, it's really, very, very sad.

[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.080]
But that's a good comparison you brought up.

[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.000]
The thing with it, Jesus craft those bumper stickers.

[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.460]
People are in the fish on the car.

[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.860]
How do you explain to your kids that there are

[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.620]
a bunch of religious freaks who use their cars

[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.780]
to religious billboard?

[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.100]
See, some of the bumper stickers, as you know,

[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.740]
make really outrageous claims.

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.700]
You know, and a kid is going to read that and believe it.

[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.620]
And then, of course, you've got to tell them that, no, it's not true.

[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.380]
My boss was a Jewish carpenter.

[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:47.680]
Yeah.

[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.980]
No Jesus, no peace.

[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.040]
No Jesus, no peace.

[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.340]
Oh, boy.

[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.440]
How about my boss was Karen carpenter, OK?

[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.020]
So to share some of those BLTs from Howeys,

[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.060]
what do you have a good severance plan?

[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:58.600]
Ivean.

[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.240]
717 votes.

[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.400]
We're going to be versioned on 800 by the new hour.

[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.760]
Mr. Curtis, Curtis, Curtis.

[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:05.740]
I am excited.

[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.740]
No, you're not.

[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.220]
How many QAM, hello?

[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.300]
Hey, Ney, how you doing?

[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:09.840]
OK.

[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:10.460]
All right.

[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:13.480]
Actually, I just tuned in and I was actually

[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.960]
going to talk to you about the P-H-O with the Post

[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.860]
and that was on the plane.

[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.780]
I guess something that you were already talking about.

[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.940]
No, I mentioned it yesterday.

[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.840]
I read the story, yeah.

[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.000]
OK, well, I apologize.

[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.660]
OK, go to apologize.

[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.740]
Just one side, I just was listening to what this guy called about.

[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.540]
I mean, I have a son that's under the age of 10.

[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.280]
And obviously exposed to reality, different things he hears,

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.380]
over here, sees.

[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.260]
But it's up to each parent.

[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.880]
As you guys said, and George would notice as a parent himself,

[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.740]
your job is to teach them what's right and what's wrong.

[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.880]
So you can't sit here and rely on society

[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.900]
and everyone else to do the parenting for you.

[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.860]
And with that being said, I agree with you.

[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.620]
I think every and anything in America, quote, unquote,

[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.980]
you should be able to say whatever it is that you want

[01:15:58.980 --> 01:15:59.460]
it to say.

[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.180]
Hey, Rita.

[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:00.660]
Miss Beach.

[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.080]
I think the family probably didn't say, well,

[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.900]
you can say you have freedom of speech, except whatever,

[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.320]
some people may find politically incorrect or offensive.

[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.340]
We have the right to offend people.

[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.920]
I offend people on this show every day.

[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.180]
And we'll continue doing it.

[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.500]
I have to do it.

[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.960]
And you know what?

[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.940]
It's the same one thing like you tell everyone else.

[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:20.940]
You don't like it.

[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:21.720]
Don't risk it.

[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.620]
And if that's something, love your show, too.

[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:24.500]
Thanks a lot, Pali.

[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.040]
Thank you.

[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.560]
Well, but you might offend somebody.

[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.840]
That's why the network says it's a bunch of voices, man.

[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.340]
And that's why they put people like Franklin Graham

[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.280]
and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson on the year.

[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.880]
And don't fall down laughing at them

[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.580]
and make a laughing stock out of them

[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.940]
is because they're terrified.

[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.000]
It's bad for business.

[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.940]
They might offend one of the potential sponsors.

[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.300]
But you know what, Yamama, OK?

[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.180]
Yamama.

[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.480]
You know that bumper sticker that says one way

[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.380]
of an insult to everyone who doesn't agree with that.

[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.220]
It's an insult, an offensive insult.

[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:50.660]
Yes.

[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.040]
To everyone who's life.

[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:52.920]
To say the same punch.

[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:53.400]
There you go.

[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.800]
There are slaughtering people by the thousands of life.

[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.320]
And these are the same people, of course,

[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.800]
that want everybody running around with the gun.

[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.420]
So then if we have some kind of a conflict

[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.880]
we can go to the first and away.

[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.700]
And the same people are like some gun

[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.920]
ho for capital punishment for frying somebody.

[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.380]
They can't kill somebody fast enough to make,

[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.920]
to give them that thrill.

[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.600]
But in the meantime, Terry and her

[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.400]
was very important because that was

[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.860]
almost the same as the old feedie sucker.

[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.220]
That's one of the rare times

[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.600]
they've ever seen somebody write wingers get all whipped up

[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.400]
to a frenzy about somebody who was alive.

[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.580]
And I used to turn very loosely.

[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.900]
You know, who's already out of the womb.

[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.320]
Yeah.

[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.420]
I always do have, I keep his fat ass out of her womb, OK?

[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.860]
Oh, but she's living and breathing.

[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.440]
And she talks and she walks and she follows the balloons.

[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.020]
Cute.

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:32.720]
Yeah.

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.080]
And another thing, Tony's pizza sure is great.

[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.760]
Oh, we love Tony's pizza, man.

[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:37.800]
We love Brad.

[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.800]
He is the best of it.

[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.600]
I'm 41 at 190 seconds.

[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.340]
It's also good.

[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:43.460]
Can't wait to tear into it.

[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:44.760]
You got papi runny on there?

[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.160]
Oh, please don't come and eat and cheese

[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.040]
and meet that's trache.

[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.120]
Pepperoni and ham.

[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:48.260]
And ham.

[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.720]
Just the extra porky.

[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:50.620]
Oh, boy.

[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.900]
Should've probably got some Italian sausage on there too.

[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:53.980]
Oh, there's sausage on there.

[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:54.580]
Is it really?

[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:55.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.900]
Instant heart attack pizza.

[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.440]
In other words, it's got all the meat,

[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.060]
got papi runny and sausage and extra grease.

[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.360]
I just hadn't laid it on top.

[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.200]
See, if Gary Sarner went in a building and I were there,

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.600]
I would call an order extra trache just to aggravate him.

[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.900]
Don't forget the bratwurst, Gary.

[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.340]
No cheese, that's a trache.

[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.900]
How could you make it more trache than it already is?

[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.560]
No, that's slice and force get on there.

[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.620]
722 votes.

[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.040]
I'm so impressed that I might just call up Joel Fiber

[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.360]
and say thanks for putting this over there.

[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.940]
Thanks for putting me in such a good mood.

[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.800]
That stuff I was hearing.

[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.080]
It's all over town, by the way, Joel.

[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.800]
A lot of your people, you got a lot of moles inside the building

[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.060]
better.

[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.980]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.060]
I don't want to get into those people in trouble

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.240]
because we like some of those people

[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.540]
and they're like, it's just Jo and Zach, it's about it.

[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.720]
Well, I had a lot of mold in that building

[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.220]
who were spilling the beans and talking all over town,

[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.840]
talking a lot of trash about you, Joel,

[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.300]
and about the kind of stuff that goes on in there.

[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.240]
So maybe they can't rip you on the air.

[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.580]
That's the edic that came down.

[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.180]
But off the air, they're ripping you

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.960]
a big gigantic fat indeservantly so.

[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.460]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.560]
This is 5.62 AF.

[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.080]
Oh, 8.5.60.

[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.660]
The key is a slam with a wrist in the fog

[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.080]
where you're going for the hell with your style.

[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.980]
Oh, the key is a slam with a wrist in the fog

[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.080]
where you're going to make your friends.

[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.220]
Oh, right, right, right, the whole world will die.

[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.440]
Oh, you'll be going for the snow that never goes down.

[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:50.420]
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right

[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:42.400]
right right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right step two is all right look at what it is in the

[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:42.960]
way for example, that this would going to crack in time, that really would go wrong, that really would suck in and really stretch it out well you know the other side edge member was dying in quote from this

[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.220]
forget about him. He's old old news. He just turned 97. He's running for

[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.380]
nothing. In fact, he had run in period with him bad knees.

[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:53.860]
Shameless draft request. The crow, you know, QM's phone number 567 OH 560.

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.960]
Wow. Remember that a box of rocks, but the he sure smelled good. Much too good.

[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:01.320]
The crow. Now, what did you tell me he was doing? He's like managing somewhere,

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.560]
Josh? Sort of call us that. In Japan. Oh, it sounds like Josh was eating some of

[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.880]
that Tony's pizza. Thanks Brad. Josh was thinking personal, but he's got him

[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.620]
awful. How do you like that? And it also says also bills by two touchdowns

[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.820]
this Sunday. Oh, yeah, Jay, you must say on the magic mushrooms or something.

[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:21.040]
You must be on the weed like that. The old broad said on the weed. I love that.

[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.120]
I'll never get tired of that. Yeah, what? But it's not said lady. Yes. Oh, yes, you can.

[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:30.340]
It's just these guys, Nick and Sucks and whatever the heck it is. And the people that call in,

[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:36.120]
they're just like them like that they were on the water court. The weed and they're high in that.

[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:42.300]
I mean, it's terrible. I want ball. What's that up? He is that up and look at listening to six

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:47.600]
ten and I miss him. And this year. Oh boy. What's that? I'm in a video. So I thought she's

[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.100]
probably dead. Tell me what that is. What is what's that called in the thingy?

[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.560]
The music. The sounds nippin suds. Yeah. As a nippin in the bun. You got it. Yeah, you got it.

[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.520]
I got it. Okay. For me.

[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.720]
Oh boy. At any rate, follow abortion. The senator is cool to court. So I stand brown back a real serious Nazi that made

[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.460]
Hermann giving look like a good human man. I made up for her. I'm on conservative. It was over the

[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:22.920]
candidacy of Harriet Myers that died for the Supreme Court. One of the most ardent abortion

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.740]
opponents in the Senate said yesterday that Miss Myers hadn't persuaded him to vote to

[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:31.920]
confirm her. Miss Myers. Don't you love that? Oh yeah. As opposed to kind of Lisa, she's Dr. Rice,

[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.660]
but this is Miss Myers, but she dikes. And of course, thank God we got Hillary running for

[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:41.180]
president, maybe in 2000, at least it'll be like a real lady. Well, the senator, Sam Brownback,

[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:46.380]
Republican, a Kansas FAR so far to the right that he's off the Richter scale. He makes wrestling ball

[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.600]
look like a full like Ted Kennedy. Totally. Porter's had an hour long meeting with him. Miss Myers

[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:55.360]
had steered clear of discussing Roe v Wade, the yadi yadi and had done a little assure him that

[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.520]
she'd be open to revisiting or overtrain that case. No promises were made either way. Brownback said

[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.840]
he said he would consider voting against the nomination, even a president bush made a personal

[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.120]
plea for his support. Asked if he was impressed with the what is this John Cynthia Lennon? Is this

[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.400]
something happening? A great deal to say. A great deal to say because I did write a book in 1978.

[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.500]
Well, that's Cynthia Lennon. We don't care about her. She's disgusting. Look at she's got stevy

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:24.960]
Tyler's mouth, too. Do you see that? Yes. No promises were made either way. Asked if he was

[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.540]
impressed with Miss Myers. Mr. Brownback paused and offered a very cautious reply to his very decent

[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.160]
lady. Hey, Sam, how you doing with the ladies? The senator said he had tried to initiate a

[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.520]
discussion of abortion law by raising the case of Griswall versus Connecticut, a 65 decision

[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.140]
that established a married couple's right to use contraception and later served as a basis for Roe.

[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.460]
Mr. Brownback said Miss Myers didn't use the term several law to describe Roe. A phrase that he

[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:51.080]
said would have been a red flag indicating she wouldn't overturn the decision, but neither would

[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.220]
she discuss it saying related cases could come before the court. She has stated that she doesn't

[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.400]
believe the circumstances of Griswall will come back in front of the court. Brownback said

[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.820]
recounting the conversation, but that the legal issue of Roe clearly and the legal issue involved

[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:07.520]
here is very much a live issue. A White House spokesman Dana Perino. I wonder she's

[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.020]
kind of Marty Perino, the old left-handed Syracuse borer. Dana Perino later said that Miss Myers had

[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:16.160]
simply acknowledged that abortion and role related issues are ones that are alive before the court.

[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.260]
While other Republicans have emerged from meetings with Miss Myers offering more

[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:25.120]
effusive praise over than before, Senator Brownback and his view was unchanged. He complained that he

[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.700]
was left trying to gather little pieces of shreds of evidence about reviews, not only on a

[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:32.740]
abortion, but on other matters of importance to social conservatives, including gay, married,

[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.540]
gay, and the role of religion in public life. The Kansas Senator is important for two reasons.

[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.660]
First, he's a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and would be a serious embarrassment

[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.980]
to President Bush if we're Republican and a panel hold against Miss Myers' second

[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:49.080]
Brownback, a possible presidential. Oh, he needs to be on there right now then.

[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:49.740]
All right.

[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.920]
Senator Brownback put him on there because he just zoomed at the top in my mind. Holy cow.

[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.120]
A possible presidential candidate in 2008 is considered a leading voice for conservatives in

[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.740]
the Senate for Nazis. Should he vote against Miss Myers? Other Republicans kind of playing

[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.340]
White House bids might feel compelled to follow. The spirit of Christ might compel them.

[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:12.740]
The spirit of San Brownback, you Nazi, you bastard. You ferry. Man. And if we're up to him,

[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.340]
we wouldn't be able to save Bastard on him. Probably not Nazi either.

[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.220]
Going back to that call, a couple calls back. I mean, once in a while over the years,

[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.840]
I said, you pot him out only because we had a bleep somebody and he just doesn't get it.

[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.980]
Fork to me. Oh, look at this. Is that Shmoody Guthao?

[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.800]
That's a good update on the situation.

[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:34.780]
Look at this. Get your ass in the beard on the big hat in New York. He's a hawk and a China

[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:39.540]
there with Mayor Bloomberg. They're talking in Yiddish. Oh, brother. That is really something.

[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.740]
That's scary. Hey, it's 2005. Okay. Somebody poked at Getski in the ribs.

[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.580]
No, no, no, no, no, because man probably a stink like crazy. Probably had that same suit.

[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:54.260]
Now, he probably sleeps with it. W.A.M. Hello. That's a rye when George talks about his

[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:59.320]
panic. Okay. Good. W.A.M. Hello. Hello. I am. Yeah, I just want to find out what is your

[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.280]
address. What is our address? Why are you also coming for tickets? Is that it? Yeah, I,

[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.740]
one one one one tickets two days ago. Well, how come they didn't give you the address?

[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.420]
They told me the address. I just didn't write it down. Well, okay. Well, you better get

[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.660]
with it. Two oh two nine five is on two hundred and second and Northwest at four forty one.

[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.520]
Two oh two nine five. Yeah, that's right on the corner next to Kentucky Fried and the white building

[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.540]
on the turd floor. Okay. Thank you. And when you go and when you get to take it,

[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:27.060]
it's no longer too long because if Carlos is after this, well, you all understand when you see it.

[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.620]
Run out. Okay. It's right in the game, Pally. There's a guy who'll take us for the past. He's

[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.440]
lightning game. No doubt. I know you man. They're not doing a very good job. Who's a board off

[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.640]
and that show is a Curtis? Who you ask? With a man. Yeah. Yeah, Curtis. Well, Curtis, I know

[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.140]
you're a star now and he's going to be doing the show for the mad dog today, but you better start

[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.560]
giving out the address a little bit more because on this high page show, we don't have time to be

[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.880]
sitting here giving everybody directions to come and pick up their stupid ass hockey tickets

[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.180]
that they want on the mad dog show as much as we love mad dog and Curtis. Never to less. Right? Right.

[01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:01.260]
Although I like that. I get depressed when they don't give the address. 751. We're going to be

[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:06.760]
right on the verge close to but not over 800 votes by noon. We got 1,000. They just look at

[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:12.360]
these split, man. Look at the old split. 756 as in Q 56, which is on the corner of North

[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.580]
West second Avenue in the two and 441 right across the street from tire kingdom. It's not tire

[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.480]
gays. It's if he looped it's a start. It's starting to be a tire kingdom in jiffy loop and right next to

[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:26.120]
Kentucky, Fry and not too far from Poio Tropical and just kitty corner block up the street from the

[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.420]
VP Amico station where they got the right huge north of all that market and right by that

[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:36.220]
plaza where they got a big wall green or George goes and buys drugs. I mean the paper towel

[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.520]
both. Nobody can soda. Nobody Q.A.M. Hello. It's a water Q.A.M.

[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:47.440]
And here. Yes sir. How you doing? I just thought that you know how it was really bad yesterday

[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.380]
because the toilet were not working. Did you hear anything about it? The what wasn't working?

[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:56.080]
The toilet? Yeah. The toilet was still not working for look. I'll be damned.

[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:01.940]
Well if anybody is full of it. There's no reason Turlitz working when he's on because he's

[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:06.220]
spewing it out. You can smell it. Don't be knocking mo now. Just see Hank always leads me down

[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.920]
and in fact this morning right out of the box. I wasn't even thinking anywhere in that direction.

[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.760]
Absolutely. And for right out of the get run from the get go hang starts on it. I was thinking

[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.640]
more like Joel Feinberg this morning. By the way, I'm going to send you the best facts I can recall.

[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.540]
I'm here forever. Oh, I'm excited. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Have you stuck in an area?

[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:27.480]
What about the facts? Yeah. It's grinded through as we speak.

[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.460]
756. You know something? I can't wait. Seriously. The food in Italy of course is the best.

[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.400]
But Germany I've put right up there too. I mean the food is really good there which may surprise

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.360]
you because you probably think oh, I got them sausages and vineyard stencil. They got really

[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.160]
very good food. It's a fine place. Not of course that I would want to like leave North America for

[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.120]
anything more than you know a few years. So this is really a great fact at my chase. I think so.

[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.120]
It's up to me. It's my opinion. What is it about? It's about everything. It's about that call.

[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:03.380]
It's about the life the universe. Life in general. All right. It's just to the point. It's great. I think

[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.160]
760 votes. Boy, we got six minutes to get right on the verge 800 there which would really be a

[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.880]
feather in our craft. Didn't we have 800 by noon yesterday? I think. Yeah, I think so. There are

[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.980]
votes. We were like right on the verge of it of a major achievement. We're going to be in the

[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:20.300]
Guinness Book of Records boys and girls. I'm just killing time waiting for this facts which is

[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:25.260]
cranking right now. They're cranking it. Oh, I got it. All right. Oh, I thought it was going to be

[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:28.380]
something wrong. This is one of our regular factors. Yes, it is. It's not as bad a choice.

[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.160]
And it says, how can I explain to my children that gas is five dollars a gallon or

[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.760]
presidents in the oil business? How can I explain to my children that despite what they're learning

[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.860]
in public school the world is not flat? How can I explain to my children that our God is better

[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:46.360]
than their God? How can I explain to my children that 2,000 Americans and 100,000 Iraqis

[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.340]
are dead and were based on lies? How can I explain to my children that the 911 high

[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.300]
jackers were Saudis, not Iraqis? How can I explain to my children that we have a $900

[01:29:54.300 --> 01:30:00.260]
trillion deficit? No, it's $3 trillion. How can I explain to my children that 50 million

[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:04.260]
Americans can't afford health insurance? How can I explain to my children here's the best of all

[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:09.480]
that Leny Martez is on the radio? That is outstanding. That really is a rock star that's pretty

[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:14.520]
and not the best but it's good. It's right up there in the running. Of course we're worried

[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.080]
about words and what am I going to tell my children when they see the... Let me ask you this,

[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.400]
you got all this graffiti. Remember I told you that day there was a big... Of course this is

[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.740]
a candidate where they're not so uptight about words and stuff like that. They don't give a crap

[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.280]
and a CBC runs... It's over the air, not cable. Everyone of those new documentaries,

[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:34.200]
they leave all the F words in here. Well, whatever. They showed fair and high 911 and

[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.120]
and insurance for column by look all the F's in it. No problem at all. Nobody's having a snid about it.

[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.080]
They're not but on the under the overpass they're in a way to the gardener expressway

[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.440]
the other day. They're it said something written in graffiti, the F word F you bush.

[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:51.860]
Okay. Now obviously anybody driving by there nobody's going to come along and scrub that out or

[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:56.240]
like who cares you know. Right. And kids are going to see it. Is it going to change their lives?

[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.720]
Is the award that they don't hear? Who cares? It'll unravel the fabric of society.

[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.380]
I'd be much more concerned about how your kids can understand that all these soldiers have

[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.460]
been sacrificed. These lives have been thrown away and we're killing all these innocent men and

[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.280]
women and children and their rackies little babies with Luna Bamba Grande and a lot more.

[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.700]
I'd be concerned about explaining that to them as opposed to oh gee what is that word that

[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:23.200]
begins with F me. This steady new rock. Grow up now. Grow up before it's too late. It could

[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:31.700]
be produced in place. This is Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8L. All right.

[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:52.640]
The word for names is all the time. The word for names is all the time. The word for names

[01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:01.280]
Unite

[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:42.200]

[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.880]
other people implementing hate because of your idiotic beliefs of crap.

[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:38.020]
Okay? So leave whatever you want to believe but have a little bit of tolerance. Is that possible?

[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:38.860]
No. Will it happen?

[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.080]
No.

[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.280]
It's for your own good, heathen.

[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.340]
The suit was filed in federal court by Mikey Weinstein,

[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.280]
and Academy graduate and outspoken critic of the school's handling of religion.

[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.080]
I wonder if Mikey is ready to brownie Brown?

[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.060]
Over the past decade or more, these suit claims Academy leaders have fostered an environment

[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:58.820]
of religious intolerance at the Colorado School in violation of the First Amendment,

[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.600]
which some of us are reluctant to remember. There's that guy Barbara Starf.

[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.180]
So that's it.

[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:04.140]
By the US intelligence community.

[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.240]
Yeah, that's a guy. It looks like hate.

[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:11.480]
You all hankin' apology. On his worst day, he'll never look like that.

[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:15.900]
Weinstein claims that evangelical Christians at the school at the Air Force Academy

[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:21.040]
have coerced attendance at religious services and prayers at official events among other things.

[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.540]
All of these things.

[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:26.760]
It's a shocking disgrace that I had to file this thing Weinstein told the Associated Press.

[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.500]
The AP declined to meet at comment, of course, their mom.

[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.220]
They're praying for the Lord to lead them out of this dark moment.

[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:37.380]
Could that's what's the group's and a former chaplain at the Academy of alleged that religious

[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.240]
intolerance is widespread at the school.

[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.880]
On August 29th, the Air Force issued guidelines discouraging public prayer to official functions,

[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:48.760]
and urging commanders to be sensitive about personal expressions of religious faith in

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.460]
Jesus' name.

[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.000]
There have been complaints at the Academy that a Jewish kid that was told to Holocaust

[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.940]
was revenge for the death of Jesus, and that another Jew was called a Christ killer by

[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.620]
a fellow cadet.

[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.400]
I thought we out threw that in like elementary school in kindergarten.

[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:01.080]
Massacre?

[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.640]
A banner in the football team's locker room read,

[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.340]
I am a Christian first and last, I am a member of Team Jesus Christ.

[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:11.520]
Also there have been complaints that cadets were pressured within chapel that Academy

[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.920]
staffers put new testament verses in government emails, and that cadets use the email system

[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.020]
to encourage others to see the Mel Gibson movie, The Passion of the Christ.

[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:22.920]
Weinstein who is Jewish, no kidding, and lives in Albert Herfie, said the Air Force has

[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.600]
violated cadets rights to worship as they choose.

[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:30.220]
My problem is that with Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, or even evangelical Christianity

[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:35.100]
said it said whenever religion, in this case a group of people tried to engage the machinery

[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.520]
of the state, it is constitutionally repugnant and violent of, and he is absolutely nice

[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.000]
to go on air.

[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.520]
Absolutely correct.

[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.080]
Jaime, or what's his name Mikey?

[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.400]
Mikey likes it.

[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:45.380]
Not really.

[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.960]
No, Mikey, you don't like it.

[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.660]
Look at that, they keep showing that hazmat thing and they go back to Basque Robbins

[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.280]
for another one.

[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.820]
He's given a banana split.

[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.440]
The lawsuit, which names the Air Force and its acting secretary Peter Garin as defendants,

[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:01.900]
asks the Air Force to prohibit its members, including chaplains, from evangelizing and

[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.480]
proselytizing, or in any way, a related way of attempting to involuntarily convert

[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.520]
pressure, exhort, or persuade a fellow member in the U.S. Air Force to accept their

[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.880]
own religious beliefs while on duty.

[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.840]
In June, an Air Force task force said if I would know over religious discrimination, but

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.420]
observed a lack of sensitivity among seven, confused over what is permissible in sharing

[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.880]
one's faith, I've got to answer one word to answer for that.

[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:23.380]
What's that?

[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.160]
Don't.

[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:24.460]
Okay.

[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:25.700]
Sharing one's faith.

[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.220]
Don't.

[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:26.660]
Don't share.

[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.480]
Maybe a nice pizza?

[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:29.960]
Share.

[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.340]
Maybe a holiday bonus?

[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:32.860]
Share.

[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.220]
What do you wait for somebody to ask you about your religion?

[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:36.420]
But sharing religious beliefs?

[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.600]
The answer is, no.

[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.720]
Don't even think about it.

[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:39.580]
Sharing one.

[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.020]
And it's called proselytizing.

[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.140]
Nothing to with sharing, believe it said, and making people laugh when they can't refuse.

[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:50.400]
I think it's not just a coincidence that that line was in the Godfather.

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:50.780]
Right?

[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.120]
I'm going to make them an offering, camera.

[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.780]
See, I was part of their Catholic bashing.

[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.740]
They did that movie, too.

[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.820]
Do you reject Satan above a man or holding with that silly-ass baptism, cranberry?

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.400]
Shmeer a little water on your head and all of a sudden you're going to be like, oh,

[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.740]
what's better than everybody else?

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:08.180]
In June, an Air Force task force said if I'd know over religious discrimination, but observed

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.620]
a lack of sensitivity among some, and confused over what is permissible in sharing one's

[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.380]
faith, after it's life, it's the academy.

[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:19.420]
A team from the Evidentities School, a report last month saying, it found lingering problems

[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:23.520]
among the Academy's Chapeans whose activities may conflict with the goals of school leaders

[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:26.760]
and the Air Force overall, or the Air Force's overalls.

[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.420]
How do you like that?

[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.480]
Those Chapeans want to get in their overalls, and it does surprise me.

[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.160]
Right, what a shot.

[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:32.160]
Not the least bit.

[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:33.640]
798 votes.

[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.840]
We need to get to that 800 mark then we'll be on our way.

[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.580]
It's kind of slowed down here on that thing.

[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.680]
Prometheus, that guy called about the t-shirt.

[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.420]
Well, speaking of that, you're not going to keep your little bashings religious stuff, are

[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:44.740]
you bet, you bet, are you?

[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:44.760]

[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.840]
Yeah, Alabama Church Youth swallows live goldfish.

[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.620]
There's two days in where we had a goldfish during this is a different one though.

[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]
That was another good one, about the pita people.

[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:53.200]
Remember that?

[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:53.980]
Oh, good God.

[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.520]
Oh, they were all booked up because some kids swallow the goldfish.

[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:58.860]
Well, same thing here.

[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.280]
Florence, Alabama.

[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.340]
By the way, actually, that's a place of real enlightenment and liberal thinking.

[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:04.820]
That's a real progressive place.

[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:05.780]
Florence, Alabama.

[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:06.640]
Not yet.

[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.700]
And have to go there to have a banjo on your knee.

[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.100]
You can have it anywhere on your body.

[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:10.880]
You can go pick it.

[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.120]
The first assembly of God Church has a fear factor ministry that had youth swallowing

[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.840]
live goldfish if they were up to it.

[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:22.520]
The youth ministry says it teaches children about fear, but a grandparent question and

[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.900]
a pet shop owner called an animal cruelty.

[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.260]
The pet shop boys are called animal cruelty.

[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.280]
Fear factor is a reality to you all.

[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:29.800]
We know that.

[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.220]
We need to be realistic about what the Bible says about fear and not be afraid to share

[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:33.920]
our faith in school.

[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.860]
Youth minister Anthony Martin told the Times Day in a story yesterday, we can't let

[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.120]
that fear rule our lives.

[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.460]
Whatever that means.

[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:44.700]
Martin said the ministry's participants are between the ages of 14 and 21 and then they

[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.500]
had to get their parents to sign a waiver to be involved and let their kids swallowing

[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:47.900]
goldfish.

[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.240]
And now, is this have something to do with the Jesus fish?

[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.700]
Is that what that's supposed to signify?

[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.620]
I wish I knew.

[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.240]
Hey, you better get with it, mister.

[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.040]
That's the church I used to go to to.

[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:57.680]
What?

[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:58.480]
Assembly God.

[01:41:58.880 --> 01:41:59.720]
Florence, Alabama, one.

[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.380]
Well, not that one.

[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:00.940]
Different one.

[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.740]
When you better get to Florence, Alabama, and get things right with the Lord before it's

[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:05.240]
too late, man.

[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.080]
When you get to this worldly place, it'll be too late.

[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:10.980]
Through this ministry, kids are surrendering their lives to Jesus and developing a deeper

[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:12.020]
relationship with Jesus.

[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.720]
He said the method of the ministry that we use to bring people is going to change, but

[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.040]
the message is going to stay consistent.

[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:21.160]
See, a lot of people think that the rest of the world, especially Europe, is just a

[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.680]
gas with the revulsion for what's happening in America.

[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.840]
And it isn't just the unabomba.

[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.140]
It's not just that part of it, all the violence, but it also has to do with this religious

[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:30.860]
fanaticism.

[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:34.020]
And yeah, I had some stories on that, but most people don't pick up on that.

[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:38.380]
That the civilized parts of the rest of the world, and there are some, I know it comes

[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:40.140]
into shock, the civilized parts.

[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.940]
They just are grossed out by this as opposed to the uncivilized places, and especially

[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.920]
a lot of the schmack-dotted places that we are in partners with, they think it's great.

[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:53.760]
Of course, we got the wrong God, never less than the wrong Bible, but at least it's

[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.060]
a start.

[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:58.220]
In teaching lesson about fear, participants in last week's round were asked to pull

[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.060]
a number between one and three from a bull that went indicate how many live comet

[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:03.220]
goldfish would be swallowed.

[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:07.060]
Martin said 12 of the almost 20 young people participated advances,

[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.400]
week to the this round of activities, which involved undoing chains and getting out of

[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.820]
a real coffin with the eight fastest advancing.

[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.420]
What does this have to do with church, by the way?

[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:17.160]
I don't know.

[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:21.000]
The final four will compete for 250 bucks by the ministry's final week.

[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.440]
Martin said he had been contacted by one participant's grandma, who was angry about

[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.260]
the activity, which he said was used for the first time last year.

[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.760]
We resolved the issue when I explained what happened that we were using it to draw kids

[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.040]
to Jesus to have a deeper relationship with them.

[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.840]
She seemed to simmer down, he said, simmer down, grandma.

[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.160]
Paula Keaton managed her pet deeper with solar fish that she considers the church's

[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.580]
actions as animal cruelty.

[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.120]
It is against our policy to sell to people that would like their wabbits, you know?

[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.500]
And we're fighting to wipe out and play that.

[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.220]
It's against our policy to sell to people if the animal would be killed, Keaton told

[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:51.820]
the times daily.

[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:52.780]
These aren't for keel.

[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.120]
To me, it's the same as taking a dog or cat and killing in front of a group of children.

[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.720]
Martin said about half the participants in the fear factor ministry are members of the

[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.300]
church, which has about 300 people of ten Sunday morning services.

[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.620]
Others are just guests.

[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:06.200]
People like seeing other people swam or goal fish.

[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:06.980]
Okay.

[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.740]
Martin maintained, you ever said around watching other people swam?

[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:13.840]
Martin maintains that the children are not forced to participate and there is no peer

[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.860]
pressure involved, but there is no alternative to the activity and not participating means

[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.840]
forfeiting the right to advance in the game.

[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.880]
Toddie Lytton became a goal fish, baby.

[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:29.700]
So you rather be goldstein or goldfish, called Berk or Goldbury or gold sea.

[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:34.200]
Goldstein or Weinstein or how about Joel Feinberg?

[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:38.720]
There's a fine name for you as in or where Feinberg?

[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:40.980]
814 votes on a pool.

[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.520]
I just find that so childish and juvenile, yeah.

[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.880]
Maybe that's a characteristic of radio management and software and a lot of overgrown

[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.320]
children running around, running places.

[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:52.200]
People get all bent out of shape and putting their hands through the wall and throwing furniture

[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:52.560]
around.

[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.560]
All of these silly ass stupid ass.

[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.480]
All of these things.

[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.360]
814 votes.

[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:57.880]
We'll get that.

[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.940]
We don't even have to push on it, do we?

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:00.480]
No pushin.

[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:00.940]
Right?

[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.140]
Oh come on push a little.

[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.840]
I think we're in easy today.

[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.960]
You're going to let us off the hook for all time to say.

[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.900]
Speaking of fish and a bogota.

[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.220]
Now do we ever put that on our yesterday?

[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:09.840]
I guess we didn't.

[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.740]
Let's do that pole again.

[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:11.680]
We got to put fishing out.

[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:12.100]
We do it.

[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:13.380]
And what was the other guy's F-Troup?

[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]
And F-Troup?

[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.140]
Now F-Troup, right now this guy's got some nearby.

[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:24.240]
A day we got the story there about the teacher yesterday and that other thing with Wal-Mart

[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.460]
and this guy's calling him with F-Troup.

[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.360]
You pottymouth.

[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.100]
Wash your mouth out with lice all.

[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.600]
See their body wash, yeah you call people pottymouths?

[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.200]
12, yeah that's why I said it.

[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.920]

[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.000]
Ed Kaplan gambling show.

[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:44.600]
If you're in the market for a new car, don't put it off another minute.

[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.960]

[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:18.780]

This is Neil Rogers.

[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.600]
This is 5.69 AF.

[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.080]
You're best, dude.

[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.060]
The federal government is just blowing the breath of those people today.

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.420]
Underwood are encadases of remote parties.

[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.260]
Brown offered no apologies.

[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:58.560]
And mostly blame others for the debacle that crossed hundreds of lines.

[01:46:58.920 --> 01:46:59.480]
Mike Brown.

[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.800]
There's no one left to blame.

[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.200]
I said Brownie.

[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.500]
You're the government shame.

[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.040]
I said Brownie.

[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.380]
Your careers have been blamed.

[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.520]
There's no one.

[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.580]
I know who's more than you.

[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:13.720]
You're the only one who's been blamed.

[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:14.660]
George Bush.

[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:18.320]
You better make him shut up before he says.

[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.320]
If what you will messed up, you can defend him.

[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.160]
But I'm sure you will find many.

[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.020]
Think that he should do time.

[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.360]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:33.720]
He's waiting for you to come to run the air.

[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:37.280]
Fee and make some people die when he ran air.

[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.040]
Fee and make a new name.

[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:43.580]
Everyone knows that your leadership votes.

[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.340]
You can go back to your part shows.

[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:51.780]
Today, both Republicans and Democrats criticized the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll.

[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:58.180]
That may be because as long as he remains an administration official, his testimony must be cleared by the White House.

[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.240]
Oh my God.

[01:47:59.500 --> 01:47:59.860]
Exactly.

[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.600]
I only 147 grand.

[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:02.500]
You're already worried about it.

[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.000]
Small potatoes.

[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:03.540]
Right.

[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.900]
Oh, Mayor Bloomberg is discussing that soda can.

[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.080]
The presence of the rep of that thread is.

[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:08.520]
Right.

[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:11.320]
False alarm at Penn Station amid security alert.

[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.280]
This is so sad.

[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.720]
Safety, safety, safety.

[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.660]
Keep him scared.

[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:23.200]
Police shut down parts of nearest busy Penn Station this morning after an unknown substance was found in a soda can.

[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.900]
Their anthrax ticket counter.

[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.640]
Unknown substance in a soda can.

[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.540]
That would just send me shrieking.

[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:30.140]
Yeah.

[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.300]
The incident came with the after authorities waterway specific terror threat against the city subway system.

[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:44.500]
A police source told GcNN's Genie Reserve that initial test on the green bubbly substance found in the can indicate is a green dye mixed with sodium hydroxide.

[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.880]
Also known as caustic soda or a lie and we're not lying.

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.100]
It appears to be a hoax, the source said.

[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.580]
Sodium hydroxide is used in many cleaners.

[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.820]
It can be poisonous if ingested.

[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.140]
It can cause severe burns if it gets on somebody's skin or in their eyes.

[01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:57.680]
It burns.

[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.680]
None of the station was evacuated.

[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:02.080]
Police requested the closure so they could cure out an investigation.

[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.420]
Amperex is sitting in superintendent Mike Gallagher.

[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:14.240]
Be saying there was no danger at any time anyone said no no kidding police closed the main entrance at 9 30 this morning about only security personnel to enter a corner witnesses and an anthrax spoke to woman.

[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.800]
Authorities also cleared half of anthrax main platform area inside the station and prevented passengers from entering the area spoke to them and.

[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:25.920]
Mary, Marcie Galgoski said whoever the hell Mary Marcie is also about an hour later.

[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.900]
Most of the platform was reopened and passengers were allowed in except for a 30 by 30 foot.

[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.080]
3rd man.

[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.180]
Area cordoned off by police through the anthrax ticket counter.

[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.000]
All anthrax trains are reparing normally and yada yada yada.

[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:37.880]
There you go.

[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.700]
Very suspicious bubbly green substance in a soda can found near the ticket counter.

[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.020]
And the rest of the world is thinking themselves only one thing.

[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.000]
Oh my god.

[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.460]
Wow 841 votes on the poll.

[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:01.720]
We are so pleased and so impressed man this audiences come to last I don't know big big time but we don't want to overdo it.

[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.920]
That's why I'm going on vacation next week because we don't want to overdo all this progress.

[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:05.620]
Good job really.

[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:05.920]
Yes.

[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.080]
Throw a big number in there.

[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.560]
One of these trans really piss them off.

[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:08.980]
Go back.

[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:09.680]
How's that?

[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:10.420]
Oh, here coming.

[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:11.860]
Somebody Q.A.M.

[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:12.100]
Hello.

[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.300]
Q.A.M.

[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.260]
Not there.

[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.520]
That's like I said it.

[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.500]
Line one needs some fixing Q.A.M.

[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:17.720]

[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.240]
Hello, Neil.

[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:19.620]
Yeah.

[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.080]
Okay.

[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.700]
I always start for that same.

[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.020]
Yeah.

[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.000]
And it's not never running more than a half a second.

[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:25.420]
Yeah.

[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.900]
But it's sure good that it keeps them off the street.

[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:27.420]
You know what?

[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:30.780]
Oh, five six seven O five 60 come on.

[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.180]
Let's get these phones blazing again.

[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.880]
We want to hear from all our good friends today.

[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.400]
And of course if we ever found any.

[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:41.340]
I'm surprised that the guys called before didn't listen to much greater response from this very apathetic crowd.

[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.360]
You know what I call it?

[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:42.920]
What facts?

[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:43.820]
That was it.

[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.440]
What about what do I tell my kid about seeing that?

[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:51.140]
You know, you are so out of touch with what kids are talking and saying.

[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:51.420]

[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.140]
And then this whole obsession with words.

[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.140]
Oh, it's dirty words.

[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:54.700]
Wow.

[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:56.160]
What do you tell them when they use?

[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:00.100]
I live in a country where everybody swore a lot and didn't have any guns.

[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.920]
And weren't killing everybody else.

[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:06.600]
To me, that's a much more pleasant kind of a place as opposed to people where everybody speaks very properly.

[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.820]
And then about a big, you know, crap away.

[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.380]
I mean, to blow your stuff away.

[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.800]
That way you can be politely killed.

[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:12.300]
Right.

[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:13.060]
Lightly killed.

[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.500]
Dominic QA and hello.

[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.440]
Hey, they are.

[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:15.960]
How are you doing?

[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:16.740]
Pretty good, Pali.

[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.160]
More scary news.

[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.700]
Apparently if Rick Sanatorium loses in Pennsylvania.

[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:22.940]
San Torum, yes.

[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:23.780]
Yes, well.

[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.380]
Sanatorium and worry, violence.

[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.240]
I heard.

[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.820]
And I've read I've looked up.

[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.680]
Maybe a possible presidential candidate would.

[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.380]
And my name is already made with respect.

[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:34.420]
That's another good one to put on full Rick San Torum.

[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.900]
S-A-N-T-O-R-U-M-U-M.

[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:37.420]
You can't tell.

[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:39.680]
Spelt that word scumb without you.

[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:39.900]
M.

[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:41.540]
Take care of Neil.

[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:42.140]
Thanks, Pali.

[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:42.940]
Rick Sanatorium.

[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:43.720]
We got him on here yet.

[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:44.060]

[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:44.360]
Yes.

[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.660]
Penn Station reopens after an apparent hopes involving a soda can with a bubbly, slimy, green,

[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.960]
substance in it.

[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.300]
And Mayor Bloomberg, who is one of the most pedantic idiotic idiots I've ever seen in my life.

[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:56.520]
All right.

[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:57.400]
Ramping up.

[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.380]
Ramping up.

[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:00.040]
He and Aaron Brown are a little opinion.

[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:00.660]
They make a good period.

[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.720]
The whiny brothers.

[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.400]
Comedy QA and hello.

[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:04.140]
Yes.

[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.320]
I'd like to speak to Neil, please.

[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:05.800]
Speaking.

[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:06.880]
Oh, no.

[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:07.340]
How you doing?

[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:07.940]
Pretty good.

[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:13.320]
Well, I'm going to call this going to disagree with you a little bit on the speech situation.

[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:13.700]
Yeah.

[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:19.960]
I can understand where you're coming from, but there's certain things that even those words do not hurt people.

[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:20.480]
Yeah.

[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:22.920]
But they can't provoke people to violence.

[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:23.360]
Right.

[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:24.020]
Like Jesus.

[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:25.120]
No, anything.

[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.260]
I mean, um, what is it?

[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.280]
It's any kind of hateful speech.

[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:36.340]
I mean, the comments that Bill Bennett made were his choices and his right, but they were hurtful things.

[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:36.880]
Yeah.

[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:38.740]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:43.340]
On these talks, you're, in fact, you hear on the promos, Hank and me calling a call on an idiot.

[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:44.220]
That could be hurtful.

[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:46.000]
Does that mean we're not supposed to be able to say that?

[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:46.680]
Hurtful speech?

[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:47.940]
Oh, you heard my feelings.

[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.580]
You called me a moron in India.

[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.440]
There's a slime ball.

[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.280]
That's just silly what you're saying.

[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.880]
And let me ask you this.

[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.580]
Who defines what hurtful speech is?

[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.060]
Who got the book on that?

[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:58.760]
Exactly.

[01:52:59.020 --> 01:52:59.760]
That's the whole point.

[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:05.500]
I mean, if you made comments about, like Eminem who talks about gays and lesbians or black folks.

[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.320]
Or if someone had a t-shirt on that, you know, it was right that...

[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.640]
Well, the Eminem says all those things.

[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:11.620]
He's got a right to say that.

[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.800]
I just don't have to buy his records.

[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.020]
That's all or listen to his music.

[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.060]
That's the way it works.

[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:15.620]
Hey, that's...

[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.700]
You have a right and that's the whole idea of choice.

[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:23.220]
I mean, it's easier to tear down a building, but how do we construct one that will make it better?

[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:24.080]
No, I know.

[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.420]
And by saying, here you've made...

[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.900]
But what you're saying, you're talking in double talk.

[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.720]
You're going around the circle.

[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:28.440]
What does that mean?

[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.780]
What I mean is that it takes no time to build something, or to tear something down.

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:38.160]
But they try to resurrect or come over with a solution that's to make a solution to what?

[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.140]
A solution to what?

[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:39.140]

[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:45.020]
The problem, I mean, why would anybody even have those ideas of wanting to murder or to kill anybody?

[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:46.180]
I mean, that...

[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.060]
Because they're sick, because they have no respect for human life.

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:53.520]
Or like, in Bill Bennett's case, he's a bigoted right-wing piece of crap, hypocrite.

[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.100]
Right, but let me answer something.

[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.780]
If someone calls you and threaten your life every day, and even though they're not physically doing any harm to you,

[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.200]
then the government shouldn't protect that.

[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:05.520]
The speech isn't protected by the law, of course not.

[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:06.540]
That's cool.

[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:07.720]
Hold different ball game.

[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.160]
What is a teacher that has the effort on to get to do with threatening your life?

[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.140]
But I'm the same.

[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.780]
If you protect one person because of their freedom of speech, then you have to protect everybody.

[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:16.760]
No, no.

[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:17.680]
Even that's what I'm saying.

[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:18.520]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.020]
If you never do anything, then you're just an idiot.

[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.800]
Okay, oh, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:24.840]
Just an absolute...

[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.240]
Just want to hear the sound of your own voice, around the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.620]
Certain forms of speech are prohibited.

[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:30.140]
Right.

[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.980]
Causing panic, yelling, firing a crowded theater, threatening somebody's life.

[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:35.680]
That's not protected.

[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.580]
Play a little bit.

[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.460]
Right, right, right.

[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.980]
There are laws to cover those things, okay?

[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.620]
But this business of the words...

[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:42.800]
Right.

[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.560]
...protecting words...

[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.140]
Vocabulary.

[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.400]
Those words aren't a threat to anybody.

[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.540]
In fact, like you said, the Jesus crafts a lot more threatening to a lot of us than all this other stuff like the F word.

[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.060]
Right.

[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:57.560]
How about if I have a teacher that says screw America or screw Ollie or screw the Muslims?

[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.400]
Or whatever it says.

[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.040]
Sure that might get some people pissed off.

[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:00.580]
You know what?

[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.340]
I have a right to give people pissed off.

[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:03.380]
And so does everybody else.

[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:07.400]
And if you live in a civilized society just because you're pissed off, you're like, oh, by the big.

[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:09.600]
Well, that's not the problem with the words.

[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.000]
That's the problem with the society.

[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:15.800]
And of course, a lot of you people like this last guy, I guess, have been conditioned living in a state like Florida,

[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:19.700]
where, hey, if you have a fear for your life or somebody who's dangerous or threatening you...

[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.200]
Well, hey, that's the kind of place you want to live in.

[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:24.340]
Tissalud, you know, like they said in the Godfather.

[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:25.580]
That's what Salutso said.

[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.160]
Tissalud.

[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.420]
And then look what happened to him.

[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.360]
857, though.

[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.860]
Actually, what he said, yeah, that's right.

[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.640]
He said if a million dollars cash is, you know, no problem.

[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.220]
I'm just saying...

[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:35.860]
I did say...

[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:36.040]
Right.

[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.760]
But I must reject your offer because it's a dirty business.

[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:40.820]
And I will give you my reasons.

[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:41.360]
Right.

[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.000]
See, I'm doing this pretty good today.

[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.080]
I don't know what it's all about.

[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:45.700]
Maybe I haven't been paid a little...

[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.280]
A little horse.

[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.380]
I'm maybe just a little horse and...

[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:50.620]
Stick my horse and say, the last guy says, I'm a little...

[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:50.760]
Yeah.

[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:51.280]
Well, I'm a little last.

[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:52.840]
Yeah, that's not what I heard.

[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.280]
Most said, you're a big one.

[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.280]
He didn't say answer to that.

[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.140]
I'm not going to be elevated down.

[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.980]
And on my way to the car when I pulled my golden basket out,

[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:29.700]
I gave a three-kondo table.

[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.760]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.520]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.740]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:39.420]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.020]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:41.480]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:41.700]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.780]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:47.920]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.640]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.420]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:54.380]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:54.820]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:58.540]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.960]
The door is a back-and-towel.

[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.380]
Why you look at me?

[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:05.960]
I'm a God-a-long-you sport-a-old boot.

[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.640]
I know everything that's going on in tattoos.

[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.860]
Why I even know all the new Maja rules.

[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.280]
I'm hip to the jug.

[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.720]
Daddy, I'm hip to the jug.

[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:14.920]
Daddy, I'm hip to the jug.

[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.500]
You better go and stop tonight.

[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.580]
You better show when I take your place.

[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.300]
I know I ain't no way to play with you.

[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.840]
Daddy, I want my drop-high boy, Blue Skye.

[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.820]
You're a little smoothing.

[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:28.980]
I'm a good boy.

[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:30.440]
I'm a good boy.

[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:32.040]
I don't like that.

[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:33.660]
I want my legs.

[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:34.760]
I'm a good boy.

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.220]
I want my legs.

[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:41.040]
I want my legs.

[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:42.880]
It's a class.

[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.520]
Maybe it's the number one with three bullets.

[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.500]
It's superior than life itself.

[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:50.780]
Let's see, here's a fact since his hand was right.

[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.280]
Wow, how do you like this?

[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:52.400]
Yes.

[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:55.540]
I'm getting the rest of it out the facts machine.

[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.800]
How long is this stamp thing?

[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.060]
How many pages are there?

[01:57:59.340 --> 01:57:59.860]
Just the two.

[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:01.220]
Solomentade Dose?

[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:01.680]
The.

[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.460]
Somebody's got a dose.

[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.420]
Hank was right.

[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.260]
Joel Feinberg's dead.

[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:08.380]
Mike Feinberg is one of the richest one of the wealthiest men in South Florida.

[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.560]
Of course, Joel works for daddy's company.

[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.440]
He grew up with Weiner, Saladkin, Eisenberg.

[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:14.640]
Oh no.

[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.520]
So none of those fraternities of wannabes.

[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.400]
Oh, I can just see them right now sitting around and plotting this whole thing.

[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:24.540]
Oh, we're going to take daddy's money and we're going to put that QA in my bag.

[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.580]
I like that.

[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:26.920]
We'll do anything to hurt them.

[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:31.140]
All working at that station says none of them played sports past little league.

[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:35.460]
They're all fancied themselves as experts so their body, daddy's bought them a toy to play with.

[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.480]
How do you like that?

[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:41.260]
That's how a put's like Stugas gets to be general manager of a McBlaire radio station.

[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.720]
And Joel gets his picture taken with Nick Sabin.

[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:45.380]
Oh, so none of the resist guys.

[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:47.380]
There's another punk with a rich daddy.

[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:49.380]
Holy moly.

[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:50.300]
Are you kidding me?

[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.620]
Joel Feinberg, my ass.

[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.020]
How do you do that?

[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.240]
No wonder they got.

[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:56.220]
Oh, numbers.

[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.320]
Although he does have 10 votes.

[01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.580]
He's right above Joe Biden.

[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:03.140]
People are scared and I guarantee you all 10 of them are from inside the building over there.

[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:07.020]
So it's interesting that he grew up with these guys but not they're all busy badmouthing them all over town.

[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.820]
Well, I guess Daniel Vassier was not at list or Joe.

[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:11.620]
Joe Rose hates you by the way, Joe.

[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.360]
And he wishes you would die a wicked death.

[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:14.560]
He despises you.

[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:16.560]
He thinks you're a quizzling and a simple den.

[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:18.040]
Anyway, moving along.

[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.420]
Now that's pretty interesting stuff.

[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:20.580]
He grew up with those.

[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.560]
This is it.

[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.460]
You know what it reminds me of?

[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.760]
It's like Clarence and his buddies in our station.

[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:29.780]
You know, Robert Grieber and the Beast and all Clarence's little boyfriends of the UM connection.

[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:31.460]
You know, all these little quizzlings.

[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.040]
That's what our station's all about.

[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:38.660]
So it's Clarence's little boyfriend fraternity against Stugas's fraternity.

[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:43.440]
And isn't ironic that once upon a time Stugas was on Clarence's under his wing.

[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:49.080]
And Clarence was booking guests for him on the, when he was working on 940 on a failed Fox Sports event here.

[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:53.240]
When he was on there, Clarence was booking guests for his show surreptitiously under the table.

[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.720]
And now we rewarded Clarence for that disloyal about making him the program director.

[01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:57.600]
How do you like that?

[01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:59.340]
Clarence, you sell out.

[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.600]
You, you ferry.

[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:05.080]
A Palestinian leader quoted George W. Bush and saying God told him to invade Iraq.

[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.360]
But said he didn't take US president's comment literally and saw it only as a reflective his faith and commitment.

[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:11.560]
Have another drink W.

[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:14.680]
The White House dismissed as absurd.

[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:19.380]
The remarks attributed to Bush by Deputy Prime Minister Nabi al-Sharath and the BBC documentary series.

[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:24.660]
Recounted a June 2003 meeting, we attended along with Mahmoud Abbas, now the Palestinian president.

[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:25.520]
Mahmoud.

[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:32.180]
Shah said he stood by his recollection of Bush saying he had been driven with a mission from God when he sent US troops into Iraq and Afghanistan.

[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:35.500]
And also lent his support to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state.

[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.840]
But Shah told writers today we never thought he had literally had God speaking to him.

[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.320]
In advance excerpts from the TV series, an elusive piece Israel and the Arabs to be broadcast this month.

[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:49.260]
Shah says President Bush said to all of us, I'm driven with a mission from God.

[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:53.040]
God would tell me George go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan and I did.

[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.200]
And then God would tell me George go and end the tyranny in Iraq and I did.

[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.520]
And now again I feel God's words coming to me.

[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:02.900]
Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security and get peace in the Middle East.

[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.000]
And by God I'm going to do it.

[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:08.900]
Child quotes him to say in response, why how spokesman Scott McClelland the ultimate liar told reporters in Washington.

[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.200]
He's never made such comments. He didn't say another word.

[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.080]
He didn't do nothing.

[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:13.220]
How do you like that?

[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.400]
I know, no God father.

[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.500]
But there's John McCain and allowable and effective.

[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:20.840]
Have you noticed how the other chief has all puffed up now too?

[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.420]
I guess it's matching matching.

[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.420]
He's a bell.

[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.960]
Kind of like a nice even back home.

[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.980]
Yeah, matching to Baron down 891 votes.

[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:32.920]
When we come back after the next very, very short break because they're all sure today because I failed to promise.

[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.260]
Good sluff and they took some time off for the dualities.

[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.400]
I guess do we have any Jewish sales people?

[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.260]
No, no kidding.

[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.520]
You're good friend Adam Todd.

[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.420]
Oh, that's right. I forgot about time.

[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:43.920]
Gary Sarner.

[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.000]
Adam is Jewish.

[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.520]
Gary Sarner doesn't sell this show for it.

[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:47.860]
I don't know.

[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:49.320]
And he's got nothing to do with us.

[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.020]
He sells national spots that wind up on.

[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.680]
He does not sell this show.

[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:54.160]
He's too busy in coastering the house.

[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:54.680]
Okay.

[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.220]
Coastering is back home.

[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:56.580]

[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:00.360]
Let's see if we don't have anywhere near the all our best salesperson ever.

[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:03.160]
I'm sure was a John Wieness.

[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:03.700]
Right.

[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:04.600]
Not a Jew.

[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:05.200]
Huh?

[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:05.900]
Not a Jew.

[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.000]
No, not a Jew, see.

[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.320]
They're going to know how to sell this show.

[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.240]
The Jews on the other hand.

[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.120]
Well, we have PD Lenny.

[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:11.320]
He sold a little bit, right?

[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.200]
Well, what is it?

[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.760]
What does that have to do with anything?

[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:14.640]
Where did that come from?

[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.880]
About the Jewish salespeople.

[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.060]
They took off for the whole thing.

[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:18.660]
I don't have a Kenny Tobin, right?

[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:21.520]
I'm just tall because I want to see none of her votes on that pool.

[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:23.800]
I'm going to figure out like proud as the NBC peacock.

[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:24.660]
898.

[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:25.680]
That's pretty great.

[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:28.520]
And if I like to refresh it again, what do you think?

[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:29.960]
What are the odds?

[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:31.200]
Call up 8K right now.

[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.180]
Get the morning line on it.

[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.520]
Like probably three to five.

[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:34.860]
I'll get the overs and unders.

[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.880]
And we're still alive in the pick 85.

[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:37.620]
Let's see.

[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:39.580]
899.

[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.700]
Now they're pouring in by the ones.

[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:42.600]
899.

[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.420]
I'm going to refresh it one more time.

[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.180]
One more time.

[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.160]
What do you got?

[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:47.220]
What's two guys?

[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:47.760]
899.

[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:48.480]
899.

[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:50.620]
We'll refresh it again and again.

[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.560]
And this can take us up to 899.

[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:53.600]
One more time.

[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.080]
899.

[02:02:57.700 --> 02:02:59.280]
Sounds like a sale of ten, isn't it?

[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.540]
It does, and it's stuck there.

[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:01.940]
Oh, 902.

[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.800]
Man, it's a little bit of a second.

[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:05.800]
I think it was a fine amount of money.

[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:10.600]
20 to 1 at 560 WQ AEM.

[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:14.080]
My friends and gentlemen, for this have an unbelievable offer for you right now.

[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:15.020]
Unbelievable.

[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:15.720]
That's right.

[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.620]
When you call 1-800-Metrics, you can get yourself a free tank of gas.

[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:23.120]
Take the full amount of any gas received off your next mattress, up to 10% of the whole purchase.

[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:27.780]
In other words, if you spend 50 bucks at the pump, take 50 bucks off any purchase of 500 bucks or more.

[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.700]
And you'll save more gas by skipping those phony sales this Columbus Day weekend.

[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.840]
So if the department stores are so-called mattress stores double the price, then say, hey, guess what?

[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:37.000]
We're giving you 50% off.

[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:38.140]
What kind of a deal is that?

[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:39.840]
You've got to be a moron to fall for that scam.

[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.580]
So instead, call 1-800-Metrics and choose the complete line of Celi.

[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:47.320]
And CERDA, Simmons, King Coral, Teperpedic, and Stearns and Foster Hewitt.

[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:51.800]
When you call 1-800-Metrics, you choose the Dayton Tatter delivery with an A2R window, seven days a week,

[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:55.780]
from 8 in the morning till 10 at night, even on Columbus Day, even on Symmahastura.

[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:59.280]
So it's always time to money driving all around town shopping for a mattress.

[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.400]
Do it the smart way, the easy way, like I've been doing for a long time,

[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.760]
and like all these smart folks at QM are doing, and some who aren't too bright either.

[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:08.780]
Call 1-800-Metrics or log on to their website mattress.com.

[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:11.880]
And to portion of every purchase goes to Hurricane Katrina Relief 2.

[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:15.120]
Call dial to mattress 1-800-MATTR-ES.

[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:19.160]
Leave off the last S because it stands for STOOP-PENDISSAVING.

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.700]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:26.120]
This is 5.62-A-S.

[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:29.300]
Are you bastard?

[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:35.960]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi and they go to the back house.

[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.420]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi, but it's not there anymore.

[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:43.260]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi and they go to the back house.

[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:47.800]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi and we pray to be when they go to the out and say,

[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:55.340]
I don't like it with the lives, I said, Mommy, I feel a lot less like it was with the mommy.

[02:04:56.140 --> 02:05:01.700]
Yeah, I haven't felt this sad mommy since they just couldn't give you cab.

[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:06.680]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi and they cook it all over.

[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:11.020]
They put the live in the Pepsi, but it doesn't taste the same.

[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:14.980]
I use to bring them in Pepsi with my team, these three my life.

[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:18.980]
And then I would hover in my hero and twinkle, drawing an eye for a dream.

[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:20.660]
Mommy!

[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:31.180]
I have to go to the next.

[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:35.480]
Maybe Dr. Beffer would be better.

[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:41.280]
Mommy, Dr. Beffer, that'd be a beffer to Dr.

[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.360]
Beffer, business is from the Pepsi, Mommy.

[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:47.520]
Dr. Beffer, I cannot buy two cookies for it.

[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.320]
Sometimes I wish I was great.

[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:54.240]
They put the 11 in the Pepsi and they cook it all the way.

[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.360]
Maybe that's what that was, lemon Pepsi there to subway.

[02:05:58.940 --> 02:05:59.300]
That could be.

[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:00.500]
Although it was green, I'd say.

[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.420]
Well, maybe somebody, like that new line Pepsi there.

[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:06.400]
1246, maybe they squeezed a little lime in their lemon Pepsi.

[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:10.220]
Anyway, this fact is most amusing to me because he totally misses the point, obviously.

[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:14.220]
It says, hey, Neil, two things, FCUK is British-based shampoo and creams company.

[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.460]
And it stands for French-connection UK.

[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.520]
And secondly, nearly you're doing a heck of a job.

[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:19.940]
Why ain't no brown or are I owned?

[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.700]
But at any rate, that's not the point.

[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.640]
The point is that nobody wears those caps and t-shirts because of the company,

[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:30.100]
which they got 80's in the websites where they can buy older, stupid-ass products.

[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.220]
That's not the point.

[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.580]
They wear it because it looks like the F-word.

[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.960]
That's exactly correct.

[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.160]
Is there any doubt about it?

[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:36.780]
No.

[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:37.320]
No.

[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:40.060]
I don't see too many people running around with, like, uh,

[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:44.880]
L'Oreal, or, well, what are some of the other, like, uh, shampoos and, uh,

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.940]
I don't see anybody with a t-shirt or a cap on with those, do you?

[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:48.560]
Head and shoulders.

[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:49.480]
Head and shoulders.

[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:49.680]
Head and shoulders.

[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.580]
I see, oh, guys, all the time running around with the head and shoulders t-shirts.

[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:53.100]
Tegrin.

[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:54.800]
Tegrin, man, oh, man.

[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.720]
I see people like, guys that have tegrin underwear.

[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.660]
Keeps the bandroof off of their factory.

[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:00.100]

[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:01.200]
Selsin blue.

[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:01.680]
There you go.

[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:02.340]
There's a blue.

[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:04.200]
Yeah, but blue might be a little controversial.

[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:04.900]
That's right.

[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:08.680]
Yeah, we've had, uh, such convoluted, like I said, we don't want to hear about, uh,

[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:12.300]
any of that because it's just your, your opinions are ass and I, some of you.

[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.680]
You know, what are we going to do about all of these words and the kids' expression?

[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.220]
What do I tell my son?

[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:18.640]
Tell him to F off, okay?

[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:22.500]
Tell him to get those F and grades up or you're going to kick his ass and get with it.

[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:23.060]
Grow up.

[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:24.500]
933 votes.

[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:26.040]
It's not even close to 1 o'clock yet.

[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:27.120]
This is a shocking.

[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:31.780]
It's almost a shocking is that soda can that practically shut down the whole damn New York, uh,

[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:33.100]
Amtrak, their pen station.

[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.300]
Amit, this is not good news.

[02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:36.360]
I, I warned you.

[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.280]
Don't say I didn't warn you and then you're going to say, oh, well, you put that banner thing up there on your website.

[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:42.080]
I mean, I hope we took it down by that.

[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:44.400]
We did good for the American Red Cross.

[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:44.860]
We did.

[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:46.980]
I warned them at the moment I put that on there.

[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.400]
I said, I do this only because we like to give you an outlet to help.

[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.320]
And there are a lot of people who are desperate.

[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:55.960]
Not the woman at one point, the one point, six million, though, with $4.25 and quarters.

[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.380]
Oh, that's just.

[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:01.980]
You can't even believe how that crossed my big fat old ass.

[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:08.120]
Hey, it's worse when some rich boover when, uh, when this, no, no, I don't be right here, but I'm just saying 17 quarters.

[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:13.840]
I can put 1700 bills in and they're not get, uh, you know, focused while they call it luck.

[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:15.920]
I'm in the destruction and I don't have any.

[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.580]
I'm in the destruction and dislocation caused by Hurricane Katrina.

[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.620]
The American Red Cross is undertaken a really peppered unlike Indian history.

[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:27.080]
So far, the cheerleader spent $811 million on emergency cash aid and 110 million on food and shoulder.

[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:35.080]
Despite the ambition of the cheerleader's efforts and the money spent, evacuees complain that Red Cross aid has been slow and unreliable, unreliable.

[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:39.540]
Other cheerleader groups and relief workers contend that the agency is in over its aid.

[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.360]
Guy Richardson, I wonder if he's getting to Bobby Richardson.

[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:43.600]
He was a good old boy from Oklahoma.

[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:50.440]
Guy Richardson, a New Orleans waiter who made it to Atlanta with his family, said he encountered chaos and trying to get cash assistance from the Red Cross.

[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:53.180]
He waited in line for eight hours at a center without success.

[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:55.180]
The cheerleader pulled out of the center.

[02:08:55.180 --> 02:09:03.140]
Others like Liz Cadlock have grumbled about their inability to get through on an 800-fold line setup type of evacuees registered for emergency cash assistance.

[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:06.000]
The bell chassee, how do you say that?

[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:10.160]
C-H-A-S-S-E? See, that's part of that Louisiana French key drawn thing.

[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:14.400]
The bell has something other teacher said she spent two days at a center dialing the Red Cross number.

[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.080]
Or her finger must be ready to fall right off. Or if I get a line for that.

[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:26.240]
Relief workers such as Latasha Brown say the Red Cross has yet to reach many people in remote impoverished areas weeks after the August 29 storm.

[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:34.200]
Angered by what you call the cheerleys lack of outreach, brown and others form their own organizations saving ourselves in mobile Alabama and funded out of their own pockets.

[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:41.080]
There have also been allocations of discrimination in some Red Cross shoulders and complaints that some volunteers have been incensed against the needs of the evacuees.

[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:48.520]
Several relief agency leaders argue that the Red Cross has become mired and protracted recovery effort that is not designed to handle.

[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:52.740]
The charity traditionally provides short term assistance and is gone from the scene of disaster within days.

[02:09:53.020 --> 02:10:02.500]
Critics also say the charity's fundraising success has collected $1.3 billion more than 75% of all Katrina related donations so far is undercutting other agencies.

[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:11.180]
The Red Cross is a brand name and people automatically pick it for donations to Daniel Borak-Chaw, President of the American Institute of Philanthropy, which monitors how charity spend their money.

[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:15.920]
But there are a lot of local groups who can use assistance and reimbursement and the Red Cross is willing to do that.

[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:23.880]
Martha J. Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Red Cross, would not discuss in a phone interview whether the charity would share its donations, nor would she comment on specific complaints.

[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:32.780]
She said the organization has no desire to expand its mission via the immediate relief into long-term community and redevelopment and that the Red Cross will advise the public that it no longer leads hurricane donations.

[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:36.660]
The charity had to improvise, yadda yadda yadda goes on about this, but it would be better than that.

[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.320]
The assurances it says are scant comforts of victims and relief workers.

[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:45.860]
Riches in the way it was furious when the Red Cross shut down to the Cal County operation without warning.

[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.900]
Local officials had criticized the operation for long lines in efficiency, saying that this function provoked a near riot.

[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:55.660]
They demanded that the charity leave in that the Red Cross vacated the site last week.

[02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:00.460]
Riches in with no car headed travel 25 miles by bus to the next closest center.

[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:06.580]
Could they make it more difficult for people to get to as to 45-year-old father of three who is living with a family in a hotel paid by local groups?

[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:10.960]
Red Cross is a, yeah, they may not be good, but they're consistent, okay?

[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:17.160]
949 votes. We will be at 1,000 or more by the top of the hour. My name is Ishkabibble.

[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:20.220]
How do you like that? My name is Macy Pupik. That A.V. Ishkabibble.

[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.920]
My name is Yiskshak Goldstein. Yiskshak.

[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.020]
Wonder what it sounds like when Yiskshak lets loose with a gun of shriki.

[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:30.100]
Oh, wait till you hear this. Arthur calls Harry Potter.

[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.180]
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you one thing. He goes to Shrek to wait long enough. Everybody is gay now.

[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:35.000]
That's what you say.

[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:44.600]
That whole circle around the White House. A British cleric and top-selling author of children's books was thrown out of a school where he said Harry Potter was gay during a talk to 12-year-old kids.

[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:57.580]
Reverend Graham Taylor, who penned the novel Shanto Mancer, which like the tales of the famous boy wasn't created by JK Rowling, centers on witchcraft and battling evil, got his marching orders after teaching the community of homophobia.

[02:11:57.740 --> 02:11:58.220]
You fairy.

[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:08.160]
Ask for a Harry Potter. Well, he's not the only gay in the village Taylor Troll children at Penn Air School in Truro, Southwest England, referring to a catchphrase from the popular British comedy TV show Little Britain.

[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:16.680]
I don't know why anybody should be surprising in England, man. I don't know their word. It's kind of like Toronto. How many straight people are straight men in the entire country?

[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:23.680]
About 30 men? He also said villains in the... maybe Prince William, I would say. Maybe Prince Harry. That's it. You know any other ones?

[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:33.740]
I don't know a lot of Brits. No, you're lucky. There's one. There's three. He also said villains in Rowling's blockbuster series were Wimps and called TV Crap Compared to Books.

[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:42.460]
Teacher Stop Taylor is talking asked him to leave. We were very disappointed after Grit Taylor visited for Mr. Taylor to school send a statement yesterday.

[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:49.520]
Taylor, who's booked out the British book charts for 15 weeks with the film rights, also sold for 2.25 million pounds. It's for a million bucks.

[02:12:49.840 --> 02:13:02.720]
Was unrepentant to the cue staff of censorship. It was a joke. A joke from a little Britain that the children would know Taylor was quoted by newspapers as saying, I didn't set out to offend anybody. I'm a priest and I'm very careful not offending people, especially young boys. I'd rather molest them than offend them.

[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:10.320]
See, there's another thing for that to dad that's worried about how he explains that word on somebody's t-shirt, which I'm sure his kid never has seen but never laughed and on t-shirt.

[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:21.340]
How do you explain when your little kid is watching the TV news as you're all sitting around the TV there at family time or whatever and they come on it with more stories about these child molesting priests? How do you explain that to him, Pops?

[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:27.160]
About that the trusted family priest is did little boys. How do you explain that? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:33.680]
It's a comedy conspiracy. That's how you do that. That's right. They're only isolated incidents. All 85 million of them. He then's keeping those names.

[02:13:33.680 --> 02:14:02.400]
That's right. Just another way to pick on those poor Catholics. That's right. That's what that rabid build on here would tell you. Oh, he's always a very angry guy. 957 votes on his poor. We are just shocked. I bet you'd read. Read is doing cartwheel in the house only because we're ripping Joel Feinberg and ask. See, if I had known what the last fact said, I probably wouldn't even waste all my time with this because I thought he was like a real like a man. You know what I mean? Like a person? You know what I'm saying? No.

[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:08.700]
Like a real guy. He's not. He's just another one of these sports nerds. That's all as opposed to who?

[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:27.980]
Bob Green, Mike Disney, Stanley Cohen, Tim Williams, Terry Lawrence, corporate Peter, the Casper, Sid Levin. I was just going to recent memory. I don't know any of the current. Well, I'm done, but I'm just telling you. I thought he was like a real general manager, like a person. And of course you have to think of Stu got to the general manager.

[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:48.120]
So if Stu got to the general manager, why wouldn't an overgrown child be the head on show? Whatever his title is this week. So I don't know the source was all I had a good time doing. He's probably. He's probably wrecked the whole orifice owner. You know, he's probably busted up all the furniture, the chairs, the desk, the pictures on the wall, all the pictures of OJ. That's right. That's us.

[02:14:49.200 --> 02:15:00.980]
957 votes, which 2008 presidential hopeful, do you lease? You fear most, least most, you fear most. Jeff Bush, your fat ass governor. He isn't a client. He's in the leak of his own. You know what? They're finally catching on that tub of crap.

[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:09.220]
Jeff Bush, 458. You want it? You can't have it. Whatever it is. You want the slots. Can't have it. You want class, I'm having it. Can't have it. You want the bullet train. Can't have it.

[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:21.260]
Jeff Bush with his dysfunctional folding below the finger pointing board again family with his all in his cheer craft. Bill Fist, 146. Another one of those are religious notes. Hillary Clinton, 119. Well, we're getting freaked on that.

[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:28.100]
Newt, English, 46. Condoleezza, 44. Of course, the fear of Hillary could be like I said for another reason that she'll get nominated and she can lose her ass.

[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:38.740]
Condoleezza, 44. That's Mr. Condoleezza to you. Rudy Giuliani, 33. John McCain, 27. John Kerry, 22. Still scary. John Kerry. Anybody that looked like he was on the monsters should not have been running.

[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:54.720]
Al Gore, 13. Another man with fine personality. Joel Feinberg, 12. Who? Senator San Brownback, 11.00. Joel's butt. Rick San Torum, 10. Joe Biden, 9. And Barack Obama is in last place, which is a good thing, see. He's only got eight. And he's great.

[02:15:55.240 --> 02:16:00.280]
This is Neil Roger. This is 5.69.

[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:05.860]
The boy, it's the one to two hour.

[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:16.300]
It's as lonely to spell with Don Al. I'll be Don Al Jackson. And today we're going to spell the words European.

[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:29.460]
Spell it with me now. European. EURO, C-E-A-N. That's a big one. Now, this used it in the fence. So I fed through the guy. I say, hey, get away from my car.

[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:35.880]
European on my side. This is learning to spell with Don Al. I'll be Don Al Jackson.

[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:56.000]
I said, hey, get away from my car. I said, hey, get away from my car.

[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:04.360]
It's the only. I think you'll be with it. You can do those stories about it. And it's not only that, but it's not.

[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:34.340]
You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door.

[02:17:38.800 --> 02:18:02.080]
You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in the door. You'll be in

[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:28.680]
にラマレー蒲ですね争味を注ぐ点倫駅もib começるふうに

[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:29.200]
You know, I write anything.

[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:31.580]
Not that I didn't have a pretty significant pile.

[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:31.980]
My pile.

[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:34.460]
So let's your brain with the audio images.

[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:36.300]
Yeah, I'm the South Florida crowd.

[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:37.980]
What are we going to about that t-shirt?

[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:39.180]
What am I going to tell my kid?

[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:40.300]
Quit reproducing.

[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:41.060]
Let me say it again.

[02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:43.080]
Forced sterilization, that's the only hope.

[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:44.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:48.220]
Town 5, 60, and leave a rising in singular wireless lines.

[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:49.260]
And I don't see you.

[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:51.040]
I don't see you in a whole lot of action on there yet.

[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.240]
Of course, what's said, 45 minute delay kicks in.

[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.620]
It will be almost time to leave anyway, right?

[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:55.060]
Right.

[02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:56.500]
WDQIN, hello.

[02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:57.080]
Time to go.

[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:58.280]
Hey, how are you doing, buddy?

[02:18:58.660 --> 02:18:59.120]
OK, pal.

[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:00.120]
Hey, listen up.

[02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:01.800]
You guys are talking about the shows yesterday.

[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:03.160]
Did you ever see that woman's family?

[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.100]
You guys are trying to come up with some laughing?

[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.240]
Yeah, was it Joanne Fleud?

[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:08.180]
Joanne Rory.

[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:09.660]
I was Joanne Rory, right?

[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.140]
Yeah.

[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:11.580]
Oh, listen, I want to ask you something.

[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:17.880]
Tell her I'm a bouquet of wine that is just awesome with Geldy and Mo.

[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.660]
You need to get them singing.

[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:22.980]
You need to get them singing the all in the family song.

[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.440]
Yeah, well, that's a good idea.

[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:25.760]
I'm right there, don't you sleep?

[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:26.860]
Yeah, that's excellent.

[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:27.260]
All right.

[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:28.220]
Thanks, guys.

[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:31.800]
Boy, the way that Geldy's saying, I can hear it now, hey.

[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:32.760]
A lot of the lists.

[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:34.200]
Doido doido doido doido.

[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:34.720]
Doido doido.

[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:38.540]
I find myself doing that doido in the shower just all over the place, even before the show.

[02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:39.020]
I'm sitting here.

[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:39.400]
Everybody.

[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:40.880]
Well, not even being aware of it.

[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.400]
Doido doido doido.

[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:43.660]
The little kid says it.

[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.440]
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:45.740]
There's nothing wrong with doido doido.

[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:47.620]
Am I with anybody we have to head about that?

[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:49.840]
Unless they were wearing a doido on their head.

[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:50.960]
Oh, you know, I didn't play.

[02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:54.300]
Well, the phones are, remind me, I got to do that to these studios.

[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:55.120]
OK.

[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:56.300]
WDQIN, hello.

[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.400]
Money, go.

[02:19:57.980 --> 02:19:59.180]
Somebody QYN, hello.

[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:00.540]
Hey, Ali.

[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:01.260]
Yeah.

[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:03.040]
Listen, I guess.

[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:03.700]
How leasing.

[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:11.300]
I never thought it was real, but the other day, I'm at 136 and 595 and these paper vendors

[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:16.500]
were passing a barrel of alcohol back and forward.

[02:20:16.980 --> 02:20:17.200]
Yeah.

[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:18.700]
Underneath the overpass.

[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:22.260]
I mean, so when I heard it, I heard it was a soapy green liquid that they were drinking

[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:23.100]
out of a soda can.

[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:23.660]
Yeah.

[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:28.620]
But I know also I dropped direct TV for Comcast.

[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:31.060]
What a stupid situation that was.

[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:33.840]
OK, Joel.

[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:34.380]
Yeah.

[02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.180]
5670560.

[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:37.040]
By the way, Tom.

[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:37.600]
Yeah.

[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:40.020]
Booker Brian reminds me he already done that.

[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:41.100]
Well, what is it called?

[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:42.900]
Those were the gaze.

[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:44.320]
No, no.

[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:45.000]
Really?

[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:46.640]
995.

[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:51.380]
During the original cast of all of the family, Dad and the live.

[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.780]
In the premiere of the Can't Do That, no more.

[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:55.160]
Oh, no.

[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:56.320]
That's not the name of it.

[02:20:56.500 --> 02:20:57.960]
I can't even say the name of it anymore.

[02:20:58.580 --> 02:20:59.660]
What we can't play it then?

[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:00.560]
Guzzle and gaze.

[02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:02.040]
Oh, we can't play it.

[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:03.260]
No way.

[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:03.860]
And it was great.

[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.000]
And it was great.

[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:08.460]
But again, in the line of what things we can't say and the other things we can't talk about,

[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:09.320]
there's another example.

[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:15.040]
See, that's why the American public, most of them, including even the people who like and listen to this show,

[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:16.580]
they most of them are just out of it.

[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:17.280]
They just don't get it.

[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:20.180]
So when I come on the agency, we ought to be able to use any language we want.

[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:20.900]
Oh, no.

[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:22.200]
Why not?

[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.440]
Based on what?

[02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:23.680]
Why not?

[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:27.500]
Based on somebody sat down and just arbitrarily decided you can't say this, you can't say this.

[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:28.280]
I'm not fine.

[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:28.940]
It's a salad.

[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:29.940]
It's a series of salad.

[02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:30.960]
It's a word.

[02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:31.500]
That's all.

[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:32.760]
Words don't hurt people.

[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:36.720]
If they hurt your feelings too bad, and if they're like a live list, then we have laws to handle that.

[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:37.820]
We have live a law of slander.

[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.600]
If they're like threatening, that's the whole thing.

[02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:43.340]
We have laws to cover those things.

[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:45.200]
We're not even beginning to go there.

[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:47.220]
We're talking about the terms of language.

[02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:51.460]
The idea that somebody picks and chooses some idiot-like joy, so that they're in Naples,

[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:52.020]
sits there.

[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.520]
Some self-important bitch like George.

[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:58.740]
Oh, and you can't do it the far-t's sounds, and you can't say this, and you can't say a P and S,

[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:00.240]
and you have all this other crap, you know?

[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:01.080]
Well, guess what?

[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:01.620]
Your mama.

[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.300]
How do you like that?

[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:02.940]
I can say that.

[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:06.820]
She is absolutely, totally unqualified to be in that position to be.

[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:10.280]
She hasn't got any clue what this business is all about or about FCC law.

[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:15.400]
And again, she was in a medical insurance person in Maryland or Virginia or some damn place.

[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:16.480]
And they bring her down here.

[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:19.000]
Only the beesleys could find somebody so eminently unqualified.

[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:23.920]
It's kind of like, she is to radio what Harriet Myers is in the law.

[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:26.560]
Only Harriet, at least, they're one that was the lawyer anyway.

[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:27.860]
Well, this one was the lawyer too.

[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.580]
Lawyers are at dime, it doesn't.

[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:30.800]
Just as normal, she'll tell you.

[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:32.520]
We get our thousand, yet or what?

[02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:34.760]
Oh, this still keeps showing these same old...

[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:37.160]
This is old footage, I'm sure, that they keep showing on there.

[02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:39.920]
991, before the next break will be on.

[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:40.520]
971.

[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:41.960]
997?

[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.020]
But you notice now all...

[02:22:44.020 --> 02:22:44.740]
I don't even know.

[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:47.300]
The media always came into this crap.

[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:53.360]
This is what he started yesterday morning with an 80 million speech about terror, the war on terror, and Iraq, and tried to justify.

[02:22:53.720 --> 02:23:01.740]
And again, wagging the dog, wagging the dog, wagging the dog, getting everybody's attention off of Bill Friston, Tom Delay, and about Carl Rove and Scooter Libby.

[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:05.460]
All these other scandals, the fact that the whole house of cards has come crumbling down.

[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.860]
No, now that's all they're talking about is...

[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:08.440]
Oh, look at this.

[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:12.780]
The Department of Homeland Security says that this threat is of doubtful credibility.

[02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:15.400]
They have a terrorism brief every day.

[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.300]
Every single day, and he's also a good person.

[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:18.920]
Oh, doubtful credibility, okay?

[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:24.860]
So all they did was use the New York people to get them whipped up, and they say, oh, well, we don't really believe it anyway.

[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:28.560]
But in the meantime, it's totally and completely changed the whole thrust.

[02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:36.960]
Every time they have another scandal, every time there's more bad news, whether it was the first wave of stuff about Valerie Plame, then all of a sudden they play the plane game.

[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:40.680]
And we got some other BS kind of crap that they bring up.

[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:44.140]
The more that time goes on, the more I'm convinced.

[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:46.580]
And I know you're in, it sounds very horrible to say it.

[02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:50.400]
The more I'm convinced that in some way, maybe not directly, who knows?

[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:52.760]
We'll never know the truth, just like the Kennedy assassination.

[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:57.560]
But in some way, the Bush clan was involved with their friends and the Saudis in that whole 9-11 thing.

[02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.860]
I just believe it.

[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:05.180]
Sure. Because if you read the Neocon Bible, man, if you read that Holt-Penac business about well, they're right.

[02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:07.360]
They must do this in a racket, but it will put them in.

[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:13.160]
Wolfowitz and Richard Pearl, all these idiots were talking about what they would have to do this in order to change the governments in the Middle East.

[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:19.140]
And the meantime, the only way the public will stand by for an invasion of Iraq is for another Pearl Harbor-like incident to happen.

[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:21.080]
Well, maybe they just had very good fortune.

[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:23.220]
The people who were in the buildings didn't have such good luck.

[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.900]
But maybe they just had good fortune.

[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:27.940]
Right. 9-11 came along just in time, just what it did.

[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:29.860]
We got some ragheads on the payroll, don't we?

[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:31.620]
Yeah, they might like a deal like that.

[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:37.280]
5670560, pound 560 and a Verizon singular wireless lines.

[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.200]
Oh, this line 9. Now this week, this has been the champion line.

[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:41.220]
WCYM Hello.

[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.660]
See, that is still one of the better ones.

[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:45.040]
WCYM Hello.

[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:46.260]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:46.820]
Pretty good.

[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:56.380]
Definitely convinced that the reason why we got hit at 9-11 was because of George Bush is running in with a bedlaught and family and screwing up their money.

[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:58.240]
Yeah, there was something went on there.

[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:07.320]
In fact, the fact that daddy was meeting with the Carlisle group in New York on the morning of the 9-11 attacks, there's something really smells honoris about that.

[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:10.360]
Oh, yeah. Well, look, you're a business owner.

[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.080]
I want to invest money in your business.

[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:16.160]
I give you whatever $100 million to start doing something.

[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.440]
I don't see any results.

[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:18.760]
What do you think is going to happen?

[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:20.800]
Something bad. That's a lot of fun.

[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:21.420]
Something bad.

[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:22.920]
Something bad, definitely.

[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:24.900]
I also want another thing I want to tell you.

[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:31.320]
I'm a Democrat and I have a few acquaintances that I know that are Republicans.

[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:32.400]
You know, it's funny.

[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:39.760]
The only thing that these people seem to care about is only themselves and how much money that they can save in their lives.

[02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:44.520]
Now you're talking, that's the only thing that they talk about is how much money they save in their taxes.

[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:47.960]
They do not care about any other agenda. They do not care.

[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:50.080]
I was growing up Jewish.

[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:56.640]
I always thought that almost all Jews were Democrats and that they were liberals and that they cared about social issues and about all of it.

[02:25:56.660 --> 02:25:59.200]
And once upon a time that seemed to be the general Jewish ethic.

[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:03.500]
But as I grow older, I realize that more and more Jews in this country are sell-outs.

[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.840]
And as long as somebody gave them some tax breaks, that the dollar was like,

[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:07.980]
that's the same only Jews.

[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.240]
But it's a very sad thing that people used to have some ethics.

[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:12.140]
So many of them now have totally sold out.

[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:15.760]
Like David from and like a whole bunch of these re-acts.

[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:18.340]
Oh yeah. Well I said, let's you know, I'm Jewish also.

[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.860]
And I do not think that way.

[02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:33.180]
So you know, I feel number one, taking care of your home and security in your home and your people at home is number one before even thinking about taking care of anybody else.

[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.420]
I've been sitting there for 80 years now.

[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:37.380]
So you know, I don't know.

[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:40.700]
Well I think they should be sure to do what a good job they're doing in the world.

[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:42.520]
And I'm taking care of their own.

[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:48.300]
You know, in a way it's not surprising to me because I know these people have their own agenda.

[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:53.140]
And whatever they do is what they want to do, not what they should be doing.

[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:55.380]
Well, as they stay inside Bury at Hulman's Rear.

[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:56.960]
Have a good, uh, in Japanese New Year, Pellie.

[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.020]
You two nails. See you.

[02:26:58.020 --> 02:26:58.520]
Take care, buddy.

[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:02.240]
It's an acting quickly enough to prepare for a possible pandemic.

[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.540]
Oh, here we go. Let's have a big argument about this.

[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:09.100]
Everybody's going to, if you don't die from the terrorist attack, it's going to be that I, I'm flew or avion.

[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:10.180]
If you drink to the avion.

[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.360]
Now, can't, now that's French water, man.

[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:18.000]
Now if we patched up our deal with the French enough so that we can stop at a, uh, freedom toast and freedom water and all that other stuff.

[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:18.380]
No.

[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:23.380]
Oh, well like I said, look out for that avion and that avion to 1010.

[02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:24.920]
Now we had that the other day we had 1010.

[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:28.360]
I was talking about 1010 wins New York and 1010 CFRB in Toronto.

[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:32.040]
And Joel Feinberg's got a dozen votes. The dirty dozen.

[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:34.640]
This is Neil Roberts.

[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.100]
This is by 162.

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:38.580]

[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:04.700]
Oh, W.

[02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:11.580]
Oh.

[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:24.960]
Oh.

[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:41.580]
Oh.

[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:19.640]
Oh.

[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:19.920]

[02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:32.080]
What's 17 at 560 WPM? We got the molemeister. We got, uh, Mr. Meister.

[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:34.400]
On, I didn't play. What did you play?

[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:37.240]
Um, I'll find it.

[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:03.720]
Let's see that. I heard it.

[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:11.620]
I'm going to wear that one.

[02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:14.160]
There's the one armed man.

[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:14.820]
I don't know.

[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:16.240]
I'm going to wear that.

[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:27.800]
I'm going to wear that one.

[02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:29.500]
There's the one armed man.

[02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:33.000]
I didn't.

[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:33.000]

[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:33.000]

[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:33.160]
I'm going to wear that one.

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:33.160]

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:33.160]

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:33.160]

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:33.160]

[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:07.880]

[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:08.080]

[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:08.260]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:08.560]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:10.020]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:10.100]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:10.360]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:10.540]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:11.720]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:11.760]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.300]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:13.020]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:13.080]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:13.080]

[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.760]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:20.840]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:21.280]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:21.280]

[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:21.980]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:22.280]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:24.120]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:25.360]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:29.800]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:30.440]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:31.000]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:31.700]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:33.780]
Jason Saladkin.

[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:35.820]
That this is Neil Rogers.

[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:40.380]
That's your this is by Cazachie A.S.

[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:43.600]
Deathlong Presidents.

[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.140]
Whoa, you ain't kidding.

[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:47.100]
Goodbye George.

[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:50.840]
You got to go, Leo Milo.

[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:53.040]
You got to go home.

[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:55.900]
Put your foot in the pad on the pile.

[02:38:57.060 --> 02:39:00.260]
But you sure, if you know where it came to sit,

[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:02.220]
Carrie Shivon.

[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.700]
Son of a bush is a foot in your touche now saved by yo.

[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:10.320]
That's how Georgia Wild People's Row,

[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:13.620]
you played a round of relaxing golf flow.

[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:15.820]
He was on vacation for I.R.A.

[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:19.520]
and he's a nut your cup of tea that's ever been known.

[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:25.140]
Oops, and no one cares to even prepare for the worst scenario.

[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:30.780]
You were the one busy having fun in that window.

[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:35.020]
You'll invest a game at a later date.

[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:36.440]
That's real bullshit.

[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.060]
So, nink a situation once that dutch you get locked up

[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.420]
so it don't continue.

[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:48.860]
But no one will get blamed like with age and blame no hands will roll.

[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:52.660]
A part and as for this, if you slap on the wrist,

[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:55.460]
the no-charges pile, what a surprise.

[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:00.360]
Because you're a liar, no one gets fired with each new messo.

[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:05.640]
Nobody, a new get-tall, a slip in the poles, that's no problem.

[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.020]
Oh, ill-fax it.

[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:09.660]
Your spin machine will deal with new whirlings,

[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:13.180]
because that's their job, oh, as per usual.

[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.680]
Son of a bush is a foot in your touche, you're an asshole.

[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:23.700]
We just don't understand you got blood on your hands, but what no brain, no.

[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:24.740]
I'm a problem-solving.

[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:30.360]
You made it obvious that these can most goblas, you have no shame, oh shame, what's that?

[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:35.600]
And what's with that smirk you stupid jerk when people have died old?

[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:40.780]
Son of a bitch, you should be impeached and we mean front.

[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:43.580]
Now do us all a favor and get the fuck out.

[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:44.500]
You're here.

[02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:45.720]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:46.480]
Absolutely.

[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:51.420]
132 at 560 WQM, here's the fact that says no need to read on the air, but why not?

[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:54.460]
Don't you think this is moderately interesting and woodless?

[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:55.100]
I did otherwise.

[02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:55.900]
Ludkris?

[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:00.060]
It says, just wanted to report I got serious satellite radio this week and learn a few things.

[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:04.920]
One, air America left serious for XM a few months ago, because XM offered them several million dollars upfront

[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.120]
to put an end release from after their financial woes, so air America is now in bed with a cheap channel.

[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:13.640]
Two, serious is liberal progressive stations called serious left,

[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:18.200]
and sports ads for real sponsors has high production values, and is surprisingly professional.

[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:23.540]
The line of a personality is includes Alex Bennett, whom I used to listen to on WMC in New York 30 years ago.

[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:25.120]
I'm turning on Alex Bennett.

[02:41:25.380 --> 02:41:26.160]
Oh my god.

[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:28.540]
I know I got to find it.

[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:29.100]
Where is it?

[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:29.820]
It's an arm moment please.

[02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:30.580]
I'll find it.

[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:34.360]
If I have the ability to do, I take you out here right now and kick your teeth in.

[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:34.660]
Nice.

[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:35.900]
I was worried about that.

[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:37.440]
Maybe you were worried about that.

[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:38.280]
I'm on top of it.

[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:39.140]
That's what I'm worried about.

[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:42.240]
Anyway, Alex Bennett was about as exciting as Tampa, Yucca putting.

[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.700]
Tim Hartman, I have no idea.

[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:44.640]
I know Mary Hartman.

[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:45.860]
Do you know who Tim Hartman is?

[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:46.540]
Never heard of it.

[02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:48.120]
And it says, your pal Ben Samuel.

[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:48.980]
She's not my pal.

[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:50.140]
She's a fag-hag.

[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:52.020]
She's obsessed with mis-fudge.

[02:41:52.220 --> 02:41:52.720]
Oh god.

[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:53.780]
Curseing a blustery.

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:55.240]
It says, it's told in the afternoon.

[02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:57.960]
That sounds like a heavy duty start packed lineup.

[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:02.500]
Two articulate and modestly funny fellows called the young Turks and evenings in Alan Combs.

[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:03.720]
We made it night.

[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.720]
Obviously to help you go to sleep.

[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:08.560]
Sirius left his years ahead of Air American terms of listenability.

[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:10.520]
Alex Bennett mentioned that a separate Randy Rhodes.

[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:11.280]
Where are we?

[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:16.060]
Air American hired mostly stand-up comics who are inevitably laudative radio hosts.

[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:17.440]
Oh, they're a caution.

[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:21.800]
An extremely topical concentrating on the latest news in Iraq, FEMA, road climates ever.

[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:25.280]
In addition, the station lies right next to the Sirius trucking channel.

[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:29.720]
In the last few days several callers have mentioned how they stumbled on a Sirius left like what they heard.

[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:32.240]
Have told their friends about it and now listen regularly while they drive.

[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.160]
In short, Sirius left has its hands to roll become influential in the US and make a real difference.

[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.960]
When that star said a lot of fun, it really has some impact.

[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.860]
Sirius channels 101 have been set aside for Stern and his imminent arrival is being highly promoted.

[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:45.260]
You should fire Norma.

[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:46.120]
Make up with Stern.

[02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:48.320]
See, I make up with Stern.

[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.500]
It's not me that needs to make it.

[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:50.300]
It's the beesleaves.

[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:51.460]
They're the ones that screwed me over.

[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:52.520]
The beesleaves.

[02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:53.440]
He had no problem with me.

[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:54.440]
His problem is with them.

[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:57.840]
And they're not going to do any business with them because they are screwing over.

[02:42:57.860 --> 02:42:58.900]
They got an early in this market.

[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:00.760]
But in Fort Myers.

[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:05.480]
When you don't pay somebody to carry their show and you're supposed to be paying, I will even go into it.

[02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:09.240]
Make up with Stern to whatever else is required to get on the train before it pulls out of the station.

[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:12.060]
Oh, not if somebody's drinking a soda can in that slimy green fluid.

[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:15.480]
Having said two hours of your daily QM show, Simal Cast Uncervation,

[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:20.460]
I'd require you to quit Toronto to vote any more time-refer to Pernier Show or present any significant legal difficulties.

[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:23.660]
Please do yourself your fans in your ex-country a big favor.

[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:27.200]
Look into this more deeply and see if you can take to the skies and go national.

[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:28.880]
Sincerely, I can't read the name.

[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:30.660]
A scribbled scroll.

[02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:31.820]
The chronic M. Coco.

[02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:33.660]
Wow, I have one answer to that.

[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:33.880]
No.

[02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:34.140]
No.

[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.300]
Not going to happen.

[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:39.840]
And I, with all due respect, I appreciate the sediments and so on.

[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:41.500]
But forget about it.

[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:44.860]
And then line up, I'm supposed to impress by Alex Bennett and Lynn Samuels.

[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:47.660]
Jesus, don't we have enough old Jews on the air already?

[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:48.960]
Can there really be too many?

[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.200]
No, that's true.

[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:51.780]
I think once we reach our quota.

[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:52.840]
About 30, man.

[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:53.520]
That'll be enough.

[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:56.140]
1069 votes we're going to do 1100 during the show.

[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.900]
And Josh is just spinning cartwheels in the studio there.

[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:01.240]
Don't fall down now like your predecessor.

[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.340]
Don't worry.

[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:03.660]
It's not making that night well.

[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.200]
Fell down and couldn't get up.

[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:10.100]
Anyway, here's, oh, this is something an upcoming Vatican document on Gays and the priest that says,

[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:18.320]
men who demonstrate homosexual tendencies cannot become priests unless they can show they live chastly for a three-year, at least three years in a sunny newspaper system today.

[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:19.040]
And he liked that.

[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.440]
Unless they can show they've been, they've chased all her boys the last three years.

[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:27.880]
Men who publicly show their homosexuality and those who are being on attraction to gay lifestyle should be refused admission of the clergy.

[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:30.800]
The Coriada de la Santa, daily said today.

[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:34.140]
Coriada de la Santa, evening courier, evening news.

[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:37.440]
The report by the newspapers, she's Vatican correspondent Luigi Acatoly.

[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:42.280]
Side of sources have spoke to him about the document from the Vatican's congregation for Catholic education.

[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.080]
The Italian weekly panorama said in today's editions that Pope Benedict the Nazi approved the document during the summer of course.

[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:50.780]
A Vatican official declined to come out of the reports.

[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.100]
They say only that the document will be published very soon.

[02:44:53.440 --> 02:45:00.000]
Several Vatican documents and letters over the years have said Gays or men with homosexual tendencies should not be ordained regardless of whether they can remain celibate.

[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:07.080]
The key one is a February 2nd 61 document and instruction on the careful selection and training candidates for the states of perfection and sacred orders.

[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.960]
Oh my God, which made clear homosexuals should be barred from the priest to it.

[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:14.540]
Why don't they just say forget about homosexual? Why don't they just say pedophiles?

[02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:16.000]
That would cover a hell of a lot more territory.

[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:17.680]
Well, they don't believe there's a difference.

[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:27.960]
Advancement to religious files, nerd nations should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies toward homosexuality or pedistry since for them the common life and the priest of ministry were construed serious dangers.

[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.700]
Well, they sure did a hell of a good job for that.

[02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:39.000]
Oh yeah. A study commissioned by US bishops after the scandal broke by the John J. Collins of Crone of Justice found most abuse victims since 1950 were adolescent boys.

[02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:49.190]
That's abuse from the church. Experts on sex offenders said homosexuals are no more likely than heterosexuals to molest young people, but that didn't stifle questions about homosexual seminarians.

[02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:55.730]
That's the seminal question of the day in Rome with your B.D.I. Nazi Pope.

[02:45:56.270 --> 02:46:00.490]
Oh, and speaking of the all that gay stuff and obviously the audience does money here, but I'm here.

[02:46:00.490 --> 02:46:10.570]
An envision of an Islamic society that bans mixed dancing and sternly disavarues of homosexuality has been given by Makhmoud Zahar, the most senior leader of Hamas in Gaza.

[02:46:11.310 --> 02:46:21.250]
After controversies when a Hamas led council halt at the dance festival and Islamist gunmen stopped a rap band performing in Gaza, doctors of Hara defended the enforcement of a strict interpretation of Islam.

[02:46:21.250 --> 02:46:33.710]
A man holds a woman by the hand and dances with her in front of everyone. Does that serve the national interest doctors of Hara said on the Arabic website, Ilaf? If so, why have the phenomenon of corruption prostitution become pervasive in recent years?

[02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:36.970]
Thank God there was no prostitution back in Merrimagdalens days, you know?

[02:46:37.270 --> 02:46:47.530]
Right. Because of success by Hamas and the municipal polls and it's likely strong showing in January's parliamentary elections, secular Palestinian spirit that will try to impose its ultra conservative vision on them.

[02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:56.710]
It's Gaza Heartland has no cinemas or bars yet the West Bank has a brewery and Ramallah restaurant served wine. Try the wine.

[02:46:57.050 --> 02:47:07.770]
Doctors of Hara condemned homosexual marriage saying, are these the laws to which the Palestinian street is waiting for us to give rights to homosexuals and lesbians a minority of perverts and the mentally and morally sick?

[02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:13.090]
He denied that Hamas wanted a puritanical regime and said it's political and social instruction included women.

[02:47:14.050 --> 02:47:22.870]
As long as they stay in their place. This is the only right by the number. This is 5.62.8.

[02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:53.010]
There will be no dance in the sense of the party, right?

[02:47:53.290 --> 02:47:59.430]
I've already done it. I've gone astral. If they get your dance in me, you'll see. I think I'll send you to a dance to work.

[02:48:01.890 --> 02:48:29.330]
Unless you will, if you take that chance, I wouldn't try it. I think I'll pass. Don't dance.

[02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:59.310]
I can't dance so now. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't dance. Don't

[02:48:59.310 --> 02:49:15.270]
I happily so happy that you said. Cover is ten cost your head. Cover's got to roll up? Cover is d rstar demo. Cover's devilway ten 44- What is it? Ten 44 men.

[02:49:15.350 --> 02:49:19.530]
Turn on 187 votes on the pool. 16 from 2.

[02:49:19.530 --> 02:49:22.970]
is what it is. I'm counting the seconds. Now all these people are all panicking about.

[02:49:23.050 --> 02:49:27.150]
Oh, it's got SARS and Toronto again. You're going to... Yeah, all right. Toronto Health

[02:49:27.150 --> 02:49:31.390]
Officials yesterday said Legionnaires' disease is the cause of 60 deaths in that Toronto

[02:49:31.390 --> 02:49:35.050]
nursing home and more and that more deaths were possibly before the bacteria was fully contained.

[02:49:35.410 --> 02:49:39.650]
But only these people in the one nursing home, seven of them for the age had died and they got

[02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:43.410]
it and said it and so on. 70 residents, 13 employees and five visitors to seven of them,

[02:49:43.490 --> 02:49:47.930]
also been effective. And Legionnaires is a type of pneumonia named after a severe outbreak.

[02:49:47.930 --> 02:49:51.470]
They killed 29 people at a meeting of the American Legion of Philadelphia in 1976.

[02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:55.990]
The bacteria typically found in the environment usually in the water. This disease cannot be

[02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:59.430]
transferred from person to person. There is not and there never was a threat to the

[02:49:59.430 --> 02:50:03.630]
general population of Toronto way. The disease is environmental. It is not contagious

[02:50:03.630 --> 02:50:07.570]
and cannot be passed from person to person and is not outside of the nursing home and they're not

[02:50:07.570 --> 02:50:12.630]
dying over there no more. Yeah. So you got that? Got it. Anybody that's all panicking? Oh, it's SARS again.

[02:50:12.790 --> 02:50:15.670]
Of course being in this state of panic, you know, there's only one thing you ought to be very

[02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:21.410]
concerned about and that safety, safety, safety. Just keep that in mind. Just like those people in

[02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:25.710]
Nalini, safety, safety. We saw a real good example of it there because Bush has got plenty of

[02:50:25.710 --> 02:50:29.870]
his cronies to make sure that he keeps you safe. Tom Oliphant in the Boston Globe writes,

[02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:34.110]
since we all know from President Bush himself, no less, that he's such a selfless leader that he

[02:50:34.110 --> 02:50:37.750]
never even peaks at opinion polls, let's take an audit glimpse at the very latest anyway.

[02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:42.030]
This stuff is from Zogby International and it's current. On the fighting over in Iraq,

[02:50:42.030 --> 02:50:46.610]
Americans who think Bush is doing a good, a excellent job are the just 36% of the sample.

[02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:52.530]
Those who say fair or poor are now above 60%, 63% to be exact. Those numbers don't come close to

[02:50:52.530 --> 02:50:56.510]
explaining why Bush has suddenly become vocal again on security issues. The Rose Garden twice

[02:50:56.510 --> 02:51:00.630]
in the Reagan building once having been set to speeches just in the last week. The real reason

[02:51:00.630 --> 02:51:03.870]
is to be finding the numbers on what used to be considered the president's strongest suit,

[02:51:03.970 --> 02:51:08.650]
the so-called War on Terror. These are the numbers he used to bludgeon John Kerry last year as someone

[02:51:08.650 --> 02:51:11.950]
who couldn't be trusted to keep us safe in order to scare the devil out of just enough

[02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:15.870]
voters to win reelection. From the immediate aftermath of 9-11 right through the spring and even

[02:51:15.870 --> 02:51:18.910]
while the rest of his numbers were beginning to crumble out of the way to vineptitude and worse,

[02:51:19.350 --> 02:51:23.810]
the terrorism numbers held strong. No more, no more. They had been eroding for weeks in the

[02:51:23.810 --> 02:51:27.870]
abysmal performance of government during Gulf Coast hurricanes exposing a stunning absence of

[02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:32.950]
ability cope with catastrophe, probably accelerated to decline. At any rate, the latest Zogby numbers on

[02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:36.710]
Bush and the War on Terror in line with all the other data that politely political landscape

[02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:42.590]
are 49% good or excellent and 50% fair or poor. The problem the president has faced in the Rose Garden

[02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:46.250]
at the Reagan building here yesterday is that there's very little he can do about this mess except

[02:51:46.250 --> 02:51:50.270]
talk. He has all the money he wants, even though it is money the government doesn't technically have,

[02:51:50.490 --> 02:51:53.930]
he has all the power he wants, there's nothing more to get except those elusive results.

[02:51:54.430 --> 02:51:58.170]
Laming somebody else for his rose isn't much of an option any more. The real problem isn't so

[02:51:58.170 --> 02:52:02.150]
much the opinion poses the fact that the clock is ticking in a rack through that awful moment when

[02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:06.030]
it becomes clear that the country no longer trusts Bush on the subject or no longer supports an

[02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:09.990]
open-ended military involvement or both. The president's handlers have gone to great lengths to show

[02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:14.250]
him with his top military people in recent days but the photos have not obscured the disturbing fact

[02:52:14.250 --> 02:52:19.070]
that he and they are not on the same page. Bush is talking is ever about progress, they are talking

[02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:23.650]
especially on Capitol Hill about the limits of military capability in murderous mess like Iraq.

[02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:28.550]
He's talking about resolve, they're talking about politics, Iraqi politics. The latest major

[02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:32.950]
dent in the administration's fading credibility is the yucky political situation in Iraq in total

[02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:37.110]
contravention of its assurances the constitution writing process it become a mechanism to increase

[02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:41.170]
tensions not to resolve them. The point isn't merely that the Iraqis and their American helper

[02:52:41.170 --> 02:52:45.210]
occupiers missed a deadline two months ago for a finished product. The point is that a constitution

[02:52:45.210 --> 02:52:49.450]
was written that makes these societies divisions worse and could end up further enabling it soony

[02:52:49.450 --> 02:52:53.470]
and geihadist insurgency. The idea that this is a budding democracy for which Americans should

[02:52:53.470 --> 02:52:57.970]
gladly sacrifice lives and treasure is absurd. The best way to understand this is to read the

[02:52:57.970 --> 02:53:02.330]
proposed constitution. Instead of creating your country if Foster's fight them is behind the

[02:53:02.330 --> 02:53:05.850]
figure-leaf of federalism there's nothing in it that will prevent Kurds in the northern part of

[02:53:05.850 --> 02:53:09.470]
the country from creating the equivalent of a breakaway state complete with domination of the

[02:53:09.470 --> 02:53:13.530]
less Kurdish city of Kirkuk and its oil fields. There's also nothing in it that will prevent the Iran

[02:53:13.530 --> 02:53:18.330]
influence Shi'at majority in southern Iraq from achieving extreme of a mini-country of nine provinces

[02:53:18.330 --> 02:53:22.970]
ruled by the iron fist of Islamic law of free to repress women and minorities. Presumably the

[02:53:22.970 --> 02:53:26.050]
constitution will be rammed down the throats of feminists, human rights true believers,

[02:53:26.450 --> 02:53:29.730]
the soothing maturities in central and western Iraq and those few still believing in a democratic

[02:53:29.730 --> 02:53:35.130]
secular state. It is fascinating how we're there to take a threat from the UN to label the October 15th

[02:53:35.130 --> 02:53:39.550]
vote illegitimate to get the Iraqi authorities to reverse a lame attempt to fix the result by changing

[02:53:39.550 --> 02:53:44.590]
election rules. These developments along with the continued loss of lives and limbs from the backdrop

[02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:49.270]
to Bush's latest rhetoric. His loss of credibility and support is more of a beginning to be exacerbated

[02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:53.450]
by developments here. After a summer of delay his sentimenturity leader Bill Frist at last had a

[02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:57.710]
schedule of voting a proposal from John McCain and other through a few simple rules for the

[02:53:57.710 --> 02:54:01.790]
treatment of prisoners in the war in Iraq as well as on terror generally. It was opposed by

[02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:05.570]
Bush but it passed with 90 votes. There are going to be more developments like that as long as

[02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:09.890]
the public's disenchantment with this mess continues to grow. It's growing, it's getting bigger.

[02:54:10.410 --> 02:54:13.730]
And of course the other reason that they had to do this dog and pony show yesterday and today in

[02:54:13.730 --> 02:54:18.510]
New York is while we just on the heels of this classic example in the Gulf of showing how in

[02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:22.150]
if these people are and we got all these hacks and cronies like brownie brown in there.

[02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:26.370]
And so now they have to show oh see we're keeping everybody safe after all we really are doing a good

[02:54:26.370 --> 02:54:31.130]
job. Anybody believe us? Come on. No. Look at that. Nobody's dying in New York yet and there was

[02:54:31.130 --> 02:54:36.590]
that dangerous soda can. They have this to make you believe. Really sad. 1100 and four votes you've

[02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:41.930]
got to be kidding me man. You got to be tickling the hairs on my butt. That is a shock isn't it?

[02:54:42.310 --> 02:54:49.750]
That would be what 2008 presidential hopeful you fear the most. We got over 1100 and 1104 and we

[02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:55.790]
sure could use more right right. Fan-ass governor Jeb Bush one of the real they Pinax see a lot of

[02:54:55.790 --> 02:55:00.630]
people don't realize you know they figure well he's just a liar and got a crappy family. That

[02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:06.010]
whole Pinax thing that's something ought to be real concerned about okay you ought to like

[02:55:06.010 --> 02:55:11.810]
to Google it just do a PNAC Google it read about it read all about it. About him and Bill

[02:55:11.810 --> 02:55:18.150]
Crystal and Richard Perl and Paul Wolfowitz and the scooter Libby all of these things I do mean

[02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:23.210]
things. Jeb Bush 530 your fat ass governor he's a good to win by a landslide although we do

[02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:27.410]
like his family a lot they're amusing. How come we got the goddy thing on her come we can't

[02:55:27.410 --> 02:55:32.770]
have the Jeb Bush reality show okay Jeb Bush family oh man like the Adams Taylor Bill

[02:55:32.770 --> 02:55:40.730]
Chris 165 Hillary Clinton 136 they fear Hillary man the ice princess Congolese 51 and her $7,000

[02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:47.070]
shoes Newt Gingrich 49 Rudy Giuliani 38 John McCain is got about 30 man. Oh we now has two

[02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:52.410]
puppy cheeks I'm not too sure about him John Kerry 23 Rick Santorum 20 the there is a real I

[02:55:52.410 --> 02:55:57.970]
mean you talk about way way he must sound brought Sam Brownback out of a low Rick Santorum from

[02:55:57.970 --> 02:56:03.330]
Pennsylvania a Nazi of the worst kind not this is any of the good but I mean the worst and Sam

[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:08.430]
Brownback is right on his ass with 18 probably not the first time either Joe Feinberg and Al Gore

[02:56:08.430 --> 02:56:12.470]
are tied 13 at peace now that is real interesting okay and you want to know what they have in common

[02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:20.370]
what both losers Joe Biden 9 Barack Obama 9 out of 1104 we like Barack Obama a lot a lot

[02:56:20.370 --> 02:56:24.830]
am I right or what yeah I like him a lot there's a guy now of course they'll eventually get to him

[02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:29.470]
and they'll like you know like they do to everybody sooner or later sooner or later but in the meantime

[02:56:29.470 --> 02:56:34.410]
he stands as the great dark hope for an otherwise desperate situation yeah we've got to show everybody

[02:56:34.410 --> 02:56:38.070]
that we're keeping him safe and we're right on top of the situation in New York even though the

[02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:42.510]
you know the Pentagon says I nothing really going on but nevertheless so let them see and then

[02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:45.670]
they can always say well we told you that was not a big deal and there was no credibility

[02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:49.990]
and it was Bloomberg and all those nut jobs up there they got everybody whipped up but nevertheless

[02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:54.410]
and fact that's what he did before this morning when he was there with a Hungarian Gulasz guy like well

[02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:57.590]
we just pass it along to the local governments and then they act on their own they make their own

[02:56:57.590 --> 02:57:00.970]
evaluation and yeah you know and so get everybody whipped up of it in the meantime it had its

[02:57:00.970 --> 02:57:06.230]
desired goal as they always do and these people are unbelievable they can always change the subject

[02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:10.130]
no matter what it is no matter how many people they've killed no matter how many lies they've told

[02:57:10.130 --> 02:57:14.310]
no matter how much crime the how many the deficit no matter what it is no matter if it's $40

[02:57:14.310 --> 02:57:18.930]
a gallon of gas they can always weasel their way out of it or is that must read their way out of it

[02:57:18.930 --> 02:57:27.090]
speaking of that don't don't don't forget this is Neil Rogers this is 5.16 Q.A.

[02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:37.170]
it's day oh if I have a town at 5.6 O WQ.

[02:57:44.310 --> 02:57:52.830]
the Middle Eastern world will be exploded to domic people killed with the gas that we sold him

[02:57:52.830 --> 02:57:59.810]
first time a press or nation and they only want that's going now more blood will be spilled to get

[02:57:59.810 --> 02:58:08.990]
that oil flowing forget about Korea the notes there's no demand but all right wing is drilling it

[02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:18.950]
over and over into our head that Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:58:30.270 --> 02:58:35.770]
3000 people killed are now forgotten let's exploit them and set

[02:58:35.770 --> 02:58:43.590]
hate their oil to be counted going after sat down to flankato sama there's no longer

[02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:52.210]
mention of the naked lot but no one seems concerned all I'm being complacent believe in every word

[02:58:52.210 --> 02:58:59.290]
of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and

[02:58:59.290 --> 02:59:12.270]
right wing is drilling it over and over into our heads that Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:59:22.810 --> 02:59:23.510]
so

[02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:31.130]
off the civil rights is the rights that we're paying we're all suspects now not the ash crop is saying

[02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:38.490]
I have nothing to hide table talkers all are saying but I know media and cattle don't have any

[02:59:38.490 --> 02:59:45.450]
reservations count of provoked battle that world annihilation hold regime must mall

[02:59:45.450 --> 02:59:52.550]
in how the Virgin and so with no objection at all then the craft don't have the balls and the

[02:59:52.550 --> 03:00:05.250]
right wing is drilling it over and over into our brain wash I Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[03:00:05.250 --> 03:00:26.430]
andusha

[03:00:35.230 --> 03:00:41.650]
