[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.940]
the best that you forgot you wait it's just unbelievable about the you know

[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.440]
about when we missed the time about Monday night football and we missed the

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.260]
co-cell and the humor of Don Meredith and then he goes on about the steady

[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.300]

was a dullard good God Barry you're just a quizzling man you know you've

[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.640]
been perfect there at the Harold but nevertheless he's a blowviator yeah well

[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.860]
at least part of that anyway hey Barry so this I got a great a DVD for you a great

[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.020]
movie that I know you'll enjoy yeah I thought George sent it to me and I

[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.460]
well he actually did send it but it was Suds Coleman thanks suds what was man

[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.140]
this this movie just blew me away standing in the shadows of Motown

[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.680]
ah the soul behind the sound yeah the funk brothers I think I saw that did you

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.640]
see that I think so it is just yeah absolutely outstanding yep and I'm just

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240]
it motivated me to do our pull today on black recording artists and I went out

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600]
and bought a whole bunch of new and I'm glad you brought that up because you know

[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.740]
it bothers me the super bowl pre-game show is gonna be the Rolling Stones the

[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.480]
games being played in Detroit this year oh no you know the great wouldn't this be

[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.800]
perfect of course yeah get the funk brothers out there and there's some great

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.180]
recording artists great singers on here why wouldn't you put Stevie Wonder

[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.640]
out there you know all the great recording artists who are on this the CD like

[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.520]
Gerald the Hurt and Ben Harper which I never heard of Ben Harper before

[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.340]
this is sensational the problem you know those aren't people that you know

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.400]
that their most important thing yeah the Motown thing is huge in the music they're

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.440]
playing the game in Detroit and they're bringing the Rolling Stones in for the

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.540]
entertainment yeah I think that was one you only good part of that is maybe

[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.460]
the Stones will sing some of those anti bush songs but I'm sure they won't

[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.460]
no I was saying I can assure you that the league is already taken care of that if

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.140]
if the media were as critical of this illegal invasion of Iraq and you

[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.920]
notice almost a thousand people died in that stampede at Baghdad yesterday which

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.360]
of course that goes way into the background on the news because of what's

[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.000]
happening in the whirlens and Gulf port and Baloxi but if they were as critical

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.600]
of the administration on that stuff as they are on this Fee Man rightfully so

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.040]
all the politicians being totally unprepared you know the Army Corps of

[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.960]
Engineers only yesterday was starting to fill sandbags to to show up the

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.940]
levy and they're starting to do that today well it's a little late yeah just a

[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.720]
little bit late don't you think I would say and all those people the people are

[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.560]
just foaming at them out they're just furious about well we haven't seen

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.800]
anybody and where's the food and where's the water and you know this business

[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.640]
about the homeland security is going to be the biggest pile of BS and if anybody

[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.140]
really thinks that if we sustain a real serious like a chemical or a

[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.860]
biological attack that they're prepared to deal with it you're dreaming this is

[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.720]
pretty busy busy peeing your tax money down the drain on the illegal war in

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.580]
Iraq and also giving tax cuts to the rich that's what they're busy

[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.520]
on pay something based on what has happened in the last week it's time to get

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.460]
out of there and take care of our own period amen where the Democrats except for

[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.300]
a small handful where the hell are they screaming and railing you know yeah

[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.740]
they're just content to sit back and watch the whole thing feel so that they

[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.600]
can use it for politics next year that yeah that's the problem with the

[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.580]
country both parties suck yeah well the Democrats have become irrelevant yeah

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.580]
that's correct that shows you the leaders the first the first bus by the way

[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.920]
that got from the super dome to the astradome the first bus to cut to Houston

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.540]
yeah was common-deared were you aware that no yeah it was taken over by the

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.400]
passengers in other words all the gunpoint that's the story this hour I know

[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.380]
you're on the air but I didn't think you were back to waste of the super

[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.260]
to me the hijacked the bus yes they hijacked the freaking bus you see the kind of

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.580]
chaos that's going on there I mean when you don't have any clothing or any

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.960]
water or any food or what do you do you go any a steel a TV set I would steal

[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.140]
food yeah well you know see I think that if they're still in food and water

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.020]
they should everybody should look the other way I have no problem with that

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.540]
yeah because first of all there's I don't think anybody to buy it because

[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.420]
there are any stores open for the most part number two nobody's got any money

[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.880]
anyhow so I think go to the bank and use their ATM card I mean it's a hopeless

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.640]
so I can see the food in the water but where is the government been with the

[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.340]
food and water this thing I have a big this grace is ever seen why I have a

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.280]
question for the looters what do you do with the television set once you're

[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.980]
loo where are you gonna take it sell it sell it who's gonna buy a thousand

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.320]
some of the looters taking the merchandise that they stole into the shelters

[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.560]
with them yeah but there's no place to go I mean I mean I mean hook up a

[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.740]
man but hey it's chaos can't go there though you understand you can't say

[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.120]
these things but anyway getting back to Motown no see that fits right in though

[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.820]
doesn't it that they ought to have that would be a perfect the thing for the

[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.440]
yeah what for Detroit but that would make too much sense it just I just don't

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.680]
understand that yeah I mean if they could have Michael Jackson we could certainly

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.240]
have and if they could have Justin Tinkerbell and Janet Jackson we could sure

[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.800]
have a Motown yep and I guarantee you nobody take their clothes off

[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.120]
well Motown what I mean the history of of Motown all those artists yeah

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.800]
it's incredible tremendous to roll all those people out there I guess you won't be

[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.880]
betting on the fairgrounds today huh and not for a while not totally underwater you

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.000]
know what that means that means that all those horsemen will be here this winter

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.300]
yeah because the fairgrounds it's gonna be a long time before they operate I saw

[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.560]
they had a clip of a seal you see that I saw the one of the shark they had a

[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.120]
short now we're gonna help the seal come from I don't know they had were

[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.360]
were maybe from the zoo probably they had any

[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.540]
three of the sharks swimming through the the French quarter and can you imagine

[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.080]
the snakes and the rats it's unthinkable yeah the whole deal it's and they said

[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.540]
the levies were built to withstand a category three what makes a lot of

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.260]
sense to me you know this was forecast a year ago well actually the times

[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.640]
picky one had been writing stories about this I got an article on that the

[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.940]
New Orleans paper the time is picky one for years about the fact that this

[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.500]
was gonna happen and that the money that had been allocated wasn't being

[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.800]
spent and of course now they can't do it because they got so many of the

[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.620]
military over there in Iraq and busy with you know tax cuts for the rich it's

[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.240]
just it's a scandal and she's show up to the public exactly what your

[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.220]
government is doing not do you think any other government is gonna come to R.A.D.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.700]
no no maybe the Canadian government a oh yeah the relations have never been

[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.500]
better oh brother every day there are stories here about how much the hate

[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.940]
that exists now that's what Bush has done the whole world hates the U.S. oh

[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.880]
nevertheless why do you always say you've been in the Astridome I'm sure and

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.680]
Superdome oh the Astridome or the Superdome oh yeah both I've been to both yeah

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.660]
yeah I stayed in that high at hotel every time I you know I've been to about

[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.780]
half a dozen Superbolls in the war ones in the other day of the hotel because I

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.800]
didn't know that because I never been to Baluxy because it's you know Baluxy's

[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.180]
for goyem but the the you see that one of the floating casinos the hurricane

[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.300]
actually lifted it and dropped it right on top of the holiday ended you see

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.080]
that yeah I did see that just dropped it right on top of the hotel and

[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.780]
crushed it and all of course another thing most people are talking about right

[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.080]
now is jobs you know that I forget how many thousand they said a half a

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.440]
million dollars a day it's gonna cost in Mississippi because of the

[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.260]
revenue that's gonna be cut off from the casinos and not in the thousands of jobs

[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.360]
yep and and what about what are the kids do or you know supposed to be in school

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.480]
yeah I mean they're not have they don't have schools to go to right every every

[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.620]
five minutes I think it's something else you know it's just how these people's

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.200]
lives have been totally up to the know house no money no clothes nothing no food

[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.420]
the only people who got half a million people got out of there all the people

[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.800]
with money got out yeah well that was another thing too I mean how come it

[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.420]
took them the the moment that they saw and again I don't care what anybody says

[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.920]
the forecasters really blew this whole thing oh it's gonna become a category

[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.640]
two or three when it gets into the Gulf the minute they saw it and developing

[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.300]
into what it was category five they had three days three solid days to really do

[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.540]
a job of getting all those people out of there and they didn't do it I realized

[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.700]
some people you know are just hard to ask they refuse to leave but they just

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.040]
didn't get the job done they should have every bus every uh every you know what I'm

[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.060]
saying yeah and even as it is now they've got a limited number they got

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.180]
300 buses and the people that are sitting on a highway is there which they

[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.820]
went you know they the overpasses where they could find dry ground they they've

[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.640]
been dying right there in a highway because they haven't had any water right and

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.500]
you know they're just brushing aside dead bodies they can you know they can't

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.520]
do anything about that well that's that's because they're so understaffed

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.420]
unprepared that they can't you know they're they're not even doing a job of finding

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.340]
the people were still I don't know how you how you're prepared for a disaster

[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.620]
that magnitude you have to unless you just send in the troops yeah but our

[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:28.080]
troops aren't available right now exactly that's my point yep okay Neil on that note

often change their name to the Miami tampons and why do such a thing they're good for just one

[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:14.380]
period and have no second string and they're up Miami Dolphins Miami Dolphins Miami Dolphins

[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:39.360]

[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.240]

they're only good for one period they have no second string one of the great lines in a

[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.520]

[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.740]

he says you know we're not the flagship station anymore so he's gonna have to look into that

[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.640]

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:02.120]
Niagara River or good luck to you let's go pay your leave now here's the deal or let me just

[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.080]
I was inspired for the poll today before we get in a little bit of this ground I'm not going to

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.580]
spend four hours today well what what's the point you know gnashing my teeth and all the

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:16.040]
recriminations and about this one didn't do that it's just obvious that your government is just

[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.580]
in fact the people in the states and Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama are just

[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.640]
foaming at the mouth with FEMA they're furious with the federal government

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.600]
did you see Mary Landu on there the senator from Louisiana the other day no just reaming and ripping

[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.860]
an ass but nevertheless all the meaning and ripping isn't going to help those dead people

[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.200]
it's not going to help those desperate starving people and homeless people all the other stuff

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.920]
that's going on here your government once again totally unprepared and see this and I disagree

[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.500]
with Hank when he said you know how could they have been prepared for a catastrophe of this magnitude

[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.440]
that's the point you have to prepare for the worst the worst case scenario and keep in mind when

[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.920]
it came on shore it wasn't even a category it was a strong four it was just under category five

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.420]
strength when it finally made landfall am I right right four yes well I want to make sure I get

[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.120]
it right because then for I'll come in again on next Tuesday morning and bitch me out for

[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.920]
giving wrong information about the hurricane it's all your fault everyone was complacent that's

[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.080]
right I got everybody to complacent I didn't go on the year and say make your preparations now

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.140]
it's coming sooner than later I didn't say any of those things but anyway I'm not even going to

[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.740]
go into it throw you an idiot okay but nevertheless so the movie that suds thank you suds Coleman

[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:27.580]
I thought it was you I thought you were talking about it damn it huh no I told you that suds gave me

[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.880]
this movie to give to you standing in the shadows of Motown the soul behind the sound it's about

[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.040]
the funk brothers which was a group that backed up all of the great Motown artists in fact it says

[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.720]
they backed up more if I want to get it right more number one hits here it is then the beach boys

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.060]
rolling stones Elvis and the Beatles combined making them the greatest hit machine in history

[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.460]
popular music and that inspired me to do the pool today and also go out and buy a whole bunch of

[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:56.240]
Motown and buy the soundtrack from this and also on this in the movie there are some people singing

[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.720]
they're none of the original singers from the songs you got all the musicians and they've got some

[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.720]
great people on there like Gerald the vert who does reach out I'll be there and Ben Harper which

[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.140]
I've never heard of been Harper before who's just sensational he's like the new Marvin gay man he

[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.160]
is fantastic he's even better than Marvin gay in my opinion everything that that's available for

[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:22.980]
him for free of course right of course for free so our poll question today is who was or is the

[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.100]
all-time best black recording artist or group now when they're like artists like Diana Ross you

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.960]
know on a game she went out on her own all of the other stuff but I didn't I didn't duplicate in

[00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.530]
the words she's partly supreme so I just put supreme so I'm saying I got it there are a whole

[00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.970]
bunch of people like that like I didn't put the Jackson five I just got Michael well I got that

[00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:45.230]
backwards but anyway we could change it no no because I picked whichever one made more sense to me

[00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.150]
I didn't put Smokey Robinson I put the miracles I didn't put David Ruff and I put the

[00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.050]
temptations you follow what I'm saying what he said I don't know I didn't put Martha reuse I

[00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.110]
put Martha at any rate so here's what we got so far and it just let me say it again at one

[00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.510]
thing about the South Florida crowd or at least our audience anyway you're taste in music and don't

[00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.690]
ever ever tell me that my taste in music is bad again don't ever say that which I'm always

[00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:10.930]
getting at because I'm an old toad okay because I don't like a rap and crap that's what they like

[00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.970]
they like garbage see and and this proves this movie proves beyond a shadow of a doubt and as if

[00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:22.810]
as old timers did I already know the us old coots that you know the R&B artists I mean from all

[00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.510]
the way back to Fats Waller and there's so many others they they were the ones that really made

[00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:31.790]
music they're the ones that paved the way for Elvis and all the others and the stones but

[00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.710]
nevertheless don't confuse that with this crap that passes from music today I mean what the

[00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.290]
look at I possibly know who is or was the all-time best black recording artist or group and you people

[00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:48.230]
say Jimmy Hendrix is God oh my god could he sing no he's a great guitarist one of the great

[00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:54.050]

[00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:15.830]

and fire departments they also have opened a fifth birth at four different grades for oil tankers

[00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.970]
in the effort to bring in as much fuel as possible and thank you again by the way mr. President

[00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:14.810]
for those low gas prices we don't have any hard data to lead us to believe there will be a shortage

[00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:20.310]
county administrator Roger Dijar Lee said officials in four-loaded oil plantation highly and

[00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.170]

energy the storm flick are we find ways and oil rigs at fpnl spokesman bill swank much of that

[00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.410]
fuel that we use for generating electricity is being restricted now not willing to take a chance

[00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.710]
on shortening jr just try to beat higher prices motorists lined up for gas in some local stations

[00:28:54.710 --> 00:29:00.130]
I saw the clips on that manager just lined up uh eight million long like a bunch of crazy people

[00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.250]
so they're gonna like goug you and the rape you when it just continues the rape of the american

[00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:43.450]
public and thank you again mr. president to even know your name is bush the evacuation of

[00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:48.410]
the super almost suspended today after shots are reported fire at a military helicopter and

[00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.930]
arson fires broke out outside the arena no injuries immediately reported the scene at the

[00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.150]
super dome became increasingly chaotic with thousands of people rushing from nearby hotels

[00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.630]
in other buildings hoping to climb out of the buses taking evacuees from the arena paramedics

[00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.030]
became increasingly alarmed by the sight of people with guns that's one of the things that they

[00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:11.610]
stole along with shoes not a lot of tons of a re-box and Nike's man it got some nice shoes and

[00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.870]
video games a lot of people stealing video games and binoculars and you see all the stuff they were

[00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:21.590]
yeah every plasma TVs and of course lots of firearms every kind of gun to take a five

[00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.650]
steal the gun that reminded me of what was it over the omega man with Charlie oh yeah one of my

[00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.930]
favorites yeah that reminded me of that scene shots were fired at a military helicopter over the

[00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.810]
super dome before daybreak he said the national guard told him we were sending a hundred military

[00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:40.470]
police officers to restore order that's not enough he said his circadian ambulance is based in

[00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:45.050]
Lafayette Louisiana we need a thousand Lieutenant Colonel Pete Snyder of the Louisiana National

[00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.810]
Guard said the military which was handling the evacuation of the able body from the super dome

[00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.430]
had suspended operations to because fire set outside the arena were preventing buses from getting

[00:30:53.430 --> 00:31:00.230]
close enough to pick people up just a little bit of chaos I would say and where's that story

[00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:05.870]
about I got it here somewhere there it is oh seriously about the yeah I was telling Hank the first

[00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.170]
bus to turn up at the Houston stadium arrived unexpectedly early an authority said later it

[00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:14.190]
apparently had been commandeered and driven to Houston with its load of passengers eager to escape

[00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.390]
a city lacking electricity and fast running sure to food and water people on the bus some of

[00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.590]
whom described heroin conditions in the super dome were allowed and did you see that the two people

[00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.210]
committed suicide they just jumped yes we're allowed into the assidum which is installing thousands of

[00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.810]
cuts where Houston's professional baseball and football teams once played and keep in mind in the

[00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.950]
places that were hit by the store by the hurricane there's not only is there no drinking water there's

[00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:43.130]
no there's no water period in other words there's a we can't there's no toilets to be flushed is what

[00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:48.310]
I'm trying to say delicately so if there are things floating in the water the best alligator just

[00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.450]
they keep talking about dead bodies floating in the water I think there may be worse things floating

[00:31:55.450 --> 00:32:01.210]
in the water 50 roll they call those floaters um something to Houston from the destruction of

[00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.550]
Orleans expressed anger they couldn't join those from the super dome skates will be temporarily

[00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:11.610]
housed in the assidum and there were some people that you know they they listen to the advisories

[00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.730]
on the weekend and they got in their vehicles and they drove to Houston and they went to the

[00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.770]
assidum and those people aren't being let in they're happy let in they're with their little kids

[00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.090]
their families and they're not being let in so in other words if they're not coming on the buses

[00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.290]
so what they probably there's people are going to have to do is come and do one of the buses when

[00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:33.110]
it gets to town gets to Houston you mean hi Jack well I didn't say that come in here here's a

[00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.830]
fact this is I see there are charity events and telephones being set up for the hurricane having

[00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.630]
said that I feel with billions of dollars going out for a pointless war troop strength low because of

[00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.370]
that what a joke I have compassion for the disaster but to put the bill on or in this uh or this in

[00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.110]
some way rubs me the wrong way this is a government problem they should pay with well guess what

[00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.830]
they're not going to okay Jesus good guy I mean his points are all valid and you're absolutely

[00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.510]
correct in the test cuts for the church which I have that story about the picky in times in

[00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:03.430]
Louisiana which had warned about this whole thing going to happen for a long for years now but in

[00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.390]
the meantime this business is standing back and say well you know we warn you people and above

[00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.770]
just be one of those you know totally so kind of people that doesn't get the job done just like

[00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.210]
the media now with all you know it's fine that they're you know ripping an ass that's great and

[00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.310]
they're right about not being prepared enough but what good is that do right now don't we have

[00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.330]
plenty of time to do that all the recriminations like later on after we like scrape up all the dead

[00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:28.910]
by did you see that there were caskets it looked like a scene out of passions like like look like

[00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:34.470]
a tsunami on passions a few weeks ago there were caskets floating in the water yeah already occupied

[00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:40.990]
a lot of evil just the beyond beyond description beyond words and you know FEMA we're doing a great

[00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.310]
job or really no you're not you're doing an embarrassing it but like I said recriminations later

[00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:54.510]
click on the red cross thing on our website donate a few bucks this is Neil Rogers this is 560 QA

[00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.910]
yeah

[00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.070]
stench of pal manure covers over this performance by the dolphin

[00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.350]
think about it

[00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:20.290]
about the prices you pay to feel the quantity after the quarter fish and bullet

[00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:30.010]
seniors laden it over the prices price and you can't give the film a let's you clearly tell us just why

[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.390]
things are so fast everywhere

[00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:39.510]
and let's see you know they will charge for fair

[00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:49.430]
best thing to do you should try to see how long to walk to what they will be

[00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:58.190]
prices so high at the cost price is so high at the cost

[00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.730]
it's that higher price

[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.110]
thirty

[00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.390]
and

[00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.910]
I'm in the shadow of love, I'm in the shadow of love

[00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.390]
I'm in the shadow of love, I'm in the shadow of love

[00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.790]
I'm in the shadow of love, I'm in the shadow of love

[00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.010]
I'm in the shadow of love, I'm in the shadow of love

[00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:51.390]
I'm in the shadow of love, I'm in the shadow of love

[00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.530]
I'll be the...

[00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.610]
It's not beginning at the beginning

[00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:56.950]
at the beginning

[00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.970]
It's not beginning at the beginning

[00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:56.970]

[00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.090]
for the two of us

[00:35:59.090 --> 00:35:59.230]
beginning

[00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.390]
For now we have to make that happen

[00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.130]
From a moment years before

[00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.910]
and then we're not apart

[00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.610]
And show it to our kids

[00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:13.990]
And show it, so we're back

[00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.570]
Just for a moment

[00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.090]
I'm in the shadow of love

[00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.710]
Okay ... 10 47 and 5 60

[00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.590]
here's an oya

[00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:20.770]
We're back to Frankie LymAA

[00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.890]
again. No one is offering French alignment. That's the same one dimension.

[00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.750]
Leave these out there again. Now put a bottle just to make that go happy.

[00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.530]
All right. Frankie Lyman. What a what?

[00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:33.270]
Greatest black singer of all time. Not. I mean, I say this, I'd vote for him before I'd

[00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:37.210]
vote for Jimmy Hendricks. All right. And Jimmy Hendricks has got a comfortable lead.

[00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.150]
He'll win on our pool. I just, we ought to have like an asterisk next to that is in pardon

[00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.730]
these people to just stoned off their ass. They don't wouldn't know a singer.

[00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.530]
It's all name recognition with them. Whatever. Get out of here. Name recognition.

[00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:52.250]
Yeah. State of mind name recognition. All of that. Is that what it is?

[00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.430]
So there's a don't know who these other people are. They don't know.

[00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:59.310]
I don't want to go into it. It's just too sad. I guess we could take a call or two because I got

[00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.130]
to like some stuff on the hurricane and on the your federal government and on FEMA and all of

[00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.230]
a sudden. Of course, the all of the dead people in the bag that stand peed. I'd like to pull it out to

[00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.490]
you. The reason that that happened was like somebody on the fire on a crowded theater.

[00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.610]
Yeah. Everybody panicked. And let me just say this to you. The rumor that was going around

[00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.950]
is that there was a suicide bomber because they already they already had shot into the crowd.

[00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.250]
The insurgents and there were some bodies laying around and oh, we got a suicide bomber and I'm

[00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.950]
missing everybody panic. That's what caused the stampede. I just would like to point out and

[00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.790]
passing out that anybody cares, especially the people in the media that before the Iraq

[00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.510]
attacked by the US and its a couple of allies. There wasn't any. There were no suicide attacks

[00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:40.050]
in Iraq and it was all of this bloodshed and chaos going on. You know, sometimes a dictator isn't

[00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:44.270]
all that bad, especially one that we put in there in the first place, by the way. WDQAM,

[00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.830]
Hey, Neil, you know bad news about that seal. You know, they shot it about what? You know,

[00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:54.030]
that seal you were talking about it and I'm a specific shot. They popped the twice in the head

[00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.450]
that Anderson Cooper was reporting. They said put them out of his misery. They shot

[00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.670]
off. They shot off to Anderson Cooper in the head twice instead of the seal if I had a choice.

[00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.790]
You're an idiot, Anderson. You're a quizzling. You're an invasible. You people on CNN, including

[00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.970]
Mrs. Limbaugh. Our Rick Sanchez is in New Orleans. See what I'm saying? There you go. Oh,

[00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.590]
does that answer all your questions? Birds, right? I rest my case. Thanks, whatever, Daron. You

[00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.470]
just redeemed yourself. Now get a divorce and come to your senses. WDQAM. Hello? Hey,

[00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.970]
Valley. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil, I just want to have a question. We're all our countries

[00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:28.290]
millionaire. We're still getting head turn of Donald Trump. Oprah, I've got to send some money in.

[00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:33.890]
Don't send $2,000. Oprah. I mean, don't send any books or cars. Send some money. That big.

[00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.710]
Oh, she gets another deal with a car manufacturer. She can send everybody her car. There's no

[00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.930]
road to drive them on, but she'll like, you know, she'll email them. Get your car on an email.

[00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:47.030]
That's a good idea. Excellent. We're going to email everybody in the audience a car.

[00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:55.950]
WDQAM. Hello? Neil. Yes, sir. Why is it that nobody on the news or nobody's talking about?

[00:38:56.030 --> 00:39:01.250]
The fact that every year there's more and more hurricanes and more and more stronger. I mean,

[00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.330]
they are. I just got through reading articles about that on Tuesday. If you pay attention, sir,

[00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.170]
if you get with it, if you don't understand about the global warming thing, which, and if you'd read

[00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.510]
the stories on our website, you know, but he's right. They're not really talking to the media much

[00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.810]
about the mainstream, so-called mainstream media. They're too busy doing their grave robbing.

[00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.490]
They got lunatics covering it like. In order to see if we can find some people and as you're

[00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:25.170]
as you're navigating to these like Ricky Tiki Sanchez. Oh, brother, no wonder they're hyperventilating

[00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:30.070]
they're unseeing. That was the end when they hired that nut case. That was the end. They were

[00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.150]
already right on the edge. They were wobbling like less Cooper would say. They were wiggle wobbling

[00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:38.110]
right there at the edge. I think Bokobron wants to send me that wiggle wobble by less Cooper. I

[00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.650]
got to dig around and find that. Remember that song? No. Oh, come on. QA and hello? Neil. Yes, sir?

[00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.030]
Yeah, I got a nomination for the poll, which is maybe a little unusual, but it just fit the category.

[00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:54.190]
Lay in team price. One of the main purposes. Right. Okay. Well, we call us a put how about my

[00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:58.870]
Haley Jackson or even Mary Anderson? Exactly. There you go. Mary Anderson would be good.

[00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:04.850]
Probably. Those are like real singers anyway. Excellent. Hey, when I took at the quarter of

[00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:11.290]
state road 84 and Southwest 4th in Fort Lauderdale, their Anthony's restaurant. Gas is

[00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.130]
$2.69 a gallon at the Amico. Uh oh. Well, that's the end of them. There you go. Thank you. Okay, thanks.

[00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:23.710]
All right. What did you name all those again for me since? I bleonteen price. That's a L E O N T Y.

[00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:28.470]
I don't know. Mary Anderson doing this. Mary and Anderson. I got it. Can you

[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:35.390]
call me? Helio Jackson. Jesus. God almighty. Let's have our own fund razor and send Josh back to

[00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.510]
school. Okay. Why are you making them write all these names down? That's right. They're not going to

[00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:44.730]
get votes anyway. No, but my Haley Jackson is going to get a voter too. You don't think? I mean,

[00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:53.690]
she's no Jimmy Hendrix. The hell you can't. Oh, yeah.

[00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.830]
Oh.

[00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:06.250]
At least I was pleased that you knew who the hell Ben Harper was anyway. That was good. I must confess.

[00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.550]
I, you know, on course, what a hell of aino. I'm so out of touch with life. But I mean, Ben

[00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.290]
Harper is just great. Yeah. He's been around for a few years now. I'm disgusted. I can't find

[00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.690]
that CD. I must have landed a somewhere. Oh, Jesus Christ. Well, I really need you to come through.

[00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.490]
Thank God for suds. Yeah. Now, seriously, that movie. I don't want to say like it changed my life,

[00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:27.810]
but it was just so because I grew up with all that music and it's just so fantastic, so sensational.

[00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:33.510]
Damn it. All of these, all these fun brothers, these people that nobody ever heard of before.

[00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.650]
You know, gave them some recognition. Speaking of recognition, suds will be here tomorrow.

[00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.010]
Yeah. Just to back. So what does that have to do with me? I don't think you're tomorrow.

[00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.950]
What does that have to do with me? Nothing. I'm promoting the only thing that they're interested in.

[00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.750]
I don't care about you.

[00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:04.670]
I got the wrong disc in there. I don't want to play that, but that's okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60. We'll take

[00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.710]
a few calls and we'll get here. Bush Bungles did again. Federal government wasn't ready for Katrina.

[00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.070]
disaster experts say did the catastrophe really have to happen? The times picky in the New Orleans

[00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.770]
newspaper repeatedly raised federal spending issues. It didn't have to happen. All of these

[00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:23.890]
things and your media like you like we said, other busia hyperventilating, which is what they do

[00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:31.330]
best. WQA and hello. WQA and hello. Not there. I'll take one or two more and I'll get out with

[00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:36.650]
my agenda. WQA and hello. Neil. Yes sir. Is this Neil? Sounds like me. Yeah.

[00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:43.670]
All right. Neil listen. I just want to say I have that DVD. It is the most fantastic piece of work

[00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.490]
that you guys were hitting away. It's so many years and now that they've been broken

[00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:52.790]
alive just great. I just want to say that. That's really correct. Right. And the

[00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.430]
performance by Joe Knox born to that Jimmy Rubin. I want to come to the program.

[00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.210]
What is it? It broke in hearted. Yeah. It's dynamite dynamite.

[00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.010]
It's fantastic. I'm so glad that you're pushing this because it should have been pushed

[00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.390]
a year ago when it came out. Thank you for your time and a great day.

[00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.530]
Okay thanks a lot Polly. I'm pushing it. Aren't you pushing it?

[00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:14.530]
Every day.

[00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.030]
The

[00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:59.370]
ritual

[00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.790]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.510]
Won't be come,

[00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.210]
No, no, no, no,

[00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.770]
And I'm a huge man,

[00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.530]
Oh, don't, don't, don't,

[00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.250]
No, I'm a huge man,

[00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.230]
Now, be fun,

[00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.010]
I know I've got to come,

[00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:14.270]
Don't come,

[00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.230]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.410]
Hey, hey, hey,

[00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.990]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.190]

[00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.690]
No, no, no, no,

[00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.050]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.370]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.870]
I'm a huge man,

[00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.150]
Yeah, really,

[00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.690]
Honey, come, come,

[00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:03.330]
Here

[00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.170]
I walked this lat

[00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.370]
I'm a huge man,

[00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:09.050]
I have薪

[00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.470]
So time may be so big,

[00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.490]
We would have

[00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:14.750]
But time may become

[00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.110]
So time may be

[00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.150]
So time may come

[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.250]
Here is your poll for tomorrow,

[00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:23.910]
Who do you like better,

[00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.310]
Jon asked Bourner Jimmy Roughen

[00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:31.030]
I mean, just identical. Of course, you got the same musicians doing all the, you know,

[00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:37.170]
all the, all the right music, but it just, and she is good. She's great. And also Gerald

[00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.890]
Laverte, reach out and I'll be there. I did a great job. Thanks a lot, by the way, for

[00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:46.270]
us straight me out. I never heard of him either. You ever hear him? No. Gerald Laverte,

[00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.870]
right? You're a pervert. I'll be there.

[00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:16.930]
Just remember you took this. And your world's proudest woman down.

[00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:26.750]
Tell me! Come on, girl. We got for me. We got for you. See, we could be doing like our own

[00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.470]
time-life special here, you know? The first days the department was on top of things instead

[00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.870]
of running around spreading rumors like Troye, yeah. Oh, we wish he was. We wish he was

[00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:38.010]
wet spread. She was wet, you know. You're spreading it. That's what Serant told me he was

[00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.150]
spread that I can't tell you what but I don't ever less. Oh,

[00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.470]
anyway, she had this big scrap on deal. So Al Jolson, somebody

[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.970]
says the joke facts here. Don't put it on there. By the way,

[00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.370]
Josh, I'm going to say that real fast because no one, Josh,

[00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.110]
you would know Al Jolson from your mama. Who? Jimmy Wilson says he

[00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.250]
was black wasn't he? The face delipsed Manny. Manny, how I

[00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.230]
know? No, he was not black. He was Jewish. No, Sammy Davis,

[00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:04.610]
either. Frank says being that I like rock hard type rock music,

[00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.670]
there's only one black group actually in Jolson, two in that

[00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:10.230]
group is seven dust. You know seven dust? Yeah. Yeah. Really?

[00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.370]
I guess I'm out there left in the cold again being old and

[00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.890]
gray. Another black rock group was in living color, but they

[00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.490]
were very lame. It says well, as for Hendrix, he was a great

[00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.570]
solar guitarist, which is correct, but the sound of the use for

[00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.010]
his albums was horrible. Yeah, it was all distorted. Like,

[00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.470]
I don't know, like, like, what's that? What do you say? But they

[00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.450]
like that because that's why he's leaving our poll, Jimmy

[00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:35.870]
Hendrix, he the best. 45 votes, Ray Charles 38. Yeah, they're

[00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.670]
Neil Rogers. This is 516.

[00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:50.470]
This is the Neil Rogers show. This is your brain. Any

[00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.890]
questions?

[00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:05.050]
I went to Dalton's training camp. I asked Nick Sabin

[00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:13.770]
who will it be? Will it be AJ? Will it be sage? Here's what

[00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.010]
Dixit to me.

[00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:25.790]
God's for us, for us. Our starting to be will be. I think we'll

[00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:35.030]
have victory with the rock for us. Just you wait and see

[00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:45.010]
me. I saw an exhibition game watching him play was like a

[00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:53.970]
bad dream. I saw him from the drop of all it made me want to

[00:48:53.970 --> 00:49:03.790]
scream. God's for rock. He got what ever it is you need. Your

[00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:13.410]
offense has gone to sea with for us for right. He can't score to

[00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:26.370]
these. Just for right. For right. Media. If you play for

[00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:30.970]
right. You will be sorry.

[00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:38.610]
She can't help but you look outside. I didn't believe my

[00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:43.690]
mother called me. She said it's not you're going up now.

[00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.650]
Pretty soon you'll take a ride. And then she said.

[00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.730]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:15.830]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.910]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:18.610]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:48.590]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.610]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:34.070]
You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God. You can't be God.

[00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:04.050]
That is a great line. They only heal fast one period and they have no second string.

[00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:15.430]
The government was not prepared to script on storm spending and shifted its attention from dealing with natural disasters, defying the global war on terrorism.

[00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:22.450]
The disaster preparedness agency at the center of the Relief Effort is FEMA, which was developed by the new Department of Homeland Security.

[00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:29.870]
Let me take it back, which was developed by the new Department of Homeland Security with a new mission aimed at responding to the attacks of al-Qaeda.

[00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:40.550]
What you're seeing is revealing weaknesses in the state, local and federal levels at Eric Tilbert, who until February was FEMA's disaster response chief, all three levels have been weakened. They've been weakened by that version into terrorism.

[00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:55.890]
You know all those terrorist attacks we've suffered here? That's right. After 9-11, an interview yesterday, a civil man and women who've led relief efforts for dozens of fellow hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes over the years, chastised the current disaster leaders for forgiving these simple Boy Scott motto, Be Prepared.

[00:52:55.890 --> 00:53:03.450]
Bush administration officials say they're proud of their efforts. Their first efforts emphasized rooftop rescues over providing food and water for the victims already safe.

[00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:09.770]
We're extremely pleased. Get them off the roof and let them starve to death and fry in the sun and die from heat stroke.

[00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:15.610]
We're extremely pleased with the response of every element of the federal government and all our federal partners have made a terrible strategy.

[00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:23.310]
A Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Trudeau, said during a news conference once in Washington and wanting to speak to a lot of people including me, we're throwing up.

[00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:29.930]
The agency has more than 1700 truckloads of water, meals, tents, generators, others, supplies ready to go. He said, ready to go.

[00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:35.890]
Federal health officials have started setting up at least 40 medical shoulders. The Coast Guard reports rescuing more than 1200 people.

[00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:45.670]
But residents, especially in Baloxie, Mississippi, said they're not seeing the promised help. And night-rider reporters along the Gulf Coast said they saw little visible federal relief efforts other than search and rescue teams.

[00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.830]
Some health started arriving Wednesday by the truckloads, but not everywhere.

[00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:58.350]
We're not getting any help yet, said the Baloxie Fire Department Patent and Chief Joe Boni. We need water. We need ice. I've been told it's coming, but we've got people in shoulders. We haven't had drinks since the storm.

[00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:08.650]
The slow response to Katrina and poor federal leadership is a replay of 1992's Miss Handling of Hurricane Andrew, said former FEMA Chief of Staff, Jane Bollock, a 22-year veteran of the agency.

[00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:17.170]
Bollock blamed inexperienced federal leadership. She noted that Trudeau and FEMA director Michael Brown had no disaster experience before they were pointed to their jobs.

[00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:25.450]
The slowness is all too familiar to Kate Hale, as Mami's disaster chief during Hurricane Andrew, Hale asked, where the hell's the cavalry?

[00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:32.230]
I'm looking at people who are begging for ice and water and a presence Hale, said yesterday. I'm seeing the same sort of thing that horrified us after Andrew.

[00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:37.670]
I realized it got a huge job. Nobody understands better than I do what they're trying to respond to, but it ain't getting done.

[00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:46.830]
Vulget cuts have made disaster preparedness any easier. Last year, FEMA spent $250,000 to conduct an ATA hurricane drill for a mock killer storm hitting New Orleans.

[00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:56.510]
Some 250 emergency officials attended. Many of these scenarios now playing out, including a helicopter in evacuation of the Superdome, were discussed in a drill for that fictional storm named Pam.

[00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:04.910]
This year, the group was to design a plan to fix such unresolved problems as evacuating sick and injured people from the Superdome and housing tens of thousands of stranded citizens.

[00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:12.430]
Funding for that plan was cut, said Tolber, the former FEMA disaster response director. A lot of good was done, but it just wasn't finished, he said.

[00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:19.050]
He was the disaster chief of the state of North Carolina. I don't know if it would have saved more lives, it would have made the response faster. You might say it could have saved lives.

[00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:31.190]
FEMA wasn't alone in cutting hurricanes, spending into New Orleans in the surrounding area. Federal flood control spending for Southeast and Louisiana has been chopped from $69 million in 2001 to 36 and a half million this year, according to budget documents.

[00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:40.270]
Federal hurricane protection for the Lake Potschentrain vicinity in the Army Corps of Engineers budget dropped from 14.2 million in 2002 through only 5.7 million this year.

[00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:47.270]
Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landry requested 27 million this year. She got 5.7 million. 22 million short, still short.

[00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:57.850]
And now this was a couple of days ago this article. So I'm not going to like try to change it around. So obviously it's already dated, but that's not the important part of it.

[00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:06.310]
Even though hurricane Katrina moved well north of the city, the waters still keep rising in New Orleans late Tuesday. Luckily, thank goodness they've stopped doing that. They're starting to receive a little bit.

[00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:17.210]
That's because Lake Potschentrain continued to pour through a two block long break in the main levee near the city, 17th Street Canal, with much of the crescent city, some 10 feet below sea level, the rising tide may not stop until it's leveled the massive lake.

[00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:29.210]
New Orleans had long known it was highly vulnerable to flooding on a direct hit from a hurricane. In fact, the federal government has been working with state and local officials in the region since the late 1960s on major hurricane and flood relief efforts.

[00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:37.710]
When flooding from a massive rainstorm in May of 95 killed six people, Congress authorized the South East Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project or SEALA.

[00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:55.890]
Over the next 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers tasked with carrying out SEALA spent $430 million on insuring up levees and building pumping stations with 50 million in local aid, but at least $250 million in crucial projects remained, even as hurricane activity, the Atlantic Basin increased dramatically, and the levee surrounding New Orleans continues to sigh.

[00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:01.990]
I'm getting sure to talk about it. And after 2003, the flow of federal dollars towards SEALA dropped to a trickle.

[00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:11.830]
The Corps never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq, as well as homeland security, coming at the same time as federal tax cuts for the rich, was the reason for the strain.

[00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:22.210]
At least nine articles in the Times-Pikio newspaper in New Orleans, and from 2004 and 2005, specifically cite cost of Iraq as a reason for the lack of hurricane and flood control dollars.

[00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:28.730]
New House News Services, an article posted late Tuesday night at the Times-Pikio and Webstar reported, no one can say they didn't see it coming.

[00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:34.310]
Now in the wake of one of the worst-terms ever serious questions are being asked about the leak, about the lack of preparation.

[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:46.410]
Good job, and again, there's another reason for the war in Iraq. It's just a disaster. The word impeachment keeps spinning around, speaking of the spinners, spinning around in my mind. Why is it taking so long?

[00:57:46.410 --> 00:58:05.370]
Why is the media continuing to suck up? Can you explain it to me? The corporate opinion? Absolutely, unacceptable, unbelievable, tragic. Thousands of dead people, the final tool in this summer freight is going to make the people who died in the 3,911, pale into one significance. Thousands of people. You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:23.690]
Because under all of them, they keep showing these aerial shots, all the houses that are collapsed and just the piles of wood and brick and whatever. And there's bodies all over the place. Plus the ones that are floating by in the water, they said that they had to push the bodies back with sticks. You following this? Yeah, the group are the poles.

[00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:31.530]
1113, they're white, but when we do the white pole, let's do one on white people. Ever do white pole?

[00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:45.610]
308, they're all often. 318 votes. Jimmy Hendrix 53, Ray Charles 44, Bob Marley-Mon 28, Bob Marley. Temptations 22 and 19, cool 19. The result of the pole are making me want to caca all over the place. I just can't deal with it.

[00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:15.590]
Meal. Peter Jennings, what a life. Oh, I mean, tremendous. What a cause.

[00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:19.110]
I don't know any dead celebrity joke. No, ma'am, and if I did, I wouldn't say so.

[00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:36.850]
Baldwin City, Kansas. Hello. Yeah, Peter, are the rumors true? Is hell really a couple degree cooler than the center of a McDonald's apple pie? I think the answer is yes. But you've asked a question that a lot of people in the country are going to ask today.

[00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:50.610]
Summer said Kentucky for Peter Jennings. Hello. Hi, gentlemen. Hi, Mr. Jennings. Is there a lead on music and a hell? Yes, it just happens. It goes on and on and on for hour and hour and hour after.

[00:59:50.930 --> 01:00:00.510]
Oh, my. I think that would make my ears bleed. Oh, many do indeed. One more call we have on the left. Downers grow the linoid. Hello, Mr. Jennings. What would you like for Christmas?

[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:17.890]
I would like to have a little bit of Christmas. I would like to have a little bit of Christmas.

[01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:30.490]
I would like to have a little bit of Christmas. I would like to have a little bit of Christmas. I would like to have a little bit of Christmas.

[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:45.870]
I would like to have a little bit of Christmas. I would like to have a little bit of Christmas. I would like to have a little bit of Christmas.

[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.690]
My million Tiara's baby milk because we don't have Christmas stock.

[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:55.710]
Our baby is certainly on there, too.

[01:00:55.710 --> 01:01:01.330]
Why is there a thousand or more of him?

[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.950]
I'm taking it one thing, I leave my stuff as he would know Jimmy Hendrix, you know that?

[01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:10.470]
No.

[01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:15.710]
20 after 11 to 5, 60 WQAM, maybe you take a call or two.

[01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:17.110]
WQAM, hello?

[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.070]
Hey, Neil.

[01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.690]
Yes sir.

[01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:22.050]
I've got one from your poll and he's from Australia, New York.

[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.730]
Ronnie James D.L.

[01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.310]
Here's the fact that this is Ben.

[01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:34.490]
I'm going to get a heart for his murder, which I saw this when I looked him up on the line.

[01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.990]
Spotted, I forgot to mention it.

[01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:38.150]
Thank you for reminding me, married to Laura Durn.

[01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.870]
Okay.

[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:39.630]
Did you know that?

[01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:40.230]
No, I did not.

[01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:43.350]
See, look at the education we're getting on this show.

[01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.530]
Who says it's not an educational show, huh?

[01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:46.050]
Right?

[01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:47.110]
That's right.

[01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:47.730]
Even he agrees.

[01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.350]
Don't forget the mole man, too.

[01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.150]
Try to forgive it.

[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:51.090]
First is September.

[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:51.870]
Can you believe that?

[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:53.870]
Boy, one more week of this game and then we're back to the regular.

[01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.950]
All our choice is, you know, wasn't he was just stirring up rumors about the sales manager

[01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:58.890]
getting canned or something?

[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.630]
Also, it says here, listen, I'm going to fix his ass.

[01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.930]
You think Jesus was bad on that cross at a tough time.

[01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:08.210]
You just wait, Troy, pull that crap with us.

[01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:12.290]
And then he comes in bitching me out for not hyping the storm enough.

[01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.230]
I'm supposed to know.

[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.230]
I'm supposed to be the meteorologist, you know?

[01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:19.850]
Gerald DeVert recently toured with his father, O.J.'s lead singer, Eddie LaVert.

[01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.530]
I don't even like that, where I was with Pervert.

[01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:22.110]
LaVert.

[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.430]
I would have said LaVert.

[01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:24.490]
Thanks a lot, Duff.

[01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:25.970]
Hey, Duff, did something constructive today?

[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:26.690]
You're fairy.

[01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:31.310]
Also, it says I like Bootsy Collins's comic rendition of the Motown Sound Like Cool Jure.

[01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:32.730]
Yeah, Bootsy Collins was great on there.

[01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.570]
Isn't that on the, oh no, don't tell me it's not on here on the CD?

[01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:37.370]
Damn it.

[01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.990]
Oh yeah, it is.

[01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.970]
The problem is I don't have the CD in the thing.

[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.070]
Well, we'll wait.

[01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:46.270]
No, but all of these because you've got all the same people playing all the same instruments.

[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.470]
You've got, you know, and all the same backup singers too, by the way.

[01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.770]
Well, I would see, I'd talk more intelligently with you about it when you ain't seen the yet.

[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:54.310]
Right.

[01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:54.590]
I will.

[01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.870]
Oh!

[01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:03.430]
That's kind of like a song about twice grand, for at least the last part of that Cool Jure.

[01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:07.390]
You're not too full of trouble, you're really up.

[01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:37.950]
Oh, by the way, Bootsy, nice outfit too.

[01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.090]
It says, you may want to get the Motown 25th anniversary CD, you said, I have it right here

[01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:45.110]
as a matter of fact, it's got commentary and interviews, but I don't want to board the

[01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:45.750]
audience with that.

[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.270]
They're probably already peeled enough that I'm playing some of this music.

[01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:49.410]
Too bad, okay?

[01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.290]
Too stinking, freaking bad.

[01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.030]
You can't talk about ball games all day, every day.

[01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.310]
Well, we'll say that for George tomorrow.

[01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:55.990]
That's right.

[01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:59.810]
It says, you want to try the DVD dramas, the temptations and the five heartbeats, you see

[01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:00.030]
those?

[01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:00.350]
No.

[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.150]
Nor did I.

[01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.390]
Before Motown, very Gordy wrote songs for Jackie Wilson, it says.

[01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.430]
Jackie Wilson, who that?

[01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.130]
Is he still there?

[01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.590]
Poor Jackie, he had some tough times.

[01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.470]
I just looked at a poll, Jackie Wilson has one vote.

[01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.130]
You know, there's something wrong.

[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:53.750]
There's something in the drinking water.

[01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:58.150]
Maybe it's still left over from that storm from the Katrina.

[01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:02.510]
See, you take Katrina what it did in Florida, even in Bayed County, and then you multiply

[01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:06.110]
times 500 and then you've got what it did in the Nullings and Bootsy and Delphore.

[01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.430]
One vote for Jackie Wilson.

[01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.250]
I mean, he's no getting a Henry, so I'll get it then.

[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:19.230]
Jackie Wilson, my heart is fine.

[01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.670]
No, no, no, no.

[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.650]
My bill is fine or short.

[01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:30.590]
Of course the problem being just like our buddy Josh didn't there.

[01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.990]
He wouldn't know Jackie Wilson from Brian Wilson.

[01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:34.610]
Am I right?

[01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:34.730]
Am I right?

[01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.910]
I'm not.

[01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.770]
Yeah, or Craig Wilson.

[01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.590]
Right.

[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.610]
Or Mr. Wilson.

[01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:40.590]
Or Wilson Phillips.

[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.810]
Or Wilson Pickett.

[01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.030]
Ever seen Wilson Pickett?

[01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.630]
All the time.

[01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:44.850]
You've seen Moe Pickett.

[01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:45.730]
Yes, do do do do do.

[01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:50.150]
He true and also have lots of non-Motown acts like Eurethra Franklin, MC5, Bob Seger, Ted

[01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:54.130]
Nugent, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Kid Rock M&M, Bob James, Anita Baker and The Winons.

[01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:56.670]
It's, let's see.

[01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.990]
He goes, this tune in, can you repeat the name of the movie you're talking about?

[01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.110]
Low-town rocks, rap sucks.

[01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:00.530]
Amen.

[01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:01.190]
Absolutely.

[01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:02.450]
Correct.

[01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.590]
Correct.

[01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.730]
Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the name of the movie.

[01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:06.550]
It's on DVD.

[01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:09.490]
It's on your BVDs and you can also get the soundtrack.

[01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:12.810]
And the soundtrack is called Standing in the Shadows of Motown.

[01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.470]
What a concert.

[01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:15.170]
Let's see.

[01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:16.130]
We got also two packs.

[01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.570]
There's a lot.

[01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:17.630]
Al Green on there.

[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:18.190]
Why not?

[01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:19.190]
Al Green's okay.

[01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:20.350]
I certainly wouldn't say is the fact.

[01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.310]
Like record, huh?

[01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:22.050]
Two packs.

[01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:23.210]
Two packs.

[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:24.310]
A two pack, the honor.

[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:25.330]
How's two pack doing?

[01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:25.970]
You got a voter too?

[01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.770]
In fact, if two packs got more votes than Jackie Wilson, I'm going to, he's got three.

[01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:30.910]
Jackie Wilson's got one.

[01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:32.310]
Oh, man.

[01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:33.910]
It makes my heart bleed.

[01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.390]
Holy moly, rat man.

[01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:38.610]
But Al Green deserves to be on there.

[01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.630]
Oh, he's no Bob Green.

[01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:40.230]
No.

[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.930]
Thank God.

[01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:41.830]
Hey, man.

[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.190]
How come you're so torpy, man?

[01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:45.350]
26 past 11 at 5.

[01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:45.690]
60.

[01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.550]
I wonder how your old friends over there, I would do.

[01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.810]
You hear from any of those people anymore?

[01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.470]
Are your good, high signs, your good buddies?

[01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:51.490]
Oh, everyone's in love.

[01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:52.450]
Greg Fadek.

[01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:53.990]
We hear him on the commercials.

[01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.430]
Cheryl Riftkin, Mike Disney.

[01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:56.470]
He was always fond of you.

[01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:57.890]
Riding the mic at the bar.

[01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.010]
While back at work.

[01:06:59.010 --> 01:06:59.570]
But how unusual.

[01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:01.050]
Mike Disney at a bar.

[01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.410]
What a concept.

[01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.930]
Was his nose still glowing?

[01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:06.990]
27 past 11 at 5.

[01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.350]
60.

[01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.170]
It's one thing you have to power over when I went out at IOD.

[01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:12.150]
We always used his nose as kind of like a flashlight.

It's endousy that soldiers got boy

[01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:16.270]
It's endousy and I might get shot

[01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:19.290]
She's here W. Mokanshan

[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.590]
You can't go so to my girl

[01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:28.670]
You never, never do this before

[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.170]
I'm so here, you never, never do this

[01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.690]
Why do you go so to my baby boy

[01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:36.130]
I'm not a cop, I'm a cop, I hate you

[01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.950]
I'm not a cop, I'm a cop, I'm a cop, I hate you

[01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:42.210]
I'm not a cop, I'm a cop, I hate you

[01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:45.050]
I'm not a cop, I hate you

[01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:48.150]
I hate you, I hate you

[01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:51.410]
I have this kind of like a new technique I use mentally

[01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:53.230]
And it is that any time I hear a song like that

[01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:56.910]
I just tune out the part of my mind that will recognize Michael Jackson

[01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:58.770]
The singing line makes life a lot easier

[01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:01.470]
Well what I do is that wasn't the Michael Jackson that we hate

[01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:03.090]
That was the different Michael Jackson

[01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:05.150]
Before he was a little kid who we liked a lot

[01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.370]
Nice fine, that was before we started molesting little boys

[01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.010]
And stuff like that, different person

[01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:10.530]
Anyways black, that's right

[01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:10.650]
That's right, that's right, that's right

[01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.190]
I was actually black, a good point Josh

[01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:14.030]
Leave it to Josh to come up with it

[01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:15.550]
By the way, how's the tickets coming?

[01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.370]
Or the cash, remember man

[01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.130]
No, it's a good thing that you brought that up

[01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:25.350]
Because knowing this out that they'd like to kind of slide right on by with that whole deal

[01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:28.330]
And they have either cough up the tickets or give me the cash

[01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.390]
Which at this point in my life, I'll take the cash

[01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.970]
Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting the tickets and giving to you

[01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.530]
But how come they don't have any

[01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:37.110]
Just because we're not the fag ships they stay standing more is that it?

[01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:40.250]
I guess I said something but I figured maybe if you

[01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.470]
You may just think about it maybe somebody would tell me

[01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:44.090]
Well I'm gonna make a stink about it all right

[01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.090]
Because it's part of the deal you know it's like getting paid

[01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:48.130]
It's the same thing, it's part of the deal

[01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:50.430]
And I realize that Greg Reed when he makes a deal

[01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.250]
You can just wipe your ass with it

[01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:55.930]
But at the bottom of my hand you always have to like go through a song and dance to get what you have coming

[01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.610]
But that's just the way it goes with it, it's the beastly effing way

[01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:01.150]
Come on Ray Perry cough up some tickets okay

[01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.610]
And since Josh is the one who's gonna get it he didn't care where to

[01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.330]
I'm just kind of surprised that you can't sit up in a press box

[01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:07.830]
Being the Marlon Hot Shot that you are

[01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.050]
Having all the contacts in the stadium that you got

[01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:14.430]
And I say that sarcastically knowing what a hard ass organization the dolphins are

[01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:18.390]
I mean I could go up there for like you know a game if I guess if I wanted to

[01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:20.810]
Yeah but I need to see that

[01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:22.810]
And let me ask you this what about the QAM box

[01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:24.150]
What about a sky box

[01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:26.610]
Yeah and what I told you

[01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:27.950]
I'm gonna be like trying to blind

[01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:29.830]
For sales people

[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:31.570]
I mean being a client that goes

[01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:34.210]
Sales people you mean like Troy Stratford just like that

[01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.510]
I'm gonna tell you if anybody runs into Troy Stratford

[01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:38.230]
Okay just run into him harder

[01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:40.930]
I mean he just really this one

[01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:44.590]
When he pulled this morning was absolutely positively unacceptable

[01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:47.670]
And in fact I think he ought to come in and spill the beans on the air

[01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.370]
About the sales manager getting canned

[01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:52.790]
Anyway here's a fact that says he probably won't get any votes beside mine

[01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:55.490]
But Nina Simone was in his fantastic and you're right

[01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:56.970]
Hope Nina Simone

[01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:00.030]
Don't you know Simone she's the lesbian on the passions

[01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:04.650]
She's the lesbian daughter Whitney sister you know Whitney the nun

[01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.130]
No

[01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.710]
Sooner man recently part of the musical school in study

[01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:09.830]
They're also the remake of Thomas Crown Affair

[01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:11.270]
She is those

[01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:12.390]
Anyway Nina Simone

[01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.030]
Can you handle it Josh

[01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:17.430]
Yes I am O.N.E

[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:21.610]
Look at this facts my god from Alfred

[01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:23.590]
Oh and Baton Rouge so it might be worth a read

[01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:26.230]
It says we're doing relatively well here in Baton Rouge

[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:27.630]
Well they didn't get much

[01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:31.190]
We're very lucky not to have received as much damage as New Orleans and it's around here

[01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:34.850]
Is Baton Rouge has become a temporary housing center for many of these displaced people

[01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:38.330]
The hotels are full and we have so many people living out of their cars and parking lots

[01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.930]
Of places such as Walmart, Loads

[01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:41.470]
Or any other large parking lot

[01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:44.110]
I work with the Department of Environmental Quality is a paralegal

[01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:48.430]
And we've been using our conference rooms for temporary housing for displaced employees

[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.670]
Of state and federal agencies

[01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:52.370]
Many people here in Baton Rouge are still without power

[01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.830]
Many streets are still living with down power lines and trees

[01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:58.390]
Some of the rural communities on the outskirts of Baton Rouge are dealing with flooding

[01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:00.050]
And thus unable to get out food and water

[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:05.530]
Etc. But for the most part the people of Baton Rouge were very lucky and you shouldn't have any complaints about Nutton

[01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.210]
Ironically I moved from West Palm Beach to Baton Rouge

[01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:11.070]
Last October after dealing with Hurricane Jean and Ivan

[01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:14.890]
Oh maybe that's what that maybe effort maybe their hurricanes are following him around

[01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.830]
Huh let's be good keep going moving up

[01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:20.550]
My wife is to blame for the move and now I'm thinking I should divorce her ass

[01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:23.490]
I love your show with the speakers here in the Legal Affairs Division

[01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:26.150]
I have it on and so we need to hire you at your best

[01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:27.590]
What does that mean?

[01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.970]
I have your show on over the speakers here in the Legal Affairs Division

[01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.630]
So we need to hear you at your best

[01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:34.810]
How about it my like mediocre okay

[01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.970]
I mean he's got a way this is a Republican country

[01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:38.930]
And so Rip Bush and Ask every chance you get

[01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:42.250]
Maybe these Yahoo's will begin to realize they were sold a bill of goods by that clown

[01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.750]
The dangerous clown

[01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.970]
The only clown even close to being that dangerous was John Wayne Gacy

[01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:50.550]
Only Bush is responsible for the deaths of a hell of a lot more people than that queen

[01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:54.670]
And lastly check out the article by the legendary John Dean by way of reminder

[01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:59.050]
Yeah we know who John Dean the article was too long to fax but is a must for you and your audience

[01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.350]
Well I hate to break the news to you every it was on our website a couple of days ago

[01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:07.790]
In fact I read it on the year was I read part of it was Pat Robertson's call for assassination before and later a crime

[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:09.470]
Remember I read that? I do

[01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:13.150]

So good it's kind of scary even better than Marvin Gaye

[01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.110]
I think you don't think?

[01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:58.610]
I think and that's for a question of like Marvin Gaye anyway because you don't like his name

[01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:02.950]
Gay that's it that's why every time we do that thing about Marvin Gaye and the Beach Boys you go into this

[01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:06.370]
And nobody likes the Beach Boys and I think of all the love the Beach Boys make

[01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:08.330]
I make your pardon of all the comparisons

[01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.930]
What?

[01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:12.270]
Like what do they have to do with each other it's like comparing it out to other people

[01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:16.550]
I said that Marvin Gaye was a much more influential and much greater talent

[01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:18.750]
And I'm giving a soul some of the names about the Beach Boys

[01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:22.610]
He was going saying he was good but the Beach Boys were like that

[01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.410]
He was saying lollipop, lollipop

[01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:27.870]
He was saying fly, not artistic, groundbreaking, wonderful stuff

[01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:29.110]

[01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:24.430]
Earlier, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry reiterated Chavez offered to send fuel on humanitarian aid to the U.S

[01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:30.250]
However, U.S. State Department's spokesman, Sean McCormick said he was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:36.170]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:36.190]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:37.390]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:38.990]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:40.450]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:41.730]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:44.030]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:45.870]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:47.030]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.650]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.730]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:52.130]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:55.090]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:25:55.090 --> 01:26:00.030]
He was not aware of any such offers of aid or order

[01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.210]
I'm going to lock myself in the bathroom and slip my wrist

[01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:03.530]
Do you believe it? No. No.

[01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.470]
And of course, overshadowed by all of this

[01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:07.950]
And of course, overshadowed by all of this and see they looked out again

[01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:10.090]
I mean, it's a horrible way to look at it

[01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:11.670]
But it's just the way the administration

[01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:13.950]
No matter what kind of crap is going on

[01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:17.390]
That they ought to respond to. And of course, they are also responsible for the horrible

[01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.430]
Lack of preparedness and response on this thing

[01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:25.270]
But overshadowed was the n141 dead in the Baghdad stampede

[01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:29.630]
Plus 323 injured. Did you see any of the tape on this?

[01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:32.550]
Yes. All the bodies, including tons of women and little kids,

[01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:35.450]
And they just had sheets and people are going around looking under the sheets

[01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:38.090]
Identified the bodies. Going from one body to another

[01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.670]
That sounded steadily in northeast Baghdad

[01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:43.330]
After a massive midday Shi'at religious procession yesterday

[01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:45.310]
erupted into a chaotic stampede

[01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:49.030]
Causing the drowning and trampling deaths of 841 pilgrims

[01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:52.990]
Authorities believe a rumor raced through the crowd that a suicide bomber was in their midst

[01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.110]
That created panic among the waves of pedestrians

[01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.650]
Trying to cross the bridge over the Tigris River

[01:26:57.650 --> 01:27:02.450]
The throngs of Shi'at faithful had been stopped by security checks and bogged down by concrete barriers

[01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:09.230]
Three hours earlier an insurgent mortar attack near the Kha'adamiya Mosk killed seven people in the 36 others

[01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:11.030]
None of this would have happened

[01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:13.390]
All of those people would be alive in one piece today

[01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:17.790]
Or it not for this wonderful glorious air racketack based on a bunch of lies

[01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:20.830]
Based on the PENAC notion that they were going to go in

[01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:24.750]
And it posed democracy where would a heli felt like it or at least their brand of it

[01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:27.470]
Certainly enough for democracy that we remember in the USA

[01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.310]
He won't see that in no mo

[01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.170]
No mo

[01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:33.350]
Don't forget mo some mo is better than no mo

[01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:36.130]
We got Howard David of the two jim and did I say mo Howard David?

[01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:38.490]
Mad Dog at 4 hurricane hotline at 7

[01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.410]
The beast at 9 puts in a one of his rare appearances

[01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:42.990]
Thank God and Ed Kaplan at 10

[01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.930]
Ancient Eddie

[01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:46.830]
Paul Craig Roberts on anti-war dot com writes

[01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:48.150]
How New Orleans was lost

[01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:52.110]
He says chalk up the city of New Orleans as a cost of bushes of rack war

[01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:56.330]
There weren't enough helicopters to repair the breached levees in rescue people trapped by rising water

[01:27:56.330 --> 01:28:01.070]
Nor are there enough Louisiana national guardsman available to help with the rescue where it hurts into patrol against the looting

[01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:02.790]
The situation is the same in Mississippi

[01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:06.130]
The National Garden helicopters are off on a fools mission in a rack

[01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:11.270]
The National Guard is in a rack because fanatic on the Ocons and the Bush administration were determined to invade the Middle East

[01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:15.790]
And because incompetent secretary of defense of Rumsfeld refused to listen to the generals who ruled them

[01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.910]
There were enough regular troops available to do the job

[01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:21.230]
After the invasion the arrogant Rumsfeld found out the generals were right

[01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:24.570]
The National Guard was called up to fill in the gaping gaps

[01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:28.910]
Now the guardsmen trapped in the Iraqi quagmire were watching on TV the families they left behind

[01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:32.670]
Trap by rising waters and wondering if the floating bodies might be family members

[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:37.590]
None know where their dislocated families are but shades of fallujah they do see their destroyed homes

[01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:42.730]
The mayor of New Orleans was counting on helicopters to put in place massive sandbags to repair the levee

[01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:46.170]
However someone called the few helicopters to rescue people from rooftops

[01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:50.730]
The rising water overwhelmed the massive pumping stations and New Orleans disappeared under deep water

[01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:56.370]
What a terrible casualty of the Iraqi war one of our oldest and most beautiful cities a famous city a historic city

[01:28:56.370 --> 01:29:03.290]
Distracted by its phony war on terrorism the US government had made no preparations in the event hurricane Katrina brought catastrophe to New Orleans

[01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:11.590]
No contingency plan existed only now after disaster our FEMA and the Corps of Engineers tried to assemble the materials and equipment to save New Orleans from the fate of Atlantis

[01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:17.150]
Even worse articles in the New Orleans times pick you in other public statements by emergency management chiefs in New Orleans

[01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:21.510]
Make it clear that the Bush administration slashed the funding for the Corps of Engineers projects

[01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:25.170]
Distracted and raised the New Orleans levees and diverted the money to the war in Iraq

[01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:29.770]
Walter Mastry no relation to Jodermace to use to play shirt shop for Kansas City

[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:34.330]
Walter Mastry emergency management chief or Jeffers and parish told the New Orleans Times pick you in

[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:38.810]
It appears that the money has been moved in the president's budget to handle homeland security in the war in Iraq

[01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:47.730]
And I suppose that's the price we pay nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished and we're doing everything we can to make that the case that this is a security issue for us

[01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:51.750]
Why can't the US government focus on America's needs and leave other countries alone?

[01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:56.210]
Why are American troops in Iraq instead of protecting our own borders from a mass invasion by illegal immigrants?

[01:29:56.550 --> 01:30:00.810]
Why are American helicopters blowing up Iraqi homes instead of saving American homes in New Orleans?

[01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:08.670]
How can the Bush administration be so incompetent as to expose Americans at home to dire risks by exhausting American resources and foolish foreign adventures?

[01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:10.490]
What kind of homeland security is this?

[01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:15.890]
All bushes achieved by invading Iraq is to kill and wound thousands of people while destroying America's reputation

[01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:22.290]
The only beneficiaries are oil companies capitalizing on a good excuse to jack up the price of gas and Osama Bin Laden's recruitment

[01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:27.750]
What we have is a Republican war for oil company profits while New Orleans sinks beneath the waters

[01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:34.630]
This is Neil Rogeris. This is 5.69 am

[01:30:36.190 --> 01:30:40.730]
This is Coach Don Juler and I sound like Bob Hope on acid

[01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:44.750]
And I want to tell you it's the 12th of one hour or whatever it is

[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:47.530]
What now?

[01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:49.230]
I want to check out my words

[01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:54.190]
Mr. Seismore, I heard you're in a porn flick. That's not just a rumor, is it?

[01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:55.910]
No, I wish I hadn't done it

[01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:56.930]
Really? How come?

[01:30:57.250 --> 01:30:58.870]
I couldn't believe what was happening to me

[01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:59.710]
Can we watch it?

[01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:00.530]
It's a disease

[01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:01.150]
Great

[01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:06.430]
Oh, oh no, oh no, oh no

[01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:07.630]
Explosive action

[01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:09.090]
What we have thinking

[01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:10.610]
I only did these things

[01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:14.010]
I didn't want my parents to be disappointed at me

[01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:17.470]
There are many times I've been seen

[01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:20.090]
What you come along and see

[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:24.310]
Here's the golden blanket from the WQM

[01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:26.410]
Right now

[01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:29.990]
You fell

[01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.830]
Oh

[01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:42.910]
She's a very good girl

[01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:46.770]
But times you don't make up to my bias

[01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:50.610]
She will never let your spirits down

[01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:54.730]
Once you get all the streets out of town

[01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:57.130]
She like the boys and the band

[01:31:57.130 --> 01:31:58.530]
I rip down her baby

[01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:01.450]
She's the only old and very fresh

[01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.410]
When I make my move to her room

[01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:05.790]
That's the right time

[01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:07.810]
Please never hide please

[01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:09.990]
So what they did to Royce A, our sales manager was leaving

[01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:12.730]
It's a 12.03.05.60 WQM

[01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:14.030]
Happy a Thursday

[01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:16.010]
Here's September the 1st can you believe it?

[01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.590]
I believe it

[01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:19.630]
The 1st of September, I mean it, is really shocking

[01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:21.530]
The way this, I know it's easy to say

[01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:23.370]
It sounds corny in the trite

[01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:24.110]
All of that crap

[01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:25.790]
Tempest fugitive

[01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:26.850]
What did I say Tempest?

[01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:27.030]
What?

[01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:28.750]
420

[01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:30.630]
Oh man

[01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:32.010]
Did you know that she had a fake

[01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:36.110]
426 votes and our goal is 427

[01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.870]
The 2P

[01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:38.090]
So we got a shot

[01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:39.350]
Yeah, it was a 2P

[01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:43.650]
426 approval rating falls to a new low

[01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:44.050]
Oh right

[01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:45.370]
There is a little bit of hope here

[01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.290]
And maybe the incompetence in the fact

[01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:49.970]
Maybe this is going to, there'll be out of this grotesque

[01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:51.290]
I know it in another trite cliche

[01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:53.630]
You know out of the horror and the suffering into the disaster

[01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.370]
We can find a little silver lining in the middle of all this crap

[01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.150]
And maybe there is in the middle of all that water

[01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:01.270]
Of all those horrible things and bodies and of the things floating around

[01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:03.250]
Find something good at silver lining

[01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.090]
That is that it shines a big fat spotlight

[01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:08.730]
Like the article I just got through reading about the

[01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:13.010]
Disassure that this Iraq attack has caused in so many other areas

[01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:16.350]
And thank you again Mr. President for those bargain basement gas prices

[01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:18.630]
Over six bucks a gallon for regular in Atlanta

[01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:19.990]
Thank you so much

[01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:23.530]
How could we have ever survived without these people stealing two elections?

[01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:27.510]
Although we better not say that because some of you might wind up in jail just for hearing me say that

[01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:33.170]
Rising gas prices and ongoing bloodshed in Iraq continue to take their tool on ill President Day

[01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:36.130]
Who's standing with the public as sunk to an all-time low

[01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.170]
According to the latest Washington Post ABC news poll

[01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:46.050]
The survey found Bush's job of overriding at 45% down seven points since January

[01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:49.770]
And the lowest ever recorded for this president and post ABC surveys

[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:54.410]
53% disapproved of the job that Bush is doing the Bushmeister

[01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:59.410]
And you can see some reading you can see the smirking chimp in drag in there on our website

[01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:04.330]
Like a whole bunch of Bush monkey pictures and underneath it a great video clip

[01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:05.390]
Did you watch that?

[01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:06.270]
Did I watch it?

[01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:07.630]
A kid that's how it went up on there

[01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:09.310]
Thanks to whoever sent those by the way

[01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.530]
There's good stuff on there

[01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:11.610]
You get a chocolate or two

[01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:14.790]
I don't know if you'll laugh at your cry it's one of the things you know about a laugh or cry

[01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:17.710]
It's kind of like when trust record comes in you don't know the laugh or cry

[01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:19.190]
Or give a good gushry

[01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:22.470]
The war has been a real drag on Bush's presidency for many months

[01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:25.690]
But his Iraq approval ratings in the new poll were a little changed from two months ago

[01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:28.950]
Despite widespread violence, a rash of US casualties

[01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:35.010]
Anti-war protests outside the president's Texas range and growing debate about reducing US troop levels

[01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:40.570]
What may have pushed Bush's overall ratings down and the latest poll is pervasive to satisfaction over soaring

[01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:44.550]
Gasoline prices but thank you so much for those low gas prices Mr. President

[01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:49.170]
Two-thirds of those surveys said gas prices are causing financial hardship to them or their families

[01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:52.070]
Gas prices stand to go even higher after the hurricane

[01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:57.730]
More ominously for the president six out of ten Americans said there are steps the administration could take to reduce gas prices

[01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:03.030]
Slightly more than a third say that run up has been due to factors beyond the administration's control

[01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:06.010]
But two-thirds over 60 percent say uh-uh

[01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:11.010]
I supported him last year said Gina Coleman 29 a homemaker living in Camden County, New Jersey

[01:35:11.010 --> 01:35:12.250]
That's bad news for her

[01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:13.690]
I wouldn't vote for him again

[01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:18.430]
It's gas prices the war just the way he's been handling things the rising gas is something that's been happening for a long time

[01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:21.710]
And the prices are getting worse this makes me feel more negative about him

[01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:27.050]
Definitely Bush also received negative marks for his handling of immigration the economy and social security

[01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:33.150]
The majority of Americans supported the handling of kids campaign against terrorism against those terrorists

[01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:36.750]
We know who the hell they are and we're doing my hell of a great job capturing the important ones

[01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:42.070]
Aren't we we got Osama and Mula Bullo and Alzarkawi and Al Al Os no people do it

[01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:48.030]
Al Azizwa Barwa here we know now Harry Carrie several thousand people have arrived at the acetate on the whole picture

[01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:49.790]
In other words while the

[01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:56.990]
Astridome can take 25,000 people there are people who are staying in other places right now in the Houston area

[01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:01.790]
There are 55,000 refugees staying in Houston area

[01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:07.830]
Hotels and motels also 100,000 in American Red Cross shelters in the Gulf region

[01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:12.630]
Let me tell you one thing that they've got in several things in the Astridome that they don't have in the Orleans

[01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:16.090]
They have two locker rooms in the Astridome which are their showers

[01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:20.010]
When you got 25 or 6,000 people obviously it's going to well you know

[01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.330]
Even if they're just all like piling there and have like

[01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:27.530]
And you know stop and think about your going days and weeks with the same clothes whatever the clothes on your back are

[01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:33.530]
That's what you got that's it and they got toilets wow what a concept and they have like water

[01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:38.310]
They got water to drink and running water to shower and flush the toilet and things like that

[01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:41.150]
And guess what else they have in the Astridome air conditioning

[01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:51.010]
What a concept all of these things 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in the Verizon and singular wireless lines

[01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:56.010]
This should be a real good lesson those of you people who find a bit all this homeland security vs. Man

[01:36:56.010 --> 01:37:01.310]
If this is what they're doing if this is the way that protecting us here at home might as well just all like to blow our brains out

[01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:04.210]
Or just to jump off the super dome

[01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:07.290]
Somebody Q a.m. Hello. Nail. Yes, sir

[01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:12.610]
This is this whole thing is really sickening but what makes me sick the most is our president

[01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:18.610]
I if I I don't understand how they're talking about all the looters and all that one of these people going to do

[01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:25.210]
What were they going to do that nothing absolutely nothing if they were restore or why are they a stupid president

[01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:31.610]
Call like maybe forthending the closest military base and have someone actually go over there and secure a place

[01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:38.950]
Rather than just talking about it this whole thing is complete this disgusting and it and it all just broke up to

[01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:43.610]
To nobody's going to help us because because they can't stand our president

[01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:53.090]
That's why nobody's helping us you don't see any you don't see any folks coming around here with anything besides what we're bringing

[01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:59.670]
Yeah, nobody is helping us. I don't care what they say. Oh well this one could have given us this and this one I want to see it

[01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:00.570]
It's not there

[01:38:01.930 --> 01:38:04.310]
Okay, little looked up to a frenzy when you say

[01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:11.330]
Pist off and fired up is what the course that gets your juices flowing five six seven others and Mrs. Limbaugh on her again

[01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:16.690]
I think it's I think it's appropriate that they've got her on there doing the news you know now that she's married I can't watch her

[01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:20.650]
We can have Eva Brown maybe doing the news at ABC and and you people sir

[01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:26.670]
And I say this you know we joke about it, but but now at a time like this when it's so serious and so grotesque

[01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:33.790]
It's just almost beyond your imagination what these people are going through and the best that they peacock and do MSNBC is to keep that reader

[01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:38.870]
Cause beyond a night at MSNBC and you're supposed to be one of the three 24 hour news networks

[01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:41.070]
Seriously she is so

[01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:49.470]
Embarrassing so juvenile so pathetic and the question she asked in that thin of excuse for a voice that she's been

[01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:58.870]
This is not what you need to be putting on the arrow. Okay the network of John Chancellor and David Brickley and Chet Huntly and Tom Bulkaw

[01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:00.250]
There be a lot of people like her

[01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:06.410]
Oh my god, I just I watched that I just want to scream. I mean your choices are so few

[01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:12.390]
I want to watch in the CBC coverage of it last night because it was Larry on there making a show out of it again with his panel

[01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:15.870]
Larry's got the panel and everything is a show

[01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:18.970]
And we're going to be all over this all weekend. I've got a three hour special

[01:39:18.970 --> 01:39:24.830]
I mean this is you talk about a guy who takes himself much too seriously and too self-important

[01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:32.310]
Get a life Larry. Okay get rid of their indistos suspenders and ditch the bag too by the way. Here's stories about a bag Larry in the bag

[01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:41.310]
Wow what an aroma. Why not in QA and hello? Hey it's Bill. Yes Bill. Hey I think I kind of obsessed with his last night

[01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:49.470]
There are bushes of speech all he does is real off numbers of bags of ice and this and that but I just wish he would I know he can't

[01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:54.710]
But take control of this situation and for once in his life deal with something and get something done

[01:39:55.310 --> 01:40:03.890]
It's an absolute joke. Yeah and it's upsetting very upsetting and I hope people realize what a freaking lawn this guy is

[01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:10.310]
They don't realize it. We want to know why it's hard work. It's hard work. Don't you understand Bill? It's hard work

[01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:16.210]
This man is an insult to the intelligence of the American public and the Congress of the Democratic Party

[01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:21.550]
They have nobody to blame but themselves. They're a bunch of spineless cowards most of them and it just makes me want to gag

[01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:28.350]
That America is a not a two party system to have a no party system because there is virtually nobody that really wants to

[01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:34.370]
Stand up and scream and holler. How are Dean? You know just make an a screaming and holler and Dennis Cassinics little Dennis

[01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:36.370]
Everyone's a step on yeah

[01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:37.850]
What's more Howard?

[01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:41.290]

Nerdnuck the school fees in the way a Diane finestein she's opening up a big push but other than that just move right along

[01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:53.850]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and leave a residence singular wireless lines

[01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.370]
WDQ a.m. Hello

[01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:56.050]
How are you?

[01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.490]
Who I am?

[01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:58.330]
How are you doing?

[01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:59.670]
Pretty good. How are you doing?

[01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:02.370]
The sound is very good. It sounds like me

[01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:08.170]
Yeah, I agree with you about Rita God. She's like a pig you know a couple weeks ago maybe about a month ago

[01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:13.670]
They put in like USA things that come in the Sunday favor. They had a half-page adverb and you should have seen it

[01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:19.430]
They they airbrush their face to make it look so hot and I know I got news for you they could put you on there tonight

[01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:25.210]
MSNBC and it would more seriously with no experience at all just reading the Q cars you could do a better job than me

[01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:32.390]
I'm not a question that she asked her so soft of Morgan so I want to say her the things are really really bad

[01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:38.890]
You should have seen the picture they may have looked like a playboy model so hot but she's terrible

[01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:43.030]
And you write about the there's no party man a couple of questions ago

[01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.070]
The other party would always find something to pitch about

[01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:52.210]
Yeah, but this party this democratic party this looks like it seems like a player they got making pictures of their wives and stuff

[01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:55.290]
They say exactly they're such chickens

[01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:56.690]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:01.770]
They're like to you pali see people are pissed off and fired up now and rightfully so

[01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:08.990]
There's just all sorts of garbage going on there's people done every single day in Iraq not just Americans and Brits and Aussies and New

[01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:16.050]
Webberls but innocent people and yesterday this disaster there almost a thousand people died because

[01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:20.370]
Everybody's in the state of panic because the suicide the bombers are all over the place

[01:42:20.370 --> 01:42:25.610]
There were no suicide bombers in Iraq before we did the Iraq attack none zero well

[01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:30.130]
There should be a lot of figures of no hands and these people are just trying to live their damn lives

[01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:34.030]
And in the meantime to and those people have electricity the ones who are lucky enough to have any at all

[01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:38.630]
Four hours a day at tops. How do you like to live every day with 20 hours of the day no electricity?

[01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:42.810]
Not and of course drinking water forget about it

[01:42:42.810 --> 01:42:49.070]
The conditions there are disgraceful with created chaos their civil war going on right now as I speak

[01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:54.470]
Oh, but we've got the Constitution and we've got elections and freedom of John the March it's a lot of bull crap

[01:42:54.470 --> 01:43:00.070]
Okay, when people take a country to war based on lies you think that they're going to stop lying at any point along on

[01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:08.290]
Of course not if this man had any decency whatsoever just the tiniest Iota he'd be planning his resignation speech right now

[01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:13.570]
He'd be sitting there with Carl Roevin as speech writers and they'd be right now and he'd be like on the TV tonight nine o'clock

[01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:18.570]
Resigning okay what I've done is totally unacceptable and it was based on you know

[01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:22.830]
I can still blame the CIA which is their favorite trick healthy information and bad intelligence

[01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:26.730]
Yeah bad intelligence alright but not the kind of intelligence you're talking about a

[01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:30.730]
President would lack of intelligence and look at 1215 already and I'm bop bop bop like that

[01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:35.690]

Welcome to a current affair

[01:44:48.130 --> 01:44:48.810]
Mr. President

[01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:51.770]
Thanks for calling in my own vacation where you now?

[01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:58.590]
In Florida with my little brother Jeff George and this rate you're going to sit a record of provocation time for any president ever

I agree with you I think what you've done is really important right but we're with you and with you all the very best

[01:45:05.610 --> 01:45:07.350]

Thanks for the time that you give the name

[01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:52.390]
The memories are all in my mind

[01:45:54.650 --> 01:46:04.190]
Now that we've come to the end of our rainbow

[01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:11.830]
There's something I must say I'm not

[01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:15.010]
I'm dying out here

[01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:18.410]
You're the one

[01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:21.830]
You're the one

[01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:23.010]
You're the one

[01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:25.470]
Me, the one

[01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:28.370]
Me, the one

[01:46:32.290 --> 01:46:39.250]
Well that's your more than enough of that it's a top 21 more than I do like the Commodore though but not that

[01:46:39.250 --> 01:46:47.210]
But just he could I could live without him you know in fact maybe he could get a train set like a Lionel playworld and just take off on it

[01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:53.910]
There's lightning going on who wrote this facts it's from somebody but it's cute though it says Armageddon out of here

[01:46:55.310 --> 01:47:00.690]
That's cute says there's lightning going off all around as I write there's a volcano blasting off in El Salvador

[01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:06.030]
We're planning a big party on June 6 2006 6606 that's cute

[01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:08.530]
I'll be from the anti-Christ

[01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:20.830]
Wouldn't you think or anti-neil could be through fairy the sun herald of galaxy Mississippi and the editorial that they criticize the relief effort in its ravaged area so far and told officials are at an

[01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:31.810]
Ignatient large south Mississippi needs your help it angrily revealed while the flow of information is frustratingly difficult our reporters have yet to find evidence of a coordinated approach to relief pain and hunger or

[01:47:31.810 --> 01:47:35.950]
To secure property and maintain order people are hurting and people are being fandalized

[01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:42.850]
It whereas the National Guard why has never able-bodied member of the armed forces in south Mississippi then pressed into service pointedly

[01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:55.170]
They declared that earlier today reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival of the galaxy junior high school shelter look north across Irish Hill road and saw Air Force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics

[01:47:55.170 --> 01:48:03.770]
It added we need the president to back up his declaration of a disaster with a declaration of every man and woman under his command will do whatever is necessary to deal with that disaster

[01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:09.930]
The newspaper is managed to publish two pre-ditions this week as well as keep its website updated if I probably better than the herald

[01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:19.390]
Here's the text of their editorial today the son herald of the galaxy Mississippi it says the coastal communities in south Mississippi are desperately need of an unprecedented relief effort

[01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:26.810]
We understand that New Orleans also was devastated by Hurricane Katrina but surely this nation has the resources to rescue both that metropolitan area and ours

[01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:36.390]
Whatever plans that were in place to deal with such an actual disaster have proven inadequate perhaps destruction on this scale could not have been adequately prepared for but now that it has taken place

[01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:44.090]
No effort should be spared to mitigate the hurricane's impact the essentials ice gasoline medicine simply aren't getting here fast enough

[01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:50.430]
We're not calling on the nation in the state to make life more comfortable in south Mississippi we're calling on the nation state to make life here possible

[01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:58.490]
We would bolster our argument with the number of Katrina casualties confirmed thus far but there is if there is such a confirmed number no one's releasing it to the public

[01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:04.710]
This lack of faith in the public's ability to handle the truth is not sparing anyone's feelings it is instead fueling terrifying rumors

[01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:13.170]
While the flow of information is frustratingly difficult our reporters have yet to find evidence of a coordinated approach to relieve pain and hunger or to secure property and maintain order

[01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:21.170]
People are hooking and people are being vandalized it where is the National Guard? Why has never able-bodied member of the armed forces in south Mississippi been pressed into service?

[01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:24.650]
On Wednesday reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival

[01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:33.790]
This is a repeat of what the other paragraph was at the Bolognese junior high school shelter looked north across Irish Hill road and sought air force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics

[01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:43.850]
When asked why these young men weren't being used to help in the recovery effort our reporters were told that it would be pointless to send military personnel down to the beach to pick up the breed

[01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:53.430]
Litter is the least of our problems we need the president to back up his declaration of a disaster with a declaration that every man and woman under his command will do whatever is necessary to deal with that disaster

[01:49:53.430 --> 01:50:01.910]
We need the governor to provide whatever assistance is at his command we certainly need our own counting and city officials to come together and identify the most pressing needs of their constituents

[01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:12.830]
And then allocate resources to meet those needs we appreciate the stress that these elected appointed officials have been under since the weekend but they must do a better job restoring public confidence and their ability to meet this challenge

[01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:15.190]
How do you like that?

[01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:19.270]
Just like maybe just want us to be more like Iraq, huh?

[01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:24.850]
We got chaos and murder and bloodshed and death in the streets and bodies floating around and you know just like Iraq

[01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:28.050]
Stop and think about it, right?

[01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:35.010]
Freedom's on the march we're spreading our branded democracy all over the world in fact if we have bushing air long enough in fact the rest of his whole term

[01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:38.010]
We'll probably have murder and bloodshed and chaos all over the world

[01:50:38.010 --> 01:50:41.410]
This is Neil Rodden, my WW3

[01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:44.530]
This is 516 QAF

[01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:48.310]
But our host is in hand

[01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:51.530]
Get ready for the wildest girls gone wild ever

[01:50:52.050 --> 01:50:54.950]
It's girls gone wild about girls gone wild

[01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:58.390]
Hey, baby, super bad shit and show us you

[01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:02.670]
That'll teach you to treat us like sex objects

[01:51:02.670 --> 01:51:06.490]
You've never seen a girl gone wild what t-shirt contest like this?

[01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:08.510]
I'm gonna spray you with his own

[01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:12.050]
And I'm gonna spray you with bullets

[01:51:13.410 --> 01:51:18.930]
Nothing makes girls go wild quite like the whole idea behind girls gone wild

[01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:21.350]
Hey, this is my girl on girl actions

[01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:24.770]
Who got your girl on girl actions right here?

[01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:29.270]
You warned her girls gone wild about girls gone wild

[01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:31.210]
So a 1-800- show us your...

[01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:41.030]
Wonderful, W-Q-A-L

[01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:43.310]
What be?

[01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:21.410]
I'm not gonna be a bad singer, I'm not gonna be a bad singer

[01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:43.290]
I'm not gonna be a bad singer, I'm not gonna be a bad singer

[01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:48.110]
Oh, 1231, well there no Jimmy Hendrix, so I'll tell you that at the four tops

[01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.950]
No

[01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:53.470]
Jimmy Hendrix is gonna win our poll on the best black recording artist or group of all time

[01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:57.830]
and that is just enough to make me want to put my head in my hands and cry like a baby

[01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:59.530]
I remember cry like a baby by the box tops?

[01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:00.450]
I'll kill it right now

[01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:00.970]
I think they were white

[01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:01.550]
They were

[01:53:02.050 --> 01:53:07.230]
Jimmy Hendrix 76, Ray Charles has 69 and he ain't feeling the thing

[01:53:08.710 --> 01:53:10.770]
Oh, they're the box tops and cry like a baby

[01:53:10.770 --> 01:53:12.790]
Where's that dish cry like a baby?

[01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:14.070]
Something like that?

[01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:19.050]
Bob Marley 40, now where are you getting all those clips from?

[01:53:19.230 --> 01:53:20.050]
I was looking for that video

[01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:25.150]
The Duff gave me this collection, all of the hits from 1962 to 2000

[01:53:25.150 --> 01:53:28.170]
Yeah, at least top five or the top 10 or something like that

[01:53:28.170 --> 01:53:28.510]
Right

[01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:30.350]
And I put them in the computer here

[01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:31.230]
Oh, I see

[01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:34.530]
I thought it was like somewhere online, we were getting like a little close

[01:53:34.530 --> 01:53:35.410]
They're there too

[01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:36.650]
Tutu?

[01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:37.750]
Don't start that

[01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:40.370]
Oh, that's what Troy said this morning, something about a Tutu

[01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:42.130]
He said that somebody looked lovely in it

[01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:43.510]
I won't mention no names Troy

[01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:47.350]
You idiot, you quizzling, you silly, you silly

[01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.870]
You're fairy

[01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:51.170]
Bob Marley 40, and my finger was on it, but nothing was happening

[01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:54.170]

Marvin Gaye, gay, 16

Otis Rending 10, Afro Man's got 9

[01:54:01.710 --> 01:54:03.010]
Oh, I never did play in that, did I?

[01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.650]
Nope

[01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:06.510]
Well, we could play a little bit and just the...

[01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:08.610]
Yeah, that's not too much, a little bit more

[01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:08.870]
Roll another part

[01:54:09.450 --> 01:54:11.650]
Louis Armstrong 18

[01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:12.730]
James Browne

[01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:14.510]
Chuck Berry-Gutty

[01:54:15.690 --> 01:54:16.130]
38

[01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:18.790]
That's that, that's that, that's that

[01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:20.310]
Boy, it's gonna be fine

[01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:22.510]
I want this girl to check

[01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:24.130]
Mine or something

[01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:25.530]
That's very white chick

[01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:29.290]
I want to restrict you without line over to you

[01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:30.970]
I was gonna create my room

[01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:32.290]
I said I got high

[01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:34.250]
Thank you Wilson 6, I need any of you in your six

[01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:36.690]
I was gonna get up and find the boom

[01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:38.150]
But then I got high

[01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:39.370]
I think he's small as Mr. Primes

[01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:41.070]
I think that's not my room

[01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:42.510]
I got you messed up

[01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:43.970]
And I know why

[01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:44.790]
You're one thing

[01:54:45.610 --> 01:54:46.570]
Because I got high

[01:54:46.570 --> 01:54:47.210]
Medical's fine

[01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:48.230]
You feel like I got high

[01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:49.630]
Look at her, you're like I got high

[01:54:49.630 --> 01:54:50.510]
You need to prank him

[01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:52.470]
That's not that, that's not that

[01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:54.010]
I was gonna go to class

[01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:55.370]
Before I got high

[01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:57.170]
One more thing, you think you said

[01:54:57.170 --> 01:54:58.390]
I could have treated

[01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:59.810]
And I could have passed

[01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:01.150]
But I got high

[01:55:01.150 --> 01:55:02.050]
I'm working three

[01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:05.390]
I'm taking it next to Mr.

[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:07.010]
And I know why

[01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:08.870]
I'm gonna be big

[01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:10.010]
Because I got high

[01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:12.050]
Because I got high

[01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:15.250]
Because I got high

[01:55:15.250 --> 01:55:16.310]

Nina Simone's got a pair

[01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.670]
And we're seeing him

[01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:22.710]

Oh man

Fat stomato 2

Luther Vandross 1

Gladys Knight got only one

[01:55:33.090 --> 01:55:33.910]
So lament they all know

[01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:34.850]
That is pathetic

[01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:36.190]
Whitney Houston 1

[01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:37.110]

We got four seventy three

[01:55:55.190 --> 01:55:56.810]
Our goal is four seventy five

[01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:57.970]
Well we don't want to set

[01:55:57.970 --> 01:55:58.870]
You know, big goals

[01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:59.810]
Like in the middle of the first

[01:55:59.810 --> 01:56:00.790]
As of September plus

[01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:02.050]
It's like Labor Day weekend

[01:56:02.050 --> 01:56:02.850]
Right?

[01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.470]
Right?

[01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:05.670]
David Corn writes in the

[01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:05.970]
Nation

[01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:07.090]
He's usually pretty good

[01:56:07.090 --> 01:56:08.090]
Although I don't know

[01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.830]
Some of what he writes

[01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:09.570]
Here is old

[01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:10.630]
But you know I'll read it

[01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.610]
Anyway, it'll kill some time

[01:56:11.610 --> 01:56:12.830]
It'll get you on the edge of

[01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:13.210]
Your seat

[01:56:13.210 --> 01:56:14.950]
He says I just spotted Haley

[01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:16.030]
Barbara, boy you talk about a

[01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:17.230]
Druing Yahoo man

[01:56:17.230 --> 01:56:19.630]
Haley Barbara makes Jesse Helm

[01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:20.490]
Seemed like a big city

[01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:20.890]
Slicker

[01:56:20.890 --> 01:56:22.310]
You see Haley Barbara on

[01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.450]
Here?

[01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:22.850]
No

[01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:24.590]
He says I just spotted Haley Barbara

[01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:25.850]
Governor Mississippi on Cien

[01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:27.010]
And arguing with Anchor Scott

[01:56:27.010 --> 01:56:27.850]
Miles O'Brien

[01:56:27.850 --> 01:56:29.310]
O'Brien was suggesting that

[01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:30.310]
The federal government dropped

[01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:31.610]
The ball in terms of preparing for

[01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:32.330]
Hurricane Katrina.

[01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:33.810]
Barbara kept defending the

[01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:34.410]
Federal government.

[01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:35.710]
That is the Bush administration.

[01:56:36.130 --> 01:56:37.170]
He seemed to suggest that the

[01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:38.470]
Hurricane was not that powerful

[01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:39.130]
When it first approached

[01:56:39.130 --> 01:56:40.490]
Slian and there hadn't been enough

[01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:41.590]
Time to do more preparation.

[01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.190]
Of course Barbara did not note

[01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:43.810]
That before becoming

[01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:45.270]
Governor Mississippi, he was

[01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:46.190]
Head of the Republican Party

[01:56:46.190 --> 01:56:46.970]
And therefore not of a

[01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:48.110]
Disposition to speak critically

[01:56:48.110 --> 01:56:49.230]
Of an administration that has

[01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:49.810]
Got a FEMA,

[01:56:50.210 --> 01:56:51.550]
Slifed funding for flood control,

[01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:52.890]
And sent many National Guard

[01:56:52.890 --> 01:56:53.730]
Reserves to Iraq.

[01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:55.550]
By one I submit about a third of

[01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:56.830]
The Louisiana National Guard is

[01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:57.830]
In Iraq right now.

[01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:59.970]
O'Brien pushed his point about his

[01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:01.350]
Hardest permitted on cable TV.

[01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:02.870]
But he neglected to raise the

[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:04.270]
Specifics or the question Barbara

[01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:05.470]
About his previous work as a

[01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:07.350]
Corporate lobbyist who on behalf of

[01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:08.530]
His well-paying clients fought

[01:57:08.530 --> 01:57:09.710]
Fierce against the Kyoto

[01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:10.270]
Accords.

[01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:12.570]
Recent scientific research suggests

[01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:13.810]
That global warming has led to

[01:57:13.810 --> 01:57:14.890]
More destructive hurricanes.

[01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:16.830]
And as I noted previously, Barbara

[01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:18.430]
Led the GOP when it was waging war

[01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:19.070]
On big government.

[01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:20.310]
Now he's all for it.

[01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:21.650]
O'Brien didn't courier him on this

[01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:22.110]
Conversion.

[01:57:22.610 --> 01:57:23.530]
As the New York Times editorial

[01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:25.370]
Ises today, a moment like they

[01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:26.470]
Show his Bush's weaknesses.

[01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:27.810]
He was late to respond to the

[01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:29.490]
Law again and his rhetoric was

[01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:30.530]
Hollow no surprise.

[01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.770]
Yesterday he declared,

[01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:33.050]
America will be a stronger

[01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:33.790]
Place for it.

[01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:34.330]
Police.

[01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:35.850]
Did he ask his speech right

[01:57:35.850 --> 01:57:36.990]
Is for the most empty plighted

[01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:38.010]
To they could concoct?

[01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:39.390]
Then today he proclaimed there

[01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:40.610]
Would be zero tolerance for

[01:57:40.610 --> 01:57:41.110]
Looters.

[01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:42.610]
But if I were stuck into war liens

[01:57:42.610 --> 01:57:43.590]
Waiting for help from a government

[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:44.970]
That had failed me and my family

[01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:46.390]
Was without water food or clothing.

[01:57:46.690 --> 01:57:47.770]
I'd grab what I could from

[01:57:47.770 --> 01:57:48.470]
Wherever I could.

[01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:49.950]
I'd worry about payment later.

[01:57:50.170 --> 01:57:51.330]
Sure some looters are criminals

[01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:52.410]
Exploding the emergency.

[01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:54.290]
But many are people trying to survive.

[01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:56.050]
Who would watch their kids go hungry

[01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:57.230]
Rather than break a window with a

[01:57:57.230 --> 01:57:59.070]
Windixie not me call me pro

[01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:00.190]
Looting when it's necessary.

[01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:02.210]
And he's right.

[01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:03.770]
And if you if it's food and water

[01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:05.190]
And necessities of life.

[01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:06.910]
Like he says there are some people

[01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:07.670]
Are just playing in the

[01:58:07.670 --> 01:58:08.170]
Slime balls.

[01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:10.650]
Just grabbing plasma TVs and

[01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:12.730]
Video games cramplight.

[01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:13.950]
What are they going to watch those

[01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:14.990]
Video games on by the way?

[01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.990]
I guess on the plasma TV.

[01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:17.510]
Yeah, stolen TV.

[01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:19.870]
Yeah, where are they going to

[01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:20.710]
Plug it in huh?

[01:58:20.710 --> 01:58:23.830]
Oh, five six seven oh five sixty

[01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:25.570]
Pound five sixty only Verizon and

[01:58:25.570 --> 01:58:26.850]
Singular wireless line.

[01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:28.010]
Let's take two three hundred calls

[01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:28.570]
By two o'clock.

[01:58:28.690 --> 01:58:29.090]
What do you say?

[01:58:29.170 --> 01:58:29.490]
Do it.

[01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:30.890]
One of these people actually seemed

[01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:32.690]
A little whipped up in the foamy in the foamy,

[01:58:32.710 --> 01:58:33.030]
Don't they?

[01:58:33.850 --> 01:58:34.710]
Come in to QAN.

[01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:35.050]
Hello.

[01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:36.370]
Hey, yeah, what's going on?

[01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:37.150]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:38.150]
I'll be right through with him.

[01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:39.650]
Yeah, you're speaking with me.

[01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:40.730]
Hey, what's going on?

[01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.750]
Hello?

[01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.790]
Yeah, I just want to say you know

[01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:46.410]
You know, whatever happens to

[01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:48.750]
$60 million or billion if they find

[01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:51.870]
In the long basement and another reason I know

[01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:53.930]
Why he's not going to be sending no troops over there?

[01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:56.830]
Because once September 11th comes, he's going to go and

[01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:58.050]
Send them all back to the right to

[01:58:58.050 --> 01:58:59.230]
Commemorates and I'm the 11th day.

[01:58:59.490 --> 01:59:00.270]
That's what he's going to do.

[01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:01.170]
Okay.

[01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:02.490]
Well, thanks for your prognostication.

[01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:03.890]
Spell that out for him.

[01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:04.230]
Would you please?

[01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:07.090]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:59:07.090 --> 01:59:08.630]
And they've arrived in Singular wireless

[01:59:08.630 --> 01:59:08.830]
Thunder.

[01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:10.930]
There's white house spokesman Scott McFellow who says.

[01:59:11.290 --> 01:59:12.010]
The waiver.

[01:59:12.330 --> 01:59:13.330]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:14.170]
Deputy QAN.

[01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:14.450]
Hello.

[01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:16.310]
QAN.

[01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:17.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:18.690]
Yeah, I'm Motown.

[01:59:18.930 --> 01:59:20.450]
Get me all mowed up.

[01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:21.610]
You ready for mold?

[01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:22.290]
Do do do do.

[01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:25.510]
He's a multi-point you know, multi-point you

[01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:26.290]
I'll be here.

[01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:27.070]
I'm going to show.

[01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:28.770]
Yeah, hear about that.

[01:59:29.010 --> 01:59:29.290]
No.

[01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:31.350]
Yeah, all the time everybody calls up.

[01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:32.630]
You don't like when people call him though.

[01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:34.210]
He says that ain't my name.

[01:59:34.530 --> 01:59:35.230]
It's all from that.

[01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.690]
We are.

[01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:36.210]
Yeah.

[01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:37.110]
Guess what?

[01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:37.910]
Guess what?

[01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:39.290]
My paycheck's still pretty big.

[01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:39.950]
There you go.

[01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:40.630]
See you, pal.

[01:59:41.130 --> 01:59:42.850]
So, Moa is starting on a rampage here.

[01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:44.010]
Is that just not going to be rumor, huh?

[01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:44.450]
Do do do do.

[01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:45.850]
Oh, I heard that before.

[01:59:46.290 --> 01:59:46.670]
Have you really?

[01:59:46.670 --> 01:59:47.030]
Yeah.

[01:59:47.050 --> 01:59:50.190]
Well, at least that's a step up from pipe smokeer I guess.

[01:59:50.410 --> 01:59:51.270]
Hey, Moa.

[01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.870]
You fair.

[01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.790]
You Moa?

[01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.770]
WDQA and Hull.

[01:59:54.110 --> 01:59:54.790]
Hey, Neil.

[01:59:55.230 --> 01:59:55.590]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:57.890]
Hey, about the global warming.

[01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.590]
Yeah.

[01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:02.590]
I think we should pass the global warming act and I have a solution.

[02:00:03.090 --> 02:00:08.750]
We all turn our air conditioners up to four power in our houses and open up the doors and

[02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:09.610]
take things with our cars.

[02:00:11.090 --> 02:00:11.870]
All right.

[02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:12.590]
There you go.

[02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:13.590]
There's a thinking guy.

[02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:15.870]
That's what a George Bush is thinking people.

[02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:18.190]
And this is Neil Rogers.

[02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:22.310]
This is 5.16.2 AF.

[02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:25.230]
Morning, good night, Clark.

[02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:26.910]
Tonight on E.

[02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:29.050]
Entertainment Television.

[02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:29.670]
Pewy.

[02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:30.470]
That's my name.

[02:00:30.710 --> 02:00:31.430]
Don't wear it out.

[02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:32.970]
What do the police find in your home?

[02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:34.190]
I don't know.

[02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:37.890]
I heard they found videos of you having sex with tickle me elbow.

[02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:40.410]
I don't need the police and I don't need you.

[02:00:40.710 --> 02:00:42.090]
I don't need anybody.

[02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:43.190]
Tonight on E.

[02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:45.330]
You love things about me.

[02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:48.030]
You don't know anything about things you wouldn't understand.

[02:00:48.330 --> 02:00:49.690]
Things you couldn't understand.

[02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:51.850]
Things you shouldn't understand.

[02:00:51.850 --> 02:00:51.850]

[02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:53.650]
That's a spot quicker.

[02:00:53.890 --> 02:00:56.090]
Pewy, step away from Elmo.

[02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:57.070]
That's you make me.

[02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:58.370]
That's a spot quicker.

[02:00:58.550 --> 02:01:00.310]
But if you take a picture and a live dragon.

[02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:02.470]
That's a spot quicker.

[02:01:02.690 --> 02:01:04.150]
So dear, if you're in.

[02:01:04.630 --> 02:01:05.250]
Turn it behind.

[02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:07.490]
And over, over.

[02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.950]
And over, over.

[02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:09.490]
And over, over.

[02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:13.150]
And over, over.

[02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:19.350]
And over, over.

[02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:20.730]
Good night, Dr. Clark.

[02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:39.530]
We're going to see your family.

[02:01:40.230 --> 02:01:40.810]
We're going to see your family.

[02:01:44.590 --> 02:01:46.670]
We're going to see your family.

[02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:48.350]
We're going to see your family.

[02:01:50.290 --> 02:01:52.290]
We're going to see your family.

[02:01:52.330 --> 02:01:52.330]

[02:01:52.330 --> 02:01:54.690]
I'd say they want to know Jimmy Hendrix, those guys these days,

[02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:54.910]
brothers.

[02:01:55.110 --> 02:01:57.710]
They got three votes in Jimmy Hendrix, and there's 76 all the wait.

[02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:59.250]
Charles is creeping up on Jimmy's ass.

[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:00.130]
Look at them.

[02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:02.470]
He's sleeping right away up there in the solar heaven.

[02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:03.770]
Bruce Rice.

[02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:06.090]
And obviously Bruce is distressed and flaming at the mouth.

[02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:09.110]
He says, SOS, same old Smith, just as in Andrew,

[02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:11.010]
the Federal Government was caught with its pants down

[02:02:11.010 --> 02:02:13.210]
and asked, showing, that don't, Bruce says,

[02:02:13.690 --> 02:02:15.690]
whereas the temporary tent city to house these people,

[02:02:15.810 --> 02:02:17.590]
where are the military kitchens to feed these people,

[02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:19.730]
whereas the water for showering and basic survival,

[02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:21.610]
whereas FEMA to give these people some kind of assistance

[02:02:21.610 --> 02:02:23.470]
or at least get the ball rolling with the paperwork,

[02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:25.190]
where are the grief, what they gotta go online

[02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:28.030]
and the FEMA website, where are the grief counselors

[02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:29.930]
to at least give these people a shoulder to cry on?

[02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:31.530]
Where's the National Guard to protect these people

[02:02:31.530 --> 02:02:33.210]
from the evil and bad element of our society?

[02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:34.930]
Where Mr. Bush, where?

[02:02:35.770 --> 02:02:38.670]
Mr. Bush would say, the Yamama, that's what he would say,

[02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:41.150]
if you knew how to spell it.

[02:02:42.650 --> 02:02:45.130]
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon and Singular,

[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:46.270]
wireless lines.

[02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:49.410]
Well, maybe Yamol had like a bad bowl of grits or something

[02:02:49.410 --> 02:02:50.690]
or maybe a bad bout of these schmitz

[02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:54.010]
because evidently he's turning again, is that the deal?

[02:02:54.130 --> 02:02:55.710]
Every time you think he's like calm down

[02:02:55.710 --> 02:02:57.310]
and just out of nowhere, out of the blue, you know?

[02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:58.250]
No particular reason.

[02:02:58.410 --> 02:02:58.750]
Absolutely.

[02:02:59.350 --> 02:03:00.710]
Goes off, but that's fine.

[02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:03.210]
Yeah, have a nice time with your two-share, Mo.

[02:03:04.050 --> 02:03:04.690]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:03:05.050 --> 02:03:06.150]
Hey, Sally, how you doing?

[02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:07.150]
Pretty good, Pally.

[02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:08.530]
I got one for the poll.

[02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:09.090]
Okay.

[02:03:09.490 --> 02:03:10.010]
Bruce Stoder.

[02:03:10.630 --> 02:03:13.470]
I mean, the guy from Merck and I on,

[02:03:13.610 --> 02:03:15.210]
Bruce, whatever his name was.

[02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:17.270]
Bruce from America, I'm Ruben Stoddard.

[02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:18.810]
Ruben, what?

[02:03:19.230 --> 02:03:19.950]
Ruben Stoddard.

[02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.430]
Stoddard.

[02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:21.450]
Yes, that one.

[02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:22.050]
Ruben Stoddard.

[02:03:22.230 --> 02:03:23.750]
Hey, Bruce, you're a sandal, yeah.

[02:03:24.090 --> 02:03:25.450]
Ruben Stoddard, get serious.

[02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:26.790]
Is he serious?

[02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:28.570]
He might be, but we're not putting it on anyway.

[02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:29.650]
No, we're sure his heart not.

[02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:31.530]
I mean, you know, are we gonna lower ourselves

[02:03:31.530 --> 02:03:33.990]
to that level, putting people from American Idol on there?

[02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.430]
No.

[02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:35.850]
Good, good.

[02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:38.130]
Next we'll be putting Clay Aiken on the White People's Pool.

[02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:39.770]
I'm aching just thinking about it.

[02:03:40.230 --> 02:03:42.970]
5'6, 7'5, 60, pound 5'60 into Verizon,

[02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:44.450]
singular wireless line.

[02:03:44.670 --> 02:03:45.470]
Bruce Stubbly.

[02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:46.910]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:47.610]
Hi, Neil.

[02:03:47.970 --> 02:03:48.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:50.830]
I'm gonna mention the other states in 7'9,

[02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:52.690]
because they got a guy there doing an interview.

[02:03:53.230 --> 02:03:54.170]
This sounds awful.

[02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:55.970]
Like Reverend Jones to me, yeah.

[02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:57.750]
They're in a long time, but not long enough.

[02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:58.630]
How sad.

[02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.950]
WNQAM.

[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:00.810]
I'm gonna ask off.

[02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:02.250]
Who is the guy next to you fucking?

[02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.810]
Who is he?

[02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:04.010]
Kill it.

[02:04:04.810 --> 02:04:06.610]
Oh, I didn't, I thought he said.

[02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:06.850]

[02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:08.050]
He wasn't talking to Wastow.

[02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.930]
I don't think so.

[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:10.530]
Although we haven't wanted to do it.

[02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:13.170]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.790]
What do we understand?

[02:04:14.590 --> 02:04:16.090]
5'6, 7'0, 5'50,

[02:04:16.170 --> 02:04:17.350]
well, what are you telling me to kill it?

[02:04:17.410 --> 02:04:18.150]
What are you doing there?

[02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.870]
I killed it.

[02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:20.430]
Well, we all killed it, okay?

[02:04:20.770 --> 02:04:21.330]
We're killing it.

[02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:22.410]
I'm dying on the heat.

[02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.590]
Good.

[02:04:22.930 --> 02:04:24.830]
Just like that poor seal I washed up, I'm sure.

[02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:26.650]
It had to be from the zoo, didn't it?

[02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:27.290]
I don't know.

[02:04:27.810 --> 02:04:29.670]
Now we have those zoos and like punch your trainer

[02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:30.210]
in the Gulf.

[02:04:30.610 --> 02:04:32.590]
They got seals in the Gulf.

[02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:33.330]
Why not?

[02:04:33.630 --> 02:04:34.070]
They can swim.

[02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:37.050]
Oh, if I got a line for that, but we'd be finished.

[02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:38.170]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:39.290]
Now.

[02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.590]
You know what it is, yeah.

[02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:41.050]
I guess, sir.

[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:45.370]
You know, I don't know why anyone's so shocked

[02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:47.430]
about the presence, lack of response.

[02:04:47.590 --> 02:04:51.790]
Wasn't it a fearless leader who put his hand on the Bible

[02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:56.150]
and swore to protect this country and it's any need?

[02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:58.830]
Sitting in elementary school,

[02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:01.950]
what he knew as the limousine drew up.

[02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:03.350]
Yeah, elementary school,

[02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:04.890]
if this country was under attack,

[02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:07.190]
that's what I keep track of for another seven minutes

[02:05:07.190 --> 02:05:07.570]
or whatever.

[02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:08.250]
That's right.

[02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:11.290]
And it was told that the second plane,

[02:05:11.650 --> 02:05:13.690]
and he just sat there and did nothing.

[02:05:13.890 --> 02:05:15.550]
That's the leader of the free world.

[02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:18.650]
That's the clown that's supposed to protect this nation

[02:05:18.650 --> 02:05:21.250]
from any attacks on any foreign nation.

[02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:23.450]
Maybe we can bring a voice of little ordinary school kids

[02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:25.390]
to the White House and they can read some stories to him.

[02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:27.890]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, pound, 5.

[02:05:28.130 --> 02:05:29.890]
And listen, that's what America wanted, man.

[02:05:30.210 --> 02:05:31.270]
Boots, boots, boots.

[02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:32.030]
That's what they wanted.

[02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:34.950]
They wanted a lunatic maniac.

[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:36.790]
It was just a puppet of the Neo-Con,

[02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:39.250]
the rejects from back in the early 80s.

[02:05:39.670 --> 02:05:42.750]
Same old crowd again, Wolfowitz and Pearl and Rumsfeld

[02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:45.770]
and a chaney, the same old Reagan crowd,

[02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:47.630]
the same people that gave you Iran Contra,

[02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:49.750]
now they're giving you Iraq, the Iraq attack

[02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:51.150]
and they're giving you all kinds of crap.

[02:05:51.690 --> 02:05:53.490]
And Iran, of course, is on the drawing board

[02:05:53.490 --> 02:05:54.790]
and has been for a long time.

[02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:56.730]
5, oh, there's Scott McPhon again.

[02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:58.270]
Just the other day, this is the first time

[02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:59.670]
it's ever been implemented.

[02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:00.410]
Yeah, all right.

[02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:03.010]
Put this poor guy, you know, I actually almost feel sorry

[02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:04.550]
for him if he weren't such a freaking liar

[02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:06.650]
and very good at it, or very bad at it lately.

[02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:08.650]
Put his stick his ass out there

[02:06:08.650 --> 02:06:10.610]
and he's gonna try to cover up for these lunatics,

[02:06:10.630 --> 02:06:13.170]
for these liars, for these thieves and rovers.

[02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:14.070]
But he wanted it.

[02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:16.450]
Nobody is holding a gun to his head and making him do it.

[02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:17.850]
Nobody can cue A and hello.

[02:06:18.190 --> 02:06:19.050]
Yeah, I want to speak to No.

[02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.610]
Speaking.

[02:06:20.070 --> 02:06:20.350]
Neil.

[02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:22.210]
Yeah, I've been listening to you show today.

[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:24.530]
I haven't listened in a while because of work.

[02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.130]
Yeah.

[02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:29.110]
But as far as Bush goes, the guy said it before, right?

[02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.950]
He's a clown.

[02:06:30.170 --> 02:06:32.190]
We should just call him Bozo for now on

[02:06:32.190 --> 02:06:34.470]
because he's ruined his country over and over again.

[02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:35.230]
Yeah, but it's a difference.

[02:06:35.410 --> 02:06:36.310]
So clowns are funny.

[02:06:36.650 --> 02:06:37.690]
All right.

[02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:41.850]
I do agree, but still, what else do you call a person

[02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:43.730]
who ruins a country like this one right now?

[02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:45.690]
Yeah, you know, an evil doer.

[02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:47.010]
Evil doer is good call.

[02:06:47.290 --> 02:06:47.670]
Thank you, Neil.

[02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:49.550]
He's always looking for evil doers, man.

[02:06:49.650 --> 02:06:50.470]
Look at him, Erie, W.

[02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:51.990]
You're the biggest evil doer in the world.

[02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:53.870]
Just like Cindy Sheen said, she's right.

[02:06:54.190 --> 02:06:56.390]
In a way, she picked up her goodies from Texas

[02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:57.910]
and she bailed out a couple days ago.

[02:06:58.250 --> 02:07:00.450]
And now she's going to go like on a tour all over the country.

[02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:01.330]
You go, Cindy.

[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:04.230]
Don't take any crap because that's what they do to anybody

[02:07:04.230 --> 02:07:06.730]
who dares who's got the audacity to tell the truth.

[02:07:07.210 --> 02:07:09.050]
Smirr and Schmirr, that's the campaign.

[02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:10.410]
So obvious.

[02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:13.150]
And the media sits back and, well, I like that article.

[02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.890]
I read on Tuesday.

[02:07:14.090 --> 02:07:15.650]
Well, we've got to give both sides, you know?

[02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.150]
Right.

[02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.450]
Yeah.

[02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:19.410]
Like when Martin, there was such a great line in there.

[02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:21.550]
But if they had Martin Luther King's high,

[02:07:21.650 --> 02:07:24.350]
have a dream speech on it, they have to have a clansman on it,

[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:26.270]
given a posing point of view to your equal time.

[02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:27.870]
But how are you people kidding, huh?

[02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:29.310]
You're so terrified.

[02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:30.490]
You're peeing in your pants.

[02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:32.650]
You're scared to death, which is why what's

[02:07:32.650 --> 02:07:33.890]
been going on the last couple of days

[02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:36.190]
is like kind of a breath of stale air, you know what?

[02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:37.790]
No, it really is.

[02:07:38.110 --> 02:07:39.830]
The fact that they're starting like actually

[02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:43.630]
a rip and ass to FEMA and Bush and a whole federal government

[02:07:43.630 --> 02:07:45.850]
and a state government for rubbing totally unprepared

[02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:47.050]
and just dropping the ball.

[02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:48.650]
There's not one interview that goes by,

[02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:50.970]
except the course for the anxious reader Cosby.

[02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:52.710]
What was really bad there?

[02:07:53.070 --> 02:07:54.430]
Tell me how bad it is.

[02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:55.590]
Is there water around?

[02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:59.890]
You people at NBC Man, if this is the best you can do,

[02:08:00.330 --> 02:08:01.790]
save yourself some energy, okay?

[02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:03.530]
We have an energy crisis in America.

[02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:05.130]
Save yourself some energy.

[02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:06.630]
Shut the transmitter off.

[02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:08.070]
Shut all the power down, okay?

[02:08:08.370 --> 02:08:09.670]
Between nine and 10 and we're every

[02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:10.970]
about to hit silly ass, big nose,

[02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:12.110]
hook those bitch on there.

[02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:13.850]
Read a Cosby My Ass.

[02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:16.490]
All the different things they've tried, you know?

[02:08:16.490 --> 02:08:18.650]
Even that Nazi from West Coast,

[02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:20.450]
what else is the name that they had on for five minutes?

[02:08:20.670 --> 02:08:23.330]
Mike, oh, that rabbit right wing lunatic.

[02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:24.630]
Sam, that's Michael Savage.

[02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:25.370]
I was gonna say that.

[02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:27.510]
Even that was an improvement over this bitch.

[02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:29.510]
What are you people thinking about?

[02:08:30.150 --> 02:08:30.870]
Good God.

[02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:33.070]
Just at a time when maybe Keith Obleman

[02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:34.710]
was starting to get a little bit of credibility

[02:08:34.710 --> 02:08:35.970]
and some of us were starting to like

[02:08:35.970 --> 02:08:38.370]
even though his act is a little bit over the top.

[02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:41.010]
But nevertheless, and of course, Chris Matthews,

[02:08:41.070 --> 02:08:43.370]
at least there are 10 or 20 people know who he is.

[02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:48.610]
But this bitch, first they started it with Mr. Bo-Tie.

[02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:50.190]
You know, see this is what the networks do.

[02:08:50.370 --> 02:08:51.790]
Anybody who's canned by the other one,

[02:08:51.930 --> 02:08:54.350]
any reject who can't make it on the CNN or Fox,

[02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:56.010]
they wind up with on MSNBC.

[02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:57.870]
And I think he's off already too.

[02:08:57.970 --> 02:08:59.390]
First they shoved him back to 11 o'clock.

[02:08:59.610 --> 02:09:01.570]
He wasn't on last night, Mr. Bo-Tie.

[02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:04.210]
Mother Rattucker Carlson, he and honor NOMO, I don't think.

[02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:07.450]
The people, you must be in charge of that network.

[02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:09.030]
It's like a deck of cards.

[02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:10.610]
They just keep shuffling and shuffling

[02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:11.910]
and shuffling the same swill.

[02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:13.670]
And at the time when you're really sitting there

[02:09:13.670 --> 02:09:15.910]
and for once, it doesn't happen very often,

[02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:17.890]
but for once when people under the age of 100,

[02:09:17.970 --> 02:09:19.870]
are actually interested in finding out what else going on.

[02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:21.790]
And we have the sofa you got basically,

[02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:25.530]
you got CNN, Fox, the fascist news network, and MSNBC.

[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:28.510]
I take back what I said last week about MSNBC

[02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:30.150]
because you don't get the MS from them.

[02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:31.670]
You get a bunch of amateur hour people.

[02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:35.170]
She belongs on the air about as much as Lady Martez

[02:09:35.170 --> 02:09:37.270]
and at least he's funny, not intentionally,

[02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.870]
but nevertheless.

[02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:40.790]
I'm so glad that you saw her for about two minutes.

[02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:42.950]
Yeah, that's a harder tool.

[02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:44.110]
She can't speak.

[02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:46.010]
She can't speak.

[02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:48.790]
Definitely qualified for a network TV.

[02:09:49.590 --> 02:09:50.850]
And then what she does say is,

[02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:52.970]
and every time they have a technical glitch,

[02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:55.130]
I mean, the real professional people,

[02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:57.670]
Genie, Missouri, Vance, CNN, or some of these other people,

[02:09:57.970 --> 02:09:58.870]
you know, they go with the flow.

[02:09:58.930 --> 02:10:01.110]
They realize Gary Tuckman, people have been doing this stuff

[02:10:01.110 --> 02:10:02.910]
for years, that they're going to have technical problems

[02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:04.870]
because they're operating in the middle of a hellacious storm

[02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:07.130]
and power out all kinds of other stuff going on.

[02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:08.510]
But every time something goes wrong,

[02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:10.670]
she says, oh, I think we've got Joe.

[02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:11.630]
Do we have Joe?

[02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:14.910]
You're sitting there and you're watching me ask you.

[02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:17.190]
So, not necessarily if you wonder if the media really

[02:10:17.190 --> 02:10:19.550]
needs serious help and you wonder why America's

[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:21.390]
become what it is today, just take a look

[02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:23.890]
at Rita Cosby, a 9-A-Coffee on MSNBC.

[02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:26.490]
And you'll say to yourself, oh my God.

[02:10:26.630 --> 02:10:29.190]
Yeah, what this be, man, what it is.

[02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:30.470]
Here's a good story.

[02:10:30.630 --> 02:10:32.050]
A little change of pace, okay?

[02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:33.830]
Something different, something uplifting.

[02:10:34.710 --> 02:10:36.890]
Olympia Washington, a state prison guard

[02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:39.230]
who was arrested after a drunken brawl at nightclub

[02:10:39.230 --> 02:10:40.870]
may also be charged with urinating

[02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:42.890]
on a municipal jail computer police set.

[02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:45.690]
Willie M. Shannon, 26 of Lacey Washington,

[02:10:45.690 --> 02:10:47.730]
employed at Washington Correction Center in Shelton,

[02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:49.530]
was later transferred from the city jail

[02:10:49.530 --> 02:10:52.550]
to the first in county jail, where he was booked for

[02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:53.350]
on a thirsting.

[02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:55.070]
Now, what the hell is a little bit of a pretty one by,

[02:10:55.170 --> 02:10:56.670]
what the hell was his first name, Thirsten?

[02:10:57.230 --> 02:10:57.790]
Oh, boy.

[02:10:58.050 --> 02:10:59.550]
So, see how we do with these black artists?

[02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:01.270]
Little bit of a pretty one.

[02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:02.510]
Well, you guys booked that up.

[02:11:02.730 --> 02:11:03.050]
I know.

[02:11:03.190 --> 02:11:04.250]
I looked it up in my book during the break.

[02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:06.370]
To a Thirsten County jail, where he was booked

[02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:08.270]
for investigation, the first to be malicious mischief,

[02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:09.770]
and then was released after posting bail,

[02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:11.410]
Quinter Police reports, Shannon,

[02:11:11.550 --> 02:11:13.770]
Sean W. Dack, 25 of McClurey,

[02:11:13.810 --> 02:11:15.070]
who works with Shannon at the prison,

[02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:17.850]
and Randy M. Hinchcliff, 38 of Olympia,

[02:11:18.150 --> 02:11:19.330]
who has previous holiday convictions

[02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:20.570]
and new Shannon from the prison,

[02:11:20.970 --> 02:11:22.610]
were arrested for fighting early Sunday morning

[02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:23.290]
at the vault.

[02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:25.350]
Lieutenant James Costa said,

[02:11:25.650 --> 02:11:27.190]
Shannon and Dack were fired through today,

[02:11:27.210 --> 02:11:28.350]
said, Velkry Johnson's spoken

[02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:29.510]
for the State Department of Corrections,

[02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:31.890]
describing all three as apparently intoxicated.

[02:11:32.370 --> 02:11:34.230]
And basically, it was found Shannon and Hinchcliff

[02:11:34.230 --> 02:11:35.230]
had been thrown out of the club

[02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:36.550]
after punching and shoving each other,

[02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:37.770]
and Dack joined the fray,

[02:11:37.810 --> 02:11:40.030]
eventually seeming to be trying to break it up, Costa said.

[02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:41.210]
Oh, it's a lot more fun to like,

[02:11:41.410 --> 02:11:42.050]
join right in.

[02:11:42.610 --> 02:11:44.590]
Dack and Hinchcliff were cited at the municipal jail

[02:11:44.590 --> 02:11:45.850]
for disorderly conduct and release,

[02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:47.630]
but Shannon, while confined in a holding cell,

[02:11:48.090 --> 02:11:49.850]
relieved himself through a protective screen

[02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:51.590]
on the way nearby computer workstation,

[02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:52.570]
according to police reports.

[02:11:53.070 --> 02:11:53.790]
He peed on it.

[02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:56.070]
During a damage to the computer monitor,

[02:11:56.250 --> 02:11:58.430]
facts machine, other hardware was estimated $1,500,

[02:11:58.950 --> 02:12:01.170]
and other equipment was rendered unusable

[02:12:01.170 --> 02:12:02.330]
because of the contamination.

[02:12:02.710 --> 02:12:05.790]
Shannon later apologized, although we can't take it back.

[02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:07.950]
Once it comes out, it's kind of hard to put back in.

[02:12:08.370 --> 02:12:09.230]
This is Billy Gilman.

[02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:10.390]
How about you, pardon?

[02:12:10.810 --> 02:12:12.530]
Everywhere that I see that I did a search,

[02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:14.290]
it says Billy Gilman, a little bit in pretty one.

[02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:15.830]
Oh, little bit.

[02:12:16.130 --> 02:12:18.570]
First in Harris, that's what I say.

[02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:22.310]
First in Harris, I got my billboard book here,

[02:12:22.450 --> 02:12:23.250]
I shot 40 books.

[02:12:23.730 --> 02:12:24.170]
Did you find it?

[02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:25.550]
I could look it up like it wasn't in the collection,

[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:27.510]
which means it wasn't a big enough hit.

[02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:30.010]
Little bit of, come on, get with it, man.

[02:12:30.010 --> 02:12:31.670]
I'm not where I'd put him on the pool.

[02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:32.970]
That was in middle of his smash,

[02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:35.610]
but I'm pretty sure there's Harvey and Mungloss,

[02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:36.550]
Cory Hart.

[02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:38.870]
First in Harris, little bit, he pretty one.

[02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:40.810]
It was number six on the charts in 1957.

[02:12:41.490 --> 02:12:42.730]
It was on the charts for 13 weeks.

[02:12:43.050 --> 02:12:44.730]
Well, 57 minutes, 100 years ago.

[02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:45.590]
I got to 60.

[02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:47.490]
See, he just don't go back.

[02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:49.210]
He's not old and crusty enough like me.

[02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.910]
I'm working on it.

[02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:52.110]
1256, the molemyster,

[02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:54.350]
I post personal friend coming up at two.

[02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:56.910]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:12:57.690 --> 02:13:01.390]
This is 5.62 a.m.

[02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:04.590]
Love, this is on.

[02:13:04.930 --> 02:13:06.290]
This is not a tumor.

[02:13:06.630 --> 02:13:08.350]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:13:08.730 --> 02:13:09.610]
Now, see here.

[02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:10.850]
I ain't never said no.

[02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:12.850]
I ain't never said no.

[02:13:14.130 --> 02:13:15.850]
I'm out here saying no.

[02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:18.650]
I ain't never said it.

[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:19.590]
I'm not a doctor.

[02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:21.930]
I'm just a patient who doesn't like to be the doctor.

[02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:24.310]
But they also pay me by that.

[02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.710]
What am I going to do with this?

[02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:27.370]
Don't always look close on trees, don't always run.

[02:13:28.290 --> 02:13:30.130]
Don't go through trees or Web areas.

[02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:33.350]
Don't always look close on trees or Web areas.

[02:13:33.730 --> 02:13:35.970]
Don't always look close on trees or Web areas.

[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:38.810]
Don't always look close on trees or Web areas.

[02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:43.950]
What is a bloome of the bomb?

[02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:54.010]
Don't always look close on trees or Web areas.

[02:13:54.010 --> 02:13:54.170]
Don't always look close.

[02:13:54.170 --> 02:13:54.290]
Don't always look close on trees or Web areas.

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.290]

[02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:13.550]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:16.450]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:17.090 --> 02:14:18.430]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:19.610]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:19.650 --> 02:14:20.630]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:21.230]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:21.230 --> 02:14:21.230]

[02:14:21.230 --> 02:14:21.850]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:21.850]

[02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:22.070]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:22.230]

[02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:22.410]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:22.690 --> 02:14:22.690]

[02:14:22.690 --> 02:14:22.690]

[02:14:23.210 --> 02:14:23.850]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:23.850 --> 02:14:25.750]
I'm going to get you

[02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:26.170]
Go.

[02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.270]

[02:14:32.630 --> 02:14:33.730]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.910]

[02:14:36.970 --> 02:14:36.990]
Go.

[02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.350]
Keep going.

[02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:40.090]
I'm going to get you.

[02:14:40.090 --> 02:14:40.090]

[02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:46.830]
Go go.

[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:47.150]

[02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:48.030]
Go.

[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.790]

[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.790]

[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.790]

[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.790]

[02:14:51.610 --> 02:14:51.790]
Down.

[02:14:52.190 --> 02:14:52.290]
Down.

[02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:52.750]

[02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:53.430]
Down.

[02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:54.130]
Go, go!

[02:15:02.150 --> 02:15:02.770]
Ah!

[02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:09.790]
All right, it's time for you to warm up

[02:15:10.730 --> 02:15:12.870]
And you were my man

[02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:15.390]
You're fair, you have no one

[02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:19.410]
You'd be weak as a lad

[02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:22.670]
If you had a stick

[02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:26.110]
To walk out that door

[02:15:26.890 --> 02:15:29.410]
My love would overrule my sins

[02:15:29.970 --> 02:15:33.410]
And I'd call you back for more if I were you

[02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:37.410]
If I were you

[02:15:37.410 --> 02:15:39.510]
I'd tell you one thing I'd gladestitue

[02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:41.030]
It was sure no Jimmy Humberts

[02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:42.770]
You didn't have no voice like that

[02:15:42.770 --> 02:15:44.770]
You can't do it

[02:15:47.490 --> 02:15:47.870]
102

[02:15:49.150 --> 02:15:50.770]
At 560 WQAM

[02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:53.870]
Great thanks by the way whoever sent this in

[02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:54.890]
Because I didn't see it

[02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:56.190]
But I just put it on our website

[02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:57.930]
At least I just sent it over to what Josh

[02:15:57.930 --> 02:15:59.450]
Maybe he'll put it on our website

[02:15:59.450 --> 02:16:00.730]
So does he clean his fingers

[02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:03.810]
How is the raperi doing what is often thing is Josh

[02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:06.270]
Do you come running in there and say

[02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:08.450]
With an answer with some kind of response or what

[02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.990]
Very accurate

[02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:10.450]
Just at the last break

[02:16:11.110 --> 02:16:12.490]
You'll hear from him on his sprint

[02:16:12.490 --> 02:16:15.490]
Waiting for a leader that's the editor of today's New York Times

[02:16:15.490 --> 02:16:16.430]
And it says

[02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:20.670]
George W. Bush gave one of the worst speeches of his life yesterday

[02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:24.470]
Especially given the level of national distress and need for words of consolation and wisdom

[02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:27.250]
And what seems to be a ritual in this administration

[02:16:27.250 --> 02:16:29.590]
The president appeared a day later than he was needed

[02:16:29.590 --> 02:16:32.990]
He then read an address of equality more appropriate for an arbor day celebration

[02:16:33.570 --> 02:16:35.710]
A long, long relist of pounds of ice

[02:16:36.170 --> 02:16:38.670]
Generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast

[02:16:38.670 --> 02:16:40.710]
He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help

[02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:44.490]
Should send cash, ginned, and promised that everything would work out in the end

[02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:46.750]
Well of course, we will endure

[02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:48.450]
And the city of New Orleans must come back

[02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:50.390]
But looking at the pictures on television yesterday

[02:16:50.390 --> 02:16:52.870]
Of a place that banded into the forces of flood fire and looting

[02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:55.790]
It was hard not to wonder exactly how that's going to come to pass

[02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:58.450]
Right now hundreds of thousands of American refugees

[02:16:58.450 --> 02:16:59.970]
Need our national concern and care

[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:02.870]
Thousands of people still need to be rescued from imminent peril

[02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:05.070]
Public health threats must be controlled in New Orleans

[02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:06.370]
And throughout southern Mississippi

[02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:09.570]
Drabbers must be given confidence that gasoline will be available

[02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:14.250]
And profiteeing must be brought under control at a moment when television has been showing long lines at some pumps

[02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:18.050]
And spot prices approaching $4 a gallon have been reported

[02:17:18.810 --> 02:17:22.630]
Sacrifices may be necessary to make sure that all these things happen in an orderly efficient way

[02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:25.570]
But this administration has never been one to counsel sacrifice

[02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:27.990]
And nothing about the president's demeanor yesterday

[02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:30.310]
Which seemed casual to the point of carelessness

[02:17:30.310 --> 02:17:33.310]
To suggest that he understood the depth of the current crisis

[02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:39.370]
While retention must now be on the Gulf Coast most immediate needs the nation will soon ask why New Orleans levies remain so inadequate

[02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:45.750]
Publications from the local newspaper to national geographic have plummeted about the bad state of flood protecting this beloved city

[02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:47.010]
Which is below sea level

[02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:51.990]
Why were developers permitted to destroy wetlands and barrier islands that could have held back the hurricane surge?

[02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:59.110]
Why was Congress before wandered off the vacation engaged in slashing the budget for correcting some of the gaping holes in the areas flood protection?

[02:17:59.110 --> 02:18:02.610]
It would be some cover to think his Mr. Bush cheerfully announced

[02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:05.370]
America will be a stronger place for enduring this crisis

[02:18:05.370 --> 02:18:07.130]
Complacements even no longer suffice

[02:18:07.130 --> 02:18:12.090]
Especially if experts are wet and warning that global warming may increase the intensity of future hurricanes

[02:18:12.090 --> 02:18:15.230]
But since this administration won't acknowledge that global warming exists

[02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:17.110]
The chances of leadership seem minimal

[02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:21.550]
Minimal to non-existent

[02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:22.790]
Your president baby

[02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:25.570]
Those of you who support a man look in a mirror

[02:18:25.570 --> 02:18:28.730]
Stack yourself in the eye with your finger and ask yourself the question

[02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:31.090]
Am I a moron? Am I an imbecile?

[02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:35.990]
Look at that Ray Charles's move he is moving up on the Jimmy Hendrix skin

[02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.670]
Leave it right

[02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:38.830]
Why he keeps bumping into him?

[02:18:38.890 --> 02:18:42.930]
Who is the all-time best black recording artist or group?

[02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:46.830]
Jimmy Hendrix 77 Ray Charles 76 Bob Marley 44 mon

[02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:49.910]
Oh please, Stevie Wonder 32

[02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:51.030]
And King Colesga

[02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.910]
Third man

[02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:52.970]
I find ridiculous

[02:18:53.630 --> 02:18:57.110]
Temptations 29 Michael Jackson 27 Marvin G 20

[02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:59.070]
Otis Redding 11 Prince 10

[02:18:59.070 --> 02:19:01.910]
I mean look at some of these really Armstrong's got nine

[02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:04.050]
But the shy lights don't have any

[02:19:04.050 --> 02:19:06.110]
See what I'm saying? Mary and Jimmy Ruff into it have any

[02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:07.990]
Everyone's star and none Marvel left none

[02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:11.570]
Even Chubby checker Chubby Chubby checkers don't have any

[02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:13.850]
Remember the Chubby checkers in Faso?

[02:19:13.850 --> 02:19:14.410]
I do

[02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:18.230]
Penny LaBelle doesn't have any

[02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:21.410]
Why do I get myself worked up about this?

[02:19:21.590 --> 02:19:22.890]
About people I've been in taste

[02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:23.770]
I don't know

[02:19:23.770 --> 02:19:24.870]
Just for the hell of it

[02:19:25.810 --> 02:19:28.830]
567.0560.560 in the Verizon Singular Revolutions lines

[02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:31.310]
Let's get about 400 calls in between now and two o'clock

[02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:33.190]
Or I could just play like a whole bunch more Motown

[02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:34.810]
WNQA and Hello

[02:19:34.810 --> 02:19:37.930]
Yeah Neil, I was in the war with a few years ago

[02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:40.850]
And there was a little problem with some pumping that they have

[02:19:40.850 --> 02:19:42.210]
They keep the water out and I

[02:19:42.210 --> 02:19:47.310]
Asked one of the people who live there says why would you live where you've got first dams

[02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:49.650]
Not even concrete or something just

[02:19:49.650 --> 02:19:52.970]
Just piles of dirt holding the water back in your under the water

[02:19:52.970 --> 02:19:58.870]
It didn't make much sense why anyway why the government all these years never did anything about it

[02:19:58.870 --> 02:20:02.350]
I mean this one and then the way they build a house in Mississippi

[02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:05.150]
I mean didn't they learn anything from Andrew or Amy's

[02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:08.590]
Those next box houses were too bad for those people

[02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:10.270]
But the houses never had a chance

[02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:15.990]
You know what a reminder well of course keep in mind the poverty level of a lot of people living in those houses

[02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:18.230]
But in reverse some of the people live

[02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.230]
It's just like on the beach

[02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:23.830]
You don't have any poor people living on the beach in Fort Lauderdale or Miami Beach

[02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:26.570]
There's no slipper living over there but they choose to

[02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:30.250]
Yeah, it's a big deal they want to have the view they want to live on the ocean all the other

[02:20:30.250 --> 02:20:34.470]
It's like people that build homes on the top of mountain cliffs in LNA

[02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:36.190]
Well what are they thinking about?

[02:20:36.970 --> 02:20:37.410]
Diane?

[02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:39.110]
Oh you must be eating

[02:20:39.810 --> 02:20:42.530]
I wonder if one of the color man he just disappeared without a word

[02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:50.770]
No the color is gone okay what else did he said his piece man I'm asking you why would anybody wait for the next month slide and put your house on the edge of a cliff

[02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:51.530]
They're stupid

[02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:54.630]
What are you eating now we're gonna give somebody a plug or not

[02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:55.410]

I just don't understand how confused get away with playing the burp sound which can't do the fart sound

[02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:48.250]
Oh I can't say it anymore

[02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:52.370]
No you can say it but I mean that fart and see you're asking me to explain it

Yeah but I mean what's different between a burp and a fart I'll learn a little bit about it

[02:22:01.570 --> 02:22:04.230]
Just take a look at your head and see if it's burping okay

[02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:06.610]
I never burp through my ass that I know of

[02:22:06.610 --> 02:22:07.910]
Did you? No not lately

[02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.590]

Joyce except just keep taking the money in the check scheme clearing we've got the you know

Maybe that's so now I figured out what Troy was going to tell me this morning that's why he ran out because he was spying most coward

[02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:37.350]
Is if I really give a crap that that's what he was going to tell me what the mode the mode business the more you hear the more ridiculous to do

[02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:43.370]

It's it's exist the greatest movie ever made man yeah

[02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:17.070]
Yeah, I just say I got friends of mine as school teacher and I told them about the movie and how he plays it as classes for his children and stuff

[02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:25.350]
Really yeah, I like to tell about that James James and all that stuff I was wanted to anybody mentioned Mississippi bluesman

[02:23:26.450 --> 02:23:33.370]

Those guys in that movie for what the for Robert Johnson really he's a king of the Mississippi blues I'll be banned

Who backed up all the Motown hits I mean all of them they played on more number one hits than the Beach Boys the Rolling Stones

[02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:37.150]
Elvis Presley and the Beatles combined making the greatest hit machine in a history of popular music and virtually nobody until this movie came out

[02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:43.330]
Nobody knew any of their names or what the LA did or what the whole deal was and then then suds

This is 560 QA

[02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:24.950]
Famous making people

[02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:31.990]
I look at famous making people

[02:27:34.650 --> 02:27:40.490]
So every day six weeks Pamela and his wife started with Tommy Lee

[02:27:41.650 --> 02:27:44.730]
The phoneography then prayer is tilted

[02:27:44.730 --> 02:27:49.350]
She made a tape where she went and she stood little to her father

[02:27:50.350 --> 02:27:57.350]
Now she's a son famous make it be this common feral time

[02:27:58.990 --> 02:28:04.350]
Famous make it be our candle lights them young

[02:28:06.350 --> 02:28:11.830]
Look what they do making these tapes to revive all their crappy careers

[02:28:12.810 --> 02:28:20.850]
Everyone is there bumping ugly and when you think that it just could not get any words

[02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:27.830]
Here come traders famous make it be in homemade videos

[02:28:30.370 --> 02:28:32.830]
Famous make it be we

[02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:35.830]
We say put on some clothes

[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:42.140]
A big cake goes in

[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:49.140]
Famous make it be we say

[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:52.580]
We say

[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:53.720]
We say

[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:53.940]
We say

[02:28:53.940 --> 02:29:00.180]
We say

[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:00.800]
We say

[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:07.420]
I'm telling you what the fan of Ross was no getting a head

[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:10.080]
And he also was no Bob Marley mon

[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.920]
No mistake about it

[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:17.500]
One 19 let's say $20 for disaster and if all the pork and transportation goes return to the citizens

[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:19.180]
Do you understand what that means?

[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.260]
Yeah the buildage is passed you know the energy bill I think they're talking about

[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:25.180]
$20 for disaster 80 fall or see

[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:27.440]
Well this is the conflict

[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:32.620]
Long Gonzalez in New York Daily News writes Iraq mess a adds to the problem

[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:37.400]
The battlefields of Iraq seem so far removed from the awesome devastation and near biblical floods

[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:40.460]
Unleashed on New Orleans and the rest of the Mississippi delta by Hurricane Katrina

[02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:43.740]
But these two tragedies are more closely connected than most of us realize

[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:48.920]
Some 7,000 soldiers from Louisiana and Mississippi National Guard are stationed in Iraq

[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:53.300]
They include more than 3,000 members of the 256th brigade combat team

[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:55.160]
A unit based in and around New Orleans

[02:29:55.160 --> 02:30:00.780]
Those soldiers who represent 40% of Mississippi and 35% of Louisiana's regular guard strength

[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:04.000]
Were forced to watch helplessly from their barracks in Iraq to pass few days

[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.060]
As the hurricane swept through their neighborhoods and threatened their families

[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:10.620]
Quite simply the two states are to sit by the storm or handicap from the state

[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:16.160]
Not having enough guard units and military equipment like trucks, humbies and helicopters on the ground to handle the crisis

[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:19.960]
As much as we need them in Iraq we also need them at home Senator Murray Landry

[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:23.180]
Democrat Louisiana Ward on CNN just before the hurricane hit on Monday

[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:30.000]
Yet not until yesterday the president pushed finally take decisive action to provide military reinforcements from other parts of the country

[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.540]
Or even from regular army bases in those states

[02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:35.840]
By then one of our greatest cities was underwater and being evacuated

[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:39.060]
Tens of thousands of its forced residents were shredded and facing catastrophe

[02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:42.740]
Millions were without power and looters that already waited off of all that could be taken

[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:46.940]
People are hurting and people are being vandalized and an editorial plea posted yesterday

[02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:50.800]
On the website of the Sunhael de Baloxi Mississippi. It where is the National Guard?

[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:55.120]
Why hasn't every able-bodied member their own forces in South Mississippi been pressed into service?

[02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:59.020]
Except for the floods the posterer came destruction and near-anarchy in New Orleans

[02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:03.200]
resemble those heartbreaking scenes of the chaos in Baghdad after so-called liberation

[02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:07.220]
Those floods are yet another tragedy that the Bush administration will have to explain

[02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:10.880]
They are in no small way connected to the curse that Iraq has become for our nation

[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:15.020]
Sure no one could have prevented a powerful hurricane from hitting the Mississippi Delta

[02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:20.280]
But federal and local government leaders all knew that it directed on New Orleans from such a storm could mean catastrophe

[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:26.700]
The times picky in New Orleans published numerous articles in the past two years warning that the city and federal officials were prepared

[02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:33.600]
The newspapers articles also revealed that Bush was making huge cuts to an Army Corps of Engineers project meant to shore up the levees and pumping stations

[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:36.900]
That protect other residents from the waters of Lake Ponce and train in the Mississippi

[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:42.020]
That project known as the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control project has been in effect since 1995

[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:45.720]
But spending on it's been reduced substantially since 2000

[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:50.380]
It appears the money's been moved in the president's budget to handle homeland security in the war in Iraq

[02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:54.780]
And I suppose that's the price we pay the emergency management fee for Jefferson and Perish Louisiana

[02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:59.520]
Told the times picky in last year nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished

[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:04.900]
Earlier this year, Bush, this president who is spending more than a billion dollars a week on the mess in Iraq

[02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:08.860]
proposed less than $11 million in new funding for Louisiana Flood Control project

[02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:11.400]
The Army Corps of Engineers won at least 62 million

[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:15.120]
Among the items the White House cut from that flood control budget was money to study

[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:17.800]
How New Orleans could cope with a category 5 hurricane?

[02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:23.060]
Well the entire country learned how this week will all be paying for that terrible lesson for decades to come

[02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:28.980]
Nice going, W. At thanks again for those bargain basement gas prices

[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:33.880]
5.670560, Pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless lines

[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:36.680]
Ray Perry in yet in what the stress?

[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:39.540]
You know and you notice how nobody says anything about this

[02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:43.500]
It's just like kind of want to live in a slide, you know? Nobody like addresses that issue?

[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:46.680]
That's right they won't. WQ, they will. WQAAM, hello.

[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:51.800]
And now a few minutes ago, college that huckin people behind dams and got me thinking

[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:55.900]
That was keeping us from being flooded is levees around Lake of the Trilv

[02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:59.780]
I just wonder if the storm had hit here as the strength that it did in New Orleans

[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:01.580]
If those levees in Lake of the Trilv

[02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:04.820]
What have I got news for us sir? And you know as well as I do a storm

[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:10.380]
If we had a category 5 direct hit on Dayton Browell Lake, say the Dayton Browell line, forget about it

[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:13.260]
Back in the 30s I think that's what killed thousands of people in Florida

[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:18.880]
Was a the levees broken Lake of the Trilv and then flooded here. All right Jerry, thanks.

[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:22.400]
Good luck. Good luck to Pally. Don't have any flooding here.

[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:27.000]
5.670560 is a matter of fact probably cast an ova is checking it out

[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.280]
What's the temperature there in Toronto? Neil, I'm glad you asked. In fact, it's a sunny 77 right now

[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:41.180]
As in 77, huh? All right. That's not a WABC. Yeah. Not too bad. Sun's trying no rain, no floods, no end of the world.

[02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:46.660]
Concord, no hamshur. I'm sorry. Concord, no hamshur. I always do that. It's Concord, Michigan. Concord.

[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:50.980]
The state is investigating a doctor accused of telling a patient. Did you see the storm in the news? No.

[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:58.080]
Telling a patient that she was so obese, you might only be attractive to black men and advising another to shoot herself following brain surgery.

[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:04.980]
Let's face it. If your husband were to die tomorrow, who would want you the state board of medicine said Dr. Terry Venator told the overweight patient in June 2004?

[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:11.140]
Well, men might want you, but not the types you might want. Might even be a black guy quoted in the same based on the women's complaint.

[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:20.340]
The board said it's also taking a second look at a 2001 allocation deemed unfounded at the time that Venator told a woman recovering from brain surgery to buy a pistol and shoot herself.

[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:25.020]
And they're suffering. Venator made that. And as a matter of fact, that's a good idea for a mole.

[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:29.800]
Okay, put yourself out of your misery and just blow your brains out if you can find them. In fact, stick it in your echo.

[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.940]
Venator made national news last week when the complaint from the obese woman became public without any mention of the racial comment.

[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:41.880]
But senior assistant attorney general Richard Head, who leads the state consumer protection anti-trust bureau said Tuesday,

[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:47.440]
the woman complained about the racial remark not about being lectured. In a telephone interview Tuesday from Rochester, New Hampshire,

[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:53.640]
Venator denied any wrongdoing and defended his message to her saying that he has read polls that say that black men prefer overweight women.

[02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:58.400]
Venator added that he's angry. The board, the board is reconsidering the 2001 complaint.

[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.880]
That patient is currently in a nursing home completely demented tied to what she or drooling on herself and doesn't recognize anybody said Venator 67.

[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:15.860]
She was in pretty nearly that condition at the time she filed that complaint. Venator's lawyer Charles Douglas said his client is being attacked by the board, which by its own rules, does not discipline doctors for bedside manner.

[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:21.240]
If a patient doesn't like the message, go to another doctor, Douglas said. Head said that he has got a point.

[02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:28.000]
Right? Head said the 2001 complaint has been considered as part of a review of Venator's overall adherence to medical ethics.

[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:30.820]
Oh, doctors and ethics, wonder how do they have anything to do with each other?

[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:36.200]
The state consumer protection anti-trust bureau investigates complaints against doctors, though the board decides how to act on them.

[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:39.380]
Head said the privacy laws prevent him from disclosing the woman's names.

[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:47.620]
The board can find, refermand or suspend doctors. It can also be evoked doctors licenses or require them to attend classes or treatment a hearing is planned December 7th.

[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:55.980]
Earlier this year, Venator rejected an effort by the board to resolve the latest complaint. The board wanted him to admit he made a mistake into a ten to class on medical ethics, which he called Touchy Feeley School.

[02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:57.620]
Never go to Touchy Feeley School?

[02:35:58.060 --> 02:35:59.040]
No, where is it? I liked it.

[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:09.860]
Venator previously was cited by the board in 1995 when as part of a settlement to a board discipline, he admitted lying on his 1992 and 3 medical license renewal applications about being denied hospital privileges and was fined a thousand years.

[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:19.040]
It's a fraternity. It's like lawyers and all that. It's like sports casters. Same thing. It's a big fraternity, everybody just, you know, dummies up and sucks up big time.

[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:23.900]
Speaking of sucking big time, that advice to all the nice admission game is to that who's that plan? Atlanta.

[02:36:24.380 --> 02:36:30.160]
Oh, the Falcons. That's right. Oh boy. And you're not going to get to go because you don't have any tickets to the game. Yeah, wonderful.

[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:38.620]
Get them by the season opener. Ray. I think I'm going to have to look in my contract right after the show and take a look and see what it says about those tickets, about those duckets.

[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:43.500]
Get them in the road. No, that because that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to duck it. They're trying to duck the issue.

[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:51.240]
What if I wanted to go to all the preseason games? Well, probably would have been a good idea if you'd open up a month before the preseason started. That would have helped me out.

[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:57.540]
Right. But of course, do I care about the dolphins or their stupid exhibition game or the regular season game or any of these things? No.

[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:00.760]
I'm going to have the money. Like I said, right. Keep the tickets. I'll take the cash.

[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:08.060]

[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:42.820]
the shadows of Motown and it's just seriously when they sit down and they

[02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:45.920]
start when they get together and start jamming and man they're playing all those

[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.740]
songs like we're here today and it's it's exactly I mean precisely exactly

[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:55.240]

and when you say Miami you're so fucking toilet bowl but they're the Miami Dolphins

[02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:20.440]
Miami Dolphins Miami Dolphins number how many teams in the lead

[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:28.900]
