[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960]
That's his own sugar!

[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.380]
What are you gonna do in Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown?

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.380]
It ain't cool being no child.

[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.340]
Turkey is so close to Thanksgiving.

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.180]
What kind of turkey are you looking for?

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.760]
A salmon.

[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.620]
They can do turkey!

[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.400]
No, no, no, no!

[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.360]
Dude, we need your turkey for our land!

[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.220]
Right, George.

[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.060]
Starting to eat this turkey.

[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.220]
My off-board brain.

[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.240]
What did you expect?

[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.140]
A turkey?

[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.700]
This is a birdie.

[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.520]
I don't like a bird.

[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.200]
I don't like a bird.

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.320]
I don't know how to go in.

[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.600]
I don't know how to go in my home.

[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.820]
Maybe I'll let you put your tongue in my head.

[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.000]
I don't like my way.

[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.660]
I don't know how to go in my home.

[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.240]
I don't know how to go in my home.

[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.540]
And I need you to move.

[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.100]
Boy, I feel a Thanksgiving.

[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.060]
You got a Thanksgiving.

[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.500]
I can't cook the Thanksgiving dinner.

[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.880]
All I can make is cold cereal and maybe toast.

[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.380]
Well, I cooked the turkey.

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.580]
Why do you mean you cooked the turkey?

[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.180]
You didn't cook me the big finale when the turkey jumped to the ring of fire.

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.280]
What kind of a Thanksgiving dinner is this?

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.820]
It was the Thanksgiving dinner.

[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.880]
Did you see that?

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.580]
I'm impossibly large bird.

[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.520]
For all of that wood.

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060]
I love the day you're here.

[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.520]
These idiots that are heat frying the turkey.

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.040]
They're a stir-up of the news on that last night.

[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.500]
Did you see that?

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.320]
I did not.

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.420]
And people are burning their houses down and deep frying.

[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.580]
Everybody's into, well, what was wrong with the old traditional way?

[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580]
Just cooking the damn thing in the oven?

[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.880]
Or on the flavorway would be good.

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.200]
Now what?

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.920]
You got to get an extended.

[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.540]
Get the extended.

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.220]
It's like a big plastic ring and you stick your ring on the thing and you can put even a big bird in there.

[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.540]
That would imagine it's great.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.220]
Anyway, we're not going to waste any words today.

[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.440]
It's Thanksgiving Day and Josh Cordis is on the other side eating donuts.

[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.580]
I would eat too many of those.

[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.260]
Spore your appetite for mom's fantastic Thanksgiving feast.

[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.300]
I wouldn't worry about that.

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080]
And if she's a really good cook, they'd even say.

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.760]
She is?

[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.500]
Good.

[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880]
That's all you said the other day.

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.120]
Anyway, here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.360]
Who's the ugliest WQM personality?

[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.540]
1304 votes and a Humper.

[00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.340]
Oh no.

[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.320]
I just second time in the desert.

[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.200]
I think four years ago, maybe five years, we took this poll last time.

[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.620]
And a Humper keeps winning.

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.800]
Nobody can touch the Humper.

[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.840]
Speaking of the Humper, I actually got his breakfast order from Howeys.

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.700]
You just got his breakfast order from Howeys?

[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.040]
That's right, because you were wondering.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.660]
Yeah, I actually got it yesterday.

[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.680]
Oh, but you're going to be surprised.

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000]
All he gets is a coffee and an English muffin.

[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.740]
And an English muffin, which is all carbs.

[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.460]
That's not a good idea.

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.380]
You see, he'd be better off getting an omelet and maybe some bacon.

[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.340]
He doesn't get it.

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.060]
He doesn't understand the carbs thing.

[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.000]
And I write, that's all right.

[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.480]
One of these days will all be dead.

[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.960]
Who's the ugliest QM personality?

[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.580]
Hank Goldberg, 421.

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.460]
Moe Howard, David at 337, who I guess is done for the week, huh?

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.340]
That's right.

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.320]
He's done for the week.

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000]
It said Curtis was going to fill in for him tomorrow and now the beast.

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.960]
And you just hear what he said.

[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.080]
He's going to be filling in for Moe.

[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.560]
I wonder if Moe's happy about that.

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.040]
But he's a little forked off about that.

[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.460]
Absolutely.

[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.260]
Anyway, Moe comes in second.

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.380]
He was given Hank a little one-fourth for Wilder.

[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.420]
337.

[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.720]
Very respectable second.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.740]
The beast comes in tied for third with Joseph Gackie.

[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.340]
Old Weenie Puss.

[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.020]
139 apiece.

[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.020]
Yours truly, I come in fifth, 125.

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.620]
I'll work on being a little uglier if that's possible.

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.080]
George Rodriguez, way down.

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.260]
After the top five, it's way down.

[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.200]
George got 47.

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.160]
Gildey's got 22 votes.

[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.680]
Lini Martez 15.

[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.160]
But then again, nobody's ever seen Lini.

[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.960]
Orlando Wells Aquiri's got 15.

[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.680]
But even though he's got 15 votes, he's still rock solid.

[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.580]
Maggog 15.

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.520]
Eddie K. 12.

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.280]
Troy Stratford.

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.460]
A Curtis Stevenson 6.

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.680]
And three people had to co-hones the stones to move for Big Kimbobo camper.

[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.520]
A big, ugly guy.

[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.520]
Okay, we got a pool today.

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.920]
What's your take on the Marlins leaving South Florida?

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.000]
Not looking too good, George.

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640]
No, he's not an arcroud.

[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.540]
They're not like, especially considering this is your Marlins station.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.360]
228 votes.

[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.480]
What's your take on the Marlins?

[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.800]
At least they're threatening to leave.

[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.260]
We're leaving.

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.240]
I'll pack them a sandwich, 65.

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.440]
I don't care a bit, 56.

[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.820]
Who cares not that they've done so much talent?

[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.940]
They're having to make fire sale.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.660]
28 people said to hell with them.

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.220]
I missed baseball somewhat.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.000]
28.

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.580]
I'm pissed off 15.

[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.900]
They're just bluffing 14.

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.080]
They'll get a stadium 11.

[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.100]
They can't leave.

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.140]
Josh needs that job.

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.460]
8.

[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.560]
And I'll miss them badly.

[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.360]
Oh, only three.

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.140]
Only three.

[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.380]
That's pretty weak in it.

[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.220]
So in other words, the first four categories, you got like, uh, 120.

[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.440]
One hundred.

[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.620]
By almost 150, I'll turn 28 votes like, uh, bye-bye.

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.220]
Go away.

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.580]
Let the door hitch in the ass on the way out.

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.780]
People are getting tired of it.

[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.160]
At any rate, we're going to play a comedy bits today all day.

[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.180]
You know, we could take requests.

[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.300]
But first of all, Josh has got a lot of food eaten there.

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.680]
So he's definitely not going to answer the phone.

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.400]
And I'm sure he's not.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.980]
No.

[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.640]
Not showing up here on Thanksgiving Day.

[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.860]
And secondly, we could have your facts in you, required.

[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.540]
Well, we could take one WQYM.

[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.760]
Hello.

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.600]
Take a morning, Neil.

[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.200]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.300]
And you too.

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.900]
You know, the Marlins organization is becoming just like woodbying.

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.460]
Give me the money and nothing in return.

[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.080]
Right.

[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.800]
Yeah.

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.480]
OK, thanks.

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.820]
Well, by the way, I told you those Panthers last night, I tried.

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.080]
I tried little psychological edge there.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.580]
They're going to win.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.520]
I said four to three.

[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.120]
And Josh goes to the game last night.

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.600]
And by the end of the first period, you could have left.

[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.560]
That was a tragic.

[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.180]
I did.

[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.020]
I did.

[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.700]
You did leave after the first period?

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.940]
I told you they scored three goals in a minute.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.560]
I know that.

[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.660]
I tried to answer the period.

[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.020]
I mean, I asked the coach if you want to meet a throw of a skate sound.

[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160]
Maybe I could block a few shots or something.

[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.660]
Well, we're going to try that next home game.

[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.200]
We're just going to stick your ass in the net.

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.120]
OK, that's it for my comments.

[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.700]
I said four!

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.900]
Just sit back and relax and enjoy.

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.940]
Rolls it.

[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.320]
Crying.

[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.120]
I said four!

[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.420]
Suffer.

[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.760]
The Holy crap.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.560]
All is one in my life.

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.440]
It came out of God as me.

[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.020]
Now it's windy, the greatest tree.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.260]
It is buried by ice.

[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.720]
Someone please cover the ice.

[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.060]
Silent heart.

[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.600]
Deadly fog.

[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.400]
My cheeks were spread apart.

[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.900]
Bracket.

[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.400]
Silent heart.

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.480]
Full of methane.

[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.420]
It don't smell.

[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.580]
I can't be pain.

[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.280]
Left a cloud so stinky and green.

[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.280]
It cleared out the dust in the deep peace.

[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.740]
It ran out of my bum.

[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.080]
Left a cloud so stinky and green.

[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.080]
I said a line at the cashier.

[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.400]
Here the one.

[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.900]
I was in front of you, dear.

[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.280]
If you don't, you lose.

[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.400]
I got the tamarind glue.

[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.700]
I'm dynamical.

[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.840]
All I heard today was,

[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.500]
Hey, that's the hell out of my way.

[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.320]
Get out, oh baby, get out.

[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.300]
I got the tamarind glue.

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.280]
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.260]
Okay, just, from me, my friend.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.460]
It's your life, it's near the end.

[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.280]
Oh, the queen of earth showed with magnet.

[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.440]
You'll get the tamarind glue.

[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.620]
There's a marvelous place I know.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.600]
Oh, well, the wealthy people go.

[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.080]
It's where royalty play follow.

[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.000]
And that's what I like about Voka.

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.500]
A downway he goes on never small.

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.680]
A downway they say, help, call.

[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.620]
And every corner has a ball.

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.480]
And that's what I like about Voka.

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.080]
Then 10 grand on Voka's piece.

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.240]
And the day in Jewish favourites,

[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.500]
you shall taste these delicacies.

[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.860]
That's what I like about Voka.

[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.440]
But please admit you are out of the woods.

[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.740]
And our BMWs are a wee fine pleasure in being rude.

[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.460]
That's what I like about Voka.

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.800]
Who'd you built the Rolex watches?

[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.780]
When shoes make us so much.

[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.020]
If your clean will let you touch us.

[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.560]
And that's what I like about Voka.

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.960]
We really don't care what you think.

[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.200]
You see, our do-do doesn't stink.

[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.340]
There's no coffee.

[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.400]
And it's only Voka.

[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.060]
And that's what I like about Voka.

[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.080]
That's what I like about Voka.

[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.080]
That's what I like about Voka.

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.680]
It's the bloodiest movie of the year.

[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.000]
Help!

[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.100]
Just in time for Thanksgiving.

[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.820]
It's the Texas Turkey massacre.

[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.060]
What can I say?

[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.920]
It's a turkey.

[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.480]
A big fat turkey.

[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.200]
Go!

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.460]
And set your turkey free.

[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.720]
The Texas Turkey massacre.

[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.520]
Just look at the big finale with a turkey junk to the ring of fire.

[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:56.880]

[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.100]
Help!

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.720]
Help!

[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:58.840]
Help!

[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.160]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.080]
This is by Stephen Faye.

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.620]
The New Year.

[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.420]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.300]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.680]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.460]
It's so many, so many, so many, so many, so many.

[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.180]
With a baseball cap and a silk cardigan.

[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.140]
It's so many, so many, so many, so many, so many, so many.

[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.780]
It's a turkey.

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.480]
One down, check it out.

[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.280]
A mint condition.

[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:35.920]
It's a turkey.

[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.340]
And that's it.

[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.220]
Now I can't think of no one who's making me mean.

[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.920]
Or then that's it.

[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.200]
A little old lady from Aileia.

[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.000]
She crawled and she saw she's a real born.

[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.640]
She's the terror of hell.

[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.980]
And they'll be full of her.

[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.240]
She's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.080]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.240]
It's so many, so many, so many, so many, so many, so many.

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.400]
You've got your open-air like you never see young.

[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.340]
It's so many, so many, so many, so many, so many.

[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.720]
Don't try and blow your gonna to agitate.

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.060]
Because you'll only keep stuck in all the respirators.

[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.800]
Now I can't think of no one who would make me mean.

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.660]
Or then that's it.

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.940]
A little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.680]
She crawled and she saw she's a real born.

[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.380]
She's the terror of hell.

[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.720]
And they'll be full of her.

[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.040]
She's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.040]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.040]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.780]
It's a little old lady from Aileia.

[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.040]
This station presents Real American Hero.

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.300]
Today we salute you, Mr. Elderly Turkey Carver.

[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.740]
You're in no spring chicken grandpa.

[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.420]
You've lost control of your memory and your bladder.

[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.720]
But not the most dangerous item in the kitchen.

[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.180]
The electric knife.

[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.100]
Leserman, whatever, link wish the task at the onset of blindness.

[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.200]
But user, look past those cataracts and see your holiday duty.

[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.780]
And when you drool on the bird, it's almost like they see.

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.080]
So the next time you're cowering under the paper,

[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.880]
open beyond hope the deluppable old coof doesn't saw right through it.

[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.440]
Raise a mango drumstick in salute to Mr. Elderly Turkey Carver,

[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.120]
a real American hero.

[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.620]
You're shaking so much there's no reason to plug it in.

[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.020]
Hey, Ferrell, by the way, sir.

[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.600]
I've been given it some stores.

[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.080]
Oh, what do you think it is?

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.680]
I know that we are new in the new, much better go in sixth again.

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.520]
And on it vibes, a gentile in the cranky tube.

[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.360]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.720]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.980]
You got a happy way we beg.

[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.760]
Stressed on two tights, no chance of toys show a kill.

[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.400]
And I'd rather die with the grassy together.

[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:50.640]
Why, I'll help you know that I'm a big monkey, Jew, a Brooklyn high.

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.320]
I've been raised by everybody but you.

[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.440]
You're not my target.

[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.960]
Me and all this crap would blow.

[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.840]
No way that if we had a fight that you'd survive.

[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.140]
Good one, I hear a gentile.

[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.420]
And pushing tight, that's grassy together.

[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.160]
So what do we do?

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:16.920]
So what do we do?

[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.700]
So what do we do?

[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.200]
So what do we do?

[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.960]
So what do we do?

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.320]
And so would you and me, for me, is much better 6-10 than that fight.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.060]
It's only right that I should get for sleep at night.

[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.900]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.820]
So what do we do?

[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:59.980]
So what do we do?

[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.340]
So what do we do?

[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.060]
So what do we do?

[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.500]
So what do we do?

[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.320]
So what do we do?

[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.160]
So what do we do?

[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.120]
So what do we do?

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.720]
So what do we do?

[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.740]
So what do we do?

[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.880]
How it everybody said about the bad?

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.180]
The bad is the way it is, the bad is the way it goes.

[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.740]
The bad is the way, the bad is the way it goes.

[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.880]
So what do we do?

[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.200]
So what do we do?

[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.960]
So what do we do?

[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.100]
So what do we do?

[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.060]
I'm a man where I don't shoot now

[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.480]
I'm a man where everybody knows I'm bad in the world

[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.320]
I'm a man where I'm a man where I'm a man

[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.140]
I'm a man where I'm a man where I'm a man

[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.460]
It can strike any time anyway

[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.120]
I was at the express checkout and got this uncontrollable urge to grope by melons

[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.500]
With Don and I, it can help

[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.560]
I began to suspect the problem when I started shopping my bra

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.940]
Women today are facing a reflection the likes of which the world has never seen

[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.440]
Madonna know

[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.360]
Yeah, we uncorrect as it is when we notice an overexposure to Madonna

[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.360]
Let me loot all she behaved in lavatory animals

[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.220]
Who would have thought the rat could hold

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.660]
But there he is hold

[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.420]
We here at Madonna can bring you back

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.480]
Using the special D-programming techniques we've developed

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.160]
Boy toy boy toy

[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.480]
Law a face of husband's mouth

[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.860]
No, it's you

[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.780]
Who's I realized I'd never be able to get a date with Sandra Bernhardt?

[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.520]
I was fine

[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.140]
I own Madonna on everything

[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.200]
Don't waste a minute

[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.700]
Call Madonna on today

[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.380]
Get in touch with yourself

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.120]
Wait, let me rephrase that

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.260]
Lose the beauty mark and find out who you really are

[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.160]
At Madonna

[00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.520]
All right

[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.480]
In that book I made it clear

[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.580]
Who's I?

[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.680]
The magic book

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.720]
What other men is where I steal?

[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.300]
Who's I?

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.080]
The magic book

[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.300]
At Roger Goldtree I sometimes stare

[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.160]
Who's I?

[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.400]
The magic book

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.300]
I like his walk and I like his hair

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.280]
Who's I?

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.800]
The magic book

[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.680]
I watch his jeans when he strikes

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.660]

I want to get murdered

[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.480]

[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.660]
Are you saying short hair? You mean like Ryan C. Chris Short?

[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.060]
A little longer than that

[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.300]
A little longer like Fabio

[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.760]
I think I'm going to make it short hair

[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.660]
All right honey, don't yell at me

[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.000]

[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.960]
No

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.540]
What kind of van is it?

[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.840]
What?

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.040]
It's a caravan

[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.400]
Is it a caravan?

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.220]
Does it have anything to do with it?

[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.900]
Is it a probe?

[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.700]
No

[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.420]

No you idiot! I'm not coming home! I'm staying at the seven eleven!

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.820]
You don't want to marry me, do you?

[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.300]
No

[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.900]

This is 5.62.00.00

[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.000]
From the twisted minds who brought you Halloween

[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.640]
Comes an entirely new dimension in horror

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.640]
Don't look in the oven

[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.620]
Or you'll experience the stock

[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.000]
Naked telemateries

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.580]
Thanksgiving

[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.740]
A family just like yours

Eat a bird that was once alive

[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.880]
A boy's stuffing child

[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.660]
And they eat until they feel like they're going to explode

[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.500]
People

[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.200]
But it doesn't stop there

[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.580]
Uncle Luther

[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.660]
No, it's time to entertain the inlaw

[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.420]
Is that fish I smell or the dog?

[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.760]
I'm a wajikina

[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.060]
And you'll think they're never going to leave

[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.740]
So, where do I put these suitcases?

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.080]
And just when you thought you could escape

[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.860]
By watching TV

[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.780]
You'd discover there is no way out

[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.320]
Now game number two

Was that a good one?

[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.980]
Help playing in the dining room near you

[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.020]

And all you might miss

[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.420]

Go, a bad economy's good

[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.320]
We're fascinated by jail

[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.380]
No reason to stupid good

[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.500]
All the hours will be

Way more than hell is that

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.100]
Jesus went to Christian Park

[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.340]
Way bigger than the nature's trap

[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.060]
Whoa, my backpack double

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.220]
It rolls the sun

[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.120]
Whoa, you can pull it close to

[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.420]
That never goes down

[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.060]
Whoa, my leg on again

[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.480]
It's where the handle's gone

[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.600]
Jesus went to the top of the rip

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.500]
All your love

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.300]
Whoa, my bank bank

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.120]
Jesus tried to let you go

[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.360]
Whoa, my bank bank

[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.320]
Stand up on your back

[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.260]
To the truth

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.520]
Whoa, Jesus made you

[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.140]
To the doctor fun to me

[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.200]
While they're swung by a dark

[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.280]
You can't hear your voice

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.120]
All the father's ears are turned

[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.780]
All those answers are always

[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.320]
You can't hear what he saw

[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.900]
We're breaking our stakes

[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.240]
We're on the getting the truth

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.780]
You can't hear the stakes away

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.200]
I'm part in a ghost snack

[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.920]
We're ready

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.420]
Whoa, we'll walk with you

[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.160]
It's a great dynamic to play with

[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.260]
Whoa, we're ready

[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.220]
We want to get there, kids

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.060]
We put the fun in

[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.260]
What the best of it

[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.040]
Whoa, race to the Lord

[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040]
We're getting more confused

[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.760]
When your choice of closely appointed humans

[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.880]
Whoa, hit them

[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.840]
Down to the ground

[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.720]
The fight was a show

[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.780]
The story of Billy Everwin

[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.880]
Right and low

[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.560]
Who is this land

[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.960]
The risk is tough

[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.400]
When your hope goes for the hell you die

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.240]
Whoa, we're getting more confused

[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.380]
The risk is tough

[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.480]
We're being arrested

[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.520]
Hate is right

[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.900]
Potato potato

[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.760]
Potato potatoes

[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.540]
Such a beautiful climate

[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.800]
Slowly gonna get you

[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.180]
Tsu little little

[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.540]
Slowly gonna get you

[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.660]
Tsu little

[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.540]
Slowly gonna get you

[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.820]
Slowly gonna get you

[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.040]
Goes torest

[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.560]
We're just cheesecake

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.200]
Where did you find it

[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.520]
Oh you took a volcanic scientist

[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.300]
I'll take the proof and go out to the occupation

[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.700]
I'll get the trial to be planned

[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.320]
Most hope for potential success

[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.680]
I'll take the study for the survey

[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.520]
Calibration should be only there

[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.340]
This will be going to be true

[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.100]
This will be going to be true

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.520]
It can be a lot of work away

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.300]
To make no cry of the heart

[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.720]
I send it to the market

[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.220]
I'll hold all that's in pain and all the silence

[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.600]
I'll take the look and decide

[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:38.680]
All I have to do is follow

[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.240]
Put that and keep in tune

[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.600]
In my doorway, she stands dead

[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.620]
I told her that she is not dead

[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.240]
I said she is not dead

[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.140]
That she is not dead

[00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:25.960]
I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a man, I'm a little bit of a

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:41.500]
man, then he leaves His balls come down to the wall when it grows On a classic

[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.400]
to link the head of things on Cla Us 됩's

[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.400]

[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.700]
I'm going to die!

[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.840]
I'm going to die!

[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.440]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.100]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.780]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:04.820]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.220]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:07.540]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.700]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.580]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.120]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.000]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.380]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.500]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:14.980]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:14.980]

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:14.980]

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.160]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.180]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.500]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.540]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.720]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.020]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:18.680]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.000]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.320]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:20.920]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.060]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.360]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.380]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:30.740]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.600]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.960]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.180]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.120]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.080]
I'm going to die!

[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.840]
I'm going to die!...

[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.300]
I...

[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:43.640]
I'm going to die!...

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.640]

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.340]
Ywwww...

[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.700]
Hey, so he's okay...

[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:45.700]

[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.540]
You're already knowing I'm fine...

[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.760]
Oh, y-y-y-y!

[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:47.840]

[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.040]
You called me so hard at VISTA.

[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.060]
oiii...

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.500]
Oh, yohy-yooo...

[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.780]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is left over at number five.

[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.520]
Oh, thanks, giving day, everybody ate the food that was on their plate.

[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.380]
We had turkey with all the fixings, grandma said, feed up, cause there's lots more in the kitchen.

[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.460]
I had to stop, cause there was so stuff. Five plate fools was quite enough.

[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.380]
I had, what me, doc me, turn up some stuff in, unbutton my pants, cause my belly was bustin'.

[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.880]
When it was time for me to get out of there, grandma gave me the life to tough away our full of gravy potatoes.

[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.740]
I'll be eating all of this until Christmas.

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.900]
I did a bit of stuff and you'd say, home, I found my potatoes and turkey's bone.

[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.700]
A little bit of hand, I'm all laughing for, better need it up before it's fuller.

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.940]
So grandma's all made of signs of cheese, with some in the fridge and the best you'd be.

[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.880]
A little bit of yeah, and then you'll see five.

[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.720]
Peaks with his sandwiches till I die.

[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.280]
Oh, thanks.

[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.840]
Let's go with number five.

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.700]
What will I do?

[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.360]
Make a Honda, got another turkey suit.

[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.120]
My fridge is so full that the dough won't shut.

[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.960]
Turkey, come in, out of my bowl.

[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.980]
Left over is number five.

[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.100]
This is Neil Rogers.

[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.380]
This is 5'16", QAX.

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.940]
I had to buy a Cadillac.

[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.300]
I'll get a ticket to the hill.

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.240]
I wish I had my money back.

[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.340]
And don't do much good damage to it.

[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.520]
Those dragons have the toughest way.

[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.760]
Those greedy challenges fall.

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.800]
And that could be living for a land.

[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.160]
And now we're getting rough.

[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.120]
Look at the Cadillac, right there.

[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.000]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.240]
Absolutely Cadillac, right there.

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.220]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.740]
This way those yeas girl with parables.

[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.760]
We cook chocolate, drop the grill.

[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.380]
Fire up the jet by fire.

[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.240]
And blow those towels into air.

[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.120]
I'll get a Cadillac, right there.

[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.140]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.340]
Absolutely Cadillac, right there.

[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.400]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.620]
Look at the Cadillac, right there.

[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:09.620]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.880]
Foxy Cadillac, Foxy Cadillac.

[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.700]
Go like all the hard burn.

[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.020]
No comforts every time I see.

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:32.160]
No comforts every time I see.

[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.220]
No comforts all the hard burn.

[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.380]
TV, please President of the ****.

[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.320]
Rap however, get muscle in.

[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.100]
And in our table and here to you.

[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.500]
I don't know why they were this one just yet.

[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.140]
But now he's here, first known to them for years.

[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.100]
The President of the ****.

[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.900]
Drop the ****.

[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.760]
Or what I get to, drop the ones more.

[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.280]
And get to we all vote it more.

[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:19.200]
If you want this, don't come low.

[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.080]
It's running stupidly.

[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.280]
And this run is rich yet.

[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.280]
And this run is even lower than me.

[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.460]
Please President of the ****.

[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.400]
Yeah, don't care what it's all.

[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.200]
You got a man by her for a broken picture.

It's a traditional Thanksgiving meal with Turkey and a giant magical giblet.

[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.020]
Harry, are you aware that your giblet is on fire?

[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.040]

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.160]
Fire, Harry, you have released this giblet of fire into Hogwarts.

[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.660]

[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.780]
Well, I don't want to.

Jesus, please, they're super happy.

[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.340]
Never shut up, junk.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.600]
Once his wife gets down, no more.

[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.960]
He can church his wife.

[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.860]

He couldn't make it as a pop star

[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.100]
Until he became a soap opera star

[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.120]
Then he made it as a pop star

[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.860]
Then he quit the soap opera

[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.520]
And he wasn't a pop star anymore

[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.120]
You do the man.

[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.780]
He was Rick Springfield

[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.260]
No one was tonight a judgey star

[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.960]
I'm not a judgey star

[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.020]
You people trying to say I was

[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.320]
In the legitimate rock star just

[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.920]
Because I was on general hospital

[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.020]
Rick Springfield is still in serious

[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.060]
Denial about why he sucks

[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.440]

I don't know what to say

[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.280]
Just admit that the only reason you had a hit

[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.780]
Was because a bunch of women wanted to get in your pants

[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.420]
When you played Dr. Noah Drake on general hospital

[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.500]
I guess you're right

[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.120]

[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.380]
Do you want to get in my pants too?

[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.180]
I'm not a year

It's a big juicy shopping web

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.980]
Look it's show business

[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.580]
You better watch it

[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.600]

[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.800]
We need people in that right

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.380]
Just have to be free

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.580]
You're the only one

[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.100]
You're the only one

[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.640]
You can't complain and say

[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.500]
The freedom comes the bunch for those I write age

[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.320]
It's from the tone of a villain

[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.880]
Who wears a spread-n-art weight

[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.320]
And the world

[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.140]
The democracy

[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.340]
That these I write

[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.240]
Each one shows

[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.100]
Desperate now

[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.560]
At least to my common sense

[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.340]
You're the strength

[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.140]
This is going to happen now

[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.000]
So you're supposed to buy it so I can't buy it

[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.020]
Nobody has the idea of the thing

[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.120]
They're going so far

[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.840]
So I'm just one thing

[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.660]
With the way I bought it

[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.360]
Everyday like this and this

[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.520]
That's it

[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.080]
Back and so there

[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.260]
Oh, what a phone they live in a lane of freedom

[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.560]
They have to have started to get rich

[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.120]
And get money to sleep

[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.100]
And bring a bottle

[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.400]
And put a few more heads

[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.880]
And put these semacuey and

[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.080]
And put these things to you

[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.080]
And put them in a bottle

[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.220]
And false alarm

[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.700]
That was our first technical screw-up of the day

[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.960]
We've had so many technical problems

[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.600]
That would be bad when they're not thanks to you

[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.220]
No, no

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.840]
So I enjoy it so far, dry

[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.900]
I'm good, I'm watching some things on my computer

[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.080]
I'll bet you are

[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.960]
I hope it's one ear though you're listening

[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.400]
Because you never know one of these bits

[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.440]
It might be one of those, uh, that's right

[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.400]
Oh, I'm listening

[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.540]
Yeah, better be right on that button man

[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.860]
And better have both thumbs on it and the button too

[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.020]
318 hosts on our pool so far today

[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.200]
What's your take on a Marlon's leaving South Florida

[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.240]
I'll pack them a sandwich 89

[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.980]
That's bad

[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.760]
I don't care a bit 77

[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.020]
I've missed baseball somewhat 40

[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.420]
Who cares now that they dump so much talent 37

[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.100]
It's your Marlon's fire sale baby

[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.680]
I'm pissed off 21

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.200]
They're just bluffing 19

[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.560]
They'll get a stadium 16

[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.960]
They can't charge needs that job 11

[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.140]
And I'll miss them badly

[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.060]
So let me take Ocho only 8

[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.560]
Okay, we got our star set of lineup today

[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.560]
In fact, we're the only regulars that are like showing up

[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.220]
Because we care enough to send our very best

[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.260]
Don't like overdo it

[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.100]
That's why it's always good to play the rack

[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.320]
Don't want to overdo it too much but never less

[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.440]
We got Jesse, Andrew and Todd, Keller, Keller, her at the two

[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.300]
Curtis, Stevenson and Lenny Martez

[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.200]
It for this afternoon

[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.400]
We'll have an interpreter for you

[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.000]
And then just shut it off

[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.400]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:33.600]
This is 5-62-8-8

[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.860]
This is the Neil Rogers show

[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.560]
This is your playing

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.540]
Any questions?

[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.440]
No

[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:52.560]
Back in the day when someone was wrong

[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.980]
We didn't take their crap.

[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.800]
In Pearl Harbor, or when the gens dropped their bombs,

[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.280]
We bombed them bad, and now the Saudis made it aside,

[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.340]
And on our cards our little flags wade.

[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.060]
As that Saudi who loved and retired,

[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.220]
Voice of bombers the wrong way.

[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.200]
And on a barren to be in America,

[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.040]
Where they follow books like chees.

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.940]
The United States of America,

[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.400]
And by woodshed and the green they got this country.

[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.040]
Appalachos to the Augustaise and I just agreed.

[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.020]
I don't want them to be a tax America,

[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.580]
Because USA.

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.100]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.840]
Stop living in the past.

[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.160]
If you want that SUV to drive,

[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.820]
You're gonna need more gas.

[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.200]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.380]
They train us to believe.

[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.500]
And anyone who says that, obviously,

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.900]
And afford to be.

[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.520]
And on a barren to be in America,

[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.400]
Where we take triadly,

[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.020]
When the flag in what has,

[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.740]
With our head in the sand,

[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.460]
It lightly followed the powers that he,

[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.760]
Appalachatik.

[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:44.940]
Washington State's from News on a 65 in Shreem.

[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.620]
Sretcher, part, everything's okay.

[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.780]
In the USA.

[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.580]
Oh, alright.

[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.260]
I went to Dolphin's training camp.

[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.420]
I asked Nick Sabin,

[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.500]
Who will it be?

[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.840]
Will it be AJ?

[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.880]
Will it be Sage?

[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.240]
Here's what Nick said to me.

[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.620]
God's for us, for us.

[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.620]
Or starting QV will be.

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.500]
I think we'll have Nick Dorees

[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.540]
With for us, for us.

[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.520]
Just you wait and see.

[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.120]
I saw an exhibition game

[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.300]
Watching him play was like a bad dream.

[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.680]
I saw him fumble, he dropped the ball.

[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.900]
It made me want to scream.

[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.380]
God's for us, Nick God.

[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.480]
Whatever it is you need.

[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.680]
Your offense has gone to sea

[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.160]
With the corrupt for us.

[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.300]
He can't score to you.

[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.860]
Just for us, for us.

[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.760]
Media, critique.

[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.080]
Absolutely.

[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.620]
If you play for us,

[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.420]
You will be sorry.

[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.800]
I'm not out of here.

[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.200]
I'm not out of here.

[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.040]
I'm not out of here.

[00:51:52.780 --> 00:52:01.880]
I'm not off here, can't ever Strengthen my feelings.

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.320]
This is what is understood by Broys abges.

[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:08.420]
сос.

[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.280]
Don't be ridiculous.

[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.020]
I look очень shy.

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.020]

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.020]

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.940]
I have nothing else to say.

[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.220]
Look at that. How about this?

[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.280]
I was going down there in a mirror mouth.

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.000]
I'm going down the street from you.

[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.600]
I have to go.

[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.820]

I'll hold you over the break. How's that?

[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.040]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts. How's that?

[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:28.620]
I got this.

[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:29.640]
No way!

[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.960]
That was the only color we had.

[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.460]
The things on your nose is blowing again.

[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.400]

Wow, you got things with things.

On your nose and on your face.

[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.300]
And around those posing pimples.

[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.880]
You fall high.

[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.600]
Wow, wow, wow.

[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.420]
I know clothes won't stop this day.

[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.580]
Almost every day I've been.

[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.960]
Am I vain since then I start a table.

[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.700]
I had annoyed, annoyed, annoyed, annoyed.

[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.580]
Yeah, I thought I was going to be a little bit more

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.580]

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.360]
but I thought I was going to be a little bit more

[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.660]
because I'm a 20-year-old guy.

[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.580]
I know that I'm a little bit more

[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:41.060]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:41.660]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.000]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.860]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.980]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.840]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.920]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.300]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.660]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.740]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.560]
but I'm a little bit more

[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.080]

Elle

[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:29.540]

[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:37.580]
It happened when she realized she raised more women

[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.900]
of clouds

[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:45.660]
Barbara Bush has already fell in line

[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.620]
Then she passed me holding crab meat

[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.540]
And she ran for boys with bad things

[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.860]
She got trowskates

[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.700]
And she saw a crick-toe I was dead

[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.340]
And what so far?

[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.640]
What's like she's carrying a bowl of bowl

[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.080]
Between the skies and clouds

[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.720]
What is telling me now?

[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.680]
She doesn't mean to score

[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.360]
As if she's always surprised

[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.400]
She's wiggle when she's caught

[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.380]
Barbara Bush and Molly fell in line

[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.840]
We gave a score of boys

[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.120]
And she pushed that shell back

[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.340]
She's made a wild and wise

[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.180]
We've been sent back

[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.060]
And she'll just find the magic sword

[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.280]
Sound of big bad

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.240]
Barbara Bush we've never done this for dying

[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.920]
I'm a sad baby

[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.060]
I'm a bad baby

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.540]
I'm a bad baby

[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:04.220]
Now from Washington

[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.920]

[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.080]
Jack Cramond

[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.780]
And sitting in for Pat Buchanan

[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.900]
New York Giant Piki Barber

[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.240]
Now here's John McLaughlin

[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:23.220]

[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.560]
Elmo Cliff

[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.320]
While John I have to say

[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:26.740]
Wrong!

[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.140]
Jack Cramond

[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.440]
Well that's not an easy choice

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.380]
Wrong! Tiki Barber

[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.500]
I'm going to have to say to vote wrong

[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.180]
Actual answer for exercise

[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.340]
That wasn't even a choice

[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.300]
Next issue!

[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.540]

[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.420]
Favorite Broadway show

[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.240]
Bringing the noise, bringing the funk or cats

[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.940]
Elinor, I think it's well enough

[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.600]
Well John, I have to say

[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.820]
Wrong! Jackie, Jackie, Pink, come on

[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.480]
Well that's a very difficult choice

[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.080]
Wrong! Tiki Barber

[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.160]
I'm going to have to say right

[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.620]
Not a choice, witty Tiki Barber

[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.720]
You gave it as a lesson, it wasn't a choice

[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.140]
Wrong! Correct response

[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.080]
Cats

[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.620]
He loves them

[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.520]
Next issue!

[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.000]
The cats, the big brothers should be murdered

[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.780]
How? Elinor

[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.360]
It would be

[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.660]
Wrong! Tiki Barber

[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.440]
I know my wrong! Tiki Barber

[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.700]
I don't think they should be

[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.580]
Wrong! Actual answer

[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.020]
Poison pudding! Bye bye!

[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:09.940]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.600]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.600]

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.700]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:10.720]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:10.720]

[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.340]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:11.900]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:12.920]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:27.140]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.900]
I'm going to have to say

I'm going to have to say

[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.380]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:34.940]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.740]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:36.380]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.780]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.520]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:38.540]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.080]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:39.680]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.900]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:42.920]
I'm going to have to say

[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:42.920]

[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:42.920]

[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.960]
this is Neil Rogers

[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.660]
this is five 16 key eight notes

[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.760]
curious

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.580]
It sat on the table

[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.860]
A little too long

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.880]
She prepared that

[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:20.180]
My stomachs weep, what that bird sure smells dumb.

[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.880]
That's why the turkey gives me cramps.

[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.560]
I love things giving.

[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.100]
It's my thing.

[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.260]
So fast me a wing.

[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.000]
Now I'm sick of what a kick.

[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.180]
The USDA shouldn't have put on that stamp.

[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:51.040]
Because that turkey gave me cramps.

[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:59.200]
I had four helpings like some kind of nuts.

[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.400]
And that that turkey kicked me right in the gut.

[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.220]
Now I turn green and I might throw up.

[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.300]
Because that turkey gave me.

[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.360]
That trooper gave me.

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.220]
That turkey gave me cramps.

[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.540]
Well, he's a fellow happy that we've got the money from the daddy.

[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.800]
And if I sent my little daddy,

[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.520]
Oh, with an agenda that's gratifying.

[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:45.440]
Oh, well, he's the tower happy that we've got the daddy.

[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.820]
Well, he's a president, so son, who doesn't have to run?

[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.420]
And when else is on a wedding?

[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.120]
I'd as well just move right in.

[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.000]
He has to go to school.

[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.600]
He went forward with the desire.

[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.200]
So look out all you do.

[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.760]
Get ready for the gas.

[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.900]
He's a tower happy that we see.

[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.580]
We'll give our people rights to weppy.

[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.740]
I mean the tower happy that we love our daddy.

[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.260]
Well, he's a very wealthy dude.

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.820]
With very bad shoes.

[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.120]
Who never cares his shoes by next year will all be screwed.

[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:27.920]
She called.

[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.540]
She called.

[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.540]
Any smart dude with that raise against buddy would pay.

[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.000]
Why do you think they call it?

[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.780]
The Toreal landing raise.

[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.920]
He's a tower happy that we.

[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.820]
Whoa, he'll need to take a king happy.

[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.140]
Whoa, daddy's a tower happy that we know the best of us.

[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.660]
I knew that I was testifying under oath and I told the truth.

[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.740]
And today I am telling the truth again that I did not do this intentionally or noranally.

[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.760]
The Orioles ain't women getting worse with every in and.

[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.980]
But these afraid he's going to lose his job.

[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.160]
So says got a call.

[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.060]
Giambe's in the yard.

[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.860]
But our arrow shows us what's down with a knife and four.

[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.080]
We're talking to you small.

[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.300]
So when you thought the fence is talking to you small.

[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.460]
Making this way of the fences.

[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.480]
The testimony just a bunch of lines have never been.

[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.720]
They're pulling three runs shots with routine flies.

[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.420]
Like a mirror.

[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.700]
Hello, second big box.

[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.140]
There's nothing to gain in everything but lose.

[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.540]
You know, while I was doing a decent work.

[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.660]
I was going to get the 3000 s's.

[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.860]
And I don't think it just makes no sense.

[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.380]
Well, I never thought I'd find the god no god that I've been through the round days today.

[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.120]
Now, the classic set of wheels fixed up so we a rubber would die again.

[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:15.500]
Now, if it didn't kind of get the drink as cold then it dies down to my seat.

[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.780]
I got the candle liquid Gary Yoke.

[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.880]
Oh, baby.

[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.260]
Open that good ought of Gary Gary.

[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.480]
If he didn't do star, baby.

[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.660]
Shining in a building, building in a kitchen, to push his bed, kid.

[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:35.960]
Now, so I bounced down the road in a big, dead as you put that way.

[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.960]
Now, with the hottest stuff, don't get me as a day of it around the beach in the place.

[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.920]
I 1979, my own phone, Catalina.

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.480]
So looking by now, he's my baby, devil, that.

[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.420]
Oh, baby.

[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.100]
Open that good ought of Gary Gary.

[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.960]
If he didn't do star, baby.

[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.440]
Shining in a building, to push his bed, kid.

[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:34.860]
I'd have a window down on the hot summer day because the AC door worked on way.

[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.820]
But this way the pressure loss eats dogs disposed hell against the dusty look in over time.

[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.000]
I'm a back-to-be find.

[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.780]
The shiny ground is no like lie.

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.560]
Thanks, my coffee.

[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.400]
Shining too, but I've been washing it with all the road.

[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.800]
Don't long be a rear.

[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.960]
Open that good ought of Gary Gary.

[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.140]
If he didn't do star, baby.

[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.720]
I'm a shopping crew, throwing open street folks into school.

[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.420]
Star, baby.

[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.440]
Fresh for low interior, be fancy to be.

[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.120]
Star, baby.

[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.540]
And it's that I was感inized.

[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.420]
Language tape number six.

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.620]
The convenience store.

[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.240]
Follow along and repeat.

[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.620]
Yes, I would like a pack of Parliament lights.

[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.340]
Convenience store manager.

[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.140]
Are you with that vitamin late?

[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.100]
Repeat.

[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.680]
You want that, vitamin late?

[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.560]
Repeat.

[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:55.940]
Is these a Parliament light?

[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.460]
Are these one, Parliament?

[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.520]
Customer.

[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.820]
No, neither one of those is the Parliament light.

[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.960]
Wait, no, he-he-he-he's not-no, it's not that one.

[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.140]
You want to fight him in late? Yes, I want the Parliament lights, please.

[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.880]
Is it the only-he? No, the part-the Parliament light.

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.680]
No, no, no, no, get your seats up.

[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.220]
This one right on the left. No, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.140]
The only way to dirty magazine can't you see it?

[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.800]
Where's the laundry hand? It's the Parliament light now.

[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.020]
Turn this teeth over for language tape number seven.

[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.000]
Ordering Chinese food over the phone.

[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.880]
There too, Miami cops with a hot movie.

[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.700]
There on the streets fighting crime.

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.260]
They pop at the handicap space, air.

[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.060]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.420]
In Allendale, Vice.

[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.040]
We got a problem. The grey game is a school of tricks.

[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.400]
Lieutenant, isn't that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven?

[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.700]
Yeah, they're backing down.

[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.180]
Let's go get them.

[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.340]
They'll stop at night, clean up the streets.

[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.760]
Hey, lady, you can't cross. Here you'll have to cross in the light.

[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.100]
They're determined to clean up this much of business.

[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.420]
All right, just there you're under arrest.

[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.460]
Oh, so now you're arresting my wife, what's the charge?

[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.180]
Section powder. Open that purse, let's see that wife stuff.

[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.180]
Yeah, just a thought. She's got over her under bag in here.

[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.160]
For words, sweet love.

[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.420]
From that restaurant, she just came out of. Let's take a minute.

[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.740]
Yeah, very good with it.

[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:31.920]
In Miami cops on a hot movie.

[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.080]
Here on the streets fighting crime.

[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.580]
We're hearing this phone on MBC.

[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.340]
All right.

[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.780]
Down from the street point, fat kid, go.

[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.180]
You can dollar in the garden or the taxes from gold.

[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.060]
Each day honey got money going in.

[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.620]
So when you take them back, get them to private.

[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:09.440]
Go. Go. Go. Go.

[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.300]
That's it.

[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.980]
Take your clothes off, she makes it.

[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.220]
I'm gonna hold you down that I can do for a piece.

[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.320]
Taking up a big roll with all this fat.

[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.640]
You don't need my little girl, you can't wear it that way.

[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.620]
Hey, how?

[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.140]
Hey, how?

[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.260]
Hey, how?

[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.440]
Girls, you can't live with big fat guys.

[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.660]
She know how to make the boldest cry.

[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.360]
Fat guys, she's a shower now.

[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:07.720]
We need to skate like a dog that's out.

[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.720]
What the hell?

[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.620]
Hey, what the hell?

[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.380]
Hey, what the hell?

[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.560]
Fat men, what the hell?

[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.520]
Cry.

[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.100]
Cry.

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:25.580]
Cry.

[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.080]
Whoop.

[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.540]
Cry.

[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.660]
Join the animation, chart guns today.

[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.540]
Have yourself them down on Christian fun.

[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.540]
Throw your friends away, move back you all away.

[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.460]
You're standing your right to a gun.

[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.040]
When you think of all the benefits you're getting,

[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.100]
life will be sweeter when you catch your heater.

[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.940]
You carry a license to be deadly.

[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.280]
Come on and join today.

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.520]
It's the American way to be a member of the NRL.

[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.260]
Hey, for the heat.

[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.000]
Hey, for the chest.

[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.800]
And always, hey, for the head.

[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.680]
Place your belly not bent.

[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.240]
Sharpen your skin.

[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.260]
Feel more comfortable.

[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.680]
Be there to the best.

[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.520]
Your right to all those girls.

[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.160]
Come on and join today.

[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.000]
And you'll be proud to say you're a member of the NRL.

[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:27.860]
Oh, right.

[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.740]
Oh, this is Albert Pryder from Tony Van Records,

[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.400]
inviting you American infidel to buy latest Cat Stevens collection.

[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.000]
You know my homie is right.

[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.020]
Let's take your head off your body.

[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.320]
Got a machete with the real chart play.

[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.060]
I wish I had an American hostage.

[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.380]
Make those ends of the ring.

[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.080]
I was so including this classic.

[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.380]
I was on air plane.

[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.100]
And suddenly with DJ,

[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.900]
their mac is I can bird.

[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.660]
And where is how am I at?

[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:00.620]
I don't know.

[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.180]
I'm in for Diana 16.

[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.840]
What do they want with me?

[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.500]
The money from your purchase does not go to fun terrorism.

[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:10.060]
Really?

[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.220]
It's not time to get off the plane.

[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.980]
Just relax and take it easy.

[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.920]
You're just dumb.

[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.880]
That's your fault.

[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.240]
It wouldn't have been a firewood you.

[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.160]
Find dark skin and a rat.

[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.080]
If you want a detainee.

[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.880]
I don't have any aviation on a classic one.

[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.460]
I ask myself every day,

[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.180]
which American should pay?

[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.260]
Tell me who a new homie is late.

[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.260]
I'm going to show you another one.

[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.560]
I'm going to make a woman.

[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.480]
She let her veil and explore herself.

[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.160]
So buy Newcastlevens collection today from 1995.

[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.100]
Or you can pay with visa, master card or weapons of master drugs.

[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:03.720]
Oh, man.

[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.000]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.120]
This is 5.69.8.

[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.500]
If you want gay or lesbian,

[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.400]
Master's shoot says they come on in.

[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.200]
It's been legal for the heterose.

[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.540]
Wait your case.

[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.200]
Find out how much marriage blows.

[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.840]
I'm my sobbing woman on the tape.

[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.760]
Say I do and then there's no escape.

[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.020]
Two years later you're in the board's cart.

[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.860]
Pack your suitcase head for Logan Airport.

[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.640]
No frills.

[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.440]
I build.

[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.420]
You'll fight.

[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.120]
All night, goodbyes single bars.

[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.960]
Put all family cards.

[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.680]
Now you're the fur with us.

[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.020]
One wedding ring and now things change.

[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.600]
Take a bite to a little strange.

[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.640]
Every morning in the same old bed.

[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.520]
You see the same face until you are dead.

[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.240]
You're fair.

[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:20.260]
The girl practices will be PA.

[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.400]
Can escape I'm just going to do a game.

[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.500]
Careful what you wish for cause trust us.

[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.320]
You wish you were run by a Greyhound bus.

[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.060]
You wear a hat.

[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.760]
The white looks bad.

[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.440]
Call it your late, but it's his great.

[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.440]
Goodbyes single bars.

[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.360]
All family cards.

[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.100]
Now you're the fur with us.

[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.660]
Oh, W.

[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.300]
One tongue-fung call protects us with a guitar on my knee.

[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.020]
Cause they died in Louisiana.

[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.420]
I race cash with a G.O.P.

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.640]
Polka, Treena don't put no blame on me.

[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.580]
When I come from my vacation,

[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.960]
For I've got an opportunity.

[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.980]
Swing your partner round and round.

[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.080]
Now do a little swam through the warless town.

[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.560]
Swam to the left to the right.

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.160]
Here we go.

[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.060]
Swing a little mud to a dosy dough.

[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.800]
Polka, Treena, why can't those people clean?

[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.860]
To the person who needs you and I've been it is for care right me.

[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.760]
Oh, I'm a bloody clown.

[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.500]
Oh, I'm a bloody clown.

[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.880]
I went to Hojis of state and something wasn't right.

[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.320]
I took a walk on down the street and I took out my flashlight.

[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.040]
And I suspected something funny when I told the father's love.

[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.560]
Then I jumped over the wall and then I took out my little stalk.

[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.960]
You told me that I'm some fancy her,

[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120]
So I looked around some more.

[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.660]
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody clown.

[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.420]
A bloody clown.

[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.220]
Spotted it to get up.

[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.900]
A bloody clown.

[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:20.580]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.280]
Next thing we knew, Hojis went on a lost beat.

[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.280]
Rumble ride.

[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:30.740]
Now he's in an LHL charge for double homicide.

[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.440]
And I believe it's the first degree.

[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.160]
Murder is your deal.

[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:47.420]
It's me, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:47.680]
Oh.

[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.500]
My wife picked her car to the mall.

[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:04.000]
She drives my dear country street feet cold.

[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.320]
I wouldn't ride with her no way.

[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.640]
I said I needed there later today.

[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:17.440]
So I'm just sitting on a pension deraille.

[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.860]
Waiting for the only best to take me away.

[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:29.000]
I'm just sitting on a pension deraille with my friend's time.

[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:51.460]
Mmm.

[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.740]
And he enreszt in my bones

[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.700]
When ran why my wife won't leave me alone

[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:02.160]
We've talked it over, but I never win

[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.860]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again

[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.040]
Spoiled so I sit on the pensioned array

[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.680]
Waiting for the lorry busted, take me away

[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.100]
Or you'll get to keep me on the pensioned array

[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.980]
With my free time

[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.300]
And there it is, it's about 10 times

[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.560]
I've been waiting all day in this space

[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.800]
Where's that lorry bupkin?

[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.060]
How the hell are you going?

[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.060]
You've got to catch me, my friend

[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:49.140]
Sister Jean, for that lichy, a sweet and long wood-happy meat

[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.880]
Just the giant two-leafing, sister Jean, that that's a lichy

[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.540]
Sister Jean is a given to me, adding cat milk, not for me

[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.680]
Call her now, you're late too late

[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.060]
She can shake that tasty meat

[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:07.280]
She's right aside of lying to my girlfriend like a real food and some food

[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.900]
Look at her nose, swing it high and throw

[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.960]
We can avoid any fall at all too

[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.840]
Sister Jean, the dance machine, ends with an open fate

[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.020]
She'll knock you off your feet

[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.740]
When you hear her well and chase me

[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.820]
I know that having a gun could knock around it when the music turns me on

[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.940]
I know it sounds happy that I'm so not bad at you

[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.780]
It's been in his heart

[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.120]
Sister Jean, a swing is enough, a shake is coming to turn a fun

[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.820]
That ain't bad for 85, then that gun can really fly

[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:44.280]
She's searching the dance machine, she is searching the dance machine

[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.000]
She is searching the dance machine, she is searching the dance machine

[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.480]
She is searching the dance machine, she is not gang, the dance machine

[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:14.060]
She is searching the dance machine, she is not gang, the dance machine

[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.480]
She is searching the dance machine, she is not gang, the dance machine

[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:15.660]
She is searching the dance machine

[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.700]
It sounds that you hate

[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.980]
But I'm in it and I think they're really great

[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.520]
I doubt that you can't hit a one or two

[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.260]
Much less or eight

[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.180]
Eight sound that you hate

[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.100]
From end from the boys they will surely separate

[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.900]
I tell you what they are

[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.000]
guaranteed you go

[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.660]
Yeah!

[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.160]
I like fingernails on a blackboard

[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.560]
When people crack their neck for their knuckles

[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.140]
When I run, style, we're both together

[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.160]
That just makes me shag...

[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:58.820]

[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.180]
Eight sound you can't dance

[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.440]
But you could tolerate if you were a handsome man I am

[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.760]
And to the list of eight

[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.520]
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate

[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.320]
Scraping on a plate

[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.520]
Scraping on a plate

[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.220]
Here's what I really love

[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:31.340]
You might want to try it

[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.120]
Give me teeth back

[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.880]
In my headphones

[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.520]
Ah yeah, that's more like it

[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.800]
Little more, little more over there

[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.360]
Little more, little more

[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.580]
Eight sound so unique

[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:52.580]
Now let's review so you can really really free

[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:55.180]
Figure nails on a blackboard

[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.760]
When people crack their neck for their knuckles

[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.060]
Rub and style we're both together

[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.620]
Cause it makes me shag...

[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.580]
I like when you sneak your darna gym floor

[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.740]
Rating in a lumen or a window

[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:16.480]
When a guest is just drilling my mowers

[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.960]
That makes me say, no

[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.400]
My boy singing on his record

[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.800]
You can't hold on for a child

[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.740]
If these have give you the shivers

[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.500]
That make you a whiner

[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:39.060]
Hey you go nuts and someone fights their fork like this

[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.540]
But I love it

[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.800]
Here I'll do it again

[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.220]
Do you have a nervous system left?

[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.700]
How about the squeegee wiping a window I crack my neck?

[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.460]
Surprise whips

[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:58.980]
Duffer whips

[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.540]
Oh wait, I got one more

[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.660]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.560]
This is 516 QA

[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.320]
Oh go go go

[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.280]
Daddy you stuck me?

[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.220]
My short video

[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.000]
Daddy you're loser

[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:31.300]
I would best open my pants

[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:36.700]
I got all of the joy in my life

[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.480]
I think mommy cheats on you

[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.360]
But most of all

[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:41.640]
Yes

[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.660]
But if I could just

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.180]
Have a better time pray

[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:49.520]
Still a little white clouds

[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.240]
All of the green burning

[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.420]
Why is the man there always here?

[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.420]
Oh we're told that I'm so wrong

[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.060]
I must have done something wrong

[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.800]
Daddy why don't you get a job?

[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.060]
Daddy he's more like the ear

[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.220]
I'm dropping out of high school

[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.880]
Daddy I'm pregnant

[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.580]
I don't know who the father is

[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.060]
I have to turn chick's heart out

[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.400]
I drove the car into a tree

[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.080]
Can you just send me some cigarettes?

[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.080]
Hey how about a toast for the brideing room?

[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.440]
You change your name today

[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.240]
Daddy I'm getting married again

[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.360]
You should make a promise

[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.980]
And I'll give her away

[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.340]
Dad that's my ass

[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.580]
Standing in the bride room just staring at her

[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.220]
I think I have ciflo

[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.140]
I asked me what I'm thinking

[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.080]
And I said I'm not sure

[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.280]
I know I've got to let her go

[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.200]
But I'll always remember

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.200]
Hey Pop we're moving in

[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.580]
Dad I asked me what I'm a lesbian

[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.360]
This is Debbie

[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.900]
Hi Debbie I'm in the student games operation done

[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.620]
Okay

[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.960]
And some body contouring and some liposuction

[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.860]
And I was wondering if you could tell me to act

[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.280]
And lip augmentation doesn't make a difference

[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.800]
Since I face it for all of these things

[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.420]
And those wondering

[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:56.680]
I always like to stare at it

[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.000]
Well I need to get everything done

[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.480]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing

[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.080]
Okay we don't do that

[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.500]
No could you do breast implants though?

[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.040]
I can't be done but I don't know if they would do right away

[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.980]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.040]
How much?

[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.580]
5,000

[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.840]
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too

[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.360]
Lays surgery

[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.560]
Have the lambs stop crying yet?

[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.120]
Mommy

[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.260]
Excuse me

[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.960]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby

[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.360]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.100]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV

[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:34.980]
Okay

[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.280]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.720]
Well we'll have to see you first

[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.260]
And then if I'm looking actually we can tell you that when we see you

[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.780]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts?

[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:45.280]
Mommy

[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.680]
If you'd like to

[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.940]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.360]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.360]
Yes

[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.860]
Okay, there is a hundred dollar consultation fee

[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:55.740]
That's fine

[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:57.940]
Okay

[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.140]
Okay, my name is Buffalo Bill

[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.960]
Okay, let me give you a little information from you

[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.580]
Mommy

[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.420]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.500]
I understand

[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.940]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.860]
Do you want to come in for a consultation for life?

[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.940]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:18.060]
Okay

[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:19.940]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:20.900]
Or do you want to call me back?

[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.940]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:23.560]
I understand

[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.800]
I got my skin suit and you're pulling like a...

[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:27.120]
Bill

[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.680]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.920]
I understand that

[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.500]
What's the lotion in the basket?

[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:34.840]
What do you like to make an appointment?

[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.880]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.600]
Okay, I will talk to you in the time

[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:38.960]
Okay

[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.900]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:41.680]
Hello

[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.180]
Hello

[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:43.180]

[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.520]
Hello

[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.820]
Hello

[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:48.480]
Hello

[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:48.520]
Hello

[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.420]
It's 30 a day plus gas

[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.620]
Well, I ran in Lincoln

[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.240]
Dasher trend

[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.240]
I drove up in the hill

[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.080]
You want me shirts?

[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.940]
And to recall how it happened

[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:03.720]
Well, it's not like it still gives me change

[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.420]
What a weirdo

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.600]
Followed my map of the star how says

[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.160]
And was shot to see

[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.800]
Sitting on her front porch was

[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.100]
And gently the dawn

[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.840]
Yeah, the lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby

[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.480]
Well, I walked up like I knew her

[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.520]
Hey, do I know you?

[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.400]
When I saw her hesitate

[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.280]
Yeah

[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.600]
But the chloro bone started working then for her

[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.300]
It was too late

[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.300]
For her in my car

[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.140]
And rolled the windows down

[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:43.520]
Yeah

[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.940]
Now she worked my queen and

[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.920]
My baby crown

[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.420]
Could this stupid crown hold me?

[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.660]
And I've got Angelina, your niece

[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.600]
And my basement

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.460]
I've got the basement

[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:04.300]
And I think I'll keep her there with me

[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:04.700]
Hello

[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.780]
And charge her ring

[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.020]
I'm not here in red

[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.380]
Well, I hope she don't mind

[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.380]
I hope that she'll find that she likes us a man

[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.080]
I think I'll pay a spend

[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.940]
How wonderful life is

[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.740]
Where Angelina Jolie in my basement

[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.260]
Yes, the hour is here

[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.860]
Watch gets her friend and

[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.980]
Pour her man in

[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.100]
But I bet you give your last sin

[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.280]
How many?

[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:41.300]
To have Angelina Jolie locked down in your basement

[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.860]
Hello, President

[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.820]
Oh, God, that's it

[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.600]
Don't hurt pressure

[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.940]
Oh, hurt your dog, President

[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.760]
And punch the dog in the basket

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.220]
Oh, what can you get me as?

[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.880]
I can get a little piece of white

[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.840]
I love you, mom

[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.940]
What are you guys doing here at Honolulu

[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.200]
When I wake you, we hear

[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.620]
I move high open

[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.420]
And dress up like honey, even

[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.560]
That's for you

[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.480]
Tell you, you're pushing me to do this

[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.860]
Can't take out that a nice Hawaiian punch

[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.440]
You

[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:10.780]
Wow

[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.780]
The dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog

[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:26.980]
The dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog

[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.020]
The dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog

[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:58.900]
The dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog

[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:28.860]
The dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, you could have gone on the other hand.

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.860]

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:28.880]
In control, I land up.

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:28.880]

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:28.880]

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:28.880]

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:28.880]

[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.540]
But you sure flew quick when it came to sick, Terry Shiloh.

[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.500]
Son of a bush is a foot in your touche now saved by yoans.

[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:46.080]
That's how Georgia, while people drown, you played a round of relaxing doll flow.

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:52.040]
Well, he was on that dash where I already eased my cup of tea that's evidento.

[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:57.800]
Oops, and no one cares to even prepare for the worst scenario.

[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:03.660]
You were the one busy having fun and that's no no.

[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.980]
You'll investigate at a later date, that's real bullshit.

[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.840]
So, I didn't get such a white to once that duck you get locked up so it don't continue.

[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:21.580]
But no one will get planes like with agent plane, no hands will roll.

[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.320]
Of course.

[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.880]
And as for this, if you slap on a wrist and no it's our just file.

[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:27.960]
What a surprise.

[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.920]
Because you're a liar, no one gets fired with each new messo.

[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:38.180]
Nobody, a new death toll, a slip in the poles, that's no problem.

[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.580]
Oh, ill fix it.

[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:44.560]
Your spin machine will deal with new warlings, because that's their job, oh.

[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:50.220]
As per usual, son of a bush is a foot in your touche, you're an asshole.

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.220]
We just don't understand, you got blood on your hands, but what, no brain, no.

[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:57.300]
I'm a problem-solving.

[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:02.900]
You made it obvious that these two most of us, you have no shame, oh shame, what's that?

[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:08.020]
And what's with that smirk, you stupid jerk, when people have died old.

[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:13.300]
Son of a bitch, you should be in peach, then we mean prompt.

[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:17.020]
I knew it was all a favor, get the fuck out, you're here.

[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:18.740]
Jackass.

[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.120]
I'm so popular, like nothing you've seen the whole.

[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.040]
Excuse me, it seems father.

[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.680]
What is it my child?

[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.540]
I have something I must tell you.

[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.360]
What is it my daughter?

[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.760]
Oh father, I'm afraid to tell you.

[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.940]
Afraid to tell me your own father?

[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.860]
I fear I will be ashamed upon our family.

[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:42.960]
Nonsense, I am your father, I love you very much.

[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.860]
You must tell me what is wrong.

[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:46.920]
You promised you was to love me?

[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.420]
Of course my sweet child.

[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:52.940]
Of father's love is not erased by a simple misdeed.

[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.480]
Very well, I am.

[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.420]
I am right now.

[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.160]
Oh, I see.

[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.360]
Do you still love me father?

[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.000]
Of course I do.

[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.340]
But since you're pregnant and not married.

[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.220]
Yes father?

[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:16.900]
I'm afraid I must drag you down to the town square and with the help of my friends and neighbors

[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.140]
I'll stone you today.

[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.280]
My daughter, it is written that this is the punishment for what you have done.

[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.180]
Could you check again father?

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.080]
And I should only be grounded.

[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.260]
The grounding is not what it is.

[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.220]
I must have you stone.

[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.600]
It's the first time that a focus is on a fundamentalist, a Middle East in Canada.

[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.600]
I speak with you, my esteemed husband.

[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.560]
What is it my wife?

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.480]
Oh, I have something to tell you.

[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.740]
I am having an affair.

[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.420]
Oh, I see.

[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.940]
Are you going?

[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.140]
Out to the backyard of your collection stone.

[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.440]
What do you mean?

[01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:03.680]
Yes, I must drag you to the town square where you will of course be stone today.

[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:08.400]
No being as much as you follow the lives of the fucknet family.

[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.180]
And they deal with the many problems that plague them.

[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.860]
Who may I speak with you, my esteemed father?

[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:14.920]
Yes, my son.

[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.360]
And last night I used a little drugs.

[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.180]
Well, what do you know?

[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.200]
You are one lucky boy.

[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.180]
Why is that father?

[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.400]
You are going to get stone two nights in a row.

[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.400]
You are one of those.

[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:33.320]
The guiding she-i.

[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.240]
The guiding she-i, the shot on location, bagged down your ass.

[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.700]
The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Rifle Association.

[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.440]
Let's face, most of us will never be rich.

[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:49.940]
Hell, we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressing.

[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.520]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution.

[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.380]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns.

[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.740]
They scare the shit out of people and timidate them and giving you whatever you want.

[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.760]
That's right handguns.

[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:04.660]
Think about it.

[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:05.560]
Need some cash?

[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:06.540]
Rub a bank.

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.120]
Don't have enough money for fear?

[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.560]
Call the convenience store.

[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:11.920]
Take some chips and pretzels while you're at it.

[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.800]
It's all free if you've got a handgun.

[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.120]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?

[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:16.980]
Kill him.

[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.740]
It's a simple solution of life's complex problems.

[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.860]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner.

[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.560]
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.220]
Buy the damn thing up the street.

[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.200]
Just buy a lot of handguns.

[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.300]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and be considered a population control.

[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.060]
Yes, handguns.

[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.680]
They just might make you fans.

[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.740]
Rocks, rocks, rocks.

[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.920]
You will find what you are looking for at Rock Mart.

[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.540]
Grab a feastful of savings on the Palestinian area's favorite projectiles.

[01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:00.000]
Protest in style with an assortment of fine, atmious and conglomerate rocks.

[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.840]
Many sizes available.

[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:08.640]
Pelt with pride with our handsome selection of metamorphic rock and new imported granite chunks.

Plus, brows are last-minute summer clearance specials on sticks and bottles while supplies last.

[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:27.640]
So, for rock bottom prices on the Palestinian area's favorite projectile,

[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.140]
fling in today to the Rock Mart for a feastful of savings.

[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:36.520]
There's one just a stone slope away from you.

[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.840]
Okay, three minutes to learn. I hope Josh is still awake over there.

[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:40.920]
Oh, what? Yeah.

[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:43.800]
You're not enjoying this?

[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.000]
Oh, this is fabulous.

[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.680]
I love this. Some fantastic craft.

[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:51.020]
And it's good. I would pat myself on the back if I could reach it.

[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.860]
A good variety and a little of this, a lot of that.

[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.140]
I'm thinking maybe tomorrow too.

[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.980]
Huh? I'm thinking maybe tomorrow too.

[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.520]
Now that you mentioned it, okay, we got 391 votes on the pool.

[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.500]
Our goal was 400. I think we got a shot of that.

[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.740]
Oh, you? Where are we at?

[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.120]
Our goal was 400. We got 391.

[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:11.080]
Oh, I think we might be able to put my push in over the top.

[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.420]
Anyway, the question today, very important because they're threatening again.

[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.420]
What's your take on the Marlon's leaving South Florida?

[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.860]
I'll pack them all a sandwich on Route 11.

[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.360]
I don't care a bit 96. I've missed baseball somewhat, 48 kind of look warm.

[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.940]
Who cares now that they dump so much talent, 43?

[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.280]
I'm pissed off, 27. They'll get a stadium, 23.

[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.800]
They're just bluffing, 21.

[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.360]
They can't leave Josh needs that job, 13.

[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.920]
And I missed them badly, so I'm emptying the webby, only nine.

[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.560]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.460]
This is 5.16 Q.A.

[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.480]
Hello, everybody.

[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:52.800]
And this portion of the Neil Rogers of your 12-to-1 hour is brought to you by the Let It 12.

[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:56.800]
One group book by 6.78.11.12.

[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.680]
The Lices of Pizza.

[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.060]
All for me!

[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.740]
A pair of...

[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:01.940]
A pair of...

[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.780]
A pair of...

[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:03.940]
A pair of...

[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:11.340]
A long, long time ago,

[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.020]
It was 1900, and Jesse Helms was just a lad of nine.

[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.160]
And no one knew what was in store.

[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.720]
Just ended the Spanish American War,

[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:33.040]
So they ported like it was 1899.

[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.840]
There were events that made you shiver,

[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.300]
But then what times we did deliver?

[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.460]
A promise that was kept,

[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.660]
With that famous one small step,

[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:54.200]
I can't remember each event,

[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.140]
Or everything that man did invent.

[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.720]
A century we will present.

[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.360]
This is how it went.

[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.580]
My, my how the time it did fly,

[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.060]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.760]
For the centuries,

[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.380]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:26.240]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.600]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.220]
It all started when two guys were right,

[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:39.620]
When they ported their blame into flight,

[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.660]
And the start of radio,

[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.660]
Signified had his mum to thank,

[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.940]
And once in theory,

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.440]
And that's why,

[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.660]
And the Titanic, that story,

[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.840]
We all know.

[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.100]
Well, World War I,

[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:03.500]
It soon began with shooting arch-dough,

[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.120]
Princess Herd and Ness,

[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:07.760]
Millions died from the flu,

[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:11.160]
And play Stinky was brand new,

[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.120]
And then Russia had its revolution,

[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:19.100]
And a mark connected both the fioships,

[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.100]
And now for least we won't see again,

[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:26.540]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.780]
And we were singing my,

[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.240]
My how the time it did fly,

[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.680]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:36.800]
For the centuries,

[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.040]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.020]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:45.460]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.140]
I would add his relative a teen,

[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.360]
A masterpiece to the new model T,

[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.660]
And the birdland didn't hear family.

[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.680]
Then some moldy bread gave,

[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.840]
And a sill in Wall Street,

[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.600]
And the great deep ration,

[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:11.140]
And women would both like you in need.

[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:16.880]
And Germany's Chancellor was sworn in,

[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.100]
And World War II would soon begin,

[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.100]
Make your retirement land.

[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:29.980]
The project meant her 10th Annabalusian trial in Tennessee,

[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.440]
We caught a first one at TV,

[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.900]
Then the date and its in infamy,

[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:41.500]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.760]
And we were singing my,

[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.220]
My how the time it did fly,

[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.640]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:51.780]
For the centuries,

[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.040]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:57.020]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.360]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.380]
When flame went,

[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.240]
And they were soon be winning,

[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.660]
Starting with the day invasion,

[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.360]
But at what an appalling cause.

[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:17.940]
In Russia no one did the frost,

[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:21.320]
And Germany they find these laws,

[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.920]
Discovered the horrors of the Holocaust.

[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.820]
Fat man little boy and all the game,

[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.360]
Change the whole world on that very day,

[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.680]
Meadow had just begun,

[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:41.400]
And trying to move by the sea tongue,

[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.340]
The first player in baseball that was black,

[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.720]
Is real guy there homeland back,

[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:53.660]
Massachusetts, I like the jack of the home,

[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.240]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.760]
And we were singing my,

[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.220]
My how the time it did fly,

[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.660]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:06.800]
For the centuries,

[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.980]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.980]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.340]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.080]
Separate for evil made such a fuss,

[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.660]
A roasted two-time went on the bus,

[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.800]
Holyoke cured with a vaccine.

[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.680]
Then my shots get us big time,

[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.240]
With spot nick, our troops into Korea quick,

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.760]
Discovered the double-keylet scheme.

[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.740]
Oh, JFK let us wait too soon,

[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:49.960]
But promise to get us all to the moon,

[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.080]
You're his first in space,

[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:56.340]
Yeah, the pill we did it raised,

[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:57.960]
And the French said,

[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.220]
And climbed into the night,

[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.640]
Cubusness also gave us quite a fright,

[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.060]
The Southeast Asia is on to fight,

[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:11.380]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.680]
And we were singing my,

[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:17.160]
My how the years they did fly,

[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.680]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:21.740]
For the centuries,

[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.940]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:26.880]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.520]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:37.540]
Niels Giants step with the big news,

[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.560]
Rovers way gave women right to choose,

[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:45.480]
Mixing resigns about water gates.

[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.000]
Got the troops at a Vietnam,

[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.480]
And hostages taken by Iran,

[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:59.460]
And a virus made us too scared to go day.

[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.140]
A test to babies held the loft,

[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.540]
Some guy named Bill started Microsoft,

[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.080]
Chernobyl explosion,

[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.620]
The Berlin Wall gets broken,

[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:21.040]
The USSR says goodbye,

[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.340]
Some students in China they did cry,

[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:28.780]
Seven died in the Florida sky,

[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.180]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.260]
And we were singing my,

[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.300]
My how the time it did fly,

[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:46.500]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.980]
For the centuries,

[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.400]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.780]
It all happened in the blink of a night.

[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:58.240]
A hundred years have gone by.

[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.980]
We were singing my,

[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:05.440]
My how the time it did fly,

[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.880]
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,

[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.200]
For the centuries,

[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.000]
Time that we say goodbye,

[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:17.980]
Cause a hundred years have gone by.

[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:18.980]
Oh!

[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.160]
Oh!

[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:33.960]
Talk to me,

[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.560]
Tell me your name,

[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.880]
You blow me off like it's all the same.

[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.040]
You made an excuse and run,

[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.000]
Taking away like it's wrong.

[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:44.860]
Yes, baby.

[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:47.380]
You pay, you pay.

[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:50.820]
Oh baby, when she moves, she moves.

[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:54.040]
I go crazy, because she moves like it's wrong,

[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.520]
But she stays like a bee,

[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.820]
Like every girl in this tree.

[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.660]
She makes, she makes.

[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.000]
No words for me,

[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.860]
They were all the times in my head.

[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:12.400]
No words for me,

[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:13.000]
No words for me,

[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.820]
No words for me,

[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:18.340]
At the young children's house,

[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:24.680]
They're right we not want to grow,

[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.900]
That is from ourselves.

[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.020]
You don't know what,

[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.400]
What you say,

[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.200]
You better or else,

[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.360]
You're but sad,

[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.220]
You're but sad,

[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.220]
The words for me,

[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:39.480]
Are monetary,

[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.880]
Are ignored.

[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.000]
I can say,

[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.940]
It's time to be free.

[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:54.940]

[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:54.940]

[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.500]
I can say,

[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:57.760]

[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.880]
I hear my heart are you to disdistit,

[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.020]
You to get me forced,

[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.700]
My claim is by the power

[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.320]
That's gonna be in our Lord,

[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:06.560]
God's push,

[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.780]
The Federal Unification,

[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.460]
The Nation's as I'm from,

[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.440]
The Nation's as I'm from,

[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:11.860]
The Nation's as I'm from,

[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.820]
The Nation's as I am,

[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:21.920]
The Nation can't stand the life that

[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:41.820]
It wouldn't hide

[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.960]
If they found Shandra,

[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.280]
For all of those computer Jews.

[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.080]
Then this olive is wood, be history.

[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.260]
We finally put it into this mystery.

[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.020]
Woodliffy nice gift, they found Shandra.

[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:07.860]
In caviar and one's dead cheese.

[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:11.960]
Woodliffy nice gift, they found Shandra.

[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:15.900]
In caviar and one's dead cheese.

[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.300]
She could tell us about Gary Swanky.

[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.880]
As she laughed at hell, God, they're thinking.

[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.700]
Woodliffy nice gift.

[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.980]
I said it was really nice. We tapped our goal already.

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.460]
We got four, uh, what?

[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.440]
Four or 14.

[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.220]
How do you like that?

[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.620]
A lot, so now it's all gravy from here.

[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:41.520]
Excuse me.

[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.560]
Well for me anyway.

[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:43.060]
Yeah.

[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:43.960]
All gravy for you.

[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:46.640]
I sure hope your mom cooked you up some good stuffing with that bird.

[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.440]
Of course.

[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:51.880]
As a matter of fact, I'll be bringing in stuffing tomorrow to eat leftovers in the show.

[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.700]
Yeah, that's what it's the best. That's what I hear.

[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:54.480]
That's okay.

[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.340]
Most stuffing for this old fat slob,

[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:56.760]
I'll tend to that.

[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.360]
12-13 EQ Amids are annual Thursday Thanksgiving, whatever it is.

[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:01.500]
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.540]
Just don't overdo it, okay?

[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.720]
A lot of people die in this day because they like, uh, gag on it.

[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.100]
And a lot of people also are like, uh, what do they call it?

[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:08.960]
Deep frying the turkey.

[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.860]
I just, I can't believe you didn't see that.

[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.720]
Well, I mean, I was just burning down and like exploding and...

[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.640]
I mean, I don't have people up there.

[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.300]
They've got to get the flavor away with the extender plastic ring.

[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:19.660]
Right?

[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:20.180]
Right.

[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:20.740]
I agree.

[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.500]
Nothing like having a plastic extender ring for your thing.

[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.420]
Anyway, truth is, when you dare to compare, you'll see why Ford is the best selling brand of vehicles in the USA.

[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.720]
It sounds literally only for dealer to shop.

That is Armstrong Ford or Homestead.

[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:34.660]

[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.400]

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:55.460]
The Deer Rogers, our sports-old radio, W-Q-A-L.

[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.400]
All right.

Yeah, I'll give you all your money.

It's the leg theaters!

[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.620]
Mr. Baca, please repeat after me.

[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:54.600]
I hereby renounce all allegiance to any foreign sovereignty of which I've here to

[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.680]
So, help me God.

[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.440]
Congratulations, here's your time to fly.

[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:15.720]
Oh!

[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:28.220]
Rise and up, back on the street, took my time to my chances.

[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:35.220]
When the distance now I'm back on my feet, just the man that is willed to survive.

[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:44.360]
If the eye of the tiger is the thrill of the fight, rising off to the challenge of our rival,

[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:52.080]
and the last dawn survivor starts his prey in the night, and his fortune must always be,

[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:58.380]
I am the tiger. I am the tiger.

[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:08.820]
Harriet Myers, you're in the Supreme Court pyramid winner circle for a swap on the nation's highest court start the clock.

[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.900]
Oh, the Great Wall of China, Michael Moore.

[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.440]
Thanks, you can say from outer spite.

[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:18.680]
You're right, Ted Kennedy.

[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.820]
Fairytales of the New York Times.

[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.400]
Thanks, you're a judge.

[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.480]
They can art true.

[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.540]
Dippers.

[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:32.580]
Carl Rowe.

[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:36.300]
Wayne Gretchen.

[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.360]
Frosted Flake.

[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.160]
President Bush.

[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:41.460]
Shame on all that grunts.

[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:49.760]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.200]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:53.840]
Way to go, thank you to your fellow dancers.

[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.280]
There's the primary start.

[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.280]
Where's the Boston Tide?

[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:59.180]
Quick to go and take your turkey free.

[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.340]
Some stuff in the turkey.

[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:01.280]
Some stuff in the turkey.

[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.740]
But I was the biggest turkey that I had it will, so far.

[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:06.460]
This is supposed to be the best reality with a turkey jump to the ring of fire.

[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.100]
I was down today.

[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.820]
It's just, yeah, turkey that could do tricks.

[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:18.060]
Yeah, that turkey sucked.

[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:20.480]
What do you mean you're supposed to turn it?

[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:21.900]
Ring in the turkey and rip.

[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.780]
Pray is our beautiful tricks the funding to the double-gobbles.

[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:49.040]
Oh, I was working in the White House late one night when my ears heard something that wasn't right.

[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.720]
Dick Cheney.

[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.700]
Carl Rowe, and that scuder guy.

[01:57:52.700 --> 01:58:01.060]
revealed the name of a CIA star in the league. It was a long-standing, a must-elegged.

[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.540]
Now they're all a Greek, a must-elegged.

[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:11.660]
Indicators coming this week, a must-elegged. It was a long-standing, a jealous grad,

[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:21.040]
having fun. The investigation has just begun. The suspects include the entire must-elegged

[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:28.860]
wish, administration. It was a leak. It was a long-standing, a must-elegged.

[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:34.320]
George Bush is starting to think because of the leak. Things are looking pretty pretty.

[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.840]
Because of the leak. Because of the long-standing.

[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:48.100]
In that power company, you put the utility in utility,

[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:52.940]
a lot of paradise in life. There isn't a hurricane that blows as much as you.

[01:58:54.920 --> 01:59:00.900]
When a storm threatens, we can count on you to turn our power off long before it gets in.

[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:06.160]
Leaving the rest of us to marvel at the blue-throw of exploding transporters,

[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:11.360]
providing us a historical perspective of 1957's technology.

[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:16.380]
And if the moist heat of tropical darkness, the weakening batteries in our radios

[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:19.600]
drug past your latest risk release for South Florida,

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:24.600]
that says your trucks and crews are ready to roll from the Alabama State border

[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.320]
and the question in everyone's mind is,

[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:33.780]
so as we search for the appropriate answer to how many FPL emergency crews

[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:35.820]
does it take to change the life hold?

[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:39.540]
Florida's paradise in life, this third is for you.

[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:44.480]
In that power company, mo-hoes.

[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:52.540]
Welcome back once more to the...

[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:53.920]
The...

[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:55.640]
The...

[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:59.180]
How pranking Joe, of course.

[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:05.500]
A joining me in the studio today is a very, very special guest.

[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:09.780]
The Diaballacol in infamous pill popper,

[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.760]
run through him, just for this occasion,

[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.120]
we had him bound again.

[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:26.500]
A win is the most effective, Jean Jean, since this way I won't get any neoconcudies on my hand.

[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.700]
He's not right, Russ.

[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:32.380]
You have like that Mr. High Moral Grounder.

[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.920]
This is for wife number one.

[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.780]
Wife number two.

[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.200]
Wife number two.

[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.640]
Wife number two.

[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:47.960]
Oh, but look ladies and gentlemen who's here.

[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.680]
And dressed in pumps and rubber.

[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:54.140]
I am taxidlant first.

[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:55.040]
Wee!

[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.640]
Puts me a little too.

[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.580]
When we come back, I will imagine.

[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:04.260]
Right right before you are.

[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.580]
Oh, full a cigarette.

[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.360]
Goodbye, my dear.

[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:10.560]
Good job.

[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.560]
We will save.

[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.480]
We will save.

[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.620]
Let's bury our hands.

[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:20.900]
We will save.

[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.100]
We will save.

[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.740]
We will bury our hands.

[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:28.920]
We will save.

[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.560]
We will save.

[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:38.360]
Come on, show hope, son of five, we'll make no sense.

[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.260]
We will bury our hands.

[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:44.520]
That's the new year.

[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.580]
We will save.

[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:51.200]
We will bury our hands.

[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:53.960]
We will bury.

[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.360]
We will bury our hands.

[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:04.320]
A side, a side, a side of this.

[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.900]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.340]
This is 516 Q.A.M.

[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:20.520]
God.

[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:52.620]

[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:52.660]

[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:53.680]

[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.220]
the next one is,

[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:57.460]
dog hunting with a judge.

[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:03.040]
Thank you very much,

[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:03.980]

Thank you very much for finding me.

[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:10.920]
5,000 dogs of feet.

[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.640]
So so am I, I'm lucky.

[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.700]
As more than high deflation,

[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:16.160]
you need me.

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.560]
Thank you very much, the FCC.

[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.620]
For proving that three speeds

[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:23.620]
It's fit isn't free.

[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.580]
Clear channels are dear channels, so how it's turn must go.

[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.200]
A turny general astronaut doesn't like strong words and so.

[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:36.180]
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rush limo.

[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.200]
So food you want so very much.

[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.160]
Absolutely.

[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.700]
So you very much, dear Mr. Bush.

[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:46.840]
For your rowy curly sitting on your tush.

[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:51.660]
For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who fail.

[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:55.600]
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.

[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.760]
She's an upper to you rich rich.

[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.320]
And into each she isn't male.

[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:02.420]
So far you also very much.

[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:03.380]
All right.

[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.220]
So you think she's changed too.

[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:10.020]
You and everything you do.

[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:13.200]
Your place maker must be a fake.

[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:14.620]
You haven't got a lot.

[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.880]
As far as I'm concerned you're just a face to face or false.

[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:22.780]
And as per calling the leaves the she's a intellectual touch.

[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.380]
So food you also very much.

[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.280]
So you very much keep me a.

[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.180]
For giving all the laskers oil away.

[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.160]
It really is a bummer when I can't fill my home up.

[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.780]
The ozone's and no goes out now that Arnold's here to say.

[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:45.380]
The nuclear intergame are going to take place in LA.

[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.820]
So you also very much.

[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:51.480]
So what the planet fails.

[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.520]
Let's say it's the great white males.

[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.300]
And you also very much.

[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:57.540]
What?

[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:05.060]
We're taking now behind the scenes as Arnold Schwarzenegger meets with political advisors.

[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:11.620]
I've only say something like I want to make California strong again by returning back.

[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:14.020]
And then going forward to the future.

[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:14.600]
That's good.

[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.500]
It's very important though.

[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:17.040]
I don't know whatever you say.

[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:18.520]
It has to make a lot of sense.

[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.480]
It's got to hit hard.

[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:27.660]
That's why I should say something like I want to make California the entertainment capital of the world bringing back the economy and moving forward.

[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:30.920]
Arnold, pilot already is the entertainment capital.

[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:31.840]
Even better.

[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:32.900]
It's already happening.

[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.240]
I'm only thinking it.

[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:34.980]
Wow.

[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.800]
Well, how about the energy crisis, Arnold?

[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:37.880]
Hey, smart man.

[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:40.620]
There is no energy crisis in California.

[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:41.960]
That was New York.

[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.480]
What's wrong with you?

[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.180]
I don't care about New York.

[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.440]
It's California.

[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:47.140]
California.

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.280]
There's a major energy problem.

[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:50.140]
Not here.

[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:52.980]
My step to the moon's day of climate is fine.

[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:54.140]
I have power.

[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.700]
Let's go back to bringing California to the future.

[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:57.560]
That's a good position.

[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.500]
Now, Alex, actually, if you want to do that, let's think about that.

[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:01.760]
I want to take it forward.

[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:02.200]
Good.

[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.140]
Not backwards.

[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:03.740]
All right.

[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:05.020]
By going forward.

[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.540]
Should you mention, Gray Davis?

[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:07.460]
Who's that?

[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.120]
You know, the guy you're recalling.

[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:10.500]
I didn't call anyone.

[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:12.260]
I've been working here with you.

[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:13.520]
Well, Gray Davis.

[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.040]
What do you want to say about Gray Davis?

[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.480]
Gray Davis is not from California.

[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.620]
He was the dancer from the rap pack.

[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:21.240]
I'm not going to make fun of him.

[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:22.240]
What are you talking about?

[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.760]
The patch guy from Ocean's Nine.

[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.100]
You mean Ocean's Eleven.

[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:27.420]
I don't see the sequel.

[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:29.860]
I don't think sequels have any merits at all.

[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.740]
You're talking about Sammy Davis.

[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.100]
We're talking about Gray.

[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.420]
All you do is sequel, too, by the way.

[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.600]
Hey, I don't do sequels.

[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:41.060]
I'm talking about taking California to the future.

[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:44.080]
And taking down that big white sign as a Hollywood.

[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.620]
We need a new sign says, Hollywood.

[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.900]
No, that's not going to fly.

[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:50.760]
You're fired.

[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.200]
You're fired.

[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:53.300]
Oh.

[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.600]
Above you, you like my idea now, Hollywood sign?

[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.080]
That's a great idea.

[02:06:59.220 --> 02:06:59.880]
Great idea.

[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.580]
California's future is about Hollywood.

[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.100]
Yeah, into the future.

[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:05.600]
Into the future and back.

[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:06.800]
And not back.

[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:07.380]
Not back.

[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:07.820]
Hey.

[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:08.040]
Hey.

[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:08.740]
Ah.

[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:17.500]
Take to that day to witness in the moon.

[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.920]
He do the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:23.000]

Into the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:38.300]

[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:41.840]
Unload from God, eat full and rotten.

[02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:44.480]
Into the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.040]
Start thin and poppin' in the eagle-like garden.

[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.540]
Into the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:54.360]
Into the rest, drug and limb off.

Into the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:09.300]
Who grew candy?

[02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:12.840]
I had an epiphany my friends.

[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:15.100]
Epiphany.

[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:17.800]
Fish, dawn.

[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:21.100]
Who is named?

[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:22.580]
Who are you?

[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:25.580]
Who are you?

[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:30.040]
Under the rough is where the story's going.

[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:32.620]
He do the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:36.460]

Into the rest, drug and limb off.

[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:05.640]
When Bill O'Reilly's dial in,

[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:10.100]
Sure he isn't wearing pants.

[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:15.040]
He'll tell you if you like your job.

[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.860]
Then you'll give him a last dance.

[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.700]
And if you tell O'Reilly,

[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:29.600]
You're not looking to be kissed.

[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:34.460]
He'll tell the pants right off you.

[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.500]
And for you an extortionist.

[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:44.680]
All the factors fair and balanced

[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:49.600]
But not when he calls at night.

[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:54.640]
He's looking for a lassie

[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:59.160]
Who likes it a little to the right.

[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:04.060]
When Bill O'Reilly's morning,

[02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:08.840]
Sure it ain't the nose spin's long.

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:14.300]
So when Bill O'Reilly's dial in,

[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.060]
You best not pick up your phone.

[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:20.440]
Oh my God.

[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.380]
Oh my God.

[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:38.020]
Oh my God.

[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.780]

[02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.560]
And you were saying,

[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:01.500]
Mama, be gentle,

[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:03.580]
That's what you must say.

[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:05.460]
We'll let's go,

[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.620]
On your next slide,

[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.020]
I want you tonight today.

[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:11.800]

[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.940]
rumb and done, rumb and done!

[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:31.620]
That's what's going on!

[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:40.160]
Rumb and done, rumb and done,

[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:48.280]

This is Neil Rutgers women

On episode 59

[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.860]
We need to face it!

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:20.440]
Bruce, where is the robot?

[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.380]
My old techno robot's function.

[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.400]
That's when you go, do it, do it!

[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:25.480]
Do it!

[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:26.280]
Do it!

[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.440]
Your doll is driving back and back and you use the robot to catch what I do.

[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:31.080]

[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:33.060]
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.960]
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:40.100]
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:43.700]
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:48.280]
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.040]
It's more cold, cold, cold, no sensor.

[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:58.820]
You can't let me touch you, don't let me touch you!

[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:02.540]
That's what you're body of a cancer vestuor.

[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:04.560]
Do it, do it, do it!

[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:08.500]
Do it, do it, do it!

[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:11.980]
JUMP!

[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:12.460]
JUMP!

[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:32.400]
to

[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:32.400]

[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.040]
I am innocent, Lord!

[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.960]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.460]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:37.920]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:38.160]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.160]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:39.580]

[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:41.480]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:41.560]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:42.780]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:45.340]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:47.880]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.560]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:55.440]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:55.940]
I am the true hero!

[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:59.000]
I am the true hero, I am the true hero!

[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:04.700]
I am the true hero, I am the true hero!

[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:06.740]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:07.220]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:09.820]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:12.560]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:13.240]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:13.500]

[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:25.060]
I am the true hero!

[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.280]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:50.080]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:50.960]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:53.240]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:53.400]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.080]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:55.100]

[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:55.120]

[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:55.200]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:55.200]

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:55.200]

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:55.200]

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:55.200]

[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:55.280]
I'm going to die!

[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:57.500]
I'm going to die here, to everyone I call!

[02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:59.280]
I'm going to die here!

[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:00.720]
I'm going to die!

[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:02.380]
I'm going to die here!

[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:02.780]
I'm going to die!

[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.660]
I'm going to die here!

[02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:09.840]
Go, go, go, go.

[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:10.340]
Go, go, go.

[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:12.640]
Go, go!

[02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:16.200]
Go, go, go!

[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:21.080]
I said, overward, that's really nice of me.

[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.340]
He's got to start talking about me, right?

[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.720]
I don't give a crap what that fairy has to say.

[02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:29.320]
Is he what that's what thinks a guy is that what?

[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:33.580]
I know what I'm talking about.

[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:38.660]
Every morning at the condo I take the elevator down and on my way to the car when I pull the

[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:41.140]
bus can out I give a free condo paper.

[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:43.800]
But always the back and pow.

[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:45.360]
Always the back and pow.

[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:49.780]
Always the back and pow.

[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:52.960]
Always the back and pow.

[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:57.620]
Always the back and pow.

[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:58.900]
Always the back and pow.

[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:00.180]
Always the back and pow.

[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:03.300]
Always the back and pow.

[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:09.300]
Always the back and pow.

[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:12.020]
I'm just a boy in the back of the house.

[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:13.860]
Why you...

[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:17.300]
Ah my God, I love you, sport, old boob.

[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:20.100]
I know everything that's going on in bad rules.

[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:23.340]
Why I even know all the no-majot rules.

[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:26.160]
I picked to the judge that he only used the blue.

[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.860]
You bet it's no one's not dead, I.

[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:31.900]
It's the baddest joke when I take your place.

[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:34.620]
I know I ain't no way of playing me.

[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:37.100]
But when they drop my voice, look, Jay.

[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.680]
You little smoothies, the boy.

[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:39.620]
The boy.

[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:40.160]
The boy.

[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.560]
The boy.

[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:43.080]
The boy.

[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:46.060]
The boy.

[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:47.420]
The boy.

[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:55.160]
The boy.

[02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:04.480]
Oh, right.

[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:06.940]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:08.600]
My friend.

[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.060]
Has to know what to mean.

[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:16.920]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:18.660]
My friend.

[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:21.920]
Has to know what to mean.

[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:28.200]
Roll on the other one.

[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:33.660]
Just like the other one.

[02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:38.420]
It's just a scene to be a bother to it.

[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:42.680]
And I need another hand.

[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:47.320]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:48.920]
My friend.

[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.960]
Has to know what to mean.

[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.400]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:17:58.100 --> 02:17:59.280]
My friend.

[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.280]
Just like the other one.

[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:24.700]
Roll on the other one.

[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:30.340]
Just like the other one.

[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:34.460]
This will see about that.

[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:39.200]
I don't have another sense.

[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:45.600]
I'm so much as your smile's red.

[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:49.140]
You can't let it all down.

[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:54.200]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:55.760]
My friend.

[02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:03.320]
Has to know what to mean.

[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:06.480]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:11.820]
Just pass it around.

[02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:16.380]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:21.380]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:21.800]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:22.860]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:32.840]
Don't bow guard the door.

[02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:37.760]
We're down in Jamaica in the Caribbean.

[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:41.600]
Take out the best of her that you ever seen.

[02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:42.200]
Absolutely.

[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.000]
Ask anybody in that neighborhood.

[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:48.940]
They tell you this country where they're going to be.

[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:52.980]
Rastaman has some he wants to sell.

[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.760]
And from a mile away you can detect the smell of smoke.

[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:01.560]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:05.300]
He likes a display of smoke.

[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:09.060]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:12.900]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:16.660]
The gun's a few good.

[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:22.500]
You can carry lots of her in the gun.

[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:27.040]
You suck, smoke it every day until you're looser and light.

[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:30.980]
With all the money that we have made.

[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:34.680]
Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.

[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:38.640]
American tourists home here and say.

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:41.720]
Got nothing like this in the USA.

[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:43.060]
They smoke.

[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:47.080]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.680]
They like a display of smoke.

[02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:54.400]
They begin to cough and choke.

[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:58.180]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.120]
The gun's a few good.

[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:08.880]
I'm not telling her son you are an astounding man.

[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:12.340]
You like to smoke the giant slip whenever you can.

[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:16.140]
Then we'll be coming here for miles around.

[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:19.820]
And by the end you'll find the ounce and the plum.

[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.680]
Rastaman, say to her, I'm are you right?

[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.320]
They're gonna be good tonight and then they smoke.

[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:32.320]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:35.900]
They like a display of smoke.

[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:36.540]
Oh!

[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.780]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.460]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:47.280]
They're gonna be good.

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:52.100]
All right, come on.

[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:03.780]
Delby, Delby, talking on a porch show.

[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.400]
Trying to be my show.

[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:12.340]
Your voice sounds just like a sad thing here old girl.

[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:18.560]
A little sports host, what else are you there for?

[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:23.120]
Delby, Delby, talking like a baby.

[02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:25.980]
Who needs a little training?

[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.100]
Like I feel understand.

[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:32.220]
You don't sound like a man.

[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:39.240]
Remove the rubber bands that show your scrolls come healthy.

[02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:42.280]
Delby, Delby.

[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:51.120]
Delby, your lovely management of hell, cause delby.

[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:56.680]
You don't belong there on the air and healthy.

[02:22:57.460 --> 02:23:00.380]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:05.920]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:11.600]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:14.740]
Delby, Delby.

[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:19.800]
When you're done and grow up, you make that you want to throw up.

[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:25.740]
You silly squeaky poop, go to broadcasting school.

[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:32.700]
Your fridge you best at clients makes you sound like a pun.

[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.480]
You're a pun.

[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.380]
You're a pun.

[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.120]
You're a pun.

[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:48.120]
Tonight on Celebrity Poverty.

[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:51.240]
Celebrity, it's sports with your...

[02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:51.960]
...in the car.

[02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:53.100]
Now, Dragon.

[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:56.780]
You fairy, Jack.

[02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:59.760]
A little heartable.

[02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:02.020]
Alright, mate, let's say, have fun.

[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:05.540]
What are you betting, Alan?

[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:06.480]
6,000 bucks.

[02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:12.480]
I call you Alan, because I am now, Dragon.

[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:14.680]
I don't care who you are, you fairy.

[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:16.460]
Now, how much?

[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.100]
6,000 dollars.

[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:19.280]
It's an awful lot of money.

[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:20.460]
What are you gonna do about it?

[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:21.180]
You fairy.

[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:21.920]
Tom.

[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:23.300]
What do you got, Jack?

[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:29.760]
You just cost me 6,000 dollars.

[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:31.500]
And one cat...

[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.480]
You can do one.

[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:34.760]
Oh, this is spent in excitement.

[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.560]
You can expect from low budget, dumb down television.

[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:39.100]
Like this viewer here.

[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:41.540]
That was funny.

[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:45.160]
Oh, God, I want to die.

[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:51.400]
We come to play the yellow in a chair with Celebrity Poverty on ESPU.

[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.620]
Here's my story, Sad but true.

[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:56.380]
Here.

[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:01.000]
About a girl called Sifull and Sue.

[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.360]
Had a bug and ran it around.

[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.320]
Give it to every guy in town.

[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:13.220]
Oh!

[02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:39.700]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[02:25:39.700 --> 02:26:07.880]

[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:42.280]
This is a day that's flying by like green slightin', isn't it?

[02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:44.200]
Oh yeah, especially for you,

[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:45.040]
because you're not doing anything.

[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:47.200]
I gotta work over a hot computer here.

[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:48.500]
And of course you've done this, right?

[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:49.000]
Yeah.

[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:49.880]
What do we do last year?

[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:51.280]
Didn't you do this last year?

[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:52.800]
I don't believe I did, no.

[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:54.080]
We do George work on Thanksgiving.

[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:55.460]
Sure, let's go with that.

[02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:56.500]
I don't think so.

[02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:57.220]
Well, somebody did it.

[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.860]
Anyway, George's on vacation this week.

[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:01.240]
Are we gonna ruin his Thanksgiving and call him in here

[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:02.480]
to work over a hot no?

[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:04.460]
I think we gotta upgrade a little bit.

[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:06.520]
I think we can do 500 votes today in a pool.

[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:07.200]
Okay.

[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:08.360]
Would you have ever thought that?

[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.620]
During a show I'm talking about between 9-2,

[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.060]
we got 461, and boy, would it be fun to do 39 more?

[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:17.080]
That was 39, we should be able to do that, you know what I mean?

[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:17.540]
Yeah.

[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:19.160]
That's like one every two minutes.

[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:20.620]
Anyway, here's the poll today.

[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:22.720]
Very important, and I'm sure the David and the Samson

[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:24.260]
and Delilah and all those guys are like

[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:26.440]
just pouring over this very scientifically.

[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:29.560]
What's your take on the Marlins leaving some photo?

[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:31.680]
Keeping in mind, of course, this is your Marlins station

[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:35.080]
and that a big part of Josh's income depends on Marlins.

[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:37.360]
I'll pack them all a sandwich under 27.

[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:39.300]
I don't care a bit, 112.

[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:41.800]
I'm a space ball somewhat, 59.

[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:44.640]
Who cares now that they've done so much talent, 51?

[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:46.240]
I'm pissed off, 32.

[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:47.940]
They'll get a stadium 25.

[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.420]
They're just bluffing, 22.

[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:50.520]
They can't do it.

[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:51.900]
Josh needs that job, 17.

[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:53.340]
And I'm gonna stem badly.

[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:55.200]
Oh man, only 16.

[02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:57.780]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.760]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.840]
Hello, this is Anand.

[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:07.300]
This is Nata Tuma.

[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:09.340]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:11.120]
Some stuff in the turkey.

[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:12.260]
Some in the turkey.

[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:14.340]
That was the biggest turkey they had at Wilson's.

[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:16.160]
26 pounds.

[02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:17.040]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.140]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:18.820]

[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:20.600]
Well, thanks, you're in it.

[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:21.440]
It's gonna get them.

[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:22.740]
It's a cranberry stuff.

[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.680]
Where's the pumpkin pie?

[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:25.360]
Quick, go.

[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:26.660]
I'm set you turkey free.

[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.620]
I'm a summer's tree.

[02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:30.320]
Yeah, it's a bird.

[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.300]
It's supposed to be the big one out.

[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:34.760]
You're gonna turkey down to the ring of fire.

[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:43.040]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:45.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:45.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:46.200]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:47.380]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:49.400]
I would dare, she said.

[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:49.820]
I would dare.

[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:49.820]

[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.140]
You could do it.

[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:52.400]
Yeah, that's your stuff.

[02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:53.360]
What do you mean?

[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:54.740]
You hooked the turk.

[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:56.660]
You're definitely failing at Thanksgiving fees.

[02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:57.540]
Bring in the turkey.

[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:00.960]
It's new, what are national birds in the ocean?

[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:03.040]
And red, gray is not a beautiful snake.

[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:03.760]
But I mean, take it.

[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:04.280]
What's in that dead?

[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:05.060]
It's a turkey.

[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:05.720]
It's a double galbo.

[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:07.240]
Oh, I like the turkey.

[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:09.380]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:10.380]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:11.320]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:13.380]

[02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:14.700]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:15.440]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:15.580]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:16.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.940]
How many storms must the women reinforce?

[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:40.340]
Before he gets known of his feet?

[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:41.800]
But third, man.

[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.820]
How much blue must he use on his head?

[02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:52.680]
So just you pray won't fly out to sea.

[02:29:54.840 --> 02:30:00.560]
How many times must he stumble and fall?

[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:05.320]
Before he wins a news, Emmy.

[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:13.140]
So when the man, my friend, keeps blowing in the wind.

[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:18.040]
So when the man keeps blowing in the wind.

[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:26.020]
Yeah, more having a day than whatever.

[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:30.340]
What the all this hope has over this rose a pop.

[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:32.700]
Ain't nobody ever heard of Jackie Robinson?

[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:34.000]
Yeah, sure.

[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:35.560]
Rose a pop's wrote on the bus.

[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:37.980]
But Jackie Robinson was an intelligent man.

[02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:41.080]
And played with bowls and a major league of the children's game.

[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:43.020]
I mean, come on.

[02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:45.340]
Who's the more for the black community?

[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:48.060]
Rose a pop's or Jackie Robinson?

[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:48.720]
Ah!

[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:50.460]
Jackie Robinson was my hero.

[02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:53.300]
Why I can remember when I was a much younger man.

[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:56.720]
And Jackie, he was working at the shop full of nuts.

[02:30:57.140 --> 02:31:00.480]
I walked up to him, shook his hand and it insended it.

[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:02.320]
You are my hero.

[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.860]
Now get me a cup of coffee and make it black.

[02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:07.380]
You think Rosa made coffee that heavily?

[02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:08.540]
More out of the division.

[02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:08.940]
What do you want?

[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:09.420]
Yes, more.

[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.180]
I think what you're doing.

[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:12.360]
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:13.060]
Wait a minute.

[02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:14.340]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:17.140]
Are you a black man?

[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:17.720]
Yes.

[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.940]
Oh, you can't tell a little bit of phone.

[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:21.040]
Who did more for the black community?

[02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:23.180]
Rosa Parks or Jackie Robinson?

[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:26.000]
Oh, it's two separate things.

[02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:30.920]
What you're doing is blurring the lies between social activists and men.

[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:32.000]
Not that I'm presuming.

[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:34.600]
Oh, he must have been disconnected.

[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:36.780]
Three no fault of my own.

[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.520]
On the anytime, pal, you'll want it to high thorns.

[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:40.260]
What were you having today?

[02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:43.160]
You mean tell me, touch my ass and it's more for the black.

[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.600]
Now, now, the last lap, what I said to you today.

[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:46.780]
Now, don't get me wrong here.

[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:47.980]
It goes up to like this.

[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:50.740]
Who did more for the black community?

[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:53.400]
Rosa Parks or Nipsey Russell?

[02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:54.300]
Nipsey Russell.

[02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:55.640]
You don't understand what I'm saying.

[02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:57.260]
I'll tell you what you're talking about.

[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:58.920]
I'll tell you what.

[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:00.260]
The food they work at right.

[02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:01.880]
But we say question right.

[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:03.540]
The food they work at right.

[02:32:04.060 --> 02:32:05.180]
Now, who did more?

[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:07.420]
Rosa Parks a sloppy white.

[02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:08.880]
Oh, yeah.

[02:32:10.280 --> 02:32:11.340]
Who did more?

[02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:12.420]
Who's a parker?

[02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:12.880]
What's that?

[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:14.040]
Who did more?

[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:15.160]
Who did more?

[02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:17.620]
Who did more?

[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:18.160]
Who did more?

[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:19.700]
Where it pops and what it pops?

[02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:22.520]
No, no, that's none of you ever.

[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:23.780]
You ever?

[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:24.800]
You ever?

[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:24.860]
You ever?

[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:25.780]
You ever?

[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:27.640]
I just got kicked.

[02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:28.560]
Shoot.

[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:31.580]
I'm going to pay my old towel droids.

[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:33.120]
What?

[02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:34.260]
I'm going to the bar.

[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:39.520]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:40.800]
They killed this back now.

[02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:42.880]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:44.380]
But it's not there any more.

[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:46.740]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:48.200]
And they killed this back out.

[02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:50.220]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:53.300]
Every great, me, when they took her out, I say, Mommy.

[02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:55.540]
I don't like it with the limes.

[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:56.840]
I said, Mommy.

[02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:00.260]
I feel a lot less likely when there's a mommy.

[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.980]
Yeah, I haven't felt this sad.

[02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:06.680]
Mommy, since they discontinued jobs.

[02:33:08.380 --> 02:33:10.260]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:11.560]
And they killed her door over.

[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:14.560]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:15.920]
But it doesn't taste the same.

[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:18.960]
I used to think they haven't wrapped you with my steam.

[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:19.860]
This week, my leg.

[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:22.280]
And then I would hover in my hero and swing,

[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:23.860]
go join an eye for a climb.

[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:25.560]
Mommy.

[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:36.120]
I prefer a lift.

[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.300]
Maybe Dr.

[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:40.380]
Pepper would be better.

[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:41.260]
Mommy.

[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:43.540]
Dr. Pepper.

[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:45.400]
Did I be a pepper too?

[02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:46.000]
Dr.

[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.600]
Be easier to be busy.

[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:49.320]
Mommy.

[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:49.900]
Dr.

[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:51.500]
I cannot buy.

[02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:52.400]
It just will be great.

[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:54.200]
Sometimes I wish I was straight.

[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:57.620]
They put the leaven in the back here.

[02:33:57.880 --> 02:33:58.740]
They took her door over.

[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:02.520]
All right.

[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:05.360]
Let's play who wants to be a millionaire.

[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:08.400]
Talk daddy.

[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:09.800]
Sitting in the chair.

[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:11.260]
I'll call you a puppy.

[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:12.240]
Yo, yo, man.

[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:12.740]
Yo, yo.

[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:13.760]
Are you ready?

[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:14.580]
Yeah.

[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:16.620]
Here's your $100 question.

[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:19.060]
Finish this nursery running.

[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:19.860]
All right.

[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:22.380]
Pickery, Dickery, Blank.

[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:29.000]
Is it A-Doc, B-Pier, C-Marena, or D-Inlet?

[02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:30.720]
Whoa, man.

[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:32.580]
Is $100 a question, baby?

[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:33.740]
You're kidding me, right?

[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:36.580]
This is $100 for $100.

[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:38.400]
This ain't a million dollar question.

[02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:40.420]
This is the first one.

[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:41.040]
Hey.

[02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:42.020]
It's only for $100.

[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:43.560]
Is this a black thing?

[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:45.120]
Would you like to use a lifeline?

[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:45.980]
Yeah, all right.

[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:46.460]
What do I got?

[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:47.000]
What do I got?

[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:50.540]
Well, we have the ask the audience to 50-50 and the phone a friend.

[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:51.540]
Ask the audience.

[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:53.380]
That's a lot of white people in here.

[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.140]
They're 50-50 and they're helping me.

[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:55.680]
Oh, you know what?

[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.540]
I'm going to phone a friend.

[02:34:56.900 --> 02:34:58.900]
I'm going to phone a friend on the $100 question

[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:00.200]
finishing the nursery run.

[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:00.840]
Yeah.

[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.160]
All right.

[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.060]
Who are we going to call, puppy?

[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.080]
Oh, my boy.

[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:05.280]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:07.240]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:08.100]
Yeah, dirty.

[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:08.640]
We're gone.

[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:12.460]
Our friends from AT&T will get old dirty on the line

[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:14.400]
and hopefully he can help you.

[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:17.400]
Yo.

[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:18.780]
Old dirty.

[02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:20.120]
Yeah, man.

[02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:22.880]
Registra Filman from who wants to be a millionaire.

[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:23.600]
How are you?

[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:25.580]
I got your friend here.

[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:26.220]
Puff Daddy.

[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:27.440]
Yo, dirty was up.

[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:28.300]
What's up?

[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:29.200]
What's up?

[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.340]
What's up?

[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:31.480]
What's up?

[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:32.980]
What's up?

[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:33.040]

[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:33.320]
All right.

[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:33.980]
All right.

[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:36.540]
Old dirty.

[02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:37.460]
Old dirty.

[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:39.420]
Puff Daddy's in a little bit of trouble here

[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:41.220]
on the $100 question.

[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:43.100]
Hey, the first time, man.

[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:44.040]
First question.

[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.680]
And the next voice you hear will be his.

[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:47.480]
He'll come on the line.

[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:48.620]
He'll ask you the question.

[02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:50.700]
He'll give you four possible choices.

[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:51.440]
Are you set?

[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:52.440]
Hey, man.

[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:54.220]
Next voice you hear will be his.

[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:56.540]
And 30 seconds begins now.

[02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:58.020]
What has happened?

[02:35:59.000 --> 02:35:59.620]
You know, dirt.

[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:00.840]
It faces off for me.

[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:01.180]
All right?

[02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:01.800]
Hey, man.

[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.120]
Take your end, dickery blank.

[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:12.640]
Is it a doc, b, pia, c, marino, or d?

[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:14.480]
In a bit.

[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:16.140]
Oh, oh, oh.

[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:16.800]
Come on, man.

[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:17.720]
I don't got much time.

[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:18.700]
Yeah, I know this, man.

[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:19.280]
I know it.

[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.420]
I see this, pia.

[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:21.420]
P, you sure?

[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.140]
I'm about 30, man.

[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:25.260]
Listen, I'm about 30.

[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:26.080]
All right, man.

[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:26.860]
Thank you very much.

[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:27.820]
I hate, man.

[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:30.960]
Times off for old dirty said, pia.

[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:33.540]
You still have two lifelines left.

[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:35.460]
We are on the hundred dollar question.

[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:36.560]
You know what, Regis?

[02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:37.520]
Wanna pull the audience?

[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:39.620]
No, I like to add a lifeline.

[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:42.600]
I'll actually know there's only three lifelines

[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:43.940]
of yours, one you have two left.

[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:44.740]
No, no, no.

[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:46.440]
I get another lifeline.

[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:48.000]
It's a brand new one to the game.

[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:49.620]
And what is that, pia?

[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:51.060]
It's called Shoot the Host.

[02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:52.960]
Pia, you can ask the audience.

[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.400]
I call it Shoot the Host.

[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:55.760]
Pia, you're so 50-50.

[02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:56.520]
What's the answer?

[02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:57.460]
Pia, it's Doc.

[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:58.080]
It's A.

[02:36:58.420 --> 02:36:58.960]
It's Doc.

[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:00.160]
My final answer is Doc.

[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:01.920]
It's Doc, and it's a good one.

[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:03.140]
You've got to open all of it.

[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:04.400]
Run you run you run you run.

[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:05.580]
Run, somebody run.

[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:06.620]
Run, let's get out of it.

[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:09.760]
Isn't it funny how some taste just take you back?

[02:37:10.180 --> 02:37:11.540]
Like when you were a teenager.

[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:14.640]
Remember sitting on your porch on a cool summer evening,

[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:17.160]
popping a zit with your fingers and then eating it?

[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:20.340]
Well, the great taste is back at the Puzz ballast.

[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:24.700]
Yes, delicious, creamy, soft serve puss in a colt or a dish.

[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:28.300]
With your choice of toppings, all the great taste of your body

[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:29.360]
you enjoyed as a kid.

[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:33.420]
Like warm ear wax, scap gifs, and our new booger bits.

[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:38.480]
The Puzz ballast, ice cream, you scream, we all scream for Puzz.

[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:39.480]
Absolutely.

[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:42.960]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Rembo 4 and 5.

[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:47.220]
How are you?

[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.640]
John, Rembo's still alive.

[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:54.420]
I wanna make movies 4 and 5.

[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:57.220]
My life and going great plan of Hollywood's broke.

[02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:00.120]
Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke.

[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.400]
First blood came in 82.

[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:05.480]
That's when my penis ended never ever grew.

[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:08.240]
Rembo 2 was in 85 late.

[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:10.940]
Rembo 3 was in 88.

[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.540]
Sure, and 2 in like I did not make this movie with my son.

[02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:21.360]
In every stage, he was in Rocky 5 in daylight, the tunnel movie.

[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.940]
A little bit, that's his what I mean.

[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:27.000]
I gotta get him all from the power of creed.

[02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:29.320]
I gotta have him all the way and movie.

[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:32.080]
Or Broadway show like Madagin.

[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:34.920]
I guess nobody ever saw cop wins.

[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:36.020]
It was stupid.

[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.460]
I guess I understand.

[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:40.380]
My whole life is about to come in.

[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:42.980]
All I got left in jail for flavor.

[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:49.440]
Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rembo 4 and 5.

[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:56.100]
Take it out, so call me up.

[02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:57.360]
I really need a script.

[02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.080]
I can do it by a long word.

[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:00.180]
Keep it zipped.

[02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:02.900]
I like comedy, action, adventure, and drama.

[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:05.580]
That the only thing I really love to do is have sex with a lot.

[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:08.480]
So give me a break for goodness sake.

[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:11.220]
I used to be an Oprah, and now I can't get on Ricky Lake.

[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:13.900]
Right now, I got a one man showin' to the kepty.

[02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:16.100]
Basically, I'm an unemployed chipsy.

[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:18.480]
A little bit of cash is what I mean.

[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:21.180]
I gotta get him all from the Marvel Queen.

[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:23.780]
I gotta have a mouthful of head moving.

[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.560]
Or Broadway show like Madagin.

[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:29.080]
I guess nobody ever saw cop wins.

[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:31.960]
It was stupid, so I understand.

[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.480]
My whole life is about to come in.

[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:38.020]
All I got left is jail for flavor.

[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:44.800]
That's why, ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rembo 4 and 5.

[02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:47.900]
I'm absolutely.

[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:50.860]
I can see the front page of the USA today tomorrow.

[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:56.400]
Roger Shoguetsu, over 500 votes on Thanksgiving on a pool from Penitoo.

[02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:57.040]
I don't like that.

[02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:58.540]
We have 491 already.

[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:00.000]
It's like falling off your chair there.

[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:01.080]
No sweat.

[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:02.160]
You are there, aren't you?

[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:04.020]
Where did he go?

[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:05.560]
Where did this man go?

[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:08.300]
I think Josh has left the building.

[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:12.380]
Oh, this is special.

[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:14.380]
I feel so alone all of a sudden.

[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:17.300]
Anyway, it's coming after 1 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:18.360]
We are on the air.

[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:19.640]
Maybe Josh got kidnapped.

[02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:20.260]
Oh, here.

[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:21.280]
What's going on here?

[02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:21.720]
What happened there?

[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:22.260]
What do you mean?

[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:23.720]
You weren't saying anything.

[02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:25.360]
I'm just, you know, letting you do your thing.

[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:28.500]
We're in hell where you?

[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:29.460]
You're not fooling anybody.

[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:31.840]
I got my sweater here and on the table.

[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:34.980]
And I was, you know, you were sweating it.

[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:35.720]
Take a little nildi.

[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:37.980]
Okay, I love 13. Josh is still there.

[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.500]
I thought maybe you got kidnapped or something.

[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:40.520]
Maybe one of your good friends.

[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:41.240]
No, no, no, no.

[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:42.480]
I'm like, I've scotted with you.

[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.940]
Anyway, rich room filling sound from your iPod.

[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:47.720]
It's the power of the Bose sound doc digital music system.

[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:49.460]
It brings the music on your iPod.

[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:51.660]
The life even charges your iPod while it plays.

[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:54.040]
Sound and vision says you're bound to love what you hear.

[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.840]
And that's because only proprietary Bose technology

[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:58.980]
lets you get the most from the music on your iPod.

[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:00.880]
The system is friendly with iPod.

[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:01.520]
iPod many.

[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:03.360]
iPod nano and iPod with video.

[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:06.060]
It's thick appearance starlessly blends with your iPod

[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:07.220]
in almost any room they core.

[02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:10.400]
Easy to use even comes with a remote that controls the sound doc system.

[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:12.980]
And the basic functions of your iPod from all the way across the room.

[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:16.420]
So let the room fillings out of the Bose sound doc digital music system

[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:18.420]
deliver a brand new iPod experience.

[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.200]
Insert iPod here what happens.

[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:22.340]
It'll make you so mellow you'll be thinking about Jerry Sarner.

[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.140]
Experience the sound doc today at well, at least maybe tomorrow when they open.

[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:31.400]
At Apple, Best Buy, Circuit City, Comp USA, Sharper Image, Target, or Tweeter.

[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:34.420]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:38.280]
This is 560 QA.

[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:42.840]
Yeah.

[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:46.640]
Miami Hurricane football is all about the U.

[02:41:46.700 --> 02:41:48.860]
Is that Joe running that trumpet?

[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:50.560]
This is a day.

[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:52.580]
It's U.M. in Virginia.

[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:53.080]
Oh my god.

[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:55.640]
In the final game of the regular season.

[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:03.180]
Presented by Bell Sound, Hurricane's Ginde starts at noon, live in the hands of the North to get lots of e-copes set for 330 right here.

[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.460]
Sports radio 560.

[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:06.780]
U.A.

[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:08.840]
Hurricane football.

[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:11.700]
I think it's hard to think.

[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:39.380]
The one thing I won't hit there.

[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:42.460]
I am a hit or so it does.

[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.100]
I'll pay.

[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:48.920]
You won the 4 and you got it.

[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:53.420]
The band's dog is back singing 4 duets on the banded scene.

[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:54.720]
Volume 2.

[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:55.380]
Yeah.

[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:56.660]

[02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:57.800]
Yeah.

[02:42:58.440 --> 02:42:58.580]
Yeah.

[02:42:59.440 --> 02:42:59.540]
Yeah.

[02:42:59.740 --> 02:42:59.820]
Yeah.

[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:00.480]

[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:00.620]
Yeah.

[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:01.260]
Yeah.

[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:01.460]

[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:01.600]
Yeah.

[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:02.080]
Yeah.

[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:03.480]
Yeah.

[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:12.340]
Oh, the radio is back carrying off with the grace singing more thickness, which even more six stars.

[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:15.000]
The mad dog does them all.

[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:18.800]
Baby, you can't take it all right.

[02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:19.600]
I'm tired.

[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.580]
Another football.

[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:23.560]
Oh, right.

[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:23.920]
Yeah.

[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:27.560]
Well, got it.

[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:35.140]
I can't take it all right.

[02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.280]
Oh, right.

[02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:39.220]
Oh, wrong.

[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:39.800]
Oh, wrong.

[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:48.080]
It's an all new British invasion with the mad dog singing like a man.

[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:53.260]
I like it. I can't. I like it.

[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:58.920]
The truth is finally out that Jim Mandage was truly the fifth people.

[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:01.680]
You got to give me love and you give me love.

[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.440]
Everyone loves the land.

[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.260]
Now your head's just aint.

[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:12.320]
You'll always hear me say,

[02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:13.640]
You're gonna be alright.

[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:15.820]
Alright. Alright.

[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:22.160]
Here's the bad dogs and your touching tribute to the king.

[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:24.120]
They are all this.

[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:25.620]
Oh right.

[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:27.900]
Oh right.

[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:30.460]
That's a wrap.

[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:32.840]
Oh baby.

[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:34.720]
You ain't gonna do.

[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:40.920]
The bad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again.

[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:42.880]
Nah. I don't think so.

[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:49.480]
So we had Lucifer Rossi payable little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on their contract.

[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.660]
That's some of a bitch's cute.

[02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:55.320]
Alright.

[02:44:58.380 --> 02:44:59.120]
Alright.

[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:03.160]
Alright.

[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:03.600]

[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:04.780]
And it's safe.

[02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:08.240]
All you do is payable now if you move quickly.

[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:09.340]
All right.

[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:10.360]

[02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:45.740]
了了了。

[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:46.100]
Wu...

[02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:46.120]
W...

[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:46.120]

[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:46.120]

[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:47.480]
The Middle Eastern world

[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:49.820]
will be exploded

[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:54.240]
So dumb at people killed with the gas that we sold him

[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:58.180]
First time a crescer nation and the only one that's growing

[02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:02.560]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing

[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.420]
Forget about Korea

[02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:07.700]
The nooks there chose to map us

[02:48:07.700 --> 02:48:13.820]
Right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hip

[02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:20.400]
That irack has some weapons of master's structure

[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.620]
3,000 people killed

[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:37.160]
Are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead

[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:39.820]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in

[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:43.580]
Going after Sattam too, playing Kato Sama

[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:47.780]
There's no longer mention of the name in lawton

[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:50.180]
But no one seems concerned all

[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:55.920]
Come be in complacent, believe in every word of this cartel administration

[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:59.760]
That controls us by fear through media manipulation

[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:07.340]
And the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hip

[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:13.720]
That irack has some weapons of master's structure

[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:16.520]
Of your looters

[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.560]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying

[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:32.540]
We're all suspects now, not the ash drop is saying

[02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:36.720]
I have nothing to hide, table talkers all are saying

[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:40.900]
But I know media and cattle don't have any reservations

[02:49:41.540 --> 02:49:45.100]

God creates father our mali wafers against no

[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:30.460]
Well, Billy, this isn't just any wafer.

[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:31.080]
It's not?

[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:36.480]
No, for the divine miracle of trans-association, I've turned this ordinary wafer into the

[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.120]
divine blessed body of Christ.

[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:41.180]
Well, why does a body of Christ have to taste so yucky?

[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:44.400]
Spice of your next communion with new Christ Aroni.

[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:49.560]
Christ Aroni is a special blend of rice, spices and seasonings, plus a bit of the body

[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:51.480]
of Christ in every fluffy forkful.

[02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:55.180]
And Christ Aroni cooks up perfect every time, as he should.

[02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:57.660]
Hmm, can I have some more Christ's father?

[02:52:57.660 --> 02:52:59.160]
That's Christ Aroni, Billy.

[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:00.280]
Amen to that.

[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:03.200]
Christ Aroni, the trans-estabgiation tree.

This is Neil Rogers.

This is 5.69.

[02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:13.360]
I want to tell you something.

[02:53:13.580 --> 02:53:14.840]
You're all about to send them a bit.

[02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:16.300]
I don't tell you what you said.

[02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:16.780]
What are they?

[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:19.060]
Are they going to get rid of this old kite on the phone?

[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:20.160]
You're going to put away that tree.

[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:21.940]
I'm not going to tell you.

[02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:22.880]
Well, excuse you.

[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:24.360]
Oh, excuse your language now.

[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:24.760]
Let's hear it.

[02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:25.520]
Use your language.

[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:31.680]
I'm at Monday.

[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:39.580]
I'm waiting Tuesday, Saturday, and Wednesday, and they stay.

[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:44.600]
I might not know what's to say.

[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:50.120]
There's a thing wrong with this thing giving what you need.

[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:53.100]
No, that's not true.

[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:54.120]
I probably...

[02:53:55.340 --> 02:53:57.800]
If it's for, yes, you say, wait.

[02:53:58.260 --> 02:53:59.660]
We're going for bad.

[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:05.420]
Oh, it seems like that.

[02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:07.040]
It's finally here.

[02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:09.340]
I've looked in a tree boat.

[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:12.740]
So, my face still unfolds.

[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:17.120]
Oh, I wish they all would stop dancing.

[02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:24.210]
I love when I get feeding all the pieces.

[02:54:25.250 --> 02:54:25.990]
Peasants.

[02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:27.290]
Peasants.

[02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:27.850]
Me.

[02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:29.810]
Give me turkey.

[02:54:30.650 --> 02:54:31.170]
Turkey.

[02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:33.710]
Turkey to eat.

[02:54:34.690 --> 02:54:41.310]
And now here's Timmy Dean, founder of Timmy Dean Fork Sausage, with a few words about new Timmy Dean Vagal Samertens.

[02:54:41.710 --> 02:54:42.950]
Hello, I'm Timmy Dean.

[02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:48.370]
You know, if someone had told me 25 years ago that I'd be making bagels, I'd have said,

[02:54:48.650 --> 02:54:50.630]
huh, that's Jew food, isn't it?

[02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:54.190]
But times have changed, and I guess I've got to change with them.

[02:54:54.570 --> 02:54:55.770]
But I don't have to like it.

[02:54:56.250 --> 02:54:58.810]
You people want your bagels, I'll give you your bagels.

[02:54:59.190 --> 02:55:02.530]
With a bagel greases slab, a Timmy Dean Fork Sausage on it.

[02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:05.590]
New Timmy Dean non-coachier bagel sandwiches.

[02:55:06.090 --> 02:55:07.610]
If you're Jewish, you can buy them.

[02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:08.830]
You just can't eat them.

[02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:10.710]
New Timmy Dean bagel sandwiches.

[02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:12.970]
There's a little bit of bigot in everybody.

[02:55:13.330 --> 02:55:16.710]
I still remember getting my first candy from my grandfather.

[02:55:17.250 --> 02:55:20.050]
It was worthless original, and I was more.

[02:55:20.410 --> 02:55:22.490]
I remember it like it was only yesterday.

[02:55:23.770 --> 02:55:25.730]
Hey Billy, let's play a game.

[02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:26.410]
What?

[02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:28.050]
Guess what I've gotten, my pocket.

[02:55:28.410 --> 02:55:29.770]
A piece of candy.

[02:55:29.970 --> 02:55:30.230]
Yes.

[02:55:30.530 --> 02:55:31.930]
And I'm guarded by a snake.

[02:55:32.130 --> 02:55:32.670]
Very good.

[02:55:32.890 --> 02:55:35.130]
Grandpa, I don't want to play this game anymore.

[02:55:35.430 --> 02:55:35.870]
Who's kidding?

[02:55:36.190 --> 02:55:38.310]
Let's play, play the candy and the crevice.

[02:55:38.310 --> 02:55:41.170]
No, Grandpa, I don't want to know when you put it there.

[02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:45.510]
Yes, those games with grandpa shard me for life.

[02:55:45.850 --> 02:55:51.050]
Which is why now that I'm the grandfather, I'm scarring a whole new generation with worthless original.

[02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:54.750]
Hey Timmy, say hi to Wet Willie, the worthless wonderworm.

[02:55:54.890 --> 02:55:56.690]
Oh no, not the wonderworm.

[02:55:57.070 --> 02:56:00.870]
Worthless original, giving children nightmares for over 60 years.

[02:56:03.350 --> 02:56:03.910]
Absolutely.

[02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:07.870]
Don't use today's good detail, hadn't said.

[02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:11.310]
And Terry's on her way on a bustman's holiday.

[02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:17.230]
Don't use today to find another way to get you through the day.

[02:56:17.610 --> 02:56:19.070]
Well, you won't see no dry.

[02:56:19.530 --> 02:56:22.910]
Why don't they know how long it's gonna take?

[02:56:23.250 --> 02:56:25.870]
Now they all know and take another break.

[02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:30.090]
They waste our time with something to defend.

[02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:33.930]
Just ride the guy and bring it to an end.

[02:56:33.930 --> 02:56:37.730]
No use today, that's too bad for all the games.

[02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:39.330]
We have the fastest race.

[02:56:39.850 --> 02:56:41.290]
He's lost the business race.

[02:56:45.490 --> 02:56:47.250]
Oh, hey, it's a pleasure to see you.

[02:56:47.290 --> 02:56:48.710]
I'm so happy because you know what I'm saying.

[02:56:49.350 --> 02:56:50.130]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:52.250]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:56:52.270 --> 02:56:58.550]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:56:59.010 --> 02:57:00.250]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:01.930]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:01.930 --> 02:57:03.670]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:05.650 --> 02:57:09.570]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:09.570 --> 02:57:11.850]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:11.970 --> 02:57:13.610]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:13.610 --> 02:57:13.690]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:13.710 --> 02:57:16.130]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:16.490 --> 02:57:16.730]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:16.730]

[02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:16.730]

[02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:17.350]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:17.570 --> 02:57:19.110]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:19.110 --> 02:57:20.030]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:23.150]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:27.770]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:32.970 --> 02:57:33.650]
I'm so happy to see you.

[02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:34.730]
And again thank you for such a amazing day

[02:57:34.730 --> 02:57:36.310]
and still the best of time.

[02:57:40.570 --> 02:57:43.790]
I'm so happy to see you again.

[02:57:51.610 --> 02:57:53.750]
Are you sure?

[02:57:55.810 --> 02:57:57.610]
Could you do it?

[02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:04.550]
Hi, I'm Aaron Sommert, you know what?

[02:58:05.290 --> 02:58:07.910]
You got me talking on the passion phone.

[02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:12.130]
Tell me the story about how you got flown.

[02:58:12.690 --> 02:58:13.310]
I got you down.

[02:58:15.050 --> 02:58:17.610]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, holy cow.

[02:58:20.390 --> 02:58:25.310]
I'll tell you what's more before I hang up the phone, I got you down.

[02:58:34.530 --> 02:58:37.870]
I got your down.

[02:58:44.770 --> 02:58:50.230]
I got you down.

[02:58:53.530 --> 02:58:55.290]
The thrill-hold olan giving me the old girl.

[02:58:55.290 --> 02:58:55.290]

[02:58:55.290 --> 02:58:55.290]

[02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:59.010]
I got you down.

[02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:02.750]
I got you down.

[02:59:04.970 --> 02:59:06.850]
I got you down.

[02:59:10.310 --> 02:59:14.190]
Here on the show there's a new topic each night.

[02:59:15.310 --> 02:59:18.270]
Who do you have sex with with a black or blue and white?

[02:59:18.730 --> 02:59:19.410]
I got you down.

[02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:23.610]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, holy cow.

[02:59:26.610 --> 02:59:30.390]
I'll tell you what's more before I hang up the phone.

[02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:31.930]
I got you down.

[02:59:37.330 --> 02:59:39.090]
All right.

[02:59:40.410 --> 02:59:42.150]
Go go, go go.

[02:59:43.250 --> 02:59:44.650]
Go go.

[02:59:44.930 --> 02:59:50.570]
She said I was too old to take something for a leave.

[02:59:51.130 --> 02:59:53.670]
Now she's got these with the base.

[02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:56.390]
I got it from Linda Energy.

[02:59:56.770 --> 02:59:58.230]
My goal's to jump down.

[02:59:58.650 --> 03:00:01.070]
My skin ain't no round and round.

[03:00:01.570 --> 03:00:04.250]
I haven't slept for three days now.

[03:00:04.250 --> 03:00:08.930]
Ooh, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

[03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:11.470]
Some weight broke around in the old way.

[03:00:11.770 --> 03:00:14.450]
Who found many drugs to what happened today?

[03:00:14.730 --> 03:00:17.430]
My hair's hollowing out and it's been hard to be.

[03:00:17.730 --> 03:00:20.190]
It's a tie-saw, Linda Energy.

[03:00:20.650 --> 03:00:23.430]
No, that my heart's been going wild.

[03:00:24.050 --> 03:00:26.510]
Beans like I wanna die.

[03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:29.190]
Kill that kill, and contemplate.

[03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:33.150]
Kill that kill, and I should expect your fees.

[03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:35.330]
Outfitting drugs all day.

[03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:38.370]
That drops the weight but who's your brain?

[03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:41.070]
Production plus spin, that's okay.

[03:00:42.310 --> 03:00:44.110]
Aization is insane.

[03:00:44.350 --> 03:00:45.790]
My goal's to jump down.

[03:00:46.190 --> 03:00:48.670]
My head's standing all round and round.

[03:00:49.350 --> 03:00:51.890]
I haven't slept for three days now.

[03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:56.670]
Ooh, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

[03:00:56.690 --> 03:01:01.210]
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

[03:01:09.330 --> 03:01:10.970]
I'm dying out of hair.

[03:01:11.130 --> 03:01:13.070]
I'm going to be Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

[03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:18.650]
Oh my god.

[03:01:19.270 --> 03:01:21.250]
They sold this radio station.

[03:01:21.770 --> 03:01:22.010]
Yes.

[03:01:22.610 --> 03:01:24.370]
Our future is in doubt.

[03:01:25.530 --> 03:01:30.510]
We've been talking about Pakistan ever since got spoiled.

[03:01:30.690 --> 03:01:31.190]
Now, we're going to be in a fight.

[03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.190]

[03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:32.710]
I will win for Pakistan.

[03:01:33.850 --> 03:01:35.810]
The man from Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

[03:01:35.810 --> 03:01:39.270]
I'm going to win for Pakistan.

[03:01:40.410 --> 03:01:42.570]
It's like waiting for hair.

[03:01:45.070 --> 03:01:47.790]
Do I think that it's a bummer?

[03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:50.650]
Ben, Ben, Henry's gone.

[03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.330]
Okay.

[03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:53.730]
Say goodbye to Aaron.

[03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.730]
Summer.

[03:01:55.470 --> 03:01:57.150]
They hide and run and run.

[03:01:57.530 --> 03:01:59.010]
They're going to win for Pakistan.

[03:01:59.010 --> 03:02:00.650]
Oh my god.

[03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:02.490]
And that's a matter of fact.

[03:02:03.610 --> 03:02:05.650]
They're going to win for Pakistan.

[03:02:06.570 --> 03:02:08.990]
But he'll be changing his act.

[03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:14.030]
My transparna again, Christian.

[03:02:15.090 --> 03:02:16.910]
My sister, she can't be.

[03:02:17.490 --> 03:02:18.030]
You fairy.

[03:02:18.390 --> 03:02:20.090]
You've all changed the stations.

[03:02:20.810 --> 03:02:21.570]
Ladders.

[03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:25.410]
The WGOD now will win for Pakistan.

[03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:28.070]
Pakistan, Pakistan, Greece, and France.

[03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:30.410]
Pakistan, Pakistan, and France.

[03:02:30.410 --> 03:02:31.990]
And we're going to work for Pakistan.

[03:02:32.410 --> 03:02:35.250]
Pakistan, Pakistan, make a sign of the cross.

[03:02:43.410 --> 03:02:45.270]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:02:46.310 --> 03:02:49.070]
This is 5.16 QA.

[03:02:49.350 --> 03:02:49.550]
Thank you.

[03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:49.650]
Thank you.

[03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:21.110]
I'll take it slow.

[03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:24.250]
Protect your inside.

[03:03:25.470 --> 03:03:31.510]
Don't say, with even stills.

[03:03:31.790 --> 03:03:36.750]
For grandmas, for even Neil Young.

[03:03:38.730 --> 03:03:42.450]
Trees, you're living well.

[03:03:44.090 --> 03:03:45.590]
Don't drink like hell.

[03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:49.150]
It'll surely go bad.

[03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:51.630]
Oh please.

[03:03:53.190 --> 03:03:54.710]
Just keep it clean.

[03:03:56.110 --> 03:03:57.970]
It can't be fixed.

[03:03:59.290 --> 03:04:01.310]
You'll need a donor.

[03:04:03.810 --> 03:04:07.210]
Don't you ever party hard.

[03:04:07.850 --> 03:04:10.270]
If you do, you could die.

[03:04:10.270 --> 03:04:12.850]
Or just wait enough long.

[03:04:15.970 --> 03:04:16.010]
Live.

[03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:20.910]
Life gave it cross me.

[03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:37.970]
Dear Atlantis, I'll know if you remember me.

[03:04:37.970 --> 03:04:42.570]
But I was the guy whose house you said on fire last year.

[03:04:43.970 --> 03:04:46.210]
God, I miss you.

[03:04:46.770 --> 03:04:48.950]
Even though you blew up my car.

[03:04:49.450 --> 03:04:51.210]
Cut all my hair off.

[03:04:51.870 --> 03:04:52.990]
I miss you, girl.

[03:04:54.330 --> 03:04:56.550]
But one quick question.

[03:04:57.630 --> 03:05:03.310]
Do you think you could let me know when you might let me out of this pit?

[03:05:03.310 --> 03:05:07.350]
No one's fed me for weeks, but I'm not complaining.

[03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:10.730]
Don't misunderstand me, because I love you with all my heart.

[03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:16.210]
But if you happen to see my mother, please let it know I'm not dead yet.

[03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:25.310]
Dear Atlantis, I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wasn't me.

[03:05:26.010 --> 03:05:31.310]
He might have looked and talked just like me, but that's surely purely coincidental.

[03:05:32.310 --> 03:05:34.490]
I was nowhere near that place.

[03:05:34.890 --> 03:05:37.870]
I love you too much to look at anyone else.

[03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:43.010]
Dear Atlantis, I had a dentist appointment that day.

[03:05:43.150 --> 03:05:47.310]
I was nowhere near the shared metal lens hotel.

[03:05:47.930 --> 03:05:55.910]
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good with all those candies as all that money.

[03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:57.830]
Make him my life the other day.

[03:05:58.990 --> 03:06:01.610]
Baby's not your couple missiles.

[03:06:02.450 --> 03:06:05.210]
Tour in a place we know.

[03:06:05.490 --> 03:06:06.070]
Absolutely.

[03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:08.510]
And name a madapela.

[03:06:09.330 --> 03:06:12.070]
Whose first name begins with old.

[03:06:13.330 --> 03:06:16.910]
There's one thing we all understand.

[03:06:20.010 --> 03:06:25.350]
Alcano won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.

[03:06:27.770 --> 03:06:34.850]
We could chase around forever with our tanks and all our troops.

[03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:41.030]
The special forces are some tired of jumping through them.

[03:06:42.030 --> 03:06:46.790]
You throw only need another plane.

[03:06:48.430 --> 03:06:54.830]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and we'll blow up Pakistan.

[03:06:57.590 --> 03:07:02.810]
Now pay the needs and nuclear tanks.

[03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:12.670]
Why don't we stop the seafood and blow blow up Pakistan.

[03:07:16.810 --> 03:07:17.690]
All right.

[03:07:23.810 --> 03:07:28.430]
I'm Casey Tissum coming to you live from Hollywood with another edition of America's Bottom 40.

[03:07:28.430 --> 03:07:36.750]
Brought to you by the Oxy5 Company's newest acne medication, Oxy1 5 for pimple-free teenagers.

[03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:39.150]
And so it goes.

[03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:46.910]
That'd be a little quicker on a tape, boy.

[03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:49.230]
That's a good joke.

[03:07:49.570 --> 03:07:52.950]
We've got the worst songs in America and we're counting them down.

[03:07:53.390 --> 03:07:54.890]
Record stories are showing them.

[03:07:56.750 --> 03:08:00.790]
For some unknown reason you're buying them and I'm using them as coasters.

[03:08:01.050 --> 03:08:04.350]
First let's review the top three songs on the charts.

[03:08:04.770 --> 03:08:07.970]
And number three, Guns and Roses is singing Sweet Child of Mine.

[03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:12.970]
Well, if I had a child around the house today, I'd have these four words for lead guitar,

[03:08:13.350 --> 03:08:14.750]
slash and his cohorts.

[03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:16.170]
Stay the hell away.

[03:08:18.410 --> 03:08:20.430]
And number two, you will who it is.

[03:08:20.430 --> 03:08:22.990]
There ain't no living in a perfect world.

[03:08:23.250 --> 03:08:26.610]
And especially not for you, Hughie, since you don't speak proper English.

[03:08:27.490 --> 03:08:31.230]
And number one, George Michael sings, he's got a monkey on his back.

[03:08:31.630 --> 03:08:34.170]
Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back there.

[03:08:42.870 --> 03:08:45.090]
But then again, you probably don't mind.

[03:08:46.650 --> 03:08:51.130]
And by the way, George, there are these remarkable shaving instruments called razor.

[03:08:51.330 --> 03:08:52.130]
Hi, one.

[03:08:52.390 --> 03:08:54.250]
And lose that silly ass theory.

[03:08:57.690 --> 03:09:02.490]
Other songs on the charts, the band Johnny H. Jazz, with I want to be a hero,

[03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:04.550]
is moving down on the charts and deserved it with myself.

[03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:07.450]
Apparently, Johnny also re-heat music.

[03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:14.890]
I don't think hero status is imminent, Johnny, so get a real job.

[03:09:14.890 --> 03:09:19.690]
And there is a song I like, Rod Stewart's newest release, Forever Young.

[03:09:20.050 --> 03:09:23.410]
And for a moment, I thought it was a song about me, Forever Hon.

[03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:29.150]
And now it's time for a long distance dedication.

[03:09:29.810 --> 03:09:33.350]
It comes first from a listener in Pasadena, California, to write Stair Casey.

[03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:37.110]
I'm 16 years old, president of my class, I'm six foot two.

[03:09:37.270 --> 03:09:42.330]
I've born here, way 175 pounds, and started quarter back to my high school team.

[03:09:42.330 --> 03:09:44.090]
But Katie, I have a problem.

[03:09:44.410 --> 03:09:46.870]
The girls simply will not leave me alone.

[03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:49.510]
It seems as though I've they want me for you.

[03:09:49.610 --> 03:09:51.530]
It's my good looks, my excellent physique.

[03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:54.650]
Why can't they just like me as a friend?

[03:09:55.050 --> 03:09:59.690]
Treat me as a person instead of some sex object, and quit hitting upon me all the time.

[03:10:00.350 --> 03:10:02.110]
Casey, need I have any suggestions?

[03:10:02.590 --> 03:10:03.130]
Shine, Todd.

[03:10:03.770 --> 03:10:04.770]
Well, here's my answer.

[03:10:05.610 --> 03:10:06.590]
Dear Flaming Harbor.

[03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:12.270]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:10:12.450 --> 03:10:13.110]
Oh, oh, oh.

[03:10:13.450 --> 03:10:15.590]
This is 5'16 QA.

[03:10:18.310 --> 03:10:19.410]
This is 5'16 QA.

[03:10:20.010 --> 03:10:24.090]
This is 5'16 QA.

[03:10:24.090 --> 03:10:25.230]
This is 5'16 QA.

[03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:27.530]
You know why people in this country get fat?

[03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:28.930]
Thanks, you do.

[03:10:29.270 --> 03:10:30.870]
A big, fat turkey.

[03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:32.630]
It ain't cool being a no-job.

[03:10:33.490 --> 03:10:35.110]
So, big, big, big, quick.

[03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:36.750]
Go and set your turkey free.

[03:10:36.830 --> 03:10:38.190]
This is a birdie.

[03:10:47.070 --> 03:10:48.770]
Do we need your turkey for a play?

[03:10:48.850 --> 03:10:50.750]
Why is our best turn in the summer season?

[03:10:51.010 --> 03:10:56.130]
What do you mean, you're supposed to first four five two days, and don't forget the right foot.

[03:10:56.310 --> 03:10:57.690]
What kind of turkey are you looking for?

[03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.230]
A truck.

[03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:59.750]
Yeah, a turkey.

[03:11:00.170 --> 03:11:01.130]
Yeah, that turkey.

[03:11:01.390 --> 03:11:01.750]
Stop it.

[03:11:01.930 --> 03:11:02.510]
Give it to me again.

[03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:04.130]
And we're flimping on.

[03:11:04.130 --> 03:11:05.710]
This is supposed to be the best turn out in the turkey.

[03:11:05.710 --> 03:11:06.750]
You gotta get a ring of fire.

[03:11:07.010 --> 03:11:07.830]
Don't shoot now.

[03:11:08.210 --> 03:11:09.210]
That's very well.

[03:11:09.470 --> 03:11:11.210]
Everybody knows that the bird is a well.

[03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:12.030]
No one cares.

[03:11:12.450 --> 03:11:13.330]
The birdies are a well.

[03:11:13.330 --> 03:11:13.330]

[03:11:13.330 --> 03:11:13.810]
The birdies are a well.

[03:11:14.130 --> 03:11:14.710]
No one cares.

[03:11:15.570 --> 03:11:18.410]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:18.730]
No one cares.

[03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:20.590]
No one cares.

[03:11:28.090 --> 03:11:29.310]
Oh, oh, oh.

[03:11:31.150 --> 03:11:32.310]
Pastro.

[03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:36.310]
Get out of your bar.

[03:11:38.570 --> 03:11:41.310]
We just can't use ya.

[03:11:43.610 --> 03:11:48.410]
You've been around way too long.

[03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:50.310]
Pastro.

[03:11:52.970 --> 03:11:55.310]
You are clip-pasta.

[03:11:56.310 --> 03:12:00.510]
Too long you've lasted.

[03:12:01.650 --> 03:12:07.250]
The bay of pigs should have worked.

[03:12:08.310 --> 03:12:11.930]
Fiddle, you make me sick.

[03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:15.930]
Get out of your bar quick.

[03:12:16.810 --> 03:12:20.010]
You also got them rich.

[03:12:20.250 --> 03:12:22.770]
You am ego bitch.

[03:12:23.610 --> 03:12:27.670]
This fall we know you like.

[03:12:28.090 --> 03:12:31.550]
Are you behind the strike?

[03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:34.790]
Where were you in 63?

[03:12:35.650 --> 03:12:37.810]
Did you kill Kennedy?

[03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.550]
I'm sorry.

[03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:52.750]
More than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than.

[03:12:52.750 --> 03:12:56.810]
The patient teeth there will lift the embargo.

[03:12:57.410 --> 03:13:01.270]
Cuba will become another key logo USA.

[03:13:03.270 --> 03:13:04.550]
USA.

[03:13:07.570 --> 03:13:11.830]
Returning all the raps and morts away.

[03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:14.170]
Close it.

[03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.730]
Pastro.

[03:13:18.910 --> 03:13:19.910]
Get out of Cuba.

[03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:22.230]
We just can't use ya.

[03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:24.290]
You've been around way too long.

[03:13:25.150 --> 03:13:25.710]
Pastro.

[03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:27.070]
You are clip-pasta.

[03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:29.010]
Too long you've lasted.

[03:13:29.470 --> 03:13:31.210]
The bay of pigs should have worked.

[03:13:31.690 --> 03:13:33.510]
Fiddle, you make me sick.

[03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:35.130]
Get out of your bar quick.

[03:13:35.730 --> 03:13:37.290]
You also got them rich.

[03:13:39.350 --> 03:13:40.850]
This fall we know you like.

[03:13:40.850 --> 03:13:42.490]
Are you behind the strike?

[03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:44.130]
Where were you in 63?

[03:13:44.350 --> 03:13:45.410]
Did you kill Kennedy?

[03:13:46.570 --> 03:13:50.610]
More than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than.

[03:13:50.610 --> 03:13:52.230]
Get out now and free your nation.

[03:13:52.470 --> 03:13:53.990]
Are you in domestic nations?

[03:13:54.270 --> 03:13:57.530]
Cuba will, the embargo, Cuba will become another key logo.

[03:13:58.130 --> 03:13:58.410]
USA.

[03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.350]

[03:14:01.850 --> 03:14:04.650]
Returning all the raps and morts away.

[03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.690]
Close it.

[03:14:07.330 --> 03:14:08.850]
Close it.

[03:14:08.850 --> 03:14:10.030]
Hasn't worked.

[03:14:11.850 --> 03:14:12.330]
Well cant be

[03:14:12.330 --> 03:14:12.630]
Okay, please.

[03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:30.310]
Half pineapple was langued.

[03:14:30.510 --> 03:14:32.030]
Try, here弓 key ring.

[03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:34.050]
You've be hung firm.

[03:14:34.210 --> 03:14:38.830]
I've been servir of it.

[03:14:38.830 --> 03:14:43.150]
For all the words but now the networks let their actors curse

[03:14:44.830 --> 03:14:47.310]
There's a wind and sights with this insanity

[03:14:48.030 --> 03:14:51.830]
All the diodes of contains profanity

[03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:55.930]
Swearing like a sailor on a pre-day path

[03:14:55.930 --> 03:14:59.010]
Words a whole lot worse than an apple

[03:14:59.010 --> 03:14:59.590]
Raccoons

[03:14:59.590 --> 03:15:03.690]
As far as bombs, how will it be?

[03:15:04.110 --> 03:15:07.050]
This morning drop the air bomb on a word TV

[03:15:07.050 --> 03:15:11.470]
As far as bombs, there's no telling where

[03:15:11.470 --> 03:15:14.050]
They'll drop on on a new field

[03:15:14.050 --> 03:15:15.210]
All right

[03:15:27.270 --> 03:15:30.650]
Don't carry me some stabs late one night

[03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:34.270]
When he insisted that the president wasn't doing things right

[03:15:34.270 --> 03:15:37.730]
Then bushes, numbers, fails arise

[03:15:37.730 --> 03:15:41.150]
And suddenly we began to realize

[03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:44.710]
They were doing the George Bush back

[03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:48.270]
His records they tried to track

[03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:51.710]
Supporters left in a flash

[03:15:52.850 --> 03:15:55.190]
They did the George Bush back

[03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:58.870]
From a tiny little office in the White House wing east

[03:15:58.870 --> 03:16:02.310]
He pondered terrorism and Middle East peace

[03:16:02.310 --> 03:16:07.770]
With the thought of John Terry grabbing more votes than thought of grabbing Terry

[03:16:07.770 --> 03:16:09.130]
By the truth

[03:16:10.270 --> 03:16:12.690]
They did the George Bush back

[03:16:13.750 --> 03:16:16.170]
His records they really tried

[03:16:17.610 --> 03:16:19.670]
Supporters left in a flash

[03:16:20.730 --> 03:16:23.170]
They did the George Bush back

[03:16:23.170 --> 03:16:26.530]
Carey's numbers were short and quite profound

[03:16:26.530 --> 03:16:30.050]
George had to do something and not monkey around

[03:16:30.690 --> 03:16:33.670]
Those important supporters he needed to revive

[03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:37.090]
With more anti-carry ads help them stay alive

[03:16:38.210 --> 03:16:40.730]
They did the George Bush back

[03:16:41.690 --> 03:16:44.190]
His records they really tried

[03:16:45.570 --> 03:16:47.550]
Supporters left in a flash

[03:16:48.650 --> 03:16:51.110]
They did the George Bush back

[03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:54.530]
Now everything's cool just as Carey had planned

[03:16:54.530 --> 03:16:57.970]
His vote of popularity begins to expand

[03:16:58.730 --> 03:16:59.690]
There's really no trick

[03:16:59.690 --> 03:17:04.970]
Just tell the truth and keep crushing the president with critical reviews

[03:17:06.190 --> 03:17:08.510]
They're doing the George Bush back

[03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:12.030]
His records they really tried

[03:17:12.030 --> 03:17:13.850]
His records they really tried

[03:17:13.850 --> 03:17:15.490]
It's catching on in a flash

[03:17:16.750 --> 03:17:19.370]
They're doing the George Bush back

[03:17:24.890 --> 03:17:28.490]
Oh, come on come come come

[03:17:28.490 --> 03:17:31.050]
Protect us with the guitar on my knee

[03:17:31.050 --> 03:17:32.810]
While they died in Louisiana

[03:17:32.810 --> 03:17:34.890]
I raised faster than we hoped

[03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:37.350]
Oh, cut, treat us

[03:17:37.350 --> 03:17:39.290]
Don't put no blame on me

[03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:41.290]
Let the come from my vacation

[03:17:41.290 --> 03:17:43.450]
For a photo of her to a tee

[03:17:43.450 --> 03:17:45.730]
Swing your partner round and round

[03:17:45.730 --> 03:17:47.790]
Now build a little swim into an orla style

[03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:49.270]
Swing to the left to the right

[03:17:49.270 --> 03:17:50.850]
Here we go, swing a little mud

[03:17:50.850 --> 03:17:51.810]
Now throw she go

[03:17:51.810 --> 03:17:53.710]
Oh, cut, treat us

[03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:55.690]
Why couldn't those people clean

[03:17:55.690 --> 03:17:59.790]
For this personal easy and a bad mid-ass player right here

[03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:04.850]
Oh, bye bye bye
