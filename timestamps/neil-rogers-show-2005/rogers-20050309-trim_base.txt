[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]
Hello nobody cares. You're right about that. I said Neil that there were two reasons why they and I said

[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.500]
Don't be complacent about that election, but it was the newspapers giving the governor credit

[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.340]
But I think that the Harold had a lot to do with it. No, Harold has no club. I disagree with it

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.320]
No, you know what is we don't respect it now

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.000]
They went on it. They went on a 10-day crusade. They're a hero lost their clout years ago

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.020]
The fact is that there is a group of people in Dave County that if anybody named Bushes jumped they'll ask how high plus

[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.760]
The biggest problem is the rest of the people didn't bother to vote

[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.720]
You know you can play in the old Cubans as much as you want and you'll notice they voted against it

[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.800]
The only ethnic group that voted against 56 to 42 Hispanics against which is mostly the old Cubans

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.960]
Right, but the fact that it matters when only 14% bother to get off the rest and vote you know channel 10 had a poll on

[00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.260]
Line last night 70% said yes for a good slots and only 30% against that state and Broward 70% the poll we took was like 90% in favor

[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.580]
So all the the fact is that overwhelming majority of the people in both counties were in favor

[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.460]
But most people said on a race so just like has been going on for years in Dave County

[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.680]
Everybody bitches and moans and the old Cubans this and it but everybody else this is sits on the air as it stays home

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420]
Yeah, I think this is this is a decnel for colder to me because you know here's Gulfstream

[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.320]
Just a few blocks away basically. I mean just a mile north and a little bit east and they got it and Carter does not

[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500]
No, here's what's gonna happen with colder because they won't be able to

[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.380]
Increase their purses right there are a lot of trainers who talked about this last summer

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.620]
They're not gonna stay here. They're gonna go to Delaware where there are purses

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.520]
They won't stay here and race anymore during the summer racing or colder is gonna be a disaster, you know

[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.940]
And well maybe Gulfstream will have to wind up being year-round

[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.860]
Ah, I hope not

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.900]
That's one of the things they had in mind all along because they're

[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.620]
Depending on how much the state is gonna live and put in there. They're gonna build a humongous casino facility with slots in there

[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.780]
Yeah, I'm the brownered side of their property, right

[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.620]
We'll see we'll see

[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.960]
Not over Neil talk about bad luck though man

[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.080]
Carter would just a few blocks out to the county line and here's Gulfstream just a few blocks north of the county line

[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.180]
What a difference a few blocks makes when they didn't know when they first started talking about the issue

[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.940]
They were saying that there was a good chance that they would have it first

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.960]
And because of the Broward Commission

[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.600]
Thranging its feet that they might have to wait a couple years for it, but it's just the reverse and

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.980]
You know they they're only hope is the two years from now

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.500]
They can come up for it again and win it this time

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.440]
But you know what as long as that newspaper exists and as long as you've got Armando, Kudina and

[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.540]
And Jeb Bush and don't you think that this fan is like an album and album?

[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.280]
I don't understand it we know listen to it don't you think the use of

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.300]
Yeah, I'm sure you know we're we're pounding away day after day on this yep absolutely and interestingly the Cubans and when it was the

[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.260]
Fascist Fatista in there had all those beautiful casinos that Marlensky was running in Havana

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.920]
Oh, they love casino gambling

[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.180]
So I think maybe if we had had like dominoes and cockpights in there

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.820]
They might have put it over the top and Superman there may be fast domino although I hear he's gonna be a Gulfstream

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.580]
And Superman yeah

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.300]
Let's remember that yeah, I remember Superman

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.440]
But Joyce will get upset if we get into that in to the graphic detail

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.520]
Well, that's just he was on stage when Johnny Ola told me about Superman. I remember

[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.460]
You broke my heart, yeah

[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.140]
That's Superman wrong Superman we'll talk about he didn't have a cape on

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.760]
Well, there's not too much going on here today except that one microphone's broken and the other one has a might stand

[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.760]
And I got a whole new attitude for you baby impact it was told to me by Berkeley or one of our really hot shot sales

[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.060]
Broad this morning she had a great line. I even wrote it down because I didn't want to misquote it

[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.120]
Just cash the check

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.360]
You told me that years ago

[00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.140]
So yeah, but this is a new twist on another words forget about copy forget about equipment forget a just cash the check

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.860]
So all everything else I've got a whole new attitude as it today

[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.480]
I'm drawing the line on the same forget about the ratings forget about our fine sponsors forget about copy forget about

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.800]
Microphones that work your homework just cash the check actually you're right. We're sorry like this like the sign that we got in the

[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.240]
NR studio there on the wall says just give us the F and money and that's our philosophy QA M

[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.720]
Okay, I won't worry about these things that come up for

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.080]
Next I'll listen you're gonna have a lot longer plus I have one other piece advice for you

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480]
Not gonna listen to me you're one of the last holdouts

[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.220]
Living in Dave County if I were you a guy that's making your bucks move the broward. I'm close

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.420]
Yeah, I know what you're getting close you gotta like get over the line. I'm in oven through

[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.260]
I'm not that far just go to show you just a few blocks too far south just get a nice place over the line

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.160]
You know what I'm five minutes to Gulfstream of my five minutes from Gulfstream with all the enters up there

[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.240]
I am five minutes away. We're almost old enough to live with the kindle commandos now. I do all those

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.840]
Oi

[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.320]
Shut up George

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.180]
You know it's great though hanging around the building and and watching the rented young women come walking into the Alta

[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.360]
Cockers upstairs really yeah

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.600]
The rented young women yeah, we're being rented by the Alta Cockers. Oh, I see

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.320]
I thought maybe we were talking about the chambermaids. I thought he was talking about this building. Yeah

[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.220]
Two weeks we used to say George

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.380]
All right, I haven't had baseball but you know I got some bad news. I just looked at the central Florida radar

[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.080]
I was looking for that dude. Oh don't tell me the game is gonna get rained off too. No, it's pouring here. I don't know how it isn't

[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.020]
Oh no

[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.460]
And that was another excuse it rained a little bit yesterday. So that was another good excuse

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.700]
I hope you people in Dave County are real happy that you're still stuck in the stone days. Okay you idiots

[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.440]
Very upset. They're gonna they're gonna be looking to blame somebody else. They got nobody to blame but themselves

[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.960]
There's over one million registered voters in Dave County 154,000 showed up

[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.820]
You know, a lot of people call you or want to know

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.960]
Hi, Leah was gonna be in an onslaught thing. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe I should have

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.480]
Hi, Leah. Yeah, that would have been good. Well, at least those people would have come out and voted just for the cock fight

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.640]
So that's all the over there although they're mayor

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.240]
Campaigned against it. Right. That's right

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.420]
And we know how honest he is

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.280]
I wonder who got the hand. You better not start up with him again. He'll beat the crap out of you

[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.960]
He could do that

[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.620]
Oh man. I think we have like

[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.180]
We're working a book. We could co-author a book. Yeah, only nobody would believe it

[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.640]
I don't think so and you notice by the way at one other point that I want to make the other day about very jackass

[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.140]
You notice how he's sucking up to the the other station now the 790. Yeah, goes to show a Greg read really paid off all those years of like only

[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.920]
We're doing very small calls and not talking to anybody else and give them all the inside dope really paid off for us big time

[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.000]
When the fan went on to your he put it on the front page of the paper to try to stick it to us and other

[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.340]
We got this stiff operation over there. It's oh, they're really fair and very well as Friday that article

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.520]
Maybe we want to puke the one where he put the disclaimer in the hero. Yeah, right. Well, it has nothing to do with this

[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.080]
Do you believe me? No, we don't very go back and eat your baloney sandwich

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.700]
Pathetic nothing. I'll ever change man. It's the same same thing faces change people come and go but it's the same place

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.720]
Wow, so that's a one thing you and I have in common besides loving the candle

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.880]
And by the way don't lose too much is that when we go home we both have to show our passport

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.980]
This is true. Yeah, you're in yeah, that's right. You're in a country to the north. I'm in a country that is correct

[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.760]
I'll take I'll keep this one. Thank you

[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.180]
Okay, I'll start looking around broward. Please

[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.440]
Although I'm only five minutes from the now slots now

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.720]
I don't play slot machines. It doesn't matter to me where they are

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.800]
You you'd go there and give it a shot. Not honestly the generate gambler like you if there's if there's a difference

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.760]
It's there where two leaves falling from a tree

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.900]
You bet which one would hit the ground? I might do that, but I would never put money in a slot machine

[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.680]
I never have really yeah

[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.840]
You'll never play the slot machine in your life. Yeah, maybe once I put a quarter in I'm not kidding

[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.780]
I'm not kidding you

[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:12.320]
I you know with the only time I ever played a slot machine and I was waiting for some people to come down

[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.460]
We were going to dinner and I was sitting by the front door and I threw a quarter in the slot machine

[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.500]
I have no interest in playing them none right

[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.320]
So no gambling it's not that kind of a form of gambling that interests me. Yeah, there's no brain work involved

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.920]
That's what you think that's not that is not correct

[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.100]
I sat two machines away from a guy that was a young couple sat down

[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.520]
They hit two grand on the line. They hit 400 on the wheel and I saw that machine have been dead all morning long

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.700]
And my machine was like keeping me even you know, it was keeping me going and the minute they left the guy

[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.820]
He said you want this one? I said yeah, I'm gonna give it a shot because as soon as it got hot

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.380]
I knew it was gonna pay within five minutes it gave me a thousand on the wheel and 1500 on the line

[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.200]
And I was out the door that was on Sunday like I said I'm gonna go play slots to staff then no no

[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.420]
I'm not the town y'all and I'm just telling you that if you use a little common sense sometimes you can know

[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.840]
Not my account something

[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.320]
I'd rather hit the pick six somewhere. There you go

[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.820]
But not today. I have enough trouble with the pick one sloppy track today. I won't be there. Oh a sloppy track is great

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.260]
I don't want to go lose money today because I've been following your lead. Okay. Yeah

[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.700]
You say don't lose too much. I'm not there. I won Saturday. I'm keeping my winning still next Saturday

[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.120]
By the way tomorrow's the 10th of March

[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.860]
I just want to remind some of the people are in the building in Rosmarts 10th its payday for most of us

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.020]
So it's very easy for for me to say just cash to check the only problem is getting it done in the first place

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.820]
Because this outfit still don't like to pay on payday

[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.660]
My last payday they had my check sitting in envelope there for three extra days

[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.360]
Just to make sure they could hold onto it for a while. Yeah, so like till a Greg puts the swig on it, which means it'll clear the bank

[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.700]
Greg's not here. No, that's what I'm saying

[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.600]
He's on permanent vacation. Yeah, I don't know where he is

[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.480]
And with that last trend if he's smart he won't come back. Yeah, I'm not worried about it

[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.580]
I just take the checks Neil. There you go. Just cash the check tomorrow Hank in fact you're probably on automatic

[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.220]
I'm on automatic. I'm on the fifth in the 20th. Yeah, there you go

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.660]
It's already in your account so that's all the more reason to go out and cleanse this afternoon. I could do that

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.900]
Yeah, I'm a pretty good sloth player

[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.660]
not a slot slot

[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:19.480]
Have a great day you two hang on to it. I'm doing it and your money too

[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:27.540]

I'm sorry

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.560]
All right, that between Monday and Tuesday we had eight hours of smiles on our faces

[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.720]
Dick and steve at poppin apart thanks for the fast guys. Okay. Go forget

[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.520]
I want my own machine five-hour real affordable machine with my name on it

[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.820]
I might actually spend more time in town, but I doubt it

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.980]
So there you go and I have bad vibes boys and girls about today's Marlon's exhibition game with a red song said Jupiter

[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.180]
Yeah, why because of the rain? No, if you look at I just looked at the central floor to radar the whole damn state

[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.160]
Well, it's a cover on it's pitch blackouts. Yeah, the whole state though is covered with that

[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.100]
I mean you think they're playing up in Jupiter with my catch of break. I don't know

[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.800]
We're supposed to get out here at 1250 today, which is the one great thing we had to look forward to and

[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.440]
Uh-uh don't look too promising. Oh already made a deadest appointment. Yeah me too. I got a uh, I'm getting drilled right Rook now

[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.640]
Oh, what's this you just sent me here? Are you really spelling Randy's name on the road?

[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.300]
Did we spell Randy? Oh, who cares how we spell it Jim?

[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.360]
Would you get a life at a life told there at the fix it? Oh, she's almost voted her

[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.840]
But Phil gets my click with the operative word being did did did

[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.820]
Anyway, can the early bird voters on your poll get a second vote for free? You vote as many times as you want

[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.480]
You know whatever makes you happy just like you people in tape you want to go back and vote again on the slot thing

[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.340]
Those of you jackasses that stayed home yesterday. Oh, man. Well it rained a little bit, you know

[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.000]
You know, I think Josh Cortes ought to take part in the blame for you. It's spreading the seeds of complacency

[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.560]
I'm a proud word guy. I don't that's not the point the point is you're on the show

[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.220]
And we have this vast audience. So we've got a lot of listeners in date. You know, I got them in

[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.740]
Yeah, it's Josh's fault and you're the one that spread the seeds of complacency there and they oh, why bother you know

[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.980]
I really carry out why bother it's uh, I watched that thing last night

[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.440]
Channel 10 by the way did a fabulous job on her website. They were the only ones and

[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.080]
It started out and in date county was 5,000 votes ahead. Yeah, this is his half of the precincts in 5,000 ahead

[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.600]
Then next time I came up with a new number it was like 2,000 votes ahead and I thought oh

[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.420]
We've seen this before the same pattern and then it came up with about three quarters of thing or now about

[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.000]
Lesson that and it was only um, there was 2,000 behind and then it was like six thousand some behind it

[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.160]
Wanda blues and by 65 of our votes in date county

[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.160]
14% of the people voted in date and I realized they didn't have all the municipal elections arrest like Broward did

[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.500]
But what you know who comes out for dog catcher, you know, all the silly things right so in Broward to pass 57 to 43%

[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.800]
Easy by over 26,000 votes and it would have passed by a lot more than that if the people who really cared what it come out and voted

[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.780]
Which they did not I mean when you look at every poll that we saw including the channel 10 pool shows 70% were in favor of slots in both

[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.320]
Data and Broward and it loses in date because nobody showed up

[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.460]
You and I've been saying this for all these years and you know what my attitude about that is the same as it is about Q.A.M

[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:53.600]
I just don't care do whatever you want don't bring me any copy just like Berkeley says just give us the just cash the check

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.880]
She made it official today not that she's in any position to make it official

[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.240]
But she you put the her imprimatur on it whatever that means where she put her rubber stamp on it

[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.000]
And then her line about our new sales managers sluggo. Oh, he doesn't come around because he's afraid of you

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.160]
Isn't that great? Where have we heard that before? This is our sales manager

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.260]
He doesn't communicate well guess what sluggo don't even bother coming back in because I don't care anymore

[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.880]
You can leave the same copy on offer in the next four years and you probably will I don't really care

[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.660]
That's the same with Dave County. I've been telling you this for as long as I can remember

[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.480]
I was killed in politician

[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.960]
Well, that's because nobody else runs and nobody else shows up to vote there the old the old Cubans are the ones you can

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.800]
Bet your life on it. They're gonna show up to vote come rain or hail or snow or

[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.560]
tornadoes or tsunamis. They're gonna show up

[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.420]
It's like a religion them and if Bush and anybody named Bush if it would have been no-eld Bush in between doing lines

[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.860]
If she would have said go out there and vote against it. It's bad. It's evil. I

[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.820]
You know, there's oh, yes. He's see mama seat. Yeah

[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.820]
Yeah, I'm telling you you know what of course Bush Bush

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.940]
Our theme and when Hank gave us a hero credit for this

[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.860]
I know that they ran a hysterical and nobody pays any attention to them anymore. They lost their clout years ago

[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.660]
You can thank the jib bush bush was the one who came in here and screwed Dave County again

[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.840]
He was getting on Spanish language radio because you know he is fluent of course of course

[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.260]
So there you go in him now

[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.340]
Yeah, rubbed off on and so as a result that's why their gets screwed

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.580]
Miami highlight gets screwed and call to get screwed and the people in the schools are gonna get screwed

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.160]
That's that's almost half that's three out of the seven facilities that aren't gonna be a run in it right away

[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.780]
Because uh your pice governor and of course, you know, he's anti-public education anyway

[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.020]
So it fits right in with his DB is playing right just a virtual of the electorate out of the agenda

[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.440]
They're your fat ass governor

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.480]
Boge, which you know that's same thing with a presidential election

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.920]
It's is the petable as the weather in Peoria man. There is no mistake about it

[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.840]
Well, I look at it's 10-13 already we're moving along here. We're supposed to get out here at 1250 there

[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.620]
I say we get out 1250 anyway. Let them worry about it right what else we got on no mode today

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.360]
Well, that'd be something to do do do do do do game we're got rained out. We had to bring Moan

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.600]
That's great ideas huh? That's a great idea bringing Moa 1250 is what I say my good close

[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.860]
Don't don't don't don't

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:19.080]
Holy machina. This is Joe Bo on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority. Neil God

[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.020]
We need a new pope

[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.620]
One that ain't so sick

[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.860]
A pope says it's wrong to show

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.380]
Altriboy's your piano stick

[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.640]
We need a new pope

[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.140]
What do things about her

[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.840]
That if you dress go all the way with clear pucks and a mini shirt

[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.680]
The pope who hates the good sir

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.080]
But once you have melt's wise

[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.140]
A pope who likes his party and it's courage a good time

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.380]
With yellow shots instead of wide

[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.260]
We need a new pope

[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.700]
One that isn't happening

[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:12.680]
Huh?

[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.620]
One who wears a fedorian stick of a bird they had on his head

[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:19.920]
What?

[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.800]
We need a new pope

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.240]
One who's really straight

[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.200]
It was a shopper cars you tried when he goes out on a date

[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.740]
A pope that makes it happen

[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.040]
A pope that's really cool

[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.140]
A pope that says rendition and say you'll be it a fool

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.220]
And a pope that does in drool

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.240]
Twenty past ten the two plus old exilios continue ruling in date counties very sad

[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.720]
Dan Rathers last newscast on CBS tonight which I'm sure they'll be very excited about because after all

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.320]
We know when they think of Dan they come on this that come on Easter the same old tired crap

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.260]
Raging soft floated down turning date county into an outdoor toilet for all these last many many years very sad

[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.160]
tragic as a matter of fact

[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.480]
So here's the deal

[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.860]
Tollywood Greyhound track Dania Highlight

[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.360]
Pompano Park and Gulfstream Park could begin adding slots as early as July 1st

[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.360]
But of course the state legislature has to do now the

[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.620]
Enabling legislation and decide how many machines are gonna how many machines you think they'll let them have

[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.540]
Stop turning man

[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.740]
Total

[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.020]
Right oh yeah, and all in all four places of course like about seven and a half a piece

[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.460]
And then it says that

[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.000]
Proponents will see that still from the bacon again

[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.220]
Proponents will likely as state county voters in two years to reconsider while the opponents

[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:47.920]
Those good Bible thumping yahoo holier than now are considering seeking a statewide referendum next year to repeal slots

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.720]
Which of course to talk about a waste of time and money anyway precinct samples from dayd showed

[00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:01.580]
That whites voted in favor of slots 55 to 45 blacks voted 56 to 44 in date county

[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:08.100]
But Hispanics were the deciding factor as usual the old tuteless crowd the exilios

[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:15.960]
They voted no 56 to 42 percent. What doesn't add up to 100 but somewhere in there who knows what the rest were doing

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960]
They were like I don't know playing dominoes

[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.440]
How do you like that?

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.880]
True

[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.660]
So it's the same old crap and like I said you can blame those people or you're looking to mirror and blame yourselves because most of you didn't vote

[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.440]
And I'm gonna tell you right now, you know

[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.000]
It's nice getting notes and stuff and thanks for your help and Broward and so on

[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.220]
Uh, I'll take some of the credit for that a little bit

[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.300]
Although it should have passed by a much much healthier margin in Broward

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.400]
You know 26,000 votes isn't too bad

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:44.040]
But we sure don't have any cloud in Dave County and and you want to know why what because this show

[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.060]
Hey, we have nothing in common with Dave County of no interest in Dave County

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:53.160]
I don't live there you don't live there. Josh doesn't live there. Uh, I still say that if there was a way for us to retool our signal

[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.760]
No, no because you know we had a trouble a lot of trouble being heard inside buildings and your

[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.080]
Power wires in the car if we could like push the whole signal north in the Broward and Palm Beach

[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.800]
We'd be you know going to help a lot more service because Dave County is like alia. I mean alien to us at least to me

[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.840]
I mean no speaking out of my language and it's just the whole thing

[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.340]
Is very very sad and it's never going to change. It's like it's like QAM

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.400]
It's never going to change. That's why I just gave up today. I'm just totally give up good

[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.040]
Yeah, cave in just take the chair of the bed and screw everything else

[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.100]
We can make a trouble

[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.840]
Because there's no point all that does is shorten your life stress kills

[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.060]
That's right when you die bed at a kind of state county

[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.760]
We can sit here and rail about the herald and about uh mayor this one and that one

[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.080]
The fact that it matters is that's what the people there want

[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.860]
They want it to be an after a funeral parlor

[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.300]
They're living in a dream world

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.080]
They got one foot in the ocean. They're waiting to cross back to Cuba again, which is not never going to happen

[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.660]
Although quite frankly those old exilios that voted against this thing yesterday

[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.460]
We'd be more than happy to find some leaky banana boats and put your asses on and send you back where you came from

[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.780]
Because quite frankly south Florida be a hell of a lot better place without your

[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.380]
Without your the cancer that you've created on Dave County and that's exactly what you've done

[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.460]
You have created a cancer in the community here is something that would have brought in thousands of jobs

[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.480]
Uh, you can argue about how many dollars, but certainly a significant amount of dollars for public education

[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:19.320]
And and given p given people some place to go and brought a lot of tourist back in who wouldn't be going on to cruise ships and go to the Bahamas

[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.220]
I mean the deposit is outweighed the negatives by a zillion to a titan

[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.080]
None

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.560]
Yeah, but and don't confuse these people ever with the facts

[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:33.940]
It's always well jet boosted this and boost that and by and on you mom visa and therefore like a bunch of sheep like a bunch of lemons

[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.600]
They do tofully go out there and buy a beep but it will and in a single tired crap

[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.740]
So I you know I my recommendation to anybody living and breathing because let's face it 44% of the people in Dave County

[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.060]
What was it 50 no 48% voted for it?

[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.900]
So that's almost half so just like I told the Humper this morning move to Broward move to Palm Beach get out of there already

[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:58.600]
Let Dave County just just hand it over okay. It's been a bloodless coup anyway for the last 40 or five years now

[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.420]
Just hand it over here. You go

[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.160]
It's a festering sewer of corruption and crap you have it

[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.120]
We're gonna go live somewhere where we have like a little voice

[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.400]
So I take back what I said yesterday that didn't about South Florida

[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.320]
See I think it's really Broward and Palm Beach counties because more and more people are moving like to Boka and

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.720]
Places in Palm Beach Delray Beach

[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.840]
Um, it's Broward and Palm Beach

[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.400]
Don't include Dave County when you talk about South Florida versus the rest of the state because it's the same red

[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.240]
Dek mentality just with a spoken with a different language, you know what I mean?

[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.080]
Thanks, buddy, buddy

[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.520]
You talked about that a million times this speaks in the Higgs have more

[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.020]
In the vision and you do what they want a bit right so there you go

[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.000]
WDQA in election central. Hello

[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:42.160]
Might see there's our first call was a good one you can hear him snapping his gum WDQA in hello and neo high

[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]
Domenon okay man

[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.160]
White Hispanic

We voted yes yesterday. Yeah, and I'm in our defense towards two late man get out there gonna come and get your ass

[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.080]
But I see what I'm gonna say is why these are who those wanted against it if you go down there to make a soup in the seminal one

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.280]
And that's how you see the whole who knows yeah because the old because bush told them bush

[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.480]

[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.640]

[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.120]
See it the Broward line man one of those days. Okay. Oh, I didn't do any of our stuff yet

[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.000]
You know, and we better hurry because we got a baseball game

[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.840]
I I would say the chances of that game being played today on a scale of zero our minus infinity

[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.620]
I don't know

[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.300]
Huh?

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.440]
Huh? Oh, I'm hoping I'm wrong on that. Oh, it always look good. Brian

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.260]
Right I'm looking at that radar and the whole state looks like it's covered by a tsunami now

[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.600]
If that's just you know, these are like greens and medium greens. It's like yellow like that

[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.440]

[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.460]
Could have made a huge difference in the out off your ass you go out there

[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.560]
But you didn't do a dindia. Did you do it now you took the Josh Cordis way out the easy way out lazy

[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.460]
strips of the fishes

[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.620]
John

[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.080]
Taxi

[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.020]
Several

[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.940]
You look at me so quissitory

[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.740]
Telltale he was in the dark

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:51.260]

I asked him for a pint of Belgium Beem is just knowing the end of what doesn't mean

[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.620]
The butter's to English

[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.120]
That the corner deli

[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.100]
Hell I think I'm in Pakistan

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.760]
You can go back to your ass

[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.180]
I

[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.080]
Came here many years ago

[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.020]
Learn my abysses. I don't say much as gross years

[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:49.340]
So get yourself to a classroom quicker American now stop making mistakes

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.400]
You know

[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.940]
1033 2074 11 and brow it in Palm Beach counties. We are not the recognizing they know more we're just I've had it

[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.800]
I'm just a terrible for almost 30 years now 29 long years nearly

[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.900]
Almost 30 been fighting a good fight and it's just that there's no point all I crap about the assimilation process and people are gonna

[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.040]
Get with it what a bunch of phony hypocrites man

[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.280]
So he had to be sitting down there playing dominoes in dominoe park or be going to the illegal cock fights in highly and sweet

[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.500]
Water that's okay, but the fact that we might actually derive some revenue and some

[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.760]
Something good in the South Florida. Oh, we don't want that because boot said it's bad. It's bad

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.540]
I have your mom be said it's bad. Well, he wouldn't like oh no not governor

[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.080]
But not our fat ass governor with his coax-norton daughter and his smuggling wife and his psychotic sons

[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.940]
56705 65 like I said there's no sense of getting you said it's never got a change

[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.500]
It's the same thing I mean once once upon a time

[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.120]
It was like a little glimmer like just maybe we're starting to make a little bit of progress

[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.760]
But we have no impact no cloud in Dave County might as well forget about it

[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.520]
It's a damn good thing. We're that close to the county line and like Hank says he's in adventura

[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.080]
He's like a stone's throw from the county line

[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.200]
So if you're not gonna like move all the way to Browell at least get close

[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.740]
So that when it comes time for the exit is the mass exit is you'll be close enough to make it before they shut the gates

[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.600]
What took over the line? One took over lines a good idea. How many QIM hello

[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.840]
Yeah, good

[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.100]
Good one. Nobody QA him. Hello

[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.160]
On colonial. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay?

[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.080]
Cuban Julio that voted in favor of a prostitution yesterday

[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.560]
Well, you know, I wasn't surprised. It's like you said we can cry in bitch

[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.540]
But those old Cubans go out and vote a lot of us down our ass and we're gonna do it and we still stand our ass

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.160]
That is right

[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.580]
Both my kids go to public schools

[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:45.940]
So I figured look any chance of getting any money for the schools or the shop because that's correct

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.220]
terrible

[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.680]
The way the look at it is what's not to like you know

[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.840]
Yeah, even a shot, but you know and let me tell you one more thing you mentioned

[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.180]
About six or seven months ago. I had them on and you know, yeah, I'm sure and you know

[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.380]
He's become like rush junior

[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.200]
He's a total

[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.760]
Yeah, he was talking about the middle east and you know

[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.340]
Ripping into them and some guy causing you can tell you know, he's like somewhere from the middle east and he's so still

[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.480]
You know fill your generalizing your grouping of thoughts terrorists. That's the right

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.080]
It's the fellow the guy will sort of what you from originally. He was watching for my ran or you know

[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.040]
But you know I went to school here. I'm an American citizen and I love America. It goes well

[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.000]
Then I care about you at that and the government is I mean it says this on the air. You'll sir

[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.260]
I don't care if we kill every single Iraq

[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.700]
Real I'm not that I heard I heard him say it no one told me about it

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.200]
I'm like how can you say that even if you're thinking it on the air. I would just blow away. Okay

[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.940]
Unbelievable. Amen. Having closing the ocean

[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:51.960]
567

[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.240]
While somebody's got to say it because I know that mode doesn't stand

[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.260]
I heard Moa at the beginning of a show yesterday going into this ranting and raving about well

[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.660]
You know the gorilla that proceeds is we don't know every day

[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.480]
We're gonna start out talking about anything except sports. That's a good idea because sports talk quite frankly is boring

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.880]
So let's one thing you're right about most sports talk is terminal

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.700]
Which is why you know when you got Hank and Mad Dog you have to be named personalities and little dog over there in the other place

[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.900]
Who's got certain sponsors up his ass by the way?

[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.520]
I think Joe's gonna have to see the partologist pretty soon because between that air conditioning guy and the other one

[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.480]
You know the mortgage guy between those two. We've got them so far up his ass. They're coming out of his earlobes

[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.200]
You know that that's what I was told by our sales department this morning

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.600]
By the way the air conditioning guy that they were talking about I've used him in my home for 10 years

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.500]
But never again switching to some new people now, you know, I mean that's the way it goes

[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.920]
You smear my hand and I'll smear you a little bit. Maybe on the neck. Maybe on the earlobe. You're the queer

[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.880]
Yeah, you're the queer. That's what we're playing. You're the queer very good line nine. That's your boyfriend. Q.I.M. Hello

[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.700]
Hey, you know how you feel about okay. What a surprise. I just

[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.180]
Curtain yesterday. I don't know if you guys are aware you had about

[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.440]
29 different pictures on there

[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.140]
29 different pictures of one of naked girls of all the girls that you've had in the past

[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.860]
The back door by accident nice job. Oh, yeah, you can you pay me in the back door. He's soon

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.660]
Well, yeah, well, we don't want to go into it. We don't want to go into it too deeply. Okay, so we'll talk you right there and have everything right

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.440]
I don't know where he's going with that, but I think I have a pretty much no idea

[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.160]
Hopefully right back out the back door. Yeah, exactly. Go right out the exit sign

[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.640]
Well, like Berkeley says just cast the F and check

[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:39.440]
What a simple vintage man. Yeah, she had her finger on it. Yeah, she had her finger on it. All right. That's what Trice

By the way, try to make me to tell us through about him in scurranathy was that the Christmas party? When was that?

[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.980]
Oh one of those parties who one of those Q.A.M. parties when there were stories going on there

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.780]
All kind of stories on the street, you know, just like I heard that story. Yeah

[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.340]
I'll tell you one thing she ain't no band leader

[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.860]
That's not what I heard

[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:06.040]
What Todd Coast Niel has worked with other than a Q.A.M. Did you like the best over the years over all these 29 years?

[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.600]
320 votes so far. But who don't have any Chris Baker Chris Baker don't have any. Oh my god. Yeah, exactly

Everybody's got to see

[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.440]
Only in the banana republic baby only in Miami

[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:57.400]

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.080]
Kane is in New York, fella. What he was doing show. I don't want to be back. I can show you that

[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.500]
But well, then who do you want? I do you want you want Alan for it?

[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.500]

[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.800]
Then what the hell do you want in the air silence?

[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.760]

[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.260]
But is that all you want? Is that all we have to kind of content? Do you want during two to six?

[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.480]
Here the next 10 major show this afternoon at two on this top radio six 10

[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.800]
W I O D

[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.820]
Yeah, obviously not you Stan. It's what they want 1043 17 before 11 o'clock

[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.440]
So one good thing about the rain. I'm becoming very a doppler radar intensive right now

[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:47.160]
Okay, there's a huge blob that's covering almost the entire state. It's more than I lightning man. It is good. Mocha

[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.340]
It is smoking across the state

[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.580]
So if they have to feel covered up there in Jupiter

[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:56.820]
We might just get that the baseball game in red socks in marlins it to 1250 pregame game time 105

[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:02.040]
Mad Dog follows the baseball game and we pray see out to the wind that big blob is all over the state

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:08.060]
Because the Lord is really pissed off and fired up about the people in deed county and about their stupidity about

[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.760]
You know sticking it to their kids again and taking away money for public education

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.460]
The Lord is really pissed off and fired up about it, okay?

[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:20.080]
Because he knows that Jeb Bush and the whole Bush family are a bunch of phony baloney hypocrites who are a bunch of coaxed-norton drunks

[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.920]
But nevertheless, I'm telling you that's why it's going on. Do you believe me? I do

[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.800]
Here's the fact it says I'm a lifetime-date county resident

[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.780]
I've never thought about moving me for but I'm out of this third world country now

[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.140]
I bet if this phone had something to do with their beloved baseball

[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.020]
These Julio bastards would have voted yes

[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.120]
And by the way that whole baseball thing is phony baloney also sure

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.020]
All that I every time we've had any kind of a sports thing to oval a cubans love their baseball and they don't show up

[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.220]
So I know what the hell they're talking about when if they build that stadium by the orange bull if they snooker

[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.680]
The state into putting that money up and they build a stadium for the marlins by the orange bull

[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.520]
You wait and see who's gonna show up there, huh?

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.220]
It's an unoriented stereotype

[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.840]
And it says by the way, I'm gonna be 47% of what do you yes? Well the good news is it was 48%

[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.920]
So we're not like painting the day with a broad brush. It's just a toilet. That's all I'm better get out

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.740]
We're not like condemning everybody in date just the 48% who are unfortunate enough to be stuck there and obviously can't get out

[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.420]
PSI know it's not a building pool, but well, no, we could add a couple names on there

[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.860]
It's not we're not looking for that but the bird certainly qualifies to be on there even though George will be very upset about that

[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.940]
The bird why would you say that? Huh if we could put the bird on there. What about Dave Caprita? Of course wait

[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.480]
Oh, that's right. What? No, nothing. I forgot how far back you were going. That's right good old Dave

[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.820]
Well, what do you mean how far back I was going? It says

[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.260]
Just because I only have a memory of IOD you have to understand

[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.360]
Oh

[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.320]
That how cares about IOD anyway, you know

[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.100]
Oh geez, well, yeah, I'm not gonna read this thing about the skemo case for you

[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.300]
No, a lawyer for a former dentist accused of oh

[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.760]
We're out of here for this new story that is disgusting

[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.420]
Here comes my bacon. Uh-oh

[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:03.080]
Man, I thought it was something about the royal navy about the semen, but it's not that kind of oh don't send me no more stories

[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.180]
Don't ever give an order like that again

[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.540]
Jesus

[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.420]
Even for this show that's too grotesque. I mean that is just over the top so to speak

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.840]
Yes, it was yeah over the top of the

[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.360]
bottom teeth

[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:24.280]
The state department ward US travelers yesterday to be extra watchful for terrorism and anti-American violence abroad

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:30.680]
Oh my god watch out for a broad a the department of state is deeply concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks against U.S.

[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.840]
citizens and interest abroad as well as the potential for demonstrations and violent actions against U.S.

[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.540]
Citizens and interest overseas the warning said by the way, thank you for those low gas prices Mr

[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.680]
And for the Americans people being loved all over the world

[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.340]
U.S. citizens are reminded that demonstrations and writing can occur at any time and I'm on with notice

[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:54.120]
That's why I'm very Canadian a the updated warning says future alkyte attacks could involve non-conventional weapons such as chemical or biological

[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.300]
agents as well as explosives

[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.420]
Terrorist acts may include that I'm not limited to assassinations high jacking

[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:08.480]
Bomings or kidnapping the department said U.S. citizens are encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness

[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.080]
Oh my god, not that we want to make anybody panic you're anything like that

[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.760]
The old thing again taking shared taking panic you the short one more

[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.320]
The short warning updates a similar warning issue last fall expires in September in 2000

[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.520]
And

[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:30.860]
The warning expires into like like a drug like a medication right it expires in September

[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.140]
No source for assertions about alkyte already tell the terrorist capabilities

[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.160]
Oh

[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.640]
It says while Americans are generally not the targets of such incidents U.S. citizens could be caught up in the violence

[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:49.560]
The war or not is the case may be and this warning expires September 5 mark it down good that is just so juicy and so perfect man

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.000]
Is that like love day when will all be loved right now? It's gonna be the love parade in Berlin. We're all going to Berlin for some of them

[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.500]
Browse by the way, whatever happened with that Browse guy

[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:03.360]
What now which is that which is that sales guy that you would give me a son and then not that I carry you understand because I've given up carrying

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.400]
Billy. What was his name Billy no not Billy it was like or marker

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:16.200]
You got across to some milk. Oh, I see so Billy was the one with the Browse guy correct and what happened with that where did Billy

[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.280]
This maybe Billy's not there anymore. So he's around let's see him around

[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.760]
He's round on top five six seven oh five fifty. Let's rehash yesterday's you know

[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.180]
We got the good news in Browse. Let's hear it

[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.100]
Nice going even though it was pretty weak, you know

[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.680]
Should have been much more overwhelming than that

[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:39.120]
But that's still pretty heavy duty 57 to 43% that's that's a landslide by any measure of anybody's

[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.440]
Evaguation right right and so Gulf Stream and Pompidopark and Hollywood Greyhound Trank and who might leave it out

[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.540]
Who's the fourth one and Danny Highlight?

[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.860]
Mm-hmm. They will benefit greatly and as a result date County will have to wait a couple of years to put it on there again

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.020]
And they're just sucking wind as usual. They're just a day late in the many-dollar short

[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.680]
Because date County continues suck it up to the wrong people always corrupt

[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:07.160]
Julio politicians and the Bush family anybody who's a good crook man. They love it in date County whether it's Joe Carrillo or

[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.680]
a Raul what's his name

[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.340]
In higher lea martina's Raul Martinez any any crook they love him in date County

[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.000]
And that's what it's all about of course they love all the courts in Cuba too. So actually it'll be a different on

[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.280]
On the mainland

[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.340]
Somebody Q a.m. Hello. Hell no. Yes, sir. How are you today good? All right congratulations on another great year radio

[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.180]
And what was the result of the

[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.580]
The vote

[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.760]
I've been on the rock today what vote I just tuned in

[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:44.040]
They'd Broward County past it 57 to 43 overwhelming and date County v to 52 to 40 lost in date by

[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.160]
6500 votes because everybody stayed home

[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.100]
All right, I'm gonna be all the old. What?

[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.180]
Sounds great. Sounds great. Yeah, why is that?

[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:57.620]
Well, I mean I kind of opposed it, but and why is that? Well, you know, I kind of bought into the fear tactics

[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.420]
They said what well, you know, the whole fear of what? Fear of a good time. Fear of jobs. Fear of money coming in. Fear of what?

[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.100]
Just a crime. I don't know

[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:13.840]
Crime where crime what crime? What are we talking about? What kind of crime takes place at the racetrack?

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:20.060]
Well, I should. So what crime are we talking about? I don't know. It's just a fear fact that you know about

[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.640]
Well, are you are you making an announcement to the public that you're an idiot and you're you're just

[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:31.240]
susceptible to any time somebody starts screaming at panic you get all panicky? Well, I'm known for it sometimes. Oh, okay

[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.480]
Well, thanks for your honesty anyway

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.960]
That was great

[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.660]
Oh, it's the panic man. That was beautiful. At least he's honest.

[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.340]
All that crime. Oh my god, when you go to go strip the only crime is all those old people

[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.680]
It's to open up the racing form

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.680]
A leaning over like 10 seconds of post-time and putting the last couple of horses in the gate and they're leaning over

[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.800]
They're like two people behind them praying you're gonna get your bed in and they're like handicaping at the window

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.660]
You know, just launched over to bring well, let's see. I'll have they one over to four five eight

[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.760]
No, I don't think that you know and then the bell rings and they're off in a horse

[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.500]
You won six to one shot wins by five and you get no bet down. That's a crime. Oh

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:19.060]
I mean so many stupid people in so little time, you know, he bought into the fear of yeah, yeah

[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.060]
Because he's stupid and he admits it though. Give him give him some points for that

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.200]
Here's the facts from Jean Rogers one of our very chronic

[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.220]
faxers

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.440]
Try calling several times this morning. Guess us folks from Broward can't call Miami number anymore

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.260]
Whatever I don't know what does that mean these aren't Miami numbers first happy anniversary second

[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.940]
The reason the old Cubans didn't vote for the slots because it would take away from their cock fighting business

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.660]
I think I mentioned that third

[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.880]
I'm surprised the government doesn't make the gas pump slot machines the way the prices are going

[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.200]
They need more money for Iraqi Iraq last toward those naked old folks in your website

[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.760]
Those are the supreme court justice is a little bit doctored off. Please okay get with it a little bit

[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.500]
He's a little bit in the behind the time. How's that radar coming? I'm like every break

[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:02.860]
I'm gonna check that because we are praying for baseball. We love the marlins in the daytime right? That's right

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.260]
I'll have a sign on the door for the maid, you know come back after one. It's usually after two

[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.420]
That's right. We have plans. Yeah, I have times like going to lunch early and getting the hell out of here

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.600]
Maybe you can go over to woodbind and see if I can get robbed and raped and murdered

[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.020]
Although one on a good day you can get all three. I mean seriously

[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.000]
What crime is this man talking about?

[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.100]
Are you still is it possible to be so stupid? Yeah, do it. Brian could be so stupid. Yeah, crime

[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.180]
That's crime. You know, yeah, not at least the center crime

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.040]
Right, the criminal is crime mafia crime

[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.120]
Oh

[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:43.320]
It is so it's so pathetic that it just makes me hurt. It makes me ache all over my body. It makes me weak limp

[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.180]
Dominic you a and crime central. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:53.700]
You know the amazing thing about date counties and all those little bars and little Havana all those places have illegal gaming machines and already

[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:54.900]
Oh my god

[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:01.060]
And then someone else the I this guy regarding crime people I talked to yesterday in date County

[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.180]
They were actually saying the same thing. It's really like this last Mosul. Yeah

[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.060]
It's really it's really un-frick and believable. They want crime there's more crime on the cruise ships

[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.720]
So there is on the street. Yeah, I don't read about anybody getting raped at the track

[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.300]
But on a cruise ship so we'd about guys girlfriends and wives and both getting raped all the time right to give us another reason to get out of date County

[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.480]
Amen good right

[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.720]
Yeah, we love brown and Palm Beach gravy and date County all I can say is we sympathize with you half

[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.060]
You know because it's obviously not our crowd don't play must we had 90% of our people under poig yesterday

[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:36.820]
Out of a thousand well out of whatever. I mean the ones who actually voted yesterday know we had over a thousand and over 900

[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:42.640]
And said they voted yes and only a hundred and so on no so the old time our crowd our crowd speak at English

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.340]
How do you like that all you toothless old

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.420]
Coots

[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.400]
Geeks man is if they could get whipped up in for something positive the community as much as they do negative like all that

[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.620]
Alien crap alien alien

[00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:01.900]
I don't believe well whipped up into a hysterical frenzy forming at the mouth burning tires in the streets

[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:09.420]
You know having demonstrations blocking off the McCarthy crossway doing all kind of destructive crap making it the laughing stock of the world again

[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:15.260]
Over a damn child custody case because every time the Spanish language media starts

[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.620]
Fan in the flames again all you got to do is like whisper in your ear

[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.480]
But I mean put a boop put a bump in right away. They just the less like the flamingos and highly

[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.660]
I just blow the whistle and they start marching and do stepping

[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.320]
So you know the idea that all this assimilation bull crap date County is never gonna change

[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.860]
It is never ever gonna change. I don't care if it's 50 years from now

[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.920]
If we went into a coma if they froze us like 10 William's head and 300 years from now

[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.460]
We came back. There would still be the same bull crap in date County

[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:46.400]
And they still be screaming about who's gonna speak any in ways here and a same old tired crap and how's alien doing and is how's this happy

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.720]
Mule is that been grown anymore?

[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.940]
Jesus KF and Christ

[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.320]
For all of those okay and air I threw a few extra ones there. Yeah, no, they were all pretty. Oh, I like

[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.700]
I like these smart ass answers because yes, they were only the last ones worth reading. Yeah, no, they're cute

[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:05.200]
Teacher smart ass answer of the year a college teacher reminds her class of tomorrow's final exam now class

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.500]
I won't tolerate any excuses for you not being here tomorrow

[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.920]
I might consider a nuclear attacker a serious personal injury or illness or a deaf and your immediate family

[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.040]
But that said no other excuses whatsoever a smart ass guy in the back of the room raised his hand and asks

[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.200]
What would you say if tomorrow I said I was suffering from completing outer sexual exhaustion the entire class does

[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:28.620]
It's best to staff all their laughter and snickering when silences restore the teacher smiles knowingly if the student shakes your head and sweetly says

[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.240]
Well, I guess you'd have to write the exam with your other hand

[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.600]
Yeah, I kind of like that kind of cute not fall down on the floor laughing peeing your pants cute, but but cutesy, you know

[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.780]
Yeah, cutesy like what's your name opera Levine?

[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.400]
Okay, you can see fighter what Josh Kord is saying man. It doesn't vote on election day man

[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.460]
What a piece of turret didn't vote yesterday's election as a five-oat-people like him

[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.140]
That's right ask me if I voted did you vote? No, but they didn't need my vote because I live in Broward in the same year

[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.340]
I just got your sand that if you just calm down. I just got your off-road time say

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.440]
Broward passed easy man

[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:11.160]
26,000 plus votes plenty of the spare two bastards and date cutty that sit on your ass and bitch in moan about the killbins in the

[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:16.200]
This one and the parties and the Jews and then everybody else and meantime you sit in there like a like a bump on the log

[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.520]
Like a dead man or woman in a suit in a burlap sack, which is where a lot of you belong

[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:27.320]
You'd be doing a much better public service just ended all man. Just go to the nearest overpass or the underpass and take a yump

[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.960]
That's it. We'll see you 1057 at 560 WQA and

[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.580]
This is the new Roger show

[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.320]
This is your brain

[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.220]
Any questions

[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.740]
Right now what's the meaning of this?

[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:10.740]
Pants you see I'm not busy. It's both of he said a word and I don't know what to do

[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.660]
I just don't know

[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.240]
What word he said he said

[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.900]
Toddger

[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.220]
Toddger what does that mean?

[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:21.560]
Right

[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:33.380]
I called Joyce and get to the bottom of all of it. A way does yes, but you have a quarter for why it's a pay cell phone sure here

[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.140]
Hello, Joyce and I look at we have a word that Boka said we don't know what it means

[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.820]
It's Toddger

[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:56.280]
Okay, what did she say? Well, she doesn't know either, but we'll stall payment on Boka's invoice in other two months just for good measure

[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.880]
That's a relief now get up on my desk and pretend you're a chicken again

[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.020]
Ah

[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:24.260]
Love it. Oh three QAM so I looked at the array darn it and look to promising. I'll take it that some big slimy green one

[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.580]
They've been the right toward the coast some big slimy greenies man come right to the florist coast

[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.800]
So I'm just trying to hear man. It's brilliant looking outside beautiful. Oh quick. Let's move the game

[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.560]
Yeah, let's play it up here at the sky dome at least they can get inside where they'll be warm and safe without all that crime

[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.280]
And it's minus nine that's also is what's not to like about that right all the way up to minus six to seven

[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.780]
I think that sounds like a good day for wood buying for like losing your ass five six seven oh five safety

[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:53.220]
Come on. Let's hear from some of your old Cubans out there. Come on. Let's go now that guy to cub before he didn't vote

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.420]
But he was gonna vote against it right the one that just crawled off from out of the rock

[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.180]
Right one probably might not send to a rock that sounds like a winner to me. Okay

[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.800]
5 6 7 0 5 60 all you people are you literally around by Jeb Bush man

[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.960]
You ought to be ashamed to yourself by that fat ass phony when that smuggling wife and his psychotic kids and his

[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.480]
Cokes sort of daughter just to kind of upstanding family. I'm sure everybody would love to have

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:26.640]
W.A.M. Hello. Yes. Hello. Yes. Yes. Am I on the air? Yes, ma'am. It sounds just like you. Okay. Uh, is this Neil? Yes, it sounds just like me

[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.120]
Let me tell you. I am

[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.120]
I'm sorry every time I get in the car with my husband and he makes me listen to you

[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.500]
I found the way you talk about the Cubans the Cubans made Miami

[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:43.440]
Miami was a crazy town when I came here 45 years ago and Miami has was made by the Cubans who made a name for themselves

[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.720]
Yeah, in their first generation. I don't know what's the matter with you

[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.760]
But let me tell you I'm really really honest to have to listen to you

[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.420]
Maybe your husband maybe your husband hates you like poison

[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.520]
My husband what hates you like poison if he's punished. Oh my husband doesn't hate me my husband

[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.020]
The why is he listening to why is he got to camp up in the radio right now he must be doing it to punish you because he knows that you

[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:12.900]
He has terrible taste that's a problem here. He has been as far as far as women. I would agree with that

[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.200]
Terrible taste is what he had. Did you did you vote yesterday?

[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:23.900]
Not click there she goes. Yeah, that's the question. She's one of those exilios that voted me. I know and her husband knows that she's a nasty bitch

[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.880]
She just just the hell she didn't are you kidding me? She probably voted about five times

[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.160]
bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapa just reach over and turn the radio okay. Speaking English. Yeah

[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.020]
Well, she probably don't want to let it out

[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.800]
She's very upset and she's being forced at gunpoint to listen to show. I understand lady I understand you hate to show

[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.460]
It's just that you're being forced. Of course

[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:49.060]
W.A.M. Hello. Hey, Neil and by the way we'll pack you an extra medium. Oh, yeah on your way back

[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:55.820]
yes, I can I talk that I want to buy jet bush a couple of costs because he closed the deal on day county

[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.900]
That's right only closures get the coffees

[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.220]
The only closures get coffee right and now I feel safe in day county because all the rate boost and all the crime

[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:07.300]
Is gonna move to brown and we're gonna be crime free here. They know correct you've been all right

[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.720]
No, they can't that'll solve that stat we had to do the day about Miami being number three in our country

[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:17.080]
It's our country third worst but it'll be like a crime scene. I'm telling you there was a crime in day that yesterday

[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.780]
It was that election that was a crime that was criminal and that bitch that just called us a couple of calls back

[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.520]
No wonder your husband hates you like poison and probably has her tied up, but you know

[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.000]
He probably got a hold of phone to the side of her head. He's probably got her tied up and bound

[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.000]
Yeah, nice go on tally. Don't let her out. Nobody Q. A.m. Hello

[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.140]
Great. It's it's pulling down here at home set. Oh God number one number two

[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:49.280]
See if you can trace that call get that lady and give her a present give her some kind of price never have I heard more true or worth

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.140]
The cousins made Miami what it is today. That's right exactly

[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.560]
And they made the name from the cells, but we can't say it over the air

[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:08.440]
Oh no, I think it began with an amon and it's a a mother the woman who accused Bill Cosby of sex like molester

[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:13.680]
Is filed a civil lawsuit against the entertainer the woman and via constant filed the lawsuit with the West district court

[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.760]
And it felt that off a year today the lawsuit includes five counts of alleged alleging battery assault and clicks to the

[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:25.060]
Marshall distress defamation and invasion of privacy last month prosecutors in Montgomery County declined to bring criminal charges against the

[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.720]
60 70-year-old entertainer, so they found insufficient evidence to support the woman's claims the civil complaint

[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:36.220]
The ledges that cost the game constant three blue pills when she told them she was stressed out saying they were an herbal remedy

[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:40.840]
Laura's for the woman of former Temple University employee now lives in her native Canada right down the road

[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:46.740]
They say they now believe the pills were some form of narcotic. She lives like in where was it not ashua?

[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:53.580]
Like Pesumbo is some suburb of Toronto the complaint ledges that Cosby rev the winds breast and general areas and digitally penetrated her

[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:59.800]
Meaning this is from the ABC this is unbelievable. Wow. This is from the ABC website. Okay?

[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.200]
ABC news analogous worse than and digitally penetrator meaning with his finger

[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:11.740]
I thought it meant with his digit which the lawsuit also alleges that Cosby called the woman in her mother released four times after the

[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:16.060]
Legends and apologized after the woman money. I wonder if he offered in Canadian or US currency

[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.480]
Meaning it actually says there right on that page me

[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.280]
Nobody Q a M hello

[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.160]
My dear friends coming down to Miami. I was criminal to letting go scream Corleco

[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.120]

[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.180]
Wtf. You I am hello. Hey, yeah, sir. Hey, how are you? Hey, listen?

[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:55.600]
You know I heard jab on the phone the other day with I think it was buddy and he was talking about the moral issue of

[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.900]
Wait a minute. What do you put him on the air? Yeah, he was on the end and not only that he's calling him

[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.580]
Yeah, yes

[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.460]
Not like he knows oh my

[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:11.880]
Anyway, what a jackass that 40 years man. Yes, yes, and and the fact is that he's even better than him down

[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:17.780]
He's talking about how the family is going to suffer because the guys are out there addictive the gambling and stuff

[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.480]
And he's gonna all they're gonna want to spend all their money at the gambling and they're not gonna have

[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.420]
Responsibility for their families and this kind of crap. I just can't believe it

[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.200]
Well, let's just where we are here. I guess I don't have a lot of him

[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.160]
And thank God that people aren't spending their lunch. No, I'm a bogus lot. Oh, it's a dumbest bet in history mankind

[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.380]
Not that I don't love you, but you can't in there. Okay. I will

[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.540]
I see I will I come back here

[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.920]
We know and then I touched my foot down on soil just to keep it legal

[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:48.240]
You know for a few days here and there you know you can stay here 180 consecutive days without coming back without leaving

[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.120]
I'm right now that time right. Yeah, it's true. I come home more often than that but briefly

[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.720]
But that's all you have to do I and just oh, it's just such a pleasure to be away from that

[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.540]
Whole festering thing and I hate did you hear they hate and that with that bitch's voice

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.260]
I'm not talking about all the Cuban people on it just you're kind

[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.840]
That's what I'm talking about and I point out that 48% of the county voted yes in addition to which as far as his

[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:18.700]
Spanish was the number 100 spanics and was 56 to 42 so 42% of his panics which includes more than just Cubans

[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.960]
But nevertheless they voted yes, you see how you generalize. Yeah, yeah

[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.500]
Just you are kind honey just miserable hateful

[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.380]
Sours like you that are always giving us this song to oh, we made it what it is today

[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.560]
Yeah, and you know something I wouldn't brag about that. Yeah, stop helping us lady

[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.140]
I wouldn't be running around telling people like that talk about creating an ugly stereotype

[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.620]
I believe the blifelike they do it. I think it's hysterical at husbands under what a nasty hateful bitch

[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.540]
He's just a punishment. He's probably got her hands tied behind her back and a radio cranked up nice and loud nice

[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.600]
Lawn Pally I still came to all he does

[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.880]
Somebody Q a.m. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I hate to change the subject

But you're just all here with all these folks from I was more of mine unfortunately, but I'm trying to get out

[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:05.020]
You know, can you tell us please a few years ago? You haven't done a few years about your first date of Michigan State

[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.800]
No, yeah, yeah, I hear what I can get lost

[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.460]

Yeah, my first day at Michigan State about the grasser and getting dry boring. Okay, it's all stuff

It's 29 years later. Okay, baby. We're moving forward not backward put it in the book

[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.180]
We don't have people calling into program the show to tell me what I'd be talking about plus

[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:30.180]

[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:05.020]
Because Jeb Bush he doesn't believe anything that he's not paid well for and I wonder you know

[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:10.740]
I saw was 5,000 votes ahead there with half the precincts counting all of a sudden when I really started you know getting nippin

[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.460]
Tuck all of a sudden it turned to south there in the last couple hours just like the metro rail vote like every other vote in

Dave County I thought I'm suggesting anything you understand but well just another good reason never to go to Dave County

[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:26.620]
Amen later. See you don't forget Dave County is spelled with four letters D.E.A.D

[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.820]
Has been for a long time they're an adornio and now that that whole fully south beach thing which was you know

Just a plastic a temporary band-aid now that that thing is gone south big time if they call it south beach for more reasons than one now

[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.840]
If you catch my drift are you drifting? So what do you know?

[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.700]
What's the story now in Dave County? What's the call? That's right? I forgot it's that stadium that nobody wants to spend any

[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.980]
Tax money on right down there by the orangeville which nobody wants to go there right?

[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.440]
Mm-hmm. Oh, they'll all just start going to the games though once it's built. Oh, I know question about that

[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:44.580]
The only thing between you and your destination is whenever nature has planned for you that day

[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.180]
unpredictable

[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.020]
Proud taking

[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:49.760]
life threatening

[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.740]
Cuban rafting on big gladdigit

[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.260]
Will you away to something better?

[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.200]
real faster

[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:01.460]
No faster. Here come the sharks get a room much faster command

[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.700]
Road damage

[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.500]
Pain for brother you were sleeping

[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.240]
Let's get that on a channel seven news at noon

[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:15.680]
1119 at 560 WDQ and I love to see that I might even come down for a moment or two or maybe just to get a satellite dish

[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.580]
Okay, okay here's the on our pool which I guess it's pretty obvious who the winner's gonna be in spite of his right wing leanings now

[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.840]
What tall coast neither's worked with other than QAM did you like the best did it is in past tense?

[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.060]
Phil Henry 153 are you sure that's past tense Phil?

[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.760]
Sense Coleman 77 never listen to me over for QM 56 11 and a half percent man

[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.360]
We have in seven years built can you keep his smell of?

[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:44.620]
Right you know it's 53 none of the above 34 micronary 33 Rick Riley 19 Bill called her 17 the burn is up to seven

[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:49.500]
Stant majors got six. How do you like that? Oh my god exactly?

[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:56.580]
Doug Thompson writes and I see him even there's a lot of rain on that radar. I keep checking it every of break because I want out of here at 1250

[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.380]
There's nothing worse than them giving you the false sense of honey

[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.800]
You've got a short show to run that old again. It's been rained out your on till two. Well screw that you know your mama Cita

[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.700]
Now how will that right right?

[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:13.000]
Doug Thompson writes at the rant from Capitol Hill blue. That's two days in a room reading his piece a rather shorted tail

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.060]
Because then rather's last newscast on CBS tonight 630 all you old exilios man can mature in come on

[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.880]
He's not coming in sure like old rotten

[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.560]
Gwakamoli at the screen. It looked like Linda Blair's been in the house

[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.900]
Dan rather brings his body career as a CBS news anchor man to a close tonight and rabbit right wing blowards

[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.860]
Our dancing on his grade before it's even Doug

[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:39.260]
conservative bloggers and bulletin boards were keyboard towers hide behind phony names like an American patriot or a real American

[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.300]
Planned credit for bringing rather down and forcing his retirement is anchorey year early

[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.460]
These wing nuts didn't end rather's career as a newsreader

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:52.480]
Dan rather brought himself down by rushing a story to air without checking it out his zeal and these stupidity of those who work for him gave

[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.940]
CBS a black eye that will remain long after we disappear from the evening news

[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:02.700]
Ironically the facts of the story that blew up in rather's face have never been disproved strong evidence still suggest a young George W

[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:07.600]
Boge got preferential treatment again in the Texas Air National Guard and avoid combat service in Vietnam

[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.140]
But a specific set of documents used to support the story turned out to be forgeries other documents may have existed

[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:19.460]
And others in the Texas guards say some of Bush's records were destroyed or altered all this brings unbounded joy to the right wing

[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:24.220]
That is long-term rather CBS and most other mainstream media are just shows for the loony left

[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:29.620]
I don't know what rather's political leanings are nor do I care it was his style of reading the news that sour vianniz abilities

[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.780]
Is an anchor man many years ago and I stopped watching his newscast

[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.320]
But I have to laugh whenever these conservative crybaby started whining about the bias of the media

[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.860]
Most of these clowns wouldn't know good journalism ever walked up and bit them in the balls

[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:45.540]
Assuming you could find their balls because conservatives are too often cowards and probably don't have any

[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.120]
Testicular protrusions to chop down upon ask the right wing nut where they get their news

[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:56.520]
They point first to Fox News channel a pseudo journalism operation run by former Richard Nixon propaganda flag Roger Ails and

[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.460]
tabloid sleaze king Rupert Murdock

[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:03.040]
Fox's star if anyone married in their muck and be called a star is Bill O'Reilly a

[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.800]
Phone sex freak who had a settle out accord a sexual harassment charge brought by a co-worker rather gets burned by a source and loses his job

[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.700]
O'Reilly calls up co-workers talks dirty to them pays hush money and stays on the air interesting double standard of justice

[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:22.240]
Another source of information for conservative hypocrites is rush Limbaugh the pill popping prepare of right wing hysteria

[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.280]
Limbaugh long freaks that anyone who legally abusing abuses drugs should face punishment to the fullest end of the law

[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.020]
But conventionally exempted himself from such treatment. We got caught loading up on black market pain pills

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:38.580]
The list of favored right wing journalists goes on and on from Mike Savage a hate spotting homophobe to Robert Novak the White House

[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:44.140]
Shill who outed a covert CIA operator because her ambassador husband is publicly criticized George W. Bush

[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:50.020]
These and others like them bring disgrace to the journalism profession because they've painted the right wing rather than seek the truth

[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:55.980]
Their success comes from knowing the right wing audience that is that follows them as vial art composed uneducated ignorant

[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:02.560]
gullible louts who would rather hate to understand the world around them fast news brags about its high ratings and huge audience numbers proof

[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.660]
They say of their quality. They've got high ratings all right among cable TV networks a small segmented part of the overall TV viewing audience

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:14.540]
In the real world of TV ratings those numbers fall far behind other quality programming like survivor the apprentice to Simpsons

[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:20.560]
Yes, even the CBS TV news yeah, the numbers tell the story and it's a far different one when told without the tin your right wing

[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.940]
propaganda is pretty good old dog Thompson

[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.420]
You go, yeah, you go boy

[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.900]
Do we get any update on the ball game? I mean I hit that stupid questions, you know, but

[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.080]
They're in Jupiter. Why would have said anything to us?

[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.640]
Well, why not because we're on the air and it affects us. Oh, I see well

[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.900]
That makes a lot of sense to me. Let's get another couple hundred calls before 1250 in that pregame show for the Marling game

[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.660]
Which may or may not get played today and we're everybody and everybody in town is hanging on the edge of the receipt

[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.660]
Because we love the Marlins we want that city and my body or where nobody wants to go

[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:57.520]
560 560 560 and the Verizon Singular Riders line W.A.M. Hello

[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.180]
W.A.M. Hello

[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:07.500]
Yes, yes, sir. How are you guys doing? We're doing good today's the greatest day

[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:13.180]
I have no longer I don't have to drive any longer down to Miami every single word day

[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.280]
I moved to Florida. I got a nice little cushy job

[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.340]
Right and all I have to do right now is just

[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.900]
Relax and enjoy it and laugh at all the stupid kids say goodbye to Dave baby. That's a slogan just say bye-bye to Dave

[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.460]
560 560

[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.260]
560 on a Verizon and Singular wireless line who would have thought that everything was looking so rosy and

[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.740]
Who would have thought it who would have thought you did brawai? It's been a wait for a long time

[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.600]
I mean always there's problems. They didn't know perfect

[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.740]
But but we're starting to fight out but now we can have all this crime say oh that's right

[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:53.240]
I forgot about that all this violent crime and people are gonna be raped on the sidewalks in shot in your

[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.680]
Bed's and all these horrible things because there's those evil one-armed bandits now

[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.420]
Of course the fact that we got slot machines over there to Seminole's at the Hard Rock Cafe

[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.060]
And there's no crime that we're hearing about associated with that that must just be an aberration

[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.340]
Because you know then engines they got those boson arrows. They don't put up with any a violent crime

[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.180]
Yeah, W.A.M. Hello

[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:19.200]

Yes, I would like that some sloths in Miami-Dade preferable with a you in the middle. Yeah, I bet WQ.A.M. Hello

[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.480]
WQ. I am hello, hey Neil

[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.560]
If the Broward voters are the only ones that want to approve this

[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.340]
The slot machine why the hell we share the money with the rest of the state because

[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:48.080]
It's like a hold-up man is it's like blackmail. That's the only way you get anything done in Florida. I always have to share the goods

[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.240]
All right, well happy anniversary and keep up with the work. Thank you, pal

[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.780]
Yeah, do you think there was any chance in November that something would have passed at all stay wide any chance at all if the

[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:03.680]
If the benefits weren't gonna be spread around all 67 counties and even then the rest of the state vote against a pretty heavy

[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:10.760]
Right and only because they'd been brought voted for it overwhelmingly that they get passed and of course when they'd been brought to get to vote individually yesterday

[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.120]
Everybody in Dave County sits home on her ass. That is just

[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.320]
Yeah, I mean not that affects my life even when I'm there am I gonna go like

[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:26.300]
To prepare mutual in Dave County go to a stock course not but it's just so depressing and so deflating

[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.660]
It's in finally after all these years like I said yesterday

[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:33.920]
Have a chance to control your own destiny and not be held up by all these mugwomps all these redness outstate

[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.640]
And what do you get you get the redness in state in Dave County?

[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.320]
You get the bush liquors

[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.580]
27 past 11 in the banana republic

[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.000]
Neal Rogers

[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.560]
Only in Miami

[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.300]
One McGilgen zone

[01:06:53.300 --> 01:07:00.220]
Father of William meets with his attorney in preparation to take his son back to Cuba

[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.420]
Well, Mr. Gonzalez. How was your trip?

[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.360]
Any good guys?

[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.660]

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.440]
Pardon me

[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.040]
Well, it means what's up like what's going on?

[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.160]
Right, it's a greeting

[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:37.740]
Now I know that you're uncomfortable being here. This is a very difficult time for you

[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:45.620]
What is it? Oh this pizza stop cost pizza is incredible

[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.660]
How do they get the mozzarella cheese into the crust?

[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.120]
Not sure so as I was saying

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:08:01.080]
Yeah, as I was saying we will try to make your stay here as comfortable as possible and get your home as quickly as possible

[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:08.460]
My my my are you going somewhere? No, I'm listening to the new CD by the boy band in sync with my new sonny

[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.220]
Discman he's incredible

[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.580]
Yes, Mr. Gonzalez. They are quite incredible

[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.800]
We'll be meeting with the just another play any day for two you must take me

[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:22.700]
But

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:28.800]
Oh, God, sir. Don't you want to get this over and get back to Cuba? Why do you look all I love it here?

[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.340]
There's like 300 channels on table and I can watch all the yam see games, but

[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.800]
Mr. Million, but is it Mr. Gonzalez?

[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:44.860]
It's a lot of 32 QAM. I'm taking a look at the radar again. Let's take a look real close in person. Okay. Let's take a puke at it

[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.300]
And oh man, we're gonna a big green thing man

[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.200]
It looks like rain, but it's not

[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.700]
Yeah, no, it is big blob. Here's a big green blob in a small and behind it and they're moving like to the northeast

[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.840]
They're like moving over toward the Okachobi

[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.420]
Now, let's see on a strana on a plane

[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:06.000]
Now why Jupiter because I've been in Jupiter. It's not that far north of West Palm, right? Correct

[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.500]
I think it'll be okay. I think they might you know, okay, huh? Yeah, let's play some ball

[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:16.600]
What do you say? Let's play some baseball. Let's play two today starting at 1145. Sounds good to me

[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:18.660]
5670560

[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:22.740]
Palm 560, you know, it's really amazing like I said a few weeks ago how come

[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.380]
Bush hasn't invaded the Cuban government of Castor already

[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:30.200]
Then we could see these old exilios if they're really gonna put their money where their aguaia bearers are and go back when

[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.040]
Hella came from and take over the homeland again good. We'll pack this alami sandwich, okay?

[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:38.240]
With Swiss cheese. It's trath. Let's start a rumor. They discovered oil there

[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.480]
Yeah, they discovered oil and Cuban and Bush is going in this weekend

[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:47.360]
Eureka and everybody go back and then you know the first thing that we'd want to do is rebuild those great casinos from back in the 50s

[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.580]
Sam straight right

[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.720]
The hotel they are the best

[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.640]
I mean if we didn't have the hard rock you see all these other hysterical arguments

[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.560]
I could I could maybe even understand it some people would say oh wow, you know

[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.180]
This is something new and we don't know what's gonna happen

[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.240]
You know, even though it's only up to per mutuals

[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.380]
Uh, orch or some of the safest places you could ever go but uh

[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:16.200]
But you've already got that thing sitting there. It's packed. It's it's jam packed morning noon and nights 24 7 28 6

[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.680]
What that was at?

[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.720]
What was that sounded like a corona?

[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.960]
Where did that come from not these studios

[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.840]
Yeah, so some jackass is in the control room in there again

[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.960]
Do it yeah like that in the middle of my show. I bet you it's the rock solid the big yeah

[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.060]
And by the way, where did he come down on this

[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:40.980]
Where did the rest of the people on this station beside you were truly in a Humper come down on this

[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.580]

[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:44.560]
Huh

[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.660]
That's a good question. How come they weren't running around there with sandwich boards up and down everywhere in Dave County getting people to go out and vote

[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:56.840]
They're having their they're having a little meeting in the uh in the on air studio and I guess it leaped out

[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.640]

[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.880]
Yeah, that was him. That was Gary Sarner

[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:08.300]
He was groaning he thought I was gonna like uncoach your his house or something. Yeah, that's what that's what it was

[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:09.540]
Wow

Villain Hollywood says oh no I already saw this I know I just want to keep asking me this for free thing stuff

I left 10 minutes from the stadium in Jupiter. It's been raining since 6.30 this morning. So enjoy your early lunch

[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.740]
What is everything is it running hard is it is it raining hard?

[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:44.400]
It's been raining since 6.30 this morning steady. It's not gonna play ball. Maybe water polo

[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.740]
Get out of here. Are you fine? I'm serious for the freaking hot attack. Oh

[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.440]
Enjoy your early. I really loved it 205

[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.260]
Got 105

[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.400]
Every time

[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.820]
Yeah, yeah, get out of here now. What else are you talking about?

[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.360]
It's been raining and they're not gonna play them. What is he talking about my room?

[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.260]
I don't see any idea

[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.200]
How is it possible so many estupidoes man?

[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:12.040]
Grab I think you own apology to those old exilios the ones with a green teeth and the aglabarus and it was

[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.340]
All the stains under fingers from those big nasty cigars

[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:20.840]
By the way, if it ugly I've spoken cigars a long time ago. I just mentioned that in passing. Okay. They're probably lived to 100

[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.980]
WQ a.m. Hello

[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.760]
Good morning. Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm a cubit American. I came

[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.100]
1961 that was a long time ago

[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.320]
Age of five

[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.180]
Really make me cringe when I hear some of

[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.600]
folks that come up and say that we made this town

[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.540]
Yeah, we've heard that a million times. I don't have any we made it what it is today every every time

[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:50.820]
Some of the just a segment of the community is something obnoxious the response the angry response always is

[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.880]
This town was nothing when we came here. We may know what it is today

[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.580]
Absolutely I cringe I cringe I this town

[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.880]
We believe we contributed to

[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.400]
to

[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.820]
Building this town and I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing

[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.100]
But it's like anything else. It's a mixed bag. It is a mixed bag

[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:14.720]
It is a mixed bag, but I'm really really disappointed not not disappointed but the fact that a lot of our

[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.460]
First-generation cubins are our letter missled the slaughter they follow the

[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.380]
the

[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:27.720]
Radio waves and whoever is um, I mean especially it's usually the republican

[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.140]
Right wing that that drives them

[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.440]
But I also I've been here long enough to realize that also in the African-American community

[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.020]
The reverend in the pastors also leader miss the the community

[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:47.860]
Yeah, but they didn't do a very good job this time because in date county 56% in fact they had the highest the plus vote white

[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:54.480]
People voted 55% yes and black 56% yes and the Hispanic 56% no

[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.320]
So over there may even maybe some of those Bible thumping preachers that you're talking about I know the crowd

[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.960]
You mean yeah, maybe they got a few people to go both but the dark community

[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.680]
And but the bottom line is nobody showed up. That's the worst problem is that no one in any community nobody showed up to vote

[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.160]
That's the biggest problem

[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.020]
Where was Amy Schaefer when we needed her?

[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:16.700]
So

[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.420]
Have a great day pal

[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.760]
That's before your time Amy Schaefer. I was human speaker really well

[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.680]
She's dead I believe I know Tom Schaefer is probably time every

[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.700]
Oh geez poor Tommy's a good guy just had a little bit of a booze problem, but he's dead we can talk about him now

[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:38.220]
Can we talk about people after they're dead? Yes, we can sure here's a fact from Keith who says

[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.040]
I'm very disappointed that Dan Radheval and so am I by the way Keith

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.720]
I wouldn't watch Bob Schaefer if he paid me by the second

[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:49.440]
That Dan will no longer be anchoring the CBS evening news rather unlike many other news readers actually writes much of the copy

[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.180]
He reads actually attempts to go out and cover stories as the managing editor I like the CBS team reporters

[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.660]
Can't they do better than Bob Schaefer or Katie stinkin?

[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.740]
I'm so sick and tired of the critics who talk about the low rated CBS evening news

[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.480]
These so-called critics don't realize that that good ratings you must have a decent lead in

[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.760]
Having the lowest rated local news cast as lead in zin New York Boston, Miami and LA is the reason for the low ratings

[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.840]
Rather survived because the suits at CBS understood this

[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.080]
CBS is a smaller percentage of its stations carrying the ratings juggernaut Oprah Winfrey which also was her hurt their ratings

[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.320]
Maybe Oprah should be rather's replacement

[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.780]
Oh man, there's another one when I see her on my TV. I get physically ill

[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:31.820]
Her and her protege Dr. Phil makes me ill. I got to take a pill

[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:38.060]
By the way speaking of the nightly news it's become now. I don't know about I'm sure it must be the same NBC and ABC

[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:44.500]
On the CBS even news nine out of every ten spots maybe 99 out of 100 are for prescription drugs

[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.260]
You know, it's oh yeah, then that's all you ever try's anymore. That is prescription drugs

[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.620]
Ask your doctor about

[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.360]
Viox

[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.920]
Ask your doctor if you can die from celibrex after the zochore

[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.040]
Now all of these things and let me just say it again. I'm not like trying to tau Canada because believe me

[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.100]
I'd like you folks all stay where you are. Okay. We got enough Americans here already

[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:07.360]
But it's illegal to advertise prescription drugs on television or radio here. It's illegal

[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:15.540]
Yeah, because the profit motive is the idea here of drugs is like to help people get well as opposed to just making money

[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.620]
As opposed to only the profit motive. I don't even understand those words. I know. That's kind of strange

[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:25.320]
It will obviously like legalizing marijuana and gay marriages and things like that

[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.720]
That's crazy. He can't kill noon at five sixty wqm your subversive station for the new millennium baby

[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.760]
All you old exilios man

[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.160]
I'm gonna tell you there's gonna be a little knock on the door three in the morning

[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.220]
It's gonna be Joe Carrio and he's gonna be a tempest in a teapot

[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:38.760]
or yeah

[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.060]
Yeah, or maybe it'll be a savory or swarrow is in his bathrobe

[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.920]
Hey, you know even after all this time some people still think it's a little unusual to buy bed over the phone

[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.580]
When you call one 800 mattress the number for dollar mattress

[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.920]
You'll find out that they have the most liberal. Oh, that's a bad word. I'm sorry

[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.280]
The most liberal exchange policy so there's no risk

[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.420]
You see in this case. It's a good word all the way around

[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:01.460]
Did you know that one 800 mattress has more repeat customers than anybody else in the industry?

[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.820]
So once you try dollar mattress I guarantee you I'll beg Greg's life on it

[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:08.160]

[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.320]

From the producers of iron shaft it's iron bus boy

[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.680]
Hashimoto who's been busing tables at Tokyo's Hokkaido restaurant for seven years today

[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.060]
He takes on Joe smooth of the sip and bite diner in Cleveland

[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.920]
Who will be the first to clear a dirty table and claim the title of iron bus boy?

[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.180]
I am ready. I'm not a stop. Yeah, bring it on. Let the battle begin

[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:24.780]
And Hashimoto takes it early leave as he risks the plates into his bus stop in one fluid motion

Yeah, I'm not gonna let my mother Joe smooth is yet to clear a single plate is the pressure getting to him wait

[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:37.800]
He's grabbed the tablecloth and yes, it looks like he's going to yank it right off the table dishes and oh

[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.560]
I win

[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.400]
I cannot bear the stain of my bus boy

[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.280]
I must commit ritual suicide with the sturdy

[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:56.400]
Whoa, I'm not cleaning him up. I'm on break iron bus boy only on the Kung-Food network

[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:02.500]
13 to 11 at 560 that's a George bit because quite frankly it leaves me a little bit on the limpside

[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.120]
I understand

[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:11.780]
The Harold article says in the last minute anti-slot campaign led by governor jab bush was cited as the difference in date

[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:15.200]
Which I was trying to tell a Humper this morning which he was blaming the Harold for it

[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.060]
I mean the hero was most ciferous and foaming at the mouth for 10 consecutive days doing everything in their power

[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:26.760]
But nevertheless the hero has no cloud man, but let me just say this to you in November during the general the presidential election

[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:31.640]
Where were the numbers on here? Let me just say it to you if I can find it and if not I won't say it to you

[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.540]
Where is it? It passed overwhelmingly in November well, well, maybe it didn't come out of here

[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:48.040]
But how do I how can I not be in oh here it is in Broward in November nearly 68% supported in date 57% got those number 68 and 57

[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:55.500]
In Broward this time 57% supported in date County only 48% so both were down about nine see that

[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.440]
That's it and the reason for it being is that a lot of people said on their ass now

[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.480]
Thankfully in Broward County didn't make them much difference because it one would plan to despair although it's still

[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.300]
57 or 43 should have been more like 77 or 23 in Broward

[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:12.880]
But in date County 57% back in November and now only 48% losing nine percent

[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.160]
So we consider and blame the toothless old exiliers

[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.700]
Which certainly they they're the ones who went out there clearly and helped bring this thing down

[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:24.580]
But the fact of the matter is very clearly again the people who are behind the pros slots that are really

[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:31.920]
P poor we can't say what P stands for a one will be a word a urine for a job there you go of

[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:39.180]
Getting the people out in Dave County. They're in my trouble. Huh? You're in trouble for what you're in you're in trouble. You're your anus

[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.700]
Just the other probably am in trouble because you always don't like that you're in man

[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.520]
Now what about that dentist in that story ahead before I don't want to get back in with that was

[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.740]
Did you show that to jy? Oh, I was sure what I missed no, don't you know?

[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.960]
You're you're you're you eating today. I'll dig it up. I know yeah eventually

[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.240]
I believe me if you want to go on a diet. No, don't show that story

[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.940]
It's even for his tender eyes. It's grotesque even for a proverb like him. It's just discussing

[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:08.780]
We can't just bring it up and not let me see it. Yeah, bring it closer. Here you go. Okay. Well give it to him

[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:14.440]
You take a look at it read read just the first sentence or two of it. Okay, and then see if you think I should have read that one on a year

[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.300]
You got it. He's got it. No, he's taking it back into the prune taking a puke at it

[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.960]
Please don't make it here already terrified of a dentist

[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:30.540]
Yeah, maybe you'd like to read that one on a year. No, there's more to fear than just the pain. Yeah

[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:36.560]
Anyway, 68% in November and bar 57 and date so like the people said on their ass they stayed home in the

[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:41.840]
The people that supposedly were motivating and mobilizing are they did a horrible horrible job

[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.300]
They did a horrendous job of getting the people to Dave County

[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:50.800]
So it rained and they know that's an excuse if there's a cloud in the skies and excuse by the way is the game on or what?

[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:55.800]
How the hell do we know? Well break up that stupid ass promotion meeting in their boys over find out

[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.400]
Huh meetings over well, they find then they got no excuse

[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.760]
We got parents running around there and the muffmeister. She's you know

[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.040]
Rub it up against the walls in a hole like a cat and heat come on

[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.980]
Let's find out what the story is here whether we got a game today or not whether it is a chance whether we got a shot

[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.200]
At least at least give us a little bit of hope right right

[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:20.340]
God here's a fact that says governor jabbed in the people of Dave County a great service

[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:27.120]
That sucking sound he kept describing is gonna be the money of Dave County residents going to Broward Marco Rubio did his people a great service as well

[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.580]
Flagler dog track, which is in his district would have employed at least 1800 of his residents

[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:35.940]
I can't believe we elect these jackasses when all they do is gross repeatedly said Jackie from kennel

[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:40.080]
Well guess what Jackie from kennel because every time it's one of those elections a local election

[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.300]
It's the same group of

[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:45.160]
Exilios who go out and vote and everybody else does the same thing they did yesterday in Dave County

[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.020]
They sit back and say oh how come we can't get any of our people like to because nobody shows up to vote

[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.220]
And it's not a it's not rocket science the same thing

[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.300]
Now why do you keep sending me the facts from this guy?

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.920]
Don't read the first paragraph read this cycle the election is not

[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.480]
No sample ballot once again notifying the public of election the only thing I receive from the government

[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.320]
Well in other words like nobody knew there was an election yesterday get out of here

[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.340]
The only thing I receive from government was a paid with taxpayer dollars political propaganda at from the city of Hollywood

[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:18.120]
That's Meragolante tell me to vote no what country is this it's a banana republic, baby in Hollywood of course

[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.820]
That's an old banana republic if you got an old banana

[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.860]
So the second election in the world that the city of Hollywood's been made your amounts of taxpayer dollars to the same one

[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.900]
But what what's the point of belly aching about that would have passed in Broward?

[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:37.660]
Right oh, I'm getting a headache from these faxes from this guy stop sending them to me right now or Maddie Bell is gonna be sitting in your life in a half an hour

[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.820]
56705 60 just kind of played that for a moment or two. Were you?

[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.000]
Count five naked naked

[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.060]
Count five 60 on the Verizon and singular wireless lines

[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.640]
WCWAM hello

[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.400]
KWAM yes sir

[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.780]
How about this I mean yesterday and Coral Springs that was the only thing that was on the ballot

[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:01.700]
I mean I drug my I drug my push out of my feet and I went and voted yes on it. Okay. Well good for you

[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.900]
That was true that was true in date County too. I'm like Broward

[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.660]
They counted to have all these other dog care collections and stuff

[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.820]
Well, here's the beautiful part of it waiting to these people

[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.020]
W the first one to belly aching when the state says guess what guys we have to have a state income pack

[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.780]
Disappoint all the stuff that we got going on the state

[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:22.580]
They'll be the first ones off their touch and revoting against it

[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:26.760]
Okay, I guarantee you some of these old toads that voted yesterday both in date and in

[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:31.440]
They're gonna be some of the first one schlepping to the casinos to play the nickel and quarter slots. I can

[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.560]
Bet you any amount on that and I was out it. I was out at the car

[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.820]
The uh yesterday and that's all there was was blue hairs there. I mean I they're coming from somewhere to play yeah

[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:45.480]
You know all right. Well got help us all Neil mom. Can you see all the crime out there pal?

[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:51.420]
You're okay. That's what I don't understand. Where's the crime coming from? We got it already and ain't gonna get worse ever great day

[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.940]
It's gonna be crying the sky's gonna

[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.860]
Oh the world's gonna come to an end. It will be a friendly

[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:04.120]
Tourist yeah, like we got something for the tourist we got sure it's for the tourists all right like I said yesterday

[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.780]
Was another chance to stick it to Orlando?

[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.860]
A lot of people would like to stick it to Orlando, but we haven't seen him in a long time but nevertheless

[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.880]
But no big county does they don't want that they don't want the jobs no yabs. They don't want the tourism

[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:21.120]
They don't want the visitors. They don't want the action and you know this crap about people you know there is no question

[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:28.420]
I will guarantee you right now, but you George and Greg and Maddie Bell's life on a right now that there will be some people who will lose their ass

[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:34.100]
In the slot in the casinos, but you know something there are people lose their ass at the track

[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.140]
There are people who they're ass and the lottery betting a plunging every week on the boat

[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:45.540]
There are people there are people who can't control their drinking there people who can't control their gambling and you know what two frickin bad people can't control

[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:49.980]
They're eating right that is correct that is right in fact some people can't control their eating at the track

[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:54.220]
While they're gambling and drinking how do you like that? Don't worry about it. I'm sure you're right

[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.700]
So I don't want to hear anybody moaning and grunting

[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:00.840]
Oh jeez somebody lost their pension. They lost it. Well two freaking bad. Okay, right

[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.240]
I've told you all along being one who goes very often take whatever money you're willing to lose and that's it

[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.980]
And if you lose it, hey, that's it like when you go to Vegas. I hear all these stories from people. Oh, I went to Vegas

[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.120]
There won five thousand. I want to okay great. I'm real happy for you

[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.980]
I've been to Vegas. Oh, I don't know maybe 50 times in my life. Okay. Okay

[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.740]
If I won in Vegas twice

[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:26.100]
That's a lot. I mean there there you know times I want individual jackpot so over 1200 here 15

[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.540]
But I'm talking about overall, you know at the end of the trip if I won twice out of 50 time

[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:37.120]
That's a lot. Can it bother me? Oh, did I expect to win? No, I had a great time right

[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.700]
I've been to wood blind probably 50 or 60 times. I would say I want maybe oh 20 times

[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:47.240]
So you do the math figure out the rest. Okay. Does anybody force me to go there? No. Is it gonna change my life?

[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.800]
No, do I take money there? I can't afford to lose no this is the amount of money. I win there change my life. No

[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.540]
I have a great time. I love it

[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:57.840]
So I'm just telling you that right up front because I don't want somebody coming back to me later on and give me a song

[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.240]
And like Wayne said and tell me that you know, we wouldn't play in the arena if you build it and whatever you said in that bit

[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.700]
Oh, you told us that nobody was good. No, I didn't play that

[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:10.600]
But using that as an excuse that's like bringing back Coral vision closing up all the bars because you got a few alcoholers

[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.780]
Who can't control their drink and because they're gonna be a few idiots who can't control their gambling?

[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:19.940]
Too bad, okay, and part of the money by the way is already gonna be earmarked toward that helping those people with gambling addicts

[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.320]
But I just I just don't sympathize with people with addictive personalities if you got a problem

[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.540]
Get yourself some help. Don't keep showing up all the time and crying on people's shoulders

[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.260]
I told you to one guy that shows up in wood blind just about every day

[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:30.760]
Mr

[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.400]
I lost my pension. I call him out and know what his name is. That's mr

[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.380]
I lost my pen. Well, you know, he's like you know, he's like Eric huh? He can apply to my question to him

[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:41.840]
Why are you here? Why are you here? Oh?

[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.640]
You know and for a while or he wasn't playing he just go around giving everybody else a license the vicarious thrill

[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.740]
Yeah, that's right. Just hanging around he likes to like to soak up the atmosphere and going around giving everybody else advice

[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.000]
Here's a guy to lost his ass lost his pension. He's giving other people advice

[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.260]
And then one day about a month ago I go in there and he's playing I said oh, what's going on with you all?

[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.180]
I'm just a back I'm back losing his ass and though I said why are you doing this?

[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.400]
What's gonna be any different for you now than it was before if you're bringing money here?

[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.900]
You can't afford to oh, I just want to get a couple thousand back

[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.320]
Said are you getting it back? No, I'm losing my ass

[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:19.140]
Do I have sympathy for him? No, in fact, I get sick of my stomach when I see him and there a few others like that well too bad

[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:23.420]
You go in any bar. You're gonna see a few drugs. You know slavering around so it goes

[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.900]
But for this we have to hold back progress

[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:32.180]
We have to hold back a place where people go have a great time and race and revenue and have a bunch of jobs because something bad might happen to somebody

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:34.540]
Maybe we can have the bad police, you know like

[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:39.840]
Since we got big brother government now anyone just making sure that you don't do anything that might be bad for you

Don't see you can call me tell me whenever I'm in town. I listen to wait a minute. I am in town

It's the 12th of one hour

[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.520]
I'm standing on the big oh

[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:18.900]
That stands for orgasm. Oh, that's just short for Orlando blue. You don't look silly. No

[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:27.320]
Now he's gonna ripy for four hours. I've been asked to keep this in strict confidence

[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.720]
But in case you wonder why we're here

[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.580]
Joe got suspended

[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:39.660]
Now maybe we should take this call from our special guest Roberto L'Awango

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.520]
Hi, you're a boy though. You know that I'm the voices of dancers now

[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.120]
Yes, aren't you that squeaky-boy guy that goes by all the time?

[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:47.720]
Oh

[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.880]
You got me confused with a character on another show

[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:55.140]
That's not me. I have children. You know

[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:21.400]
Goy-土 With you have a pretty thing

[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:21.400]

[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.100]
Well, here it is. Here is the epitome of what Q&W is all about on a piece of paper right here.

[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.020]
This is what this radio station is all about. Just on the day when I finally said,

[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.200]
I don't give a crap anymore and I thought I couldn't give a crap less.

[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.620]
This fact from PR Ralph. Now do we have any verification of this?

[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.560]
No. Well, I bet that's what I'm saying. He says, I did you a favor

[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.660]
contact with the stadium in Jupiter and the game is not being played today.

[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.360]
Hate to be the breaker of bad news but still love you PR Ralph.

[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.480]
Now he's a regular factor whom I don't think would make up something like this.

[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.840]
Correct. A friend of the show indeed.

[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.780]
A friend of the family? Yes he is.

[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.900]
So don't you find it just a little bit irritating and irresponsible and

[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:02.700]
absolutely grotesque and unacceptable? Absolutely unacceptable that your program director,

[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.380]
your operations mangler, your whoever else is hanging around in there.

[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.780]
Those two in particular haven't come in yet and said, oh by the way the game is

[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:12.420]
rained out and we're going to be on you're going to be on dual two or something like

[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.740]
of that nature. Well my impression hasn't changed

[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.960]
but since the day I walked in here.

[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:22.820]
I mean you're talking I mean these are people in desperate search of assignments

[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:26.280]
to try to justify their existence on a planet much less in a building.

[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:31.380]
And yet something as simple as that or as decent as coming in in the middle of the show and saying,

[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.480]
oh by the way the game is rained out and therefore yoddy whatever and you'll be on

[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.300]
till two and maybe we have to call in the moe.

[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.160]
We're the moe show etc but we got nothing for management only from outside.

[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:50.180]
I'll tell you one thing if we didn't have the fax machine in a phone we'd we'd totally be

[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:53.100]
clueless right be like being in a studio no windows.

[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.820]
The only contact we got with the outside world is that TV setup there and the only reason we got

[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:00.140]
the TV set is because Jeff Cohen brought us the first one and they had to replace it

[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.480]
because they were too embarrassed not to replace it. Oh I got my work.

[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.900]
Have a ride to go and TV right here thank God on MSNBC right I'm off CNN.

[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.300]
I am done somebody's got to watch MSNBC might as well be me.

[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.700]
So we don't know whether we're going to be here to roll 1250 till two till a week from Shavuas

[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.240]
till Gary Sarner troughs up the house we have no idea what's going on.

[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.680]
By the way you got a nice bright smile on your face today Gary.

[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.360]
Come into QAM hello.

[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.480]
Yes Neil.

[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.780]
Yes sir what do you think is the ball game monor off today?

[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.640]
Uh well if the weather is anything up there is it is down here it is in broader county

[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.460]
and you ain't going nowhere.

[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.220]
Damn it.

[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:34.720]
Sorry.

[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:35.920]
Yeah need to.

[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:41.860]
Listen to two points number one I really want to thank you for reading that thing you did yesterday

[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.740]
comparing Bush to Hitler by Senator Burr from Virginia.

[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.140]
Right that was brilliant.

[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.040]
One of the few people that actually has a clue.

[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.320]
That has the balls to send.

[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:56.840]
You got that right there's to go up against Bush with the Republican control Senate

[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.800]
it does take two big ones.

[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:03.260]
Yeah and the other thing is I'm a teacher here in rural county I'm on my watch break right now

[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.480]
and the big discussion and the teachers lounge released in the school like that

[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:13.760]
is how the money that it's going to be generated by the gambling that's supposed to go to the

[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.640]
schools is going to have to be split now among the rest of the state the rest of the state.

[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:18.080]

[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.800]
So we're going to get less.

[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.640]
As far as teachers salary get going up and everything it's just not going to happen.

[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.100]
It's going to happen is ain't going to happen anything that's going to mean anything.

[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:29.680]
Right.

[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:35.400]
So nobody's real thrilled about the fact that we're now supporting the rest of the state

[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.460]
and that's really kind of sucks too.

[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.220]
Well that's the only way you get it done you know that you have to be as blackmail that you have

[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.580]
to pay the rest of the state when you're in a mugwomps state that's what you have to do to get

[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.080]
anything done.

[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:52.300]
Yeah I've been here since 1969 and I don't understand how those people up in Tallahhasky do business.

[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.260]
And the worst part of it is that you're going to be subsidizing people in Dade County who voted

[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:58.920]
against this thing that's the most embarrassing part of it.

[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.140]
It is but it's just one more thing about Florida we got to live with.

[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.500]
Hey man well good luck to you pal I'll send you the other telegram.

[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.700]
Yeah have a great one sir.

[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.640]
See you around there thanks.

[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.100]
56070560, proud 560 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.240]
It's a tropical depression baby.

[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.360]
Now I'm sure that's since my outburst moment ago somebody has opened the door up and said

[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.200]
something.

[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:19.400]
I have a bulletin.

[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.180]
Yes the game is not called off yet.

[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:28.040]
Supposedly three down there said the tarps out in the field and it's cloudy so it could happen.

[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.900]
Oh PR Ralph stuck it to us.

[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.780]
Oh see never trusted me can man I'm telling you right now.

[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.100]
I'm not going to tell you that for a long time.

[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.560]
Your friend no it's your friend.

[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.060]
That's your buddy right.

[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:41.180]
That's your bunk bunk buddy PR Ralph I never met the guy.

[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.520]
He's one of your personal buddies comes to your appearances and gives you like a massage.

[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.140]
Right.

[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.900]
He gives you that feel like the dentist was doing.

[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:47.780]
That is why too.

[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:48.880]
Right oh really.

[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.240]
Who PR Ralph's wife or the dentist?

[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.000]
Both.

[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.060]
Now Josh is going to read that story about the dentist on the ear.

[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:55.980]
I don't think we can.

[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.000]
Oh that's what I'm telling you.

[01:36:59.080 --> 01:36:59.320]
We're going to read it.

[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:03.200]
Howard David Chateau attempting to say yeah maybe Moe read it will be his non sports

[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.320]
leading for the day.

[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:04.920]
I'll put it in the air.

[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.500]
How are you David?

[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.040]
It's a show.

[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:09.660]
You just got through tell me that it's cloudy and I'm going to try to play the game and now

[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:10.940]
you tell me just going to be Howard David.

[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.540]
David is a show.

[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.700]
We're heading our bets.

[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:16.620]
Make up your mind.

[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:17.840]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.060]
Hello.

[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:24.000]
You know there's there's you know this thing was dead in the water the minute that you

[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.660]
know governor.

[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.120]
Nice governor.

[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:26.760]
Thank you.

[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:35.460]
Started lying on his on all the media campaign that he did against this where he was saying that

[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.720]
you know the money has to go through all the other 65 counties that that do basically isn't

[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.760]
any long that's just that that's what they got to do with it.

[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.280]
Now despite Howard he's going to do that.

[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.900]
That's what they're going to do that's how they're going to pass it.

[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.660]
They're going to screw Howard.

[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:57.760]
Okay by making by by now passing legislation making that money go to the other 65 counties.

[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.620]
I thought that's the way it was written up in November so that because they haven't even decided

[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.340]
how it should be divvied up yet.

[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:08.640]
These guys now got to go into session and decide all of this crap but I got to tell you

[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.580]
it's amazing how this guy came out and just killed it in day.

[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.420]
I guess what happened in November and date was just an apparition.

[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:21.060]
Okay it's amazing how this him and his co-conspirators at the Miami Herald.

[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:28.020]
Okay because on Sunday Carl Huyison wrote a piece you know totally slamming the whole idea.

[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.060]
Really? Yeah.

[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:30.000]
Carl Huyison?

[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:30.600]
Yes sir.

[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.280]
The one guy in the spec not to sell out of the Herald.

[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:40.200]
And the Herald since this since this made the ballot that Herald has been running peaches

[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.020]
that leave no doubt in your mind that they were against.

[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.380]
I knew the restaurant.

[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.600]
Hey Hank was talking about that.

[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:55.140]
How the Herald had come out and has just you know started writing articles against the slots.

[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.080]
Okay I mean I went and voted yesterday.

[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.840]
My point placed okay I had to wake up the workers.

[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.360]
Okay basically what I wanted.

[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.820]
There was no buddy there.

[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.900]
Okay I had to hey yo I'm here.

[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.320]
You want to try check me in?

[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.020]
Right.

[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.120]
Right exactly.

[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.600]
So in Miami like I didn't see anybody.

[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.980]
A buddy of mine who's at a different polling place.

[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:18.020]
So we live in like the same you know general vicinity and candle but he's got a different

[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:19.120]
polling place than I do.

[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.960]
He went in there to vote for it and he was the only one that was in there also.

[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.760]
It is pathetic okay.

[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.400]
The way he just scared especially the the guanitos.

[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.740]
How they scared the all foggy guanitos and to voting against this.

[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:33.380]

[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.720]
But like you said nobody else showed up to vote for it.

[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.940]
Nobody else did the problem.

[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.620]
And nobody else showed up to vote for it.

[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.460]
It's amazing.

[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.900]
Same old sad story and Brian did.

[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.000]
All air reelection.

[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.720]
I'm going to have to be driving the tent.

[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:46.880]
I can now go to the hard rock.

[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.220]
Why do I want to know what am I going to do?

[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.120]
Because I ain't going on I ain't going on those damn Mickey RS and cruises to nowhere.

[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:52.760]
That's for sure.

[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.600]
Thank God for that.

[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:54.300]
All right Neil.

[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.280]
Just I love you.

[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:55.820]
See you.

[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.020]
Slip in the Mickey baby.

[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.700]
We are so sick and tired on an issue of Mickey Erison and his masquerade that goes on.

[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.780]
Makes me want a barf and believe me a lot of people on those cruise ships.

[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.720]
That's why you'll spend half your time doing his barfing from the food that rotted you know

[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.840]
from the visell of that's another that's just the women getting raped but all the people

[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.420]
getting sick to their stomach and getting equal and all these other grotesque things

[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:17.760]
from the rotten food.

[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.460]
Just a little minor problems.

[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.020]
Carl Heisen writing against I got to see that column.

[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.040]
It too Carl.

[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.720]
That is just the well you know maybe if they had a few

[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.400]
manatees and dolphins and alligators there maybe Carl could have embraced it a little bit better.

[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.320]
They're going to work it out so that we would raise funds for the manatees.

[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.460]
Our old manatee hugging friend Carl Heisen.

[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:39.100]
Talk about a cellar huh.

[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.760]
I want to make me they put his job on the line.

[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.900]
His ass on the line for that.

[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.940]
What kind of a moron and you know probably these are people that don't go to casinos

[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.980]
that don't gamble.

[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:47.880]
Why?

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:53.080]
All the crap we've heard all of these years about the evils of gambling and how terrible it is in

[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.660]
Vegas and yaddy yaddy yaddy and all the crime and bap bap bap bap bap.

[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.180]
You go to Vegas they treat you like a prince like a king and a queen for crime out loud.

[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.760]
You could eat off the floor.

[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:06.260]
They've got all those fantastic inexpensive meals and buffets.

[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.180]
The old farts and the condos would just fail from that.

[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.460]
They couldn't believe it.

[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.860]
But no it's all these horrible things are going to happen and the sky is going to fall and everybody's

[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.200]
going to lose their lunch money and they're going to go broke it.

[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:21.220]
People are going to get raped in the streets and that's at her and so on.

[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.740]
And it's actually going to be crime in Dave County.

[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.100]
I mean what I wanted to joke that crime in Dave County.

[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.880]
Number three in a country out of the top 100.

[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.440]
Number three worst Miami right in the middle of Dave County.

[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:36.600]
And that's even all these years after Mario 25 years later.

[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.480]
Speaking of guess who made it what it was back then.

[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.580]
That was a pleasant time by the way.

[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.360]
For eighties.

[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.780]
12, 14, at five, 60, 70, come try.

[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.460]
I'm assuming we're still going to the pregame.

[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.960]
Now it's interesting because tree Crawford now did he call you?

[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400]
No Miguel called him.

[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:52.460]
Oh Miguel called him.

[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:52.680]
Yes.

[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.580]
What's our programming maven's doing?

[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.000]
What's Mike the maven doing?

[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:56.720]
I don't know.

[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:57.320]
Huh?

[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:57.760]
That meeting.

[01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.780]
No the meeting you said is over with.

[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:00.380]
Has been.

[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.360]
Yeah, it has been for like a half an hour.

[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.240]
Don't keep me counting.

[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:04.220]
They're holding their meat again.

[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:04.580]
Okay.

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.720]
I don't want to hear about it.

[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:06.440]
It's almost like that.

[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:07.240]
Then a story.

[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:08.500]
Hey, speaking of that.

[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:10.480]
If you look at the mirror and you wonder where did it go.

[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.380]
Where my my hair we're talking about.

[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:13.140]
Where did it go?

[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.700]
Although I got I like this nice short.

[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.600]
Almost no hair now.

[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:16.780]
Wait till you see me man.

[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.780]
You'll say holy crap.

[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:18.400]
You'll say man.

[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.120]
He looks bizarre.

[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.480]
But anyway, don't I always chuck out the areas.

[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.960]
Been helping the famous in lots of famous.

[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.160]
Look fantastic for over 30 long.

[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.100]
Top 30 man.

[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.420]
Amazing years with this fantastic best in the world.

[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:29.740]
Newskin like hair system.

[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.140]
It is 100% undetectable.

[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.180]
And the reason I say it's news because every year he refines it

[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.560]
makes it better and better and better.

[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.320]
The hair looks like it's growing right out of your scalp.

[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:41.000]
As opposed to a mossy look and musk red that fell from the sky.

[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.320]
Like those frogs in Magnolia and died on your head.

[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.360]
Here's the way it works.

[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.180]
You try Charlie's system for 30 days.

[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.140]
Plus 30 man.

[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.100]
And after a month, if you know all of the way it looks and feels

[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.500]
and smells.

[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.000]
If people are grabbing and clawing at your body

[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:52.880]
and trying to get a sniff,

[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.560]
then make the call and you'll give your full refund.

[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.280]
Call him today and set up an appointment.

[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.700]
He'll drag you ass in there and show you how much better and younger.

[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.320]
He can make you look with this fantastic new skin like hair system.

[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.600]
1-800-321-2413.

[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:08.380]
That's 1-800-321-2413.

[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.200]
Like I always tell you, you got nothing loose but that bald spot.

[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.380]
And mentioning you heard about it here on the Miar Roger show,

[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.240]
you get a special Q-Way M-200-Disc on off the regular $800 price

[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.080]

CharlesAufiary.com.

[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.080]
As you are listening to new Rogers,

[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.520]
it's called St. Louis,

[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.720]
and around the Wicked Web,

[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.940]

[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.420]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby.

[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.580]
Only in Miami.

[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.080]
As though,

[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:50.720]
get out of Cuba.

[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.320]
Oi!

[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:25.500]
Did tell you make me sick.

[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.680]
Get out of Cuba quick.

[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.560]
You also got them rich.

[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:36.920]
You am ego son of a bitch.

[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.740]
Baseball we know you like.

[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:45.540]
Are you behind the strike?

[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.940]
Where were you in 63?

[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.100]
Did you kill Kennedy?

[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:53.580]
Uh?

[01:44:53.920 --> 01:45:00.900]
More than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than,

[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:04.260]
Get out now and be your nation.

[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.660]
Are you into masturbation?

[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:11.000]
Feed there will live the embargo.

[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:14.320]
Cuba will become another key logo.

[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.180]
USA.

[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:18.920]
USA.

[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:25.900]
Returning all the raps and modes away.

[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.200]
Okay, at least in the second one.

[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.420]
And I'm sure you got the first one, didn't you?

[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.040]
Pass, though I got it.

[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.140]
Get out of Cuba.

[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.340]
We just can't use your,

[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:38.320]
you've been around way too long.

[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.240]
Pass, though you ugly bastard.

[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.600]
But too long you last the day of pigs.

[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.920]
So that we're, hey puppy.

[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:47.460]
You're sick.

[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.400]
Get out of Cuba quick.

[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:53.000]
You also got, you am ego son of a bitch.

[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:54.960]
Baseball we know you like.

[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.560]
Are you behind the strike?

[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.220]
Where were you in 63?

[01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.660]
Did you kill John Kennedy?

[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.720]
Here's, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than, more than,

[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:06.340]
Get out now and be your nation.

[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.120]
Are you into masturbation?

[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:09.740]
Feed there will live the embargo.

[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:11.280]
Cuba will be coming up a kilo.

[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:12.400]
USA.

[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:14.640]
USA.

[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:19.420]
Returning all the raps and modes away.

[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:20.600]
Lucy.

[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.080]
Lucy.

[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:22.880]

[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:23.280]

[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:26.900]
I'm happy.

[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:27.200]

[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.180]
It's 12.22.

[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.800]
I'm sure glad that Josh was on the ball.

[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.040]
I ain't got the first GD thing.

[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.080]
I would have been.

[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:32.980]
I was in the other room.

[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:33.880]
Get on my clothes on.

[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:34.300]
I was busy.

[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.760]
Because the good news for me is that come

[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:38.200]
hell or high water at 12.50.

[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:38.820]
I'm out of here.

[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.780]
All right, that.

[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.020]
Okay.

[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:41.980]
Are you well?

[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:42.340]
What do you mean?

[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.180]
Okay, I mean, I'm just.

[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:44.240]
Well, whatever you're out.

[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:44.580]
You're out.

[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:46.200]
Oh, that's what it says here.

[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.180]
And since we're being told that the game is on and it's cloudy,

[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.260]
but it's been raining earlier and it's the tarpers on the field.

[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.820]
And maybe there's a delay or whatever.

[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:54.200]
But at 12.50, we're out.

[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.200]
Has anybody told you anything to the contrary?

[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:56.800]
Nope.

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.980]
So when in doubt, we're getting a hell out.

[01:46:59.240 --> 01:46:59.700]
Got it?

[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.440]
All right.

[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.300]
All right.

[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:01.700]
Exactly.

[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.780]
Can you say the better myself?

[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:03.540]
You've turned.

[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:05.720]
5.670560.

reifilm person

[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.960]
But all they want to do is just be a foreign in our ass. If that guy didn't know that we could say it

[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:40.160]
That's right. I thought I had right ask

[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:43.120]
Big fat pimple ass you got it

[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.240]
I beg your prala one is being right in our ass

[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:52.760]
That's it. Well, I got news for they did more than that yesterday for the three premier schools in Dave County

[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.580]
Right, though. Hell it damn near kill them right. That's right. It was a real shot in a head for the poor folks

[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:04.080]
And after that nice lady wrote the fantastic letter and had a pay for the ad in a hero to put that in it

[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.260]
Which I read yesterday was it Florence Hector flagger which one was it whatever anyone and

[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:14.740]
You know and she spelled her right out there very calmly and sensibly and all the positive things and she went through all of it

[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:19.220]
And then the four people in Miami Highlight were really going to take it in the ear from this and called her

[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:24.840]
Which just happens that the geogracal in this fortune of being a couple of blocks south of the Dave Rower and County line

[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.080]
I mean you talk about a bad break

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:33.640]
Brother, I mean Gulf Stream gets off easy because they're just barely north of the county line and color takes it right in the old

[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.880]
Shoot because they happen to be just a little bit just barely in the day

[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:42.340]
Just going to show you all you young people out there stay out of date as much as possible, okay?

[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:48.780]
You want trouble head for Dave you want to walk into you better have your passport and your papers ready when you go to Dave County

[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.360]
I'm struggling with that right now

[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.880]
W2 a.m. Hello

[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.640]
W2 a.m. Hello. Yes

[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.220]
Me how you doing? Okay, I voted for the property and the big argument

[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:03.460]
I had with the few dogs that I knew that we're gonna vote for or vote against it

[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:07.920]
But basically all they're worried with a money is gonna go and this and this and that is not gonna go to schools

[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:12.200]
And all my personal feeling is I could hear weird goes when I go to Vegas

[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.340]
Which is like maybe every two years on a trade show something I gamble I lose I've never won

[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:24.580]
It's entertainment like going to a restaurant that is absolutely correct and and as long as you say

[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.080]
You don't go you know bet the mortgage money it's built in the party your expenses and at the end of the story if I go to

[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.240]
Move Chris and have a dinner

[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:36.080]
Okay, well there's a wedding money goes to waitress goes to the restaurant and he throws me I had a nice meal

[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.440]
And I think with gambling and they're worrying about the teachers and it's going to tell a half thing it's going here

[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.160]
It's going there. See every time there's one of these issues

[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.480]
You've got a certain segment of the electrode out there unfortunately far too many and they want to analyze everything and they got

[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.480]
It was amulet I want to know for sure where it's all gonna go and I want to know the percentage

[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:57.960]
What like you say what the hell difference is to make when it really comes down?

[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.280]
There's no question about the jobs. I mean these places don't run themselves

[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:06.100]
I see out of woodbina a fantastic number of people working there. It's an industry under what's self?

[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.220]
Absolutely it is

[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:11.820]
But I'll say one last thing and it's not off that you better hope that they got in touch with Mo

[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:16.840]
Because you could be on before a clock today. Yes, let's we don't attend the run on long gone

[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:18.660]
See ya, stay there

[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:22.240]
I'm on my way to woodbine baby. I got my driver ready to pick me up

[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.620]
Remember how even Michael had a driver in a godfather right?

[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:30.780]
I'm going to Louise in the Bronx where I'll be safe. Yeah, I think you think five six seven oh five sixty

[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.040]
Count five sixty on the Verizon singular wireless line

[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:36.140]
Well, you know there's no sense of crime over spilled milk

[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:41.540]
You have your chance in date and most of you said on your ass and we consider in screaming yellows old Cubans man

[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:45.840]
They're not going away. They're gonna live forever just out of spite and plus whoever else voted against it

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:51.680]
Wasn't just them but whoever else to but the fact that a matter is nobody showed up 14% we can get more than that

[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:54.160]
Just for a cop fight in high alia we get more than

[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.280]
154,000 people a million plus registered voters in Dave County and

[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:06.140]
154,000 showed up and now it's the ringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth and whoa is us and all is understood

[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.900]
And I would go to go back to the day two more years

[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.740]
Things that should be as automatic as getting out of bed in the morning is falling off a log as is

[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:19.020]
Breathing the fresh air anything any place else easy as pie, but not in South Florida

[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.940]
Everything is muy difficile man. It's very difficult

[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.700]
Just the nature of the beast you know what I mean?

[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:30.900]

Just unbelievable four people in my my lie and flag there that's been there for years

[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:47.200]
Yeah, that's the end of them. They're now we're gonna be able to compete now with with Dania and Hollywood and all that

[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:48.460]

[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:54.280]
But how about people have called her now you got like Hank said this morning got Gulf Stream up the road

[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:59.640]
Carter is not gonna be able to goose up those persons like Gulf Stream is and in the summertime racing who knows how long

[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.060]
How do I even be able to hang on to it? Yeah, but they are owned by Churchill down corporation

[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:07.800]
They got a lot of money. Yeah, that's a true strong act. Yeah, I'd be able to

[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:12.040]
Know Sonic owns Gulf Stream Churchill down. That's right. Yeah

[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:16.480]
I wish it would have been the other way around because I would rather seem cold or get it in golfing music a

[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.720]
Strong act to me is a real I don't like going. Yeah, he's like a Bernad he's a jerk, but

[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:26.700]
Just unbelievable busher lookers and day county once again strike. Yep

[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:31.440]
Now you know where the flamingos went when they closed down highly you ever see that you number what's highly?

[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.620]
Did you have seen the videos of the event? It was a beautiful thing

[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:38.320]
They had the inner field there with the tote board and then the the lake you know like a lot of tracks

[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:44.660]
And and the flamingos all together there were little islands in lake and when it came to be feeding time the

[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:49.040]
Whatever they would come the ringmaster the ringleader the goofball he come along and blow to whistle

[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:53.720]
They all like line up and goose step along because they knew they've been trained at when the whistle sounded it was feeding time

[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:58.380]
It was like the dog with Pavlov, you know to ring the bell on the refrigerator door the same thing

[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:00.020]
And he would like blow to whistle

[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:03.880]
They'd all like to line up and goose step along and they get fed you know is a beautiful thing to watch

[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.140]
So we know that the flamingos have moved to a date county and voted yesterday's election

[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:09.960]

[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.680]
They don't have to be embarrassed

[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.660]
They get to keep what money?

[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:39.020]
There's money to spread out to the state from my brother, right?

[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:42.320]
And what about all the money? They're gonna lose their own revenue. What about that?

[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.980]
I don't know who's any revenue that they would have had if it would have passed

[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:53.660]
But yet the other thing you know is they don't have to look so pathetic and desperate like Broward that they'll court a bunch of compulsive gamblers

[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:56.500]
Yeah

[01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:00.680]
Pathetic and desperate to hoard a bunch of compulsive gamblers like Vegas

[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.560]
You know every time I get off of playing in a caron airport in Las Vegas. I look around

[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:08.180]
I think to make myself why and these people look really pathetic and desperate

[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:14.380]

[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:18.600]
Thank God the people in Dave County aren't so desperate

[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.180]
They have to like make money off a bunch of degenerate gamblers

[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.600]
Especially they still got all a good drug money fuel in from Latin America drug lottery

[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:29.460]

Monterrey five six seven oh five sixty

[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:37.720]

WQ a.m. Hello

[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:51.160]
Yes, ma'am hi. I wanted to talk to you about the propaganda that the chairman's are now viewing

[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.800]
I heard this morning on our government run

[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.140]
News situation and that's in the

[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.580]
Stoppeltings track of everyone. Yes

[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.900]
The chairman's now

[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:10.740]
I'm applauding Bush for the war and saying that he was right to go into our lab because he's creating well

[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:15.660]
Peace and what's ironic is they don't see the Napoleon

[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:22.400]
Hitler coming their way. Oh, they see it then notice remember when he went there and they were demonstrating by the thousands in the streets

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.380]
They were full they were throwing rotten robbers at him

[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:29.320]
Well this morning after the whole Italian thing and the Italian's want to pull out now

[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:29.900]
Right

[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.720]
The truth is and it's really scary

[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:45.580]
Yeah, you know just it seems to win both versions way no matter what well

[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:47.540]
Maybe made him an offer they can't refuse yeah

[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:54.540]
That could be made to talk to his friends the Saudis they threatened to jack up the price of gas to like about 14 bucks a gallon

[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:57.100]
Yeah, that's another thing they voted down

[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.800]
You know minimum wage and now they're really paying gas

[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:00.860]
And the gallon

[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:05.000]
This is only going to be three bucks a gallon. What do you know that money for?

[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:06.200]

For the gas prices I can't believe rook Daniels actually got a couple of votes on that pool

[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:40.960]
Can you rook Daniels who was a Randy wannabe who was had waxy buildup she's got nine votes can you believe that there's the missing nine votes

Uh, that's an excellent question. I would assume that they're gonna take that well

[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.660]
They've already filed a thing in court and I would assume they're gonna get the regga

[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:04.800]
There are slots too because whatever the law permits in the state

[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:08.740]
Whatever's permitted by the Constitution allegedly they supposedly can get the same thing

[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:11.340]

I don't know one of those people that goes all the time and then make some stories about hogger

[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:04.540]
You know some people have an image to maintain

[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:08.100]
Don't lose no much to that hand. Come on. I'm begging. We don't do it

[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:11.360]
Believe you me especially when you're working for this job, but you never know what those checks

[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.020]
Well, it's thinking about that's why they didn't come in to tell us about the game

[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:19.940]
Because I'm sure that clearance and muff are both theorously working out to make sure that my check my check shows up on time tomorrow

[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.400]
Right, they're writing it. No, maybe that's right. They're uh, they're covering it right now. They're out in the street
