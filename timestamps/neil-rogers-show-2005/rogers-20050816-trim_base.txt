[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]
Only Carl. Neil Rogers' right the Cubs. Start!

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:29.980]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:55.620]
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.080]
We are the stars

[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.940]
Be true to your show

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.340]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.440]
Be true to your show

[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.620]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.140]
Be true to your show

[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.860]
Be true to your show

[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.720]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240]
Be true to your show

[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.180]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.800]
Be true to your show

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.580]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.040]
Be true to your show

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.320]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.520]
Be true to your show

[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.620]
You're the stars, you're the stars

[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.380]
We're done, now we're here baby

[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.700]
We're rocking back and forth with Javanan

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.780]
We're like, uh, like, like that

[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.500]
But anyway, they're right

[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.560]
What I always tell you, the religious people are the

[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.480]
Crazy people, don't ever forget it

[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.960]
Not just any of one, but I mean the more religious, the crazier they are

[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.640]
The louder they are, the louder they are

[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.580]
I beg your pardon? The lot, the lot

[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.920]
And don't forget about those pillars of salt

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.240]
Anyway, so they took the, uh,

[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.580]
Pull in the Suncentle

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.880]
And of course needless to say they put it on Friday

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.640]
Knowing that I wouldn't be on here on Friday

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.260]
And I'm sure you didn't mention it

[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.940]
And they took a poll about how do you rate Jimmy Sifilus in Joe Rose on the

[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.580]
Detolphin broadcast

[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.960]
And of course that Uncle's broadcast on Saturdays

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.820]
Sent there our numbers diving down even, even more

[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.860]
And, uh, all of us said that it disappeared this morning

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.560]
It was on their yesterday and their A's dropped from the 18.8 A to about and then the F up to

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.180]
of over 20% last time I looked at it until it disappeared.

[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.480]
The bottom line adding the CD and F was like about 60% CD or F and A and big at about 40%

[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.140]
not really good.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.040]
The audience is unimpressed Jimmy.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.600]
Hey Jimmy.

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.300]
You're fairy.

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.380]
But of course Jim Sarni has seen on this show we take a stupid ass poll every day to kill

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.180]
some time and give you something to do.

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.800]
You know, awesome busy work.

[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.660]
But at least we have our own opinions.

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.200]
I'll say, well here's what the poll says but the correct answer is not giving my own

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.560]
idea.

[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.720]
But Jim Sarni, that big boop hotel he hasn't got any opinions of his own evidently.

[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.140]
So it's always, well let's take a poll and then if they don't like the way it comes

[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.320]
out it just kind of vanishes or they don't give you the result or whatever.

[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.920]
Come on Sarni, butch up you, any you quizzling you.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.660]
You're fairy.

[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.280]
A commercial airline with at least 158 people aboard crashed in Western Venezuela early

[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.760]
today after reporting engine trouble.

[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.400]
A lot of plane crashes yesterday and you know what?

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.300]
I mean lately.

[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.060]
A top government official said it was unlikely anybody survived.

[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.940]
Well that's what Scott Miles O'Brien said even before the crash they're all dead.

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.900]
The West Caribbean Airways plane was on route from Panama to the Caribbean island of Martinique.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.880]
Oh, who'd want to go there?

[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.060]
When it's part of reported trouble with both engines to Caracas's air control tower around

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.720]
three o'clock this morning said, Francisco Paz, president of National Aviation, did I

[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.140]
say that right?

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.220]
Francisco Paz.

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.280]
The airport authorities lost radio contact with the plane about ten minutes later when

[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.540]
the plane was in the area of Machique case.

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.720]
400 miles west of Caracas and the western border in St.

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.860]
Ave.

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.240]
He said, Thulia.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.180]
Residents in the area said they heard an explosion Paz said.

[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.820]
He's here at Minister Jesse Chacone said that based on reports from over to aircraft flying

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.920]
over the area it's unlikely that there could be any survivors.

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.540]
So planes just keep falling out of the sky all over the place.

[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.020]
Maybe and they had another helicopter crash somewhere in Afghanistan right?

[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.520]
Yeah.

[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.280]
All over the place.

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.560]
Look at this.

[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.100]
What is the main cause of violence in America, Georgia's poise yesterday?

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.520]
Over a thousand votes.

[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.460]
Nice go to George.

[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.040]
Well, it's that aspect, you know.

[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.000]
It's like it's the past Friday.

[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.480]
I'm looking at the physics on our website.

[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.960]
Yeah, it must have been asked Friday.

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.540]
So, Shmere lived on your head.

[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.400]
On your forehead.

[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.240]
Little ass.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.800]
Already did.

[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.160]
Oh, God.

[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.540]
And I looked down there to see what it was that got the tremendous response.

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.320]
And it's a rear ass view of some Syrian woman.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.480]
Pro-Tanasi Syrian?

[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.300]
She's a Syrian.

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.240]
Yeah, very Syrian about it.

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.240]

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.020]
It looks like a guy to be honest with you.

[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.600]
If you look at the hair and look at the ass, it looks like a guy.

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.540]
And just a distant picture of some ass and she's protesting about, but a beep, but a

[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.440]
beep, but a beep, and that's it.

[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.540]
All of a sudden, oh, gee, it's a naked ass.

[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.340]
I always think of what we ought to do is go back to the Beated Curtain and have like

[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.740]
celebrity ass of the day.

[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.420]
Okay.

[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.080]
We can do that, couldn't we?

[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.200]
You tell me.

[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]
I don't know where the line is anymore.

[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.360]
No, no, you could have an ass picture.

[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.740]
It's got nothing to do with genitalia.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.540]
And then we could, can we do a separate poll?

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.880]
Is it physically possible, Josh, that we can do like a poll on the Beated Curtain?

[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.600]
We can do that, couldn't we?

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.020]
Absolutely.

[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.240]
I beg your pardon?

[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.740]
Absolutely.

[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.860]
But yeah, and we could like have people guess whose celebrity ass it was every day.

[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.080]
That could hold a whole bunch of response on her again.

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.120]
And once in a while, we could do like a male ass.

[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.500]
Like we could put Greg Reed's picture on there.

[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.900]
Just his face, huh?

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.700]
I don't think that's possible only the one.

[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.420]
Seriously, what's not possible?

[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.240]
I was joking.

[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.300]
Male ass.

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.340]
No, we could do that.

[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.300]
Like could he tell me Cruz's ass?

[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.820]
We don't have any male asses?

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.560]
Oh, yeah, we could find out.

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.000]
I mean, mostly female, obviously, because except for some of the listeners out here

[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.580]
want to see Tom Cruz's ass, just take a look at him.

[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.460]
Okay, he's all ass.

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.420]
Speaking of all ass, you people at MSNBC now was lucky enough this morning to catch the

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.840]
promo for Rita Cosby.

[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.440]
Seriously, this is their big coup.

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.880]
Their burpless coup and MSNBC, Rita Cosby, who may be one of the ugliest skankiest looking

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.780]
bitches I've ever seen.

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.360]
And she has a little bit of a problem for broadcast.

[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.860]
And then she can't speak.

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.460]
I don't know.

[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]
You talked about your son.

[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.500]
I understand it's hard for you to talk to your son about the details of this case.

[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.600]
She can't speak.

[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.020]
I mean, right.

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.800]
Yeah, she's got a skankier nose and she's an idiot, a bubblehead and she can't, and it's

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.860]
not like she's that lyrnjadis.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.040]
That's just the way she speaks.

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.580]
Wow.

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.300]
So what a coup for MSNBC is those numbers continue zooming down.

[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.300]
Okay, a thousand and five votes on Georgia's poor yesterday.

[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.580]
Let's get back to something really serious here, okay?

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.420]
Okay.

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.220]
Okay.

[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.160]
What is the main cause of violence in America?

[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.560]
Bad parents, 249.

[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.100]
Well, how about no parents?

[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.800]
Yeah.

[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.820]
This is the new thing in America like one parent families and no parent families and people

[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.020]
just making babies and just, you know, see the thing?

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.520]
I'm impressed with that because cockroaches can make babies and rabbits can make lots of

[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.700]
babies and ants make babies.

[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.780]
What's the big deal?

[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.880]
What's the big timis?

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.260]
One thing to make babies, it's nothing to have like a little responsibility.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.600]
I think instead of like forced liberalizations, a great idea.

[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.660]
But anybody who's going to like have babies out of wedlock, for example, George?

[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.440]
Yeah.

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.400]
Main cause of violence in America.

[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.920]
Bad parents, 249.

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.180]
That's a cop-up, wouldn't you say?

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.820]
No, it's the Tiger.

[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.200]
No, that's the main cause of violence.

[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.300]
Yeah, parents not making their kids enough.

[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.960]
Oh, I see.

[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.540]
Poverty 204.

[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.640]
Now that's a cop-up.

[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.180]
Right.

[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.640]
Just because your poor isn't excused.

[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.520]
No, you're right.

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.460]
We're not asking about crime like a pickpockets or, you know, holding up a seven-lam.

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.500]
We're talking about violence because they're frustrated.

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.900]
Oh, is that what it is?

[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.800]
Black people, 141, which I see a cross over there for the top two.

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.900]
And, of course, you left out black people with guns.

[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.180]
You see, we have a real problem here in Toronto lately with the black folks who are gunned.

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.820]
But where are you at?

[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.660]
Right here.

[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.140]
You know what they said?

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.020]
Where are you at?

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.660]
Well, you at?

[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.620]
Those new commercials.

[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.160]
Yeah.

[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.740]
Oh, you've seen that too, huh?

[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.600]
Where you at?

[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.020]
No, no, no.

[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.440]
Not seriously.

[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.880]
What kind of crap is this?

[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.040]
Well, I don't want to find out who it's for because it's probably some sponsor bars.

[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.600]
But what is that?

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.940]
Well, what would that be targeting your demographic?

[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.460]
Where you at?

[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.460]
No, I'm sorry.

[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.000]
But television promoting in commercials in literacy, that's not acceptable to me.

[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.460]
It's like a death wish for dark folks.

[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.380]
Where you at?

[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.600]
Oh, I don't want to go in with black people, 141.

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.380]
I don't want to hear.

[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.580]
I can't stand it.

[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.000]
Guns 97, the Bible 79.

[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.340]
I know.

[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.540]
Actually, I had a lot on my boat.

[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:44.940]
Sure that.

[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.760]
And, of course, social to guns because we're going to the violence we couldn't have.

[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.840]
We've got like night violence and road rage violence with cars.

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.060]
But most of it is crazy people would gun.

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.880]
In a sponsor.

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.620]
The Bible 79, which the Bible says, smite audio enemies, especially starting October 1st in Florida.

[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.220]
Republican 67, drugs 46, television 31, alcohol had.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.340]
About 30, man.

[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.620]
Democrats 20, immigrants 17, video games only nine.

[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.300]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.900]
Women 8.

[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.580]
Now, what does that mean women are the main cause of violence?

[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.540]
Well, the whole thing started with how women will start a fight and expect their man to finish it or

[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.760]
meant fighting over women or something like that.

[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.260]
There's 101 ways the woman create violence.

[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.080]
And movies 7.

[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.200]
Go get on there.

[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.820]
WCYN, hello.

[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.980]
My penis is gone.

[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.840]
Internet casino buys Jesus image parogi.

[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.600]
Here's the most important story of the day.

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.160]
I saw that.

[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.320]
Point place, Ohio.

[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.220]
Where do you see that?

[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.500]
The parogi on the TV.

[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.520]
And Internet casino known for its collection of oddities is paid 1775 bucks for a parogi

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:50.640]
meat.

[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.360]
Anybody out there who's not Polish or parogi is like a holding that looks like an image of Jesus.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.780]
Oh, I always wanted a parogi that looks just like Jesus.

[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.800]
Golden palace dot com purchased the admiestodator in auction offered by eBay.

[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.120]
The seller, Donna Lee, said that Jesus face appeared when she was cooking Polish dumplings

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.020]
for Easter dinner.

[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.200]
That's what parogi's are.

[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.620]
Very good.

[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.200]
Kind of like a Canadian loss.

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.000]
For all you go in Canadian law.

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.280]
They were have canadles.

[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.380]
That I know it's like Jewish dumplings.

[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.080]
You're like a lot back in the North.

[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.100]
I pray for the dumplings to like taste really good.

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.600]
Anyway, she was cooking Polish dumplings for each student at her home in Point Place.

[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.900]
They told you those suburb on Lake Erie.

[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.520]
She has kept it in her freezer ever since because there's a Jesus face on her parogi.

[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.400]
I wonder if there's a Mary face on her.

[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.440]
We seem to have an interest in all these religious items said drew black.

[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.760]
Marketing spokesman for golden palace dot com, probably no relation to J black.

[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.840]
The casino has a collection of odd items, including a 10 year old partially eaten cheese

[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.620]
sandwich thought to be containing the image of the Virgin Mary.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.000]
A pretzel shaped like the Virgin Mary holding a baby Jesus and a pregnancy test that

[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.720]
led you into long to Britney Spears.

[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.560]
Black said the parogi will draw the traveling museum that the online casino is creating

[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.580]
for its collections.

[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.340]
Oh God.

[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.340]
I hope I live long enough to see the parogi with the Jesus face on the parogi.

[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.780]
Yeah, the lately with all this, you know, God's a crap going on.

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.320]
That's all we see now.

[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.880]
For one hand, the crazy Muslims with their flying carpets and then of course the

[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.400]
Hacidum over there with the boxes on the hills and the big hats and the long the

[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.740]
beards and the payers and they're rocking back and forth and they got oh geez like a card.

[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.280]
Oh, and they show this like these are like this is the way the world is supposed to be.

[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.880]
Okay, like we're not supposed to laugh at this.

[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.780]
You know, somebody would say when you're making fun of other people's religion and the

[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.420]
answer is no.

[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.860]
No, the answer is yes.

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.260]
Sorry.

[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.340]
Yeah, that's probably one of the best things you can do is make fun of other people's

[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.640]
religions.

[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.380]
He's got a bad.

[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:37.660]
He's got a bad.

[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.540]
1014 at 560 WDQM.

[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.220]
Oh man, we'll start with your guns from the spoke up.

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.240]
I took your calls for these phonics.

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.440]
They say the future needs right for me.

[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.300]
Now I can't get snow jobs because I don't got no literacy.

[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.240]
I was talking like an old-tea girl.

[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.220]
You might like to talk to your house this way.

[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.380]
Now I can't do nothing but my heritage says that's okay.

[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.100]
Change my name to shoot roll.

[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.700]
Try my doomsend the quarter and you can't let.

[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:31.180]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.180]
body.

[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.700]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:40.880]
body.

[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.560]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:41.560]

[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:41.640]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:41.640]

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:49.500]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.500]

[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:56.120]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.120]

[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.160]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.160]

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.600]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cards hanging outside, developing their

[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:25.600]

[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:25.940]
The other thing you know of is oil concealing.

[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:25.940]

[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.420]
And the other thing is oil concealing.

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.640]
I didn't learn that it's oil concealing.

[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.560]
And the other thing is oil concealing.

[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.360]
I never knew I had someone to be able to think of when money goes away again and again.

[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.520]
I never knew that it was oil concealing.

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.520]

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.520]

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.520]

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.640]
I remember the young guy from the leadership of an email, even in that raisedili dark

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:30.640]

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.140]
I remember the young brother from the chair.

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.900]
And the fridge is there.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.420]
I remember when I was feeling all the white nails

[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.460]
hanging outside, the building they were bought,

[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.900]
grinds the blues, that bothered me.

[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.500]
Why there was got no job for me.

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.040]
And I had a...

[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.900]
So the bonnets would give my life a chase now.

[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.080]
I had...

[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.560]
got to go in and sell more crack, okay?

[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.840]
수도 prick!

[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.240]
zuboolrtick!

[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:28.540]
upmaking the whole thing a day!

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.540]

[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]
They're funny.

[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.560]
Where did they end up?

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:35.160]
so many ugly people in so little time. Marty Feldman though seems to be winning hands down your pants. Marty's got 61. Oh come on

[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.560]
He was adorable must be those Marty Feldman eyes you think. Oh

[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.360]
Haven't played that in a long time but it's coming up soon. But

[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.260]
93 votes Marty Feldman 61. Hank Goldberg 35. The Humper

[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.500]
That's what Hank on the Arlington Millions helicopters inserted. I mentioned that. No, but yeah, not on the area

[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.420]
I did this. He that Hank was on air and

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.920]
I was thinking of myself for ABC sure like similar they treating very well and ESPN as well which is owned by ABC

[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.600]
They treated with respect as opposed to WQM which treats him with the greatest disrespect

[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.540]
I just mentioned that in passing okay. I Hank Goldberg 35 Mohawar David is got 21

[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.680]
They're showing a third place show for most so far. They're moving on to by the way

[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:23.380]
4 6 30 Marlins on deck Poverays at the Marlin 705 edk after the abaseball game

[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.640]
Stars sliced the loans got 16 Karl Maldon 12 neo-rodgers 11 right on Karl Maldon's ass

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.700]
But I sure don't have his nose. No who does oh?

[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:42.680]
Olin Wilson 9 James Woods 9. I shouldn't have his zits. Oh Charles Bronson 8 WC fields 4 Peter Laurie 3 Gene Wilder 2 and Red Skeleton had a pair

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.720]
God bless

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.700]
See it's getting to be an age thing those of us who remember Red Skeleton were very small minority because all the Red Skeleton viewers are dead

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.540]
All that you remember Red Skeleton I saw a picture or two and of course Josh never

[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.600]
He don't even know who Red Skeleton is he didn't know who been crossby was so sure I do I do you do what?

[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:04.200]
No Red Skeleton was I do would you see that like on a comedy channel or on the one who's oldy moldy some old video?

[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.380]
I think I see

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.360]
Uh, I'll be honest with you. I think he was highly overrated

[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.040]
Where's keon all right you can't say that he's dead and that's the second largest he was below

[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.400]
But I don't think he was all that funny. He was no jacking leasing that's for damn sure

[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.280]
He was no uh after the other one who was overweight it was jacked many yeah well

[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.120]
Well, what was so funny? I mean I love his reading impersonations, but other than that

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.780]
So you asked about that woman and you probably just touched on this yesterday

[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.160]
But this seems to have gotten so many people reading it on our website other than looking at that Syrian ladies ass

They came down and pushed them into a building at the north end of august and airport splinter set

Well, he's an ugly guy. All right and

[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.440]
Bokeh Brian suggested Richard Boone Richard Boone was an ugly guy. He never really had a big nose

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.520]
But he had like James Woods knows he had like a zits on his nose right?

[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.340]
She's not a good idea

[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.360]
But he's got a gun

[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.220]
You know travel if you call him ugly

[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.160]
You're ass okay, so cut the crap and Eric put one on there that you should have who is I love it

[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:20.720]
Yeah, right kind of like sounds like Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie is what it sounds like to me or Debbie Roe or Tommy Roe

[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.660]
I think Michael Jackson and Tommy Roe gonna or hope that I saw a tab 100 movie for about 30 seconds the other day

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.400]
I kept thinking the image of him and Tony Perkins doing it like do e-style kept coming to mind

[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.440]
If couldn't get that out of my mind at any rate speaking a crazy religious people

[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.540]
You know seriously you folks are about to do something about this. You've got to take the religious people and do something with it

[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:40.760]
Yeah

[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.560]

[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.260]
Maryland man in times must be getting really really tough on you

[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.680]
Yeah, it's one thing when you guys started appearing at falls view casino and Niagara falls like rain Newton and

[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.660]

Are they still open Kenny Rogers? I don't know. I haven't seen one in a long time. Oh, probably not

I don't like stack of bills and some fluency on his arm. You know so every time I mentioned Pete to Hank

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.420]
It's like oh, you know

Why do you know Hank is part of that sports fraternity? You know those people kind of like suck around together WQ. I am hello

[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.740]
How Goldstein called him the hedgehog of porn every time he referred to really? Yeah, but how does this guy remember that maybe

[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.060]
There's an old Goldstein one else's boyfriend that could be that he met at the ring and amstu

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.860]
Okay, let's get him on their round here. I mean history of grotesque and he took he took

[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.440]
Hedgehog radio Q. I.m. Yes

[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.720]

Almost gonna win a pool right. Thank you. Yeah, he's ugly. He's another zip-head. Mm-hmm greater face

[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.220]
Oh, you know what I got here. What do you got there speaking of Howard Coastal?

[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.900]
He was pretty ugly too, but I'm not suggesting we put him on the phone. He's a great day Johnson happy

[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.240]
Well, that can be the

[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.600]
Every station had a film news sound that was the ABC News Center was also the intro to speaking of sports with Howard Coastal

[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.520]
Let me hear it again

[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.320]
Religious groups in Croatia are put arms over the yeah, I'm a little off my timing now because with Hank on vacation two weeks

[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.200]
We don't have any crossover which is fine with me

[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.400]
I don't want to cross over with Gildey and Kimba not nothing against them personal

[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:35.880]
But what are you gonna talk about with them? Yeah, oh, we could talk about to Kimba about the cow on front of university

[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.400]
Dogs I'm sure you like to get the preplugin sure, but so as a result

[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.140]
We actually started 10 o'clock is opposed to the seven or eight or sometimes nine or ten minutes that Hank and I get to butcher and kill

[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.400]
At 10 o'clock every day, which I like a lot, but don't let me forget my list of racetracks when Hank comes back

[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.720]
Oh, assuming he comes back religious groups in Croatia are up in arms over the imminent arrival or shock rock or

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:02.060]
Maryland Mansard for Manson for a concert, but rounding to the banner of free speech and perhaps a little shock value of his own

[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.180]
Manson is found one unlikely to fender a Catholic priest

[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:11.340]
Maybe the priest likes him how could Manson turn young people into Satanist and drug addicts in the two hours of his activity

[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.980]
Newspaper

[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:18.180]
Visnet coded priest Anton Boba says saying Boba's who leads a heavy metal band of his own called blood

[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:24.840]
Necessy Naude messengers of hope says most of Manson's critics have never heard his songs or even seen him perform

[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.760]
The lone priest finds himself fighting a weird guard action weird guard

[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:35.180]
Let them now the priest know a lot about that against Christian groups from the ispian peninsula ahead of the constant August 22nd of the

[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.900]
Northern aad we had a town of Pula Protestant organization O'Waza which sounds a little like

[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.960]
Yeah, Protestant organization

[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.320]
Once the concert band did it while seven Catholic priest offered to pay

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.240]
Damages to the organizers use if the concert was canceled arguing that the band's lyrics and image promote

[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.360]
Satanism drug use and violence. Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.100]
Right Boba said the best concert he ever attended was seen Manson live in Hamburg, Germany three years ago

[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.160]
But even Boba's temper is his support despite the music

[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.440]
Manson was a rather dark persona and he wouldn't recommend anyone especially young people to attend the concert

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.900]
So in other words, he wants the concert to go on just so anybody go there

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:20.840]
Makes sense to me. How do you Q. I. Am hello? I need a Mary Abraham. That's a good choice

[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:27.900]
Who F. Murray Abraham? I don't have no idea who that is. I always wonder who would F. Murray Abraham? Who is it?

[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:34.160]
It's an actor. He's a very famous actor F. Murray Abraham you I never heard him who is that?

[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.560]
It's an actor. He's a famous man who that and where he be at F. Murray. What's he in? Let me let me do an IMDb

[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.080]
I do I do I think you guys I think there was a set up call that like one of the house even calling it

[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.380]
I think he's got his tits

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.060]
Too tight how can I not know F. Murray Abraham if he's a famous actor?

[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.900]
He was a Jewish boy too. Oh, is he really?

[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.560]
Maybe he's rocking it right now over there in the Gaza strip. They're rocking back and they're doveting

[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.660]
We're not gonna leave. We're gonna burn down the house

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.580]
We don't want some schmack the head moving any and meantime they got the worst mackas on their heads

[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.740]
It's a battle of head gear when the history of the human race is written some dark day

[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.160]
It'll turn out to all be a battle of head gear

[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.300]
Stop that my god is better than your god. It's my head gear my schmata is better than yours. That's right

[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.880]
No, no, no, no, I got a better. Oh, Kippah man. I got a better skull cap

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.600]
In fact, what wasn't it skull in the skull and bones was that thing?

[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.260]
You know, of course I told the one so that Roberto Calvary documentary

[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.480]
Well, it was it was a it was a documentary. I guess MSNBC

[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:37.880]
They actually had a good show on over the weekend Roberto Calvary the a Vatican banker who was a portrait in Godfather 3

[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.300]
That's one of the good things about Godfather 3 with that Vatican banking scandal

[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.520]
And of course he supposedly hanged himself in London and it's very obvious. He did not it was a was a moiter

[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.860]
The giver for the day for the mafia he was the banker for the free mason's which is not good the PI

[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.400]
And he was also a banker for the ill-vaticano

[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.520]
So he was to hang out with some really nasty people and now he's dead

[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.700]
So did you ever see on the day of some trying to find a movie that you might not see in okay?

[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.760]
Because he's made like

[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.840]
Million movies 78 now. I'm sure I've probably seen him

[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.480]
But it's one of those people is he like a star here

[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.840]
Or is it like a director director? Oh, okay, but he's ugly. Oh, yeah, well who needs a man?

[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.280]
19 before 11 at 560 WQI thing about those greatest hits collections from the 70s and 80s is all the wonderful memories the music brings back

[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.060]
But what about all the great times you've had recently?

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.840]
Now you can relive those memories with the greatest hits of July

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.460]
2005 featuring all your favorite hits from the greatest month since June

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.200]
2005 with great songs like Don'tcha from the pussycat dolls and buster rimes

[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.460]
Oh

[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:48.440]
It was July and I remember it was hot out or this one from Kelly Clarkson

[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.060]
Wow

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.540]
I remember it was

[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.940]
July because the weather was really hot or how about this classic from Will Smith

[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.240]
And coming soon look for the greatest hits of August 2005 featuring a lot of the greatest hits from the greatest hits of July

[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.320]
2005 but with different memories mostly about how it got even hotter

[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.520]
I've tell you who qualified for the poll except for the fact that he's not in radio while he's in radio

[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.760]
Sort of like on a fringe of it is Maddie Bell

[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.100]
Boy if he isn't one of the nastiest looking and I'll tell you another one in radio is PD Lenny

[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.020]
Yeah, without a cordy in skin face in it would add leather of the leather look

[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.820]
I'm not talking about the I'm talking about the skin

[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:39.800]
It's red left or it's not a personal lock at least not on PD Eleni anyway Maddie and see one thing about life is that even if you're ugly

[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.840]
As in you can still talk about other people being ugly. It's like if you're fat

[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:49.120]
You can still say look what a fat slob that is sure you ought to know somebody says how about cowboy western actor Jack Elam

[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.680]
Yeah, every time we do an ugly poll of any kind Jack Elam always gets some votes. Okay, Jack Elam on there

[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.460]
He was kind of crusty to look at

[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:01.400]
Rusty and crusty five six seven oh five sixty and you think the brits have problems with these

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.300]
You here's a different kind of you to have in problems with a severe shortage of sperm donors

[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:14.520]
Government plans to make fertility treatment more accessible to single women and lesbian couples are likely to be ineffective because of a severe shortage of sperm donors

[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.900]
A leading fertility expert and Britain has told the Guardian those brits. Well, what do you expect all the brits are?

[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.240]
Yeah, anyway, which doesn't mean they don't have any sperm

[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.780]
But it's just it all depends on where they want to put it

[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.840]
Proposals to work for a facility claims to be more flexible in who they offer treatment to our outlined

[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:37.340]
To be outlined in a Department of Health consultation paper this week many clinics only offer fertility treatment to heterosexual couples to ensure they comply with an

[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.220]
1990 human

[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.220]
Fertilization and embryology authority act. Why didn't even know that there was an

[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.080]
1990 human fertilization and embryology authority act in Britain

[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:51.400]
It states that clinics must consider the welfare of the future child and specifically the need for a father figure before offering treatment

[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.720]
A father figure for your father figure the common select committee on science and technology last year concluded

[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.100]
I knew it was you Frado

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.980]
That was on again over the weekend the Godfather to and they had the unedited version it goes on for about 75 hours

[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:12.360]
My God great and the Hyman Roth the hotels here. It was all of those lines all those corny lines are always quoting some Godfather to I'm wondering how come

[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:20.420]
You know his the henchman that he took to kill Hyman Roth right why wouldn't he just have like a silencer and although it was just bad timing

[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.360]
I guess they all turn marching in there in the nurses came out. Oh my god

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.600]
He got his alnieri. No, that wasn't alnieri. That was the big the tall

[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.020]
ominous looking guy with a black the totally black. Oh, yeah

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.540]
That's right. I'm gonna have to look him up alnieri didn't get killed in fact

[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.980]
I don't remember he sent an area to visit the vision. That's right. That's right

[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:44.640]
I'll look him up the common select committee on science and technology and Britain last year concluded the act to be offensive to

[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.300]
One conventional families of single parents and single sex couples

[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.600]
Bill Ledger who runs a fertility clinic in Sheffield said the government's proposals were a lot of

[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.760]
But unlikely to be effective because of legal changes in April

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.140]
I remove the status of anonymity from sperm donors under the new law any child born from a donor sperm can request

[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.140]
Know the identity of their biological father when they turn 18. Well if you're a key

[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.760]
It won't be I remember the royal family. He can be sure that really man

[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.720]
There's a whole bunch of queens in that family. I beg your pardon. I said rally. So who was that guy?

[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.280]
We haven't found you. No Godfather to you. You'll never find him

[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.900]
He was a Michael's bodyguard in Havana. Right. Can't you all find him right now?

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.540]
I don't envision he's a big superman. Can you envision Superman? Yeah, Johnny

[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.480]
All I used to bring me here all the time. I knew it was you Frato. You broke my heart. He was so good in that Michael Michael

[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.780]
Corleone Al Pacino. Whatever's anyone. In fact, he was always good until he did one thing true

[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:43.280]
That was the end that was all the other one sent of a woman that was that was that preceded the who high I think oh

[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.840]
I thought that's the same movie. Oh, that is the same one. You're right. Right?

[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.480]
You're absolutely and you didn't even see it did you know?

[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.980]
No, good choice. That's how I do bow elimination because it's like the one I have a horrible movie that is and he got

[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.360]
He got an Oscar for that. It just goes to show you he didn't get the Oscar for any of the godfather's

[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.500]
I don't believe but he gets a gun. I guess it's called makeup time. It's like an involve game

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.620]
You know a makeup call I'm part blows a call and all of a sudden we're gonna make good call or like a hockey

[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.480]
Same thing call a bad penalty and then I have to have a make good later on how about that hockey season?

[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.140]
By the way, where more wishes at the Panthers lose every game?

[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.220]
Errach's parliament agreed to a seven-day extension for leader. How come you're so newsy lately because I feel like it has that

[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.440]
Remember that guy in that New Yorkie guy go back in the years

[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:28.100]
Errach's parliament agreed to a seven-day extension for leaders to complete a draft constitution after politicians fail to reach a

[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.800]
Midnight Monday deadline to agree on the charter

[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:37.780]
Parliament adjourned after voting to extend the deadline till August 22th acting on a request from Kurdish leaders for more time all the Kurds and ways and

[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.700]
Means committee she I'd soon be in Kurdish framework. See this is all this is are you a person are you a human?

[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.000]
Are you let's let's take the country you live in are you in a raki or are you one of these religious one of these sects?

[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.700]
See people think that sex is the problem. It's sex sex sex. That's the problem

[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.920]
Everybody's divided into their sect and sub-sect and this and I mean but it's crap. Don't label me

[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.280]
That's what they're saying. Oh

[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.140]
She I'd soon be in Kurdish framers of the charter had reached a tentative deal

[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.700]
Yes, today agreeing on issues ranging from oil revenues to the country's name

[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.480]
But putting off decision on the most contentious questions including women's rights the rule of Islam and possible Kurdish autonomy

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.680]
Efforts to make the August 15 deadline showed how to terminate a raki's are to maintain political momentum under intense

[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.220]
U.S. pressure, but their failure to agree was a clear sign that their sharp political visions are far

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.700]
From over what it says here. Where's this from this is from the A&P

[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.500]
Recurring the same leaders

[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.380]
The law was to award in the presidential model of freedom. There was a bubble on air

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.640]
I'm sure you knew who that was. He's no reading Cosby. I'll tell you that

[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:45.460]
Well our heroes and I don't care how you pronounce her name because I heard her pronounce her own name

[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:52.260]
Everybody in the media is calling her Cindy she-han. Okay. She pronounced it like I did she in okay. I knew some she-han

[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.780]
She probably hung out in the she and he helps once upon a time back in the day doing an old style

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.900]
All the why don't think her kind hang out in the she-han helps you know

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.320]
Undaunted by counter rallies and even neighbors gunshot blast into the air a

[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.480]
Woman who's sundied in a rags head shall continue her anti-war demonstration your president pushes ranch for three more weeks

[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.840]
We can't get up give up no matter how hard it gets in the she-han city

[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.260]
I said in more than a week after she started the protest and memory of her 24-year-old son Casey

[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.640]
She ends makeshift campsite along the road leading to the ranch is going to more than a hundred and hundreds more

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.280]
Stopped to show their support on Sunday as about 60 in jeans group hell of religious service neighbor Larry Matledge

[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.480]
fired his shotgun into the air twice

[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.600]
Sheriff deputies and secret service agents rushed to his house didn't the rest of the course

[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.140]
I am threatened nobody. I ain't important to got nobody MATLAID said this is Texas gosh dang

[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.080]
Madlet said he was initially sympathetic toward the demonstrators

[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.700]
But today blocked roads in the Iran caused traffic problems. He said he fired his gun in preparation for the dog hunting season

[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.460]
But when asked if he had another motive he said figure it out for yourself

[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.440]
She in 48 said she wasn't concerned with her own safety

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.300]
But is told others to be aware that this could get physical even though we're peaceful

[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.620]
I think we knew the risk when we came down here said she in of

[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.420]
Vacuville, California. I'm surprised we haven't had more of that since we're in bush country

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:13.620]
She and said she won't leave camp Casey until Bush meets with her and during her is month-long ranch visitors vacation

[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.280]
And she met with two top Bush administration officials on the first day of her protest

[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.220]
and of course

[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:24.600]
Al President say he's he's just got to get out with his life you understand that don't you? I do understand

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.180]
Yeah, in fact, here's that story. I don't think I do

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.660]
President Bush noting that lots of people want to talk to the president

[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:37.620]
And it's also important for me to go on with my life on Saturday defended as decision not to meet with the grieving mom of a soldier killed in a rack

[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.380]
Bush said he's aware of the anti-war sentiments of Cindy she and others who've joined her protest near the Bush ranch

[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.080]
But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else. Hey, where you at?

[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.860]
There's somebody's got something to say the president that's part of the job

[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.200]
Bush said on the ranch and I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive those who have something to say

[00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:00.600]
But he added it's also important for me to go on with my life to keep a balanced life. Oh my god

[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.680]
I have no life the comments came prior to a bike ride on the ranch with journalists and aids

[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:10.060]
It also came as the crowd of protesters grew in supporters. She and she arrived early in the week with about a half dozen supporters

[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.340]
As of Saturday there were about 300 anti-war protesters and about a hundred people supporting the Bush administration

[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.660]
In addition to the two-hour bike ride Bush's Saturday schedule included wait for the year this

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.700]
He's got more important things to do with them eat with that bitch all right

[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.660]
Saturday schedule through an evening literally baseball playoff game a lunch meeting with secretary

[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:34.720]
State condolese arise a nap some fishing and some reading like the weekly reader somebody read it to him

[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.060]
I think that people want the president to be in a position to make good crisp decision to stay healthy

[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.680]
He said when asked about bike riding while a grieving mom wanted to speak with him

[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.380]
And part of my being is to be outside of exercise exercising

[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.860]
I'm fried how about exercising your brain if you got one okay dumbbell

[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.900]
Fried a Bush's motorcade drilled by the protest side. I wrote to a Republican fundraising event at nearby ranch

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:02.540]
As Bush ruled by she and held a sign that said why do you make time for donors and not for me good questions in the no answer of course

Curb your Milton is Lomac enthusiasm. I think that was a good idea that ass Friday on our website and what we put it back on a

[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.560]
Beated curtain again. All right. I don't think it even needs to be on a beated curtain, right?

[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:50.280]
We don't have to have like you have to be over 18 look and ask that that not for now, I guess not yet

[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.460]
That'll be starting in November, but at any rate

[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.280]
Let's do that. We had like a half a dozen different asses on there and then we'll have like different choices

[00:43:59.180 --> 00:43:59.900]
ABCDE whatever

[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.600]
Including we can and we don't have to tell them whether it's a male or female ass. I mean you know generally

[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.080]
There's a pretty good difference, but not always for example

[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.200]
I picked you got a that Syrian broad right now. She easily could be a guy

[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.740]
Okay, I don't care what you say that

[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.780]
That's a guy and then we'll be like if you're in the turn then like on Monday. We'll give him the answer

[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.600]
Not a good idea keep him here over the weekend. We're gonna send us the vote on

[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.520]
See if they can recognize we'll give them like multiple ways, you know who's ass is this? That's what I just said now

[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.200]
What I just said, Jay did you say multiple choice?

[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.980]
New internet war I'm targeting windows a new internet virus targeting recently uncovered flaws in Microsoft

[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:41.680]
Croft's windows operating system is circulating on the internet and anti-hirus computer software makers say yesterday

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.240]
The zootop virus appeared shortly after the world's largest software maker warned of three newly found critical security flaws

[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.840]
And it's software last week but that bill gates man. What a long kid including one that could allow attackers to take complete control of a computer

[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.680]
Trend micro ink said that the worm exploits security holes in Microsoft's windows 95 98 and me and E

[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.760]
2000 xp platforms and can give computer attackers remote access to affected systems hundreds of infection reports

[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.420]
We're cited in the US and Germany Tokyo based trend micro said

[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.360]
But computer security engineers at Microsoft said that the worm is only targeting windows 2000

[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.020]
So far it's shown a very limited impact. We're not seeing any widespread impact to the internet's

[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.060]
But we remain vigilant said the Stephen Toulouse manager at Microsoft security response center

[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:33.400]
Stephen Toulouse lot tracks the latest virus drops a copy of itself into the windows system folder as botzor.exe

[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:39.640]
And modify the systems host file in the infected users computer to prevent the user from getting online assistance from anti-virus websites

[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.160]
The worm can also connect to a specific internet relay chat server

[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:49.260]
And give hackers remote control over affected systems which could be used to affect other unpatched machines and the network can slow down

[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.380]
Network performance since most users may not be aware of this newly announced security hole

[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.280]
So it's to install the necessary patch during last weekend

[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.640]
We can foresee more infections from worm

[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.220]
Zota but said

[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000]
Last to the Microsoft issued patches to fix fixed security flaws part of its monthly security bulletin the problem effect

[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.260]
The windows operating system and Microsoft's internet explorer web browser another good reason to use what you call a Firefox

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.700]
Right right? Absolutely. As if we need any extra reasons to be using Firefox and not that

[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:23.160]
Antiquated internet explorer that opens up the door for all of those pop-up guys and all of that crap

[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.780]
It's the only one thing I would agree with you about them at the capital hill blue.com. I love the website

[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.080]
in fact, I got

[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.900]
Doug Thompson's article today, which I'm going to get to eventually if I get around but

[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.580]
It's one of those websites that opened it has along with a lot of baggage in terms of pop-ups

[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:46.500]
Only one worse is the fudge report. Oh my god. You fare everything is always popping up and the ads too

[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.000]
You ever look at that? No, I don't ever good idea bad for your health

[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.320]
So Doug Thompson and the rant rights. I didn't wasn't going to use this now

[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:01.180]
But why not is bush out of control Doug Thompson's the founder of publisher capital hill blue.com a great website that

[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.060]
George resents bitterly for some reason because it's probably the pop-up ads

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.140]
By be leagered overworked white house aids enough drinks and they tell us

[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.040]
Sorted tale of an administration under siege be said by bitter staff in fighting and led by a man whose mood swings suggest

[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.840]
paranoia bordering on schizophrenia kind of like

[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.460]
Like that like the religious nuts like those crazy bastards dobbening there in

[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:29.160]
Good Gaza they describe a president whose public persona makes and masks an angry obscenity spouting man who be rates his staff

[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.240]
Unleash his tirades against those who disagree with him and ends meetings in the oval office would get out of here

[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.060]
Yes

[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:45.120]
In fact, it says George W. Bush's mood swings have become so drastic that white house emails often contain weather reports to warns of the

[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.220]
Presidents demeanor

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:51.960]
Com sees means bushes calm while tornado alert is awarding that he is p-oed at the world

[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.200]
decreasing job approval ratings and increased criticism within his own party drives the president's paranoia even higher

[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:04.120]
Bush in a meeting with senior advisors called Senate Majority Leader Bill frist a gd trader for opposing him on stem

[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.700]
Cell research there's real concern in the West Wing that the president is losing at a high level lead told me recently

[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:15.460]
He's losing it over here a year ago this website to discover the White House physician described and he depressants for Bush

[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:21.380]
The news came after revelations that the president's wide mood swings led some administration staffers about his sanity

[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:29.100]
I thought we were under that long time ago. Yeah on site all those EOP loyalists dismissed the reports as an anti-bush propaganda

[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.880]
The reports were later confirmed by prominent church walked in university psychiatrists

[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.420]
Dr. Justin Frank in his book Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president

[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:43.900]
Dr. Frank diagnosed the president as a paranoid megalomaniac and untreated alcoholic whose lifelong streak of

[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:49.860]
Satan's ranging from childhood pranks like using firecrackers to explode frogs to insulting journalists

[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:56.360]
floating over state executions and pumping his hand gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad showcases bushes and stability

[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:02.100]
I was really very unsettled by him and started watching everything he did and reading what he wrote and watching him on videotape

[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:09.280]
I felt he was disturbed Dr. Frank said he fits the profile of a former drinker whose alcoholism has been arrested but not treated

[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.580]
Dr. Frank's conclusion has been praised by other prominent psychiatrists including Dr. James Gronstine professor

[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:20.940]
UCLA Medical Center and Dr. Irving Yalom and the professor meritus at Stanford University Medical School

[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.520]
Oi

[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.080]
Dr. Frank's as a recovering alcoholics as Doug Thompson

[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.740]
Sober 11 years too much in nine days. I know all too well the symptoms that Dr. Frank describes and after watching

[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.820]
Bush for the past several years

[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.800]
I have to unfortunately agree with him

[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.640]
Conversations over the last few weeks with longtime friends who work in the Bush White House confirm even more

[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.520]
What Dr. Frank says and others have suggested the president of the United States is out of control

[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.100]
How long can the ship of state continue to sail with a madman at the helm

[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:55.060]
Like that I like that all right a madman at the helm sound like Q.A.M

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:02.100]
Fermanent when we ripped in bad boys out and hooked you with these bang and stuff whoopus

[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.200]
Check it

[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.080]
That is just over. I got a look

[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:15.420]
I think you can see we ripped out all them complicated instruments and whatnot and putting a 32 inch plasma monitor with

[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:23.260]
Houston we have a PlayStation that's all tonight on MTV consider that's reusable spacecraft

[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.620]
Roger I mean Roger's old foe's old

[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:36.240]
Oh God save us from all this crap. Please when you do it. Oh 1118 at 560 WQA. I'm here's a gene

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.220]
Rogers is becoming really chronic. You're a good guy gene but cut the crap

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:45.360]
He says how about Don I'mus for the pool and Wayne Heisenger and lastly Don King that sounds like three choices

[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.800]
But three good ones I would say especially Don King nice dude Don

[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.820]
And by the way Don where you at that dude Don Don the dude Ron Ron and that was uh

[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:59.820]
Let's see the crystals and in the Sean Cassidy the umptuous the talentless Sean Cassidy

[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.880]
Who I guess so always like uh lived in the shadow of his sister. I mean brother

[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.780]
There it is

[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.000]
By Sean no less now was that the dude Ron Ron Jeremy or somebody

[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.300]
So you do you know? No thanks

[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.640]
Maybe I'll do what you do on Ron. What do you think?

[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.300]
Okay, that's enough. Hey Sean

[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:20.960]
Ron

[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:28.040]
Get ready for World War three writes Paul Craig Roberts uh his website is anti-war.com by the way

[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.560]
You remember somebody said well when you read some of this stuff let us know where it's from okay

[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.840]
It's from neo-rogy's dot com too. It's already on her isn't it Josh

[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:44.660]
That's right. Get ready for WW3 with every post showing the majority of Americans both fed up with Bush's war against the raccan convince that Bush's invasion of Iraq has made Americans less safe

[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.480]
The White House moron proposes to start another war by attacking Iran

[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:55.060]
Vice President Cheney's already ordered the West Ritiju command to come up with plans to strike Iran with tactical nuclear weapons

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:02.040]
Bush refuses to meet with Cindy Sheen instead using his vacation time at the Crawford Ranch to talk war with Israeli television

[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.220]
In a recent interview with Israeli TV Bush said all options are on the table with regard to Iran

[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:12.260]
The kudnik israelis bushes last remaining ally or egg or on in his war against Islamic terrorism

[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.820]
Israel which is loaded with nuclear weapons and is not a signatory to the nuclear packs

[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:22.680]
Is the accused of against Iran asserting that Iran's nuclear energy program is just a veil behind which to produce weapons

[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:27.400]
Israel's the kud party fears that Iranian weapons would be a check to its plans to complete the

[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.720]
Dispossession of the Palestinians in a further expand israel's borders

[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:38.220]
Iran has sought the non-proliferation pact and is willing for the ia ae a to monitor the nuclear energy program

[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:42.660]
Bush how would dismiss all facts and assurances and is willing to attack Iran based on nothing but

[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.160]
Israel's paranoia

[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:50.640]
Bush can ignore the american public because the democrats like the Tory party in the UK have completely collapsed as an opposition party

[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.160]
Absolutely

[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.080]
The republican party is now increasingly referred to as the republic kud party

[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.600]
The only check on bushes the lack of US troops bogged down in the Iraqi quagmire

[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.700]
US commanders are stating that a third rotation of our exhausted and demoralized troops in Iraq

[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.660]
Can be avoided only by troop withdrawals next spring

[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:13.640]
However on obvious 11th Bush next the military's task of reducing US troops in Iraq the next day the commander of

[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:18.880]
US logistics and Iraq announced that the number of insurgent attacks on US forces along supply routes has doubled in the last year

[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.940]
Making it clear that far from winning the US is not even holding its own

[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:28.200]
Cindy sheen has the right question for Bush what noble causes being served by all the suffering and destruction

[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.980]
Bush isn't hiding from his machine because he knows only ignoble causes are being served

[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.280]
According to the CIA the main beneficiary of the war is Osama bin Laden's recruitment drives

[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:43.220]
While America's military recruitment falters in US generals announced that the war has broken the reserves and national guard

[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.460]
Because of his lamic extremism baskets in an Iraqi war

[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:51.500]
General reader do you realize the danger of having a president so disconnected from reality that he plots to attack Iran

[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:58.720]
A country three times the size of Iraq when he lacks sufficient forces to occupy Baghdad and to protect the roads from the Baghdad to the airport

[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:03.120]
Despite all high profile sweeps of US forces through insurgent strongholds

[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.780]
US commanders report a doubling of insurgent attacks

[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.360]
The Bush administration is insane if the American people don't be

[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.720]
Capitated by demanding Bush's impeachment the Bush administration will bring about Armageddon

[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.000]
This may please some Christian evangelicals conned by rapture predictions

[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.520]
But W.W.W.

[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:24.240]
Three will please nobody else because they always make it fun like I said last week of the Muslims and the the seven virgins

[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:29.320]
And all of this other craft and mortar them all the baloney. Well, what's the difference between the fundamentalist Christians?

[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:33.440]
Headgear. Oh, so it is it's a better get yourself some new smashes man

[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:38.480]
People are starting to see three are they're both Middle Eastern religions started to develop a big ugly bald spot

[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:44.100]
Well speaking of Middle Eastern religions, you know right there in the heart and a hotbed of all this stuff in Jerusalem

[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.980]
And with the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims all I can say that is oh

[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:53.680]
Cox a hoist cut the crap pick your poison pick your superstition pick your

[00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:00.100]
Mumbu jumbo and then you got those who are the ones that flagged away themselves with a change isn't that the in the far east

[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.300]
They do that and the Catholics do it in South America. Oh, that's right

[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:09.360]
They flagulate themselves with a change. They're flagulating right now and then and this is religion man

[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:15.820]
Focus, how can any of you people be so ignorant so stupid don't you have a brain? Oh, that's right. You listen to Q a

[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:21.040]
Mar forgot five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and they've arrived in singular wireless line

[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.220]
Come on Jim Sarni. Where's the results of that pull the way after wait for Friday?

[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:30.640]
So you can dummy it up a little bit doctor it up and put some like whipped cream in a cherry on it to try to like make it a little bit more appetizing

[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.620]
Is that what you're gonna do Sarni you lump

[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:39.540]
Yeah, I there are people I refer to as a lump you know, I mean by a lump. Yeah, I know you mean yeah, just a big or a lump

[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.580]

What do you got Pally?

[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.000]
Yeah, I know somebody Q. I. M. Hello

[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:57.860]
Yes, sir. I had a question. I guess I've been in the mac in the last few weeks. What happened with the whole car road thing?

[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.440]
What's what car road thing?

[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.180]
Yeah

[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:07.080]
More car road thing you know me Valerie claim when up here. Yeah, there we go. There we go. I don't know nothing about that

[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.600]
I like so off the face of the air though. That's right. Yeah, go ahead and important things

[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.960]
You know like the space shuttle and um the the runaway bride and then we got that missing chicken aruba

[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.340]
We got important stuff going on. Yeah, that sounds good chicken aruba. Oh three and a half more years of misery

[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.440]
We're gonna tell you good luck to you Pally. I'll see you at the border. Thank you, sir

[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.420]
See you around a I don't know the sun or shine. Here. It's very pleasant. It's like upper 70s lower 80s

[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.600]
Here, sir. Well, that's good. I'm happy for you. Please and only we don't have

[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.860]
Jeb Bushes or yeah, we got low humidity. It's real real. Yeah, we had some hot hot spell

[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:46.060]
But now things are lovely by the way speaking of Gaza speaking of those far-bison on both sides crazy people

[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:52.080]
I'm not gonna leave my house. I'm gonna tear it down. I'm gonna burn it down this mission nor Arabs living my house. I see

[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.780]
Huh sounds like they're really getting their act together and of course keep it mine

[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.340]
These are the extremists like I'm always telling you about the Israeli

[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.740]
I just I have a real problem with that whole thing

[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.220]
I have to give you a little bit of credit not too much a little bit of credit for because I thought I was being fairly objective about this like

[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:12.720]
Three four years ago and then I realized that my Jewish brainwashing even though it didn't hold on a religious grounds

[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:19.500]
I'm not the grounds that had like I looked with a jaundiced a junest eye we all did and then I realized that

[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:24.280]
You know they've had 38 years of occupying this territory. What how are they doing there? Okay? What are you doing there?

[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:30.900]
See just just by king it's an excuse to justify. Oh you see how they're reacting with a suicide bomb

[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.920]
We're crazy. So they're crazy too. I see well. You're all crazy. Anybody who wants to live there's got to be crazy

[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.540]
Oh, no, we're gonna go to a couple of some we're gonna then we're gonna kosher the house

[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.520]
Time to get it on

[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.260]
She's way

[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.160]
Yeah

[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.320]
Okay

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.620]
It's just me, holding craft me.

[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:38.900]
And she rags for her ex-sacces, she controls me.

[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:45.280]
And she's pampered so I may go out of the desk and watch no more.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.980]
What's like she's carrying a boll and wool between her thighs and thighs.

[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.460]
Welcome.

[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:57.040]
Funny, delicate, and beautiful.

[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.480]
And it seems always nice to me.

[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.460]
She's wiggling when she's hot.

[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.440]
But her voice has funny, delicate eyes.

[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.880]
We gave a short voice and checked voice.

[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:22.700]
Not just that, she's feeling wild and flashed.

[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.940]
She'll be wrenching back and smells just like the magic storm.

[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.420]
It's not a big cat.

[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.680]
What a voice, we've never seen before.

[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.600]
Not even on a bad day with funny, delicate eyes.

[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.120]
What a dumb patrachee from Iraq.

[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320]
Remember he used to be on a Joe Joni in Patrachee?

[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.180]
Oh no, Tony loves Patrachee.

[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.920]
It's 11.33 at 5.60 W.W.A.M.

[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.080]
A pickup truck tore through rows of white crosses last night near President Bush's ranch,

[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440]
where Cindy Sheen has been protesting to wear an Iraq.

[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.680]
The crosses stretched along the road at the Crawford, Texas camp.

[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.600]
Bore the names of fallen U.S. soldiers, nobody was heard.

[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.380]
And again, except the soldiers who were all dead.

[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.420]
Meanwhile, court documents revealed that Sheen's husband has found for divorce in California.

[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:11.920]
The couple were high school sweethearts, but Cindy says they separated because of the stress caused by the son's death.

[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.700]
And the public is like, who would look at that?

[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.160]
What's the next reality show?

[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.740]
I'm only going to give one to the Gadi show.

[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.740]
They're growing up Gadi.

[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.300]
Yes, growing up Gadi.

[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.100]
I saw about four seconds of that last night.

[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.020]
You know what I'm serving?

[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.100]
Why does an outstanding network like A&E put a pile of crap on like that?

[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.240]
Can you answer that?

[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.800]
And they think it'll make some money.

[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.160]
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.300]
Well, let's see.

[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.320]
I was watching on biography.

[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.080]
What a great channel.

[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.780]
Is that a biography?

[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.520]
I don't know.

[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.500]
I better not ask about that.

[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.240]
Not only can't we say anything in terms of language, but we can't say anything because we might offend some sponsor out there,

[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:52.200]
or somebody who might someday be a sponsor, or somebody who either is in business now, or was in business.

[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:59.200]
If I said that once upon a time, I got real bad gas eating at the famous 100 years ago, even though the restaurant was great.

[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.440]
I got real bad gas.

[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.100]
Oh, gee, they might come back someday.

[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.040]
You better watch it, you know.

[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.340]
We are your worst station.

[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.720]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.200]
We are your worst station for the New Millennium.

[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.000]
When in doubt, we always was out.

[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.780]
Just like that thing with the poll.

[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.880]
The first, the earlier poll they took in a sense, I don't remember that.

[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.260]
Oh, do you think about it?

[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:18.440]
Yes.

[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.540]
You know about your favorite sports talk station and your personalities and your audience.

[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.980]
How come they didn't put any midday people on there?

[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.740]
They always pretend that I don't exist, see?

[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.680]
We got these big, gigantic numbers and kick everybody's ass, including Rush.

[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:34.000]
In fact, speaking of Rush, I was just watching Darren Kagan on there momentarily,

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.060]
moments ago on CNN, they certainly didn't use that word.

[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:36.620]
Better you than me.

[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:42.100]
And I just can't, every time I see her, I can't stop thinking about the fact that he is ruling around on top of it.

[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.040]
Oh, she is just, oh, talk about on clean, oh.

[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.760]
There she is.

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.400]
It is segregated.

[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.420]
Oh, you and Rush are doing it.

[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.700]
You're like actually naked in the same place.

[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.080]
Oh, she's too thin.

[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.220]
And then the disgusting thought.

[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.940]
Oh, she's kind of attractive.

[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.680]
She's not bad.

[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.120]
But I know I looked at her now with four John-dust eyes every time I see her,

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160]
with Marty Feldman eyes.

[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:02.800]
He's a whore.

[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.140]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.960]
But now that you mention it.

[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.620]
Now, let's see, that's his third wife already, the apias hypocritical pill-poppin Rush.

[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.980]
That's always putting fingers at everybody else and about your perverts and degenerates.

[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.000]
That's his third wife.

[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600]
Well, at least he doesn't have sex out of wedlock.

[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.280]
You're right.

[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.060]
Right.

[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.560]
Martin and Fort Myers says, thank you for the great job you're doing.

[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.240]
I love your website and its content.

[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.220]
I usually spend about an hour if you did read most of those stories.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.560]
Thanks for the effort on that.

[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.100]
If you enjoy it, Martin, because all our audience most of them want to see our naked pictures.

[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.240]
They want to see ass.

[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.480]
They want to see boobies.

[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.980]
They want to see privates.

[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.160]
And they want to see ass.

[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:38.860]
Absolutely.

[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]
That's all they care about.

[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:46.220]
90% and 98% of the audience in America, that's all they give a crap about, is just because they're desperate.

[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:46.900]
I have no life.

[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.620]
It says, unfortunately, most of the listeners don't have that much time to read.

[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.520]
Or they're just too illiterate for them.

[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.040]
I'd like to recommend a great site called chomskytorrent.org.

[01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:01.240]
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're going to check that out, Martin, where they can download hundreds of politically very disturbing movies and documents.

[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:01.680]
Right.

[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:11.540]
I mean, judging from the fact that we had so many people watching the world according to Bush, which is still on our website for you to peruse, not to mention the other good stuff like all the other good ones.

[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.960]
Among others, you can find there the power of nightmares is an excellent quality.

[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.460]
Well, there you go.

[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.120]
That's on our website.

[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.800]
You don't have to go to chomskytorrent.org to find the power of nightmares.

[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.300]
It may not be the greatest quality.

[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.100]
You know, they won't watch it anyway, Martin.

[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.800]
Hope that you'll help to educate the rest of the nation.

[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.500]
I hope that will.

[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.720]
Whatever you say, Martin.

[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.880]
Your intentions are good, Martin, but you're naive.

[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.940]
Okay, you're farting into a wind storm.

[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.760]
You're just making a lot of noise and enjoying the sound of it yourself.

[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.840]
But unfortunately, like I said, good intentions.

[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.000]
You know what happens to those?

[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.960]
They go to hell on a hand casket, right?

[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:42.420]
Right.

[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.740]
Is really security forces clashed?

[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:44.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.900]
We hundreds of opponents of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip today arresting dozens of people

[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.180]
and the roughest confrontation between troops and settlers since the start of the operation

[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.180]
they were actually throwing stale halavod each other.

[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:56.820]
How do you like that?

[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.420]
They were throwing stale maca balls as weapons.

[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.480]
The confrontation came hours ahead of a midnight deadline for all of you as settlers

[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.580]
to leave the Gaza Strip voluntarily or face forcible removal.

[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.240]
Officials said they were hopeful many settlers would leave the area before the deadline,

[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:16.120]
but also we should a stern, a Howard Stern warning of tough action against anyone who resists.

[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.860]
We will make every effort the army and the police to have law and order in this process

[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:26.540]
and anyone who acts illegally be treated according to law and defense minister Sha'ul Mofas told a news conference.

[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.960]
Hey, Sha'ul, I wonder if he's kin to Ra'ul.

[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.180]
Probably is, what do you think?

[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:30.900]
It's close to it.

[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.560]
He said he expected at least half of Gaza's 8500 residents to be out by midnight.

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.920]
They could move to Brooklyn, nobody would even know they were there.

[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.100]
They could shift them all off to Brooklyn, right?

[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:39.600]
Right.

[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:46.680]
The army said security forces detained 50 Israelis for clashing with police and soldiers attempting to help Gaza settlers leave.

[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.220]
When a doubt gets a hell out, it could rock in back and forth.

[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.220]
You're making me nervous. I'm getting vertigo just watching it.

[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:52.460]

[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.660]
They're dominating way.

[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.520]
But we're going to have to be parable for it.

[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.140]
And the Muslims, they're throwing themselves on a carpet and they're rocking back and forth.

[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.920]
It's a rock and roll religion, baby.

[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.980]
That's what it's all about. They're all rockin' it over there.

[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.260]
Man, let me say it again.

[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.660]
Too bad we don't have more people on here in America talking about this and all around the world.

[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.660]
The religious people are the crazy people.

[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.180]
It's just a matter of degree.

[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.500]
Because generally speaking people are incredibly weak.

[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.940]
They're like sheep. They want to be led by the nose.

[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.260]
They want to be given some big strong and a dance.

[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.760]
My song of dance is better than your song of dance.

[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.700]
And you're going to burn in hell and you're going to rot.

[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.240]
Or you're going to go to heaven. You're going to get the seven virgins.

[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.820]
You're going to be up there with all the other glam.

[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.400]
The Jews are going to rot in all this other crap.

[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.360]
All this ugly and nasty and the bottom livid all is hate and evil.

[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.380]
And that's what it's all about.

[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.980]
Beside the money part, of course. That's the main thing.

[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.240]
So how's Roberto, what's his name doing?

[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.240]
The one who wants to.

[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:47.620]
Who?

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.300]
Roberto Baggio.

[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.820]
21 before the New York.

[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.500]
I thought he was a soccer player and turned to find out he was a Vatican banker.

[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.960]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.000]
This is 5.16.2.8.

[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:52.800]
Thank you, man. Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:52.800]

[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.980]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.320]

[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.320]

[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:54.400]

[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:54.400]

[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:54.400]

[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:54.480]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:54.480]

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:54.520]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.520]

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.720]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:54.760]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.180]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.240]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.460]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.240]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:24.600]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:24.840]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:24.840]

[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:24.980]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:24.980]

[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.360]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:25.760]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:25.800]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:25.800]

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:25.800]

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:25.800]

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:25.800]

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.320]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:26.580]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.180]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.180]

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:27.220]
Thank you, thank you.

[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:27.420]
Thank you?

[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:27.420]

[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:27.420]

[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:27.420]

[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.400]
Take your shirt.

[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:29.460]
els.

[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.140]
Jesus, why have you done a cross?

[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.480]
I'm dying out of the hand.

[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.740]
It's 11.45, 15 balloon at here.

[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.220]
He's in the station, W2A, and thank God for us, man.

[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.240]
Thank you.

[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:39.460]
God.

[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.540]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.180]
Uh-huh.

[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.560]
I want to bend over fire.

[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.300]
Like Ron Jeremy and double- Quandion.

[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.620]
And I've been over and kissed by Nikki.

[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.640]
Although I see Ron Jeremy.

[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.660]
He's not up to my speed.

[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.000]
I got 19 votes.

[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.260]
I'm going to pull this one.

[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:52.860]
You got 17 greys.

[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.220]
And you're a little idiot.

[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:59.460]
You've fat tuba hairy crap. He's got more hair on his back than most guys have on her head. Yeah, just ask Moe.

[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.500]
He'll clearly I beg your pardon including him. Especially now that I got my balls fun

[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.900]
Oh, I got this thing shaved so short and my hair too. It is so comfortable. Iraq MP Lee

[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:16.760]
Iraq. Yeah, let me try it again. Iraqi MP defends Lucifer. Sam Tung Tad has a story so amazing defending Lucifer

[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.480]
The devil looked in on Iraq's parliament last Wednesday when a member of parliament

[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:28.240]
operated Prime Minister Abraham Jeffari for speaking ill of Lucifer. I remember that show I love Lucifer. My favorite.

[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:34.700]
Cameron Karisayi, they Kurdish MP and a member of the Manority Yazidi community that worship the

[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:40.000]
peacock angel. Oh, yeah, that's my favorite angel is the peacock angel. They only watch us on NBC.

[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.380]
Also known as Lucifer angrily interrupted the Prime Minister during a parliamentary debate.

[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.920]
My Prime Minister and my ministers, my speaking out might seem strange to you but we feel insulted

[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.780]
When you repeatedly use the expression your speeches and statements

[01:12:52.780 --> 01:13:00.380]
God protects us from the devil each time the word is pronounced my colleagues turn toward me as if I were a representative of the devil

[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.820]
When's New Jersey going to make them change the name of the hockey team Josh just like in Tampa the devil raise

[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:11.000]
Oh my god, remember that thing to miss they head over there. Are they gonna have to mess with the the Indian teams and hockey?

[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.460]
Such as I don't know you tell me

[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:19.520]
Yazidi's followed a pre-Islamic religion which some believe was founded in the 12th century by Shikyuday bin

[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.380]
Musphial al-Mawi. Oh, he was my favorite

[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.540]
Shikyuday was he really like to be better than the Shikyuday of arabi although many scholars praised its origins to these

[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.380]
Erasper religion of Asian Persia

[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:36.480]
Shikyuday was born in Damascus was died in the town of La Lisi in northern Iraq where his children become the Yazidis

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:43.400]
Holy Ashrine. Oh man watch out for those Yazidis the community was still largely based in the foothills north of Iraq

[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:52.280]
It is just so ridiculous. It's so pathetic the community was still largely based in the foothills north of Iraq's main northern city of Mosul

[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.180]
And in the Sinjar mountains on the border with Syria watch out for those naked Syrians the women look like guys

[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:04.240]
But followers of the faith could be found throughout the Kurdish diaspora neighboring Syria and Turkey as well as the former

[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.220]
Soviet republics of Caucasus or in Germany and Britain

[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:17.760]
Syrians say there are 600,000 to 700,000 Kurdish Yazidis and they feel insulted whenever used that phrase and we call on those in position of authority to take a counter

[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:23.940]
There's another was cut the crap lucifer my ass the Yazidis did not believe in heavitor held in our regards Satan is evil in fact

[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:31.340]
They worshiped him but dare not say his name. Oh, no the love that dare not say its name. You know him saying gay. Oh

[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.900]
Three of Iraq's 275 MPs belonging to the sects his members did not marry outside the faith

[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:42.680]
There were also two Yazidis in the 111st-Seat regional Kurdish parliament and the course those Kurds want to have their way

[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.020]
Defaris is he meant no harm in using the expression common among Muslims

[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.700]
He said when we use this expression

[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.260]
It's not to insult you in a provoking minority

[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.140]
Even if religions are different all agree on the need to respect one another

[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.920]
No, we don't especially in this form our respect of other brothers is essential

[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.120]
But one must also respect the majority and the majority is Muslim a

[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.740]
Okay, so take your Yazidi and take your Satan and stick away to Mundo shine

[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.540]
Take your pitchfork and stick in right don't write all under that schmata you're wearing

[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:16.360]
I will say this the Iraqis are better dresses than the Saudis. Well, yeah, because they're mostly you know moderate

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:23.360]
Well, let me ask you this now the the Saudis do all of the Saudi citizens where they're just is that just the royal family the princes the

[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.820]
The royal family just wears fancier

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.680]
dresses while I like that ring around the forehead the those black

[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.380]
What do they call that now that's the whole the schmata in place right? That's right

[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.820]
Man you don't want to round the forehead you don't want it to blow off

[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:43.220]
Governor linked to a alleged girlfriend cover up poor Arnold man his approval rating is now down to 34%

[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:47.900]
Well, you know something the people of California deserve what they got in California you deserve him okay

[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.940]
We got you have pushed that's bad enough and the people of Florida deserve that

[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:57.660]
Anybody foolish enough to put that lying piece of crap in here again who helped with Catherine Harris to fix the 2000 election

[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.940]
And they be rewarded by reelected. Oh, we like jay. We like governor jay

[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.900]
Man must be that the great family. He's got that it

[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:13.600]
Those show those perverts to Clintons a thing or two or three governor shorths nager now faces allegations that hush money was paid to a woman to keep quiet about an affair

[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.840]
The two had years ago in the last few weeks

[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.720]
It's been a difficult time for the governor had to drop a multi-million dollar deal with muscle magazines after the public found out about them

[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.540]
It's now been alleged that the same publisher paid off woman to keep quiet about her relationship with shorths nager

[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:33.520]
It was the national inquire that first reported that shorths nager had a long-running extramarital affair with the young actress named

[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.800]
Gigi goi yet who I'm sure is no relation to Phil goi yet who used to play hockey for the Montreal convenience

[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.020]
But by the way speaking of Roberto Calvi

[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:47.160]
I was just thinking most of the people in America wouldn't know about Roberto Calvi from Nick Salvi who used to drive a pompino park and had a horse called the

[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.360]
Consolieri I wish you didn't know that did not

[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.740]
Two years later the inquirers published a negotiate in a multi-million dollar deal with shorths nager to make him an editor of muscle magazines

[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.040]
In fact the consolieri was in the race when niatross raced at pompino park

[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.720]
That's when the publisher also made a payoff to Gigi goi yet according to a report in the LA Times

[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.120]
Right after he announced the national inquirer went to Gigi goi yet and paid her 20 grand for her story

[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.480]
Se shorths nager vibre for Lawrence Lemur who documented the goi yet affair in his new book called fantastic

[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.000]
Nothing has ever appeared so it looks like I may have been a bribe

[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.160]
During the campaigns worked nager was forced to deal with allegations of sexual transgressions

[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.800]
I have behaved badly sometimes shorths nager been a during his candidacy

[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.200]
It's true that I was on route remember that rowdy movie said what does that mean rowdy?

[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.720]
Well, you don't have very rowdy

[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.220]
Yeah, even Linda Blair members kept in rowdy and I've done things that were not right. I apologize

[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.800]
He said oh boy

[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.660]
That that's the catch-off for everything I apologize

[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:48.340]
That's it no matter what it is the alleged payment to Gigi goi yet came exactly two days after shorths nager

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.640]
Announced this candidacy for governor at the same time was negotiating a deal with the publisher

[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.180]
Which would pay him a minimum of a million a year even after he was elected shorths nager terminated that business

[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:59.700]
He terminated it. What would you expect him to do?

[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.940]
But only after the public found out about it

[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.000]
When you do business with somebody you don't do negative things about them

[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.120]
Says lemur if he was going to be the executive editor of the muscle magazines

[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.060]
Then he expected that they wouldn't write negative things about his sex life

[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:17.140]
And that's exactly what happened exactly the news scandal comes at a time when shorths nagers trying to repair his image with the voters

[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:22.960]
It takes a notch down in his favorabilities for a surest of San Francisco political consultant Don Solum

[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.840]
I wonder if he's kind of down for in Chesco

[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.200]
It's bound to affect his favorability and it's bound to take it down

[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.540]
The recent scandal is taking a toll on the governor politically six months ago. He's approval rating

[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:39.280]
It was at 65% the figure has been cut about in half a bad sign for a governor who's trying to convince voters to support his

[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.420]
Initiatives in the special election the governor's office had no comment for CBS five in California

[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.520]
How do you like that?

[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.120]
Lier piece of crap and his wife don't have any chin, but she sure plays a mean chin ball

[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.960]
How's that pull come we're gonna make 400 hosts say or what what do you think oh yeah sure got 398

[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.440]
See if we we got a bunch of naked pictures of Britney Spears doing it with a moose today

[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.640]
I'll tell you that he is grotesque

[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.060]
But they may be like if the same maybe we would lie a little bit

[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:22.900]
Maybe there's something there don't meet the eye and he smells too does he really that's what ex-girlfriends have said oh

[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:28.740]

But

[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.360]
He is just

But he looks great in a row

[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.560]
The Democrats don't think he's just John Roberts

[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.580]
He won't pass their list. Miss John Roberts

[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.660]

The left wing will give him grief

[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.580]
Time to look inside the crease of John Roberts

[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.880]
If you think this will get meant to be

[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.940]
Just you wait to rent with size

[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.660]
John Roberts

[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.800]
He is pushing on

[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.600]
The John Roberts

[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.400]
Oh, it's clear that John Roberts I got a story a little bit

[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.880]
Roberts wrote in 1985 that memorial for fetuses was a good way to draw attention to the abortion tragedy

[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:14.080]
I just mentioned that in passing. Here's a really good one for the poor somebody facts then John Madden and you are

[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:19.020]
I have no life. Absolutely correct. I like that John Madden. He is really gruesome

[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.480]
I've mentioned fat

[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.140]
See one thing about some fat people

[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.100]
Now like me, I don't have a fat face. My fat is all from like my nipples to my thing

[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.900]
Yeah, see what I'm saying that thing there that thing

[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:39.260]
But some fat people got like like fat jowls like Hank has got a fat face, right?

[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:43.820]
And like John Madden his face is like you could slap it on Mount Rushmore

[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.040]
We just as big as the statue there. Oh, and I keep speaking about Rushmore

[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.340]
He's forgetting to buy you north by northwest. Oh, I forgot all about it. You carry grant and what's your name?

[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.380]

[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.940]
Even Marie Saint. Oh, okay. I mentioned there are 10 people I remember even Marie Saint

[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:06.240]
She was in on the waterfront with Carl Maldon and Marlon Brando. I think Jay Cobb

[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.440]
I remember even Marie Saint

[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.900]
Beautiful blonde, but anyway, so here's some good news swap shop emergency hearing canceled. Hey press in hand

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.200]
Yeah

[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.960]
Everybody call off Preston and say

[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:23.140]
He'll understand he'll probably relate to you probably answer

[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:29.080]
Like that and attorney for the Hanover family circus this morning canceled a request for an emergency hearing against

[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.960]
Swap shop owner Preston hand

[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:36.020]
David Berkerson said he pulled the injunction request which was said to be heard by a browser judge this Thursday

[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:41.580]
Because the Hanoverids have moved off the Swap shop property on west sunrise blow of our near Ford Lauderdale

[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:49.060]
The emergency requested asked the judge to keep him away from the Hanoverids as they try try to leave the Swap shop keep him away from us

[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.040]
He's like that

[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.060]
Hand order the circus off his land last week. See that's what happens when you hang around with Nick Navarro too much

[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.900]
Nick Navarro eventually lose your mind

[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:04.340]
Hand order the circus off his land last week citing contract and insurance disputes before the Hanoverids left

[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:09.920]
Hand Swap shop employees put mechanical boots on the circus vehicles and shut off power to the circus

[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.120]
Oh, it's kind of like Q.A. And it's a circus

[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.500]
Berkerson also filed a breach of contract lawsuit against him last week alleging that he owes the Hanoverids

[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:23.020]
thousands of dollars hand and his attorneys have 20 days to respawn that I'd complaint Berkerson said

[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.260]
I like that that Preston and his hand man

[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:31.020]
At the Swap shop and we like them a lot because they might come back to former sponsor of our disease

[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:35.500]
Do a remote appearances there and smell the elephant droppings and the sawdust all co-mingling

[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.460]
Man, it was just a beautiful thing

[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:41.960]
Hmm right in the middle of lunch hour. Okay. We got some Julio stuff about time

[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.720]
We need to have a lot more Julio stuff on the show. Well first we had that the plane crash in Venezuela

[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.860]
I don't think we have too many panatholines listening couple to your four maybe

[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:58.640]
Outed a majority of Hispanics born in the US don't think illegal Latino migrants should be given drivers licenses according to a brand new pool

[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.900]
I guess they didn't take that pool and date county though

[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:07.340]
No, that's no most foreign born Hispanics disagree according to polling for the pure Hispanic center foreign

[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.500]
Right, so you want to think about ethnics, you know, and I'm not talking about Hispanics necessarily but like

[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.640]
Certain ethnic groups like like people from India

[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:22.020]
Oh, which we have an enormous number here in Canada and like if they were born if they're like born in Canada

[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:28.620]
Mm-hmm as opposed to born in India generally speaking they tend to smell better. Okay. Well, I've checked it on all right

[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:34.200]
6 and 10 Hispanics born in this country and the same with Chinese now and there are some Chinese people born in China

[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.120]
We've got a very I don't know how to describe that funky smell. Do you know I'm talking about I've never smelled the Chinese oh geez

[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.620]
Chinese but like Chinese Canadians they smell really good like maple syrup mm-hmm

[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:52.780]
6 and 10 Hispanics born in this country approve of measures to prohibit illegal immigrants from getting drivers licenses right while 2 thirds born

[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:59.540]
What was that oh sorry? What what was that was it? Yeah, what was it? It was an outburst. I said that's right

[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:04.120]
No, no, it's not that was the brakes on some truck right outside. We're right out of the street out there

[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:04.860]
Wasn't you?

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:11.000]
Any well two thirds of Hispanics born in another country disapprove of such measures the difference between foreign born in

[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.200]
Hispanics and native born Hispanics on the drivers license issue highlights the disparity between the two groups on several issues

[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.560]
Foreign born Hispanics take a more positive view than native born Hispanics and whether immigrants strengthen the USA

[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:29.380]
Almost 9 and 10 foreign born Hispanics say immigrants strengthen the country while two thirds of Hispanics born in the US feel that way

[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:35.420]
Corn of the pool so 90% if they're like foreign born and only two thirds if they were born in the USA because they're under their

[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:36.080]
Old

[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.120]
Among Latinos in the US there's a much

[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.740]
well, what was that?

[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.080]
What was that for?

[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:50.020]
Stand aside like one of those stupid sports shows now where they drop in those in-ean things at the most inappropriate times

[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.400]
stupid sports shows

[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:58.060]
Two thirds of Hispanics in the US and undocumented migrants helped the economy by providing a low-cost labor

[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:03.120]
Again foreign born Hispanics were more upbeat about the impact of undocumented migrants than those born in the USA

[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.700]
Most Hispanics feel the number of immigrants coming into the country should stay the same or be reduced

[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:13.340]
With only a third say the numbers should increase coin to a pull-down for pew another pull-down for time magazine

[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:19.200]
Three fourths in a time pull a five hundred three Hispanic adults said people in the US illegally are taking jobs that

[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.420]
US citizens don't want the time pole was taken from July 28th to August 3th

[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.800]
Well, we got that really ferricon story on there too. I don't think I had printed that out

[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:31.360]
It's on our website today he agrees with that that they're taking jobs that blacks even blacks don't want

[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:36.840]
Most Hispanics feel the number of immigrants that see three fourths of a time pull where I just got through in it

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:43.120]
The pew study also looked at how Mexicans feel about trying to get in the US almost half of Mexicans or 46% surveyed in May

[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.780]
Said they would go to the US if they could while who that would want to live in Mexico

[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:51.120]
About a two and five said they'd be inclined to go live and work in the US without authorization

[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.940]
The desire to migrate is not a phenomenon of the poor and poorly educated

[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.540]
Zero said the inclination to migrate is powerful in the middle class in Mexico

[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:02.600]
Even those with college education they would say the bill. I would go to the rest of the good

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.500]
It reminds me of that scene in the godfather too, which I just told you I saw parts of I could mark the whole thing

[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:13.980]
Where but he's the announces that his position is no longer tentable right and he's getting his hall and ass

[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:18.820]
You know and everybody else gets up before even gets finished talking and they're all hall and ass

[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:21.640]
Yeah

[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.520]
Fredo come with me Fredo you'll be safe Fredo anyway out tonight

[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:29.800]
And then of course key lost the baby. Well

[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.880]
It wasn't a portion my portion Michael it was a boy

[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.840]
Yeah, that was great

[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:45.080]
And then you can just see the blood boiling in his eyes man just the forming of them all

[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.380]
Also speaking of Julios

[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:51.560]
Alberto Gonzalez George Lopez and surprised Jennifer Lopez

[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.240]
Our among time magazines 25 most influential Hispanics in America

[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:03.820]
Gonzalez the nation's first Hispanic attorney general was born in San Antonio, the Mexican immigrants who worked as migrant workers

[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:08.920]
When he was young he could be nominated for a position on the Supreme Court before president Bush's chairman's god forbid

[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:14.040]
The magazine notes in its August 22 edition that the former Texas Supreme Court justice has helped

[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.200]
Build a more muscular executive branch

[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:25.540]
Yeah, I think fascist is the word you're looking for kind of like Abu Garret that mentality there right another listmaker may have capital hill motivations

[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:29.660]
New Mexico governor Bill Richardson is widely seen as a future presidential contender

[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:32.280]
Time rights his name recognition may be low

[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.240]
In fact more people know Bobby Richardson than Bill Richardson

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.840]
But his resume is impressive

[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:42.260]
Impressive seven terms in the US house and faster than you went secretary of energy under Bill Clinton

[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:47.920]
And last year first Hispanic chairman of a national democratic convention time reports that funny man George Lopez

[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:54.820]
Who's George Lopez show has had a solid run since its debut in 2002 is one of only three Latinos who played lead roles in hit

[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.360]
Network sitcom starring Latinos

[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.200]
But who would be the other ones?

[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.020]
Rickia Riga Desiarnes

[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:06.040]
Okay, Chico with Chico in a man now what about that fruit cake on that 70 show?

[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:09.240]
We don't know what he is. Oh, I know what he is gay

[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.600]
JLo is a no-brainer from list of magazines says embodying the American dream of success through hard work ambition

[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:22.740]
No talent a big fat ass and the worst movies ever made after a summer hi-ek also made the summer hi-ek is a huliet

[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:30.280]
She's Mexican. Oh, no time rights. He plays the show bus game like a true scrimmage here dodging scrambling and tackling much bigger obstacles

[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.200]
Among the top 25 time Hispanics or Cuban Irish writer at least a bell does or Rodriguez

[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.180]
Never trust anybody who's name engine Z right

[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.060]
Cuban American Senator Mel Martinez see and Mexican American filmmaker Roberto Rodriguez

[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.740]
The head is

[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.500]
5 6 7. How's Orlando doing anybody seeing him?

[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.380]
He even played the court one all the time now because Orlando he shined us

[01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:02.940]
Yeah, one thing about Orlando. He got married long before this whole game merged thing got going, you know, did he pretty proud of him for that

[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.920]
5 6 7 see there's no calls on here because in about 30 seconds

[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.800]
You know, as soon as I give the numbers out or maybe not I don't really care

[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:13.140]
Because when we're doing these only these two show a week this summer schedule

[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.420]
I always have myself a big pile remember I was you heard me forming my pile this morning. Yes, I think before the show

[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.920]
Yeah, always a good idea when you sit down here to have a huge pile because if you count on the audience out there

[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.960]
They're busy, you know, they're busy diving mosquitoes and

[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:30.680]
Looking on a weather map to see if there's any hurricanes coming trying to breathe

[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.400]
They're waiting to see if the South Florida's ever going to have another NFL football team

[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:39.460]
See we shouldn't be one of those promos saying we're the dolphin station like because quite frankly

[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:44.260]
We should be proud to say hey, we are no longer the dolphin station and pretty pleased about it and you ought to be too

[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.560]
And by the way Jimmy you're fairy w-q-a-m. Hello

[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.620]
Never did get that final up hole from Jim Sarni. I'm sure he's probably gonna fix it over any minutes

[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:57.160]
w-q-a-m. Hello, hey, the hell yes, sir. Hey, man. How about Elvis?

[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:02.280]
Frankly, he was a dirty racist and I hope he rot in hell forever. Yeah, yeah, he was real ugly

[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:03.480]
Ah

[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.560]

Fred Gwynn. I mean I mean

[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:16.400]
Fred Gwynn, he was really right. He was even not really then John Kerry right all of he ran better

[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.160]
Fred Gwynn for the early guy. He's dead, isn't he? Yeah, yeah

[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:26.060]
In fact, I saw thing on the biography they had to show about you know every now and then they'll do like a program on a show

[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.980]
It's supposed to just one person like they did the Brady bunch

[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:38.620]
Yeah, and they did the thing on uh, I don't think they ever mentioned about what's his name grandpa al Lewis? What about him that he's not right?

[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:43.380]
He's so he's so out, you know, he was on with Howard all those eight million times and was I'm gonna

[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.300]
Yeah, al Lewis grandpa

[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:51.260]
In fact, he was even worse than the grandpa on my three sons now. Let's see

[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:51.700]
And Fred

[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.980]
William Frawley he was the second one. Wasn't he correct? First one second Uncle Charlie

[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.080]
I mean he was also on I love loosely William Frawley. He played Fred Mertz

[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.180]
But who was the first Uncle Charlie on my three sons? I'll get out to look it up

[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:08.440]
And what's his name was doing Ferra Fossey supposedly the one

[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.560]
I like from that show what that was his name Rob. I don't know. Come on. You can do it. You know his name Don Grady

[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.580]
There you go from the Grady bunch

[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.620]
Why should I like to see that Grady bunch?

Don't tell

[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:49.600]
I got me a tumor with as big as a whale and they say that they can fix it with some stem cells

[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:57.020]
Right now I'm lightheaded. I feel kind of funny. So hurry up and get that funding money

[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.940]
Super little

[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:02.220]

[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.240]
Yeah

[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:19.280]
All

[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.680]
There

[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.820]
No one to make a wish

[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.720]
Turning to a liver

[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.520]
Turning to a heart of hell

[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.500]
Turning to a kidney

[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.380]
Do it all with stem and cell

[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.200]
Oh it's stem and cell

[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.580]
It's a clever little bell that

[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:52.640]
We cast part of it forever

[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.140]
Stem cells, baby

[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:59.880]
The stem cells are where it has us

[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.340]
Placing and adducing

[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.220]
I can't act away from it

[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:04.540]
Save them and your freezer

[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:06.380]
You can be an old geezer

[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.340]
My illness is tragic

[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:11.460]
But stem cells are magic

[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.680]
So everybody pass them around

[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.580]
And around and around

[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.160]
And around and around

[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.860]
And stem cells, baby stem cells

[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.480]
You fed us governorses

[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.640]
Always choose life

[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.900]
Choose life like Terry Anders

[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.820]
You're right

[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.420]
As opposed to all those people innocent people dying over in Iraq

[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.160]
But then again it was worth it

[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.060]
They should have attacked us

[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.880]
You made a bad mistake about that

[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.920]
You should not know your my three sons stuff

[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:36.420]
What?

[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.560]
Because somebody faccess the cast

[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.060]
And the dates they were on the show

[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.540]
And you were absolutely

[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:43.580]
Incorrector

[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.020]
What him probably was

[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.460]
Bub, he was Gramps

[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.080]
1960 to 65

[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.260]
And then he had the nerve to croak

[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:52.680]
I printed that up by the way

[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.300]
So you're like showing up your own mistake

[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.480]
Well you corrected your bad, bad error

[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.360]
My bad, what do I know about that chef

[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.000]
Evidently something to me

[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.480]
You know the name is a lot of people on it

[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.520]
Fred McMurray

[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.880]
From the T9 mutiny

[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.920]
William Demarest was Uncle Charlie

[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.640]
From the 65 to the 72 after

[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.000]
William Crawley

[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.100]
Fred Mertz or Fred and Ethel Mertz Faman

[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:13.780]
I love loosely

[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:16.740]
You went to the big sitcom in the sky

[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.840]
He's dead, he's riding in a box

[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.320]
Just like what's your name?

[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.360]
Just like what's your name?

[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.260]
Sister Ron Passions

[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:25.420]
I can't even think of her name now

[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.060]
That idiot

[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.280]
What you watch that show?

[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.800]
Oh yeah, what's her name?

[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.300]
Very Livingston Stanley Livingston now

[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.540]
Were they like related chip and Ernie?

[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.800]
They were both very ugly

[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.720]
And Tim Constan was even uglier

[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:39.940]
And the character he planned was Mike Douglas

[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.380]
Oh my god

[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:43.300]
Ever to Mike Douglas show? I sure hope not

[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:43.540]
Nope

[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:47.760]
Oh, I speak of that, I gotta go in with my panel and fight you won't believe this

[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.440]
I actually believe it because he already saw

[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.720]
I put it on our website if he read it

[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.240]
He may not even just slap it on there

[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.000]
Oh, it's some of the worst news ever if it's true

[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.740]
It may not be true, it may just be a

[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.760]
Switchful thinking

[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.720]
Oh, the story about Dick Clark, can you see that?

[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:01.940]
No, I didn't

[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:04.340]
Oh good, no wonder you sound like you're gonna hear this

[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.160]
Dick Clark, now guess who's gonna co-host

[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.960]
The 34th edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rock and Eve

[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.380]
Live from New York Times Square December 31st of the

[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.720]
Lids Ryan Seacrest

[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.460]
Oh, oh

[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.380]
Two good reasons not to watch

[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.620]
Clark 75 has been recovering at his Malibu home from a December 6th stroke

[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.220]
He's doing really well

[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.260]
Card Publis's Paul Schreffer and said Monday

[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.020]
He's walking, he's talking

[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.420]
He's living a fairly normal life

[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.300]
Every now and then he has like a wild bomb movement

[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.640]
Wow, the long time host of American bandstand

[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.200]
Hasn't appeared on TV or done interviews since his stroke

[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.600]
And according to the inquire, he was like a vegetable, like a cucumber, like a rutabaga

[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:47.000]
Last year, daytime talk host Regis Filben stood in while Clark watched him as hospital

[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.460]
But you know, I like Regis but you know, I'm talking about over-exposed

[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.740]
I mean, enough already Regis, you know what I'm saying?

[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.340]
Yeah, it's like he's everywhere

[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:57.360]
Pretty soon he'll be like the next Burke Parks

[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.160]
He just wants to find tuna before he sticks his head out, it makes his return to TV

[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.520]
Oh, he's like a turtle, he don't want to stick his head out yet

[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.120]
Said, Chef Rinders refused to discuss the impact of what he would own and describe as a minor stroke

[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.820]
But he inquire, said he had a second stroke and he was like a vegetable

[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.400]
Clark said in the statement, it'll be good to be back in New York again for new years

[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.240]
And I'm elated that Ryan has agreed to join me in ushering in the years

[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.960]
Seacrest, host of American Idol, in a real jackass, a real ice hole

[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.880]
And agreed to a multi-year deal with executive producer and joint clerk as co-host of the ABC special

[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.920]
I wouldn't time too far ahead, Ryan. Seacrest will eventually take over his host

[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:38.060]
Dick Clark is an American icon, I'm honored that he's interested in me with such a role in this national tradition, see Chris said

[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:39.360]
And that bad news

[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.520]
Wow, I don't believe it

[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.920]
Maybe they'll just wheel him up like a lump on a chair like they did with Kate Smith at one time

[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.800]
I don't want that crap

[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.000]
She was about to size your fist and they wheeled her on stage and in a wheelchair

[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.940]
And it was like a lump on a chair

[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:03.760]
Now why couldn't they let her just go out and then leave us the image of the fat, robust God was America

[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.960]
You know, like they played that thing in Philadelphia at the fliers games

[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.940]
Fliers, they Bobby Clark, you jackass

[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.880]
Here's a fact that says put any cap on your pool

[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.820]
He's kind of an ugly guy, he's got a face for radio

[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:20.680]
Look at that, he definitely has a face made for radio

[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.160]
Have you seen this picture on a Q&A website?

[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.140]
No, but I've seen him in person more than once, it is not a pretty picture

[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.520]
Also, can you please announce what are you going back to five days?

[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:35.540]
Much too soon on Monday, September 12th, not that I'm not that I have the mind, you know, in my mind, not that I'm counting the days

[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.940]
Going too fast, just zooming by

[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:45.940]
Busy, oh by the way, when I race with B Farber Dropping, the concert area was a second, and the betting interest in I Frost

[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.460]
Just in case my good friend Dick Feinberg was like, hey, Dick, how's our slots, Colin Baby?

[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:57.140]
Man, you see, one thing in Florida, they have nobody to blame themselves because they should know that they're going to get scammed by the government legislature

[01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:01.640]
They should have put it there and they're in Braille, indelible writing, I mean, every detail, you know what I'm saying?

[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:07.960]
What do you say? I'm saying that they screwed up bad, and now you don't have your slots, you can't go there and lose all your money right now

[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.720]
Which is a shame, I bet you Josh would be there right now playing Wheeler Fortune

[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.100]
Yeah, come in on me, I bet you Carlos would be there up from out front, you know what he'd be playing?

[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.780]
Bye bye, aiming!

[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.360]
Sevens!

[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.600]
I think they named that game after her

[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.080]
You like garlic?

[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.400]
Yeah, people tend to love garlic or hate it, but few probably associate it with pain

[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.680]
I guess it all depends on where it's, you stick it, it burns

[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.760]
Nonetheless, it turns out that pain-sensing nerves respawn at the suffer-based chemicals in garlic

[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:44.400]
Indeed, the same mechanism the body uses to react to the sharpness of chili peppers and spicy cutiments like mustard

[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:51.720]
And wasabi is the one that detects all the cordial study in two states proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.360]
A tibetoo illiteracy, where you at?

[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:00.700]
David Julius, oh I sure love his orange Julius, David Julius is the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology

[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:06.240]
at the University of California San Francisco said the finding was made during research on the mechanisms of pain sensation

[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:12.580]
Julius discovered that when a subset of pain neurons in rats activates a cell membrane channel called TRPA1

[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:16.820]
The result is a release of brain chemicals that stimulate blood vessel, dilation and inflammation

[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.680]
Understanding how such nerves work, he said, can help researchers learn more about how arthritis and some muscular problems develop

[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.820]
Like your bad back.

[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.800]
You can use, in fact maybe just smear some garlic on it

[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:32.160]
Okay, but in use of natural products it's very interesting from a pharmacological probes of the pain pathways

[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.260]
Julius said whatever that means, Susan Traver is no relation to Mary Traver as a Peter Polen Mary of Ohio State University said

[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:41.420]
The most interesting, maybe she's a kid of Randy Traver but I hope not

[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:47.400]
Said the most interesting finding of the papers that the neurons that respond to garlic compounds are only a subset of those that respond to

[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:50.620]
Capacacin and hot peppers that high say that?

[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:55.960]
This type of specificity would give some basis for why people can't tell the compounds the parts of Traver's

[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:58.060]
Who is not part of Julius's research team

[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:02.500]
Garlic sometimes called the stinking rose or they pick it on Joe again

[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.700]
Garlic sometimes called the stinking rose, belongs to you ever heard of that?

[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.000]
Yeah, I never did.

[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.900]
Along to the group of plants called Alium which also includes onions, leeks, oh there's nothing like a good leak

[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.100]
Chives and shallots, remember Jean Shallot with the big gamostash?

[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:20.460]
All of them produce self-rebased compounds that make them pungent, one called Allison

[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:25.480]
I thought he sat with the leafs, activates the set of pain sensors and is especially prominent in garlic

[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.660]
In addition to its culinary properties, garlic has a long history of use in folk medicine

[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:34.180]
Having been used to treat such ailments as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, even blood clots

[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:36.420]
Even bumble, even blood clots

[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:43.060]
Capsacean, the chemical that gives out peppers, their heat is currently a major ingredient in the cream for our threat of suffer

[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.080]
It's one thing about Thai food, I like Thai food a lot

[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.200]
But every now and then you're eating Thai food and you'll see one of those real hot peppers like one of them red ones sitting in there

[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.460]
Yeah, I don't like Thai food much

[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.240]
Really?

[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.560]
Peanuts, a lot of peanuts

[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.120]
No, not a lot of dishes don't have peanuts, but almost all of them, no matter even if they're not real spicy

[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.160]
They have the little red, whatever those are

[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.160]
They have to like, shmure them off to the side

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:12.400]
476 votes, we got a real shot at 600 if Joshua just putting his pedal to the metal here, just lean on it

[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.760]
Alright, I'm leaning on it, like Bill Wither said, lean on it

[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:17.160]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.280]
This is 516 QAS

[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:33.220]
Come Mr. DJ's up on the freeway

[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.700]
Mr. DJ's the traffic jam and I'll hold the torch on the highway

[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.000]
It's going nowhere

[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.240]
I'm Mr. DJ, won't you tell us what is up

[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.900]
Come Mr. DJ's the fun the freeway

[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:46.380]
Mr. DJ's the traffic jam and I'll hold the torch on the highway

[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.720]
It's going nowhere

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.920]
I'm Mr. DJ, won't you tell us what is up

[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.420]
It's some third of bumper and wheel to wheel

[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.760]
The traffic green part so I can learn how to deal

[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.300]
Let's go, gotta know why we're going so slow

[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.740]
It's a parking lot and I can take it no more

[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.300]
Back up, back up, everything's back up

[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.800]
It's a crack, crack up when they're gonna clear up

[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.360]
I'm a shit I've taken on the roof

[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.900]
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm gonna get the fool

[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.320]
When I'm new, say yeah

[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.640]
When it ever in the fool, say yeah

[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:16.680]
Well I'm ready for it, tell me about it

[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.220]
And I'm voice up, fool, tell me when we're gonna move

[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:21.720]
Come Mr. DJ's the fun the freeway

[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.160]
Mr. DJ's the traffic jam and I'll hold the torch on the highway

[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.460]
I ain't going nowhere

[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.420]
I'm Mr. DJ, won't you tell us what is up

[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.420]
It's a good machine mine, it's 1232 to 560 to WQI am

[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.640]
Here's Ed and four Lauderdale says

[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.900]
Speaking of the Murr v. Gryffindjo, who was ugly with an Archer, Arthor Treacher

[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:41.000]
And I never cared for his fast food joint anyway

[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.280]
They're out of business long since

[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.940]
Don't get all panicky over there

[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.200]
Who's that sales manager, what's his name or sales manager

[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.560]
I don't even know what his name is any Curtis

[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.900]
Arthor Treacher, you got it?

[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.280]
I don't think too many people remember him

[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.100]
And somebody says, where's Limbaugh Bob and four Lauderdale?

[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.560]
Hey Bob, I hate to break the news to you

[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.860]
But we hate worse like boys and girls

[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:00.560]
But he's not even, he's not in the same league with these other people

[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.640]
Like me, right?

[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.100]
Well, you're about to say?

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.060]
No, I'm a lot older than he is in front of it

[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.080]
Non-descript, on the outside, not on the inside

[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.060]
Though I'm beautiful on the inside, I love those

[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.980]
It's like Shirley Tweeters and Tony Fields

[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.600]
Oh, fat is so beautiful

[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.040]
No, it's not, fat is grotesque

[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.180]
Just think of her, Ron Jeremy with all his clothes on

[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.260]
I've never seen it, you've already seen it

[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:23.320]
Oh, yeah, sorry to do that to the middle of a lunch hour

[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.140]
Lee Stalvesbury writes from a website called Visited and Voice

[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.080]
Fundamentalist Christianity, a dangerous force when it denies rational scientific thinking

[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.300]
Oh, this sounds like the kind of thing I'm going to read now

[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.820]
Good, he's founder of the Critical Thinking Club of Minnesota

[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.300]
And a former evangelical preacher

[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.120]
Former being the operative word

[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.400]
He's seen the light

[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.060]
In fact, maybe he even bought the flavor wave to look seven

[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:48.060]
Which I'm sure you guys are using like I am just about every day

[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.040]
Early day

[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.760]
Yeah, I mean, what's not to like, that thing is so great

[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.000]
Alan, what kind of light is it?

[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:55.400]
How would you?

[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.180]
How would you light? When I think it's not going to last forever, obviously

[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:01.280]
But when it burns out, I'll buy everybody a new one

[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.980]
No, not seriously, I just love that thing

[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:03.840]
Nothing is so great

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.760]
He writes religious leaders hate rival sources of authority

[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.040]
18th century European enlightenment thinking

[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.320]
With its concept of rationalism and science

[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.860]
Provided religious authoritarianism with that rival

[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.280]
America's founding fathers, products of the enlightenment

[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:18.800]
Had the audacity to effectively say to Christianity

[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.400]
Worship while you want, but our constitution doesn't need your influence

[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.260]
Roman Catholic traditionalist and Protestant Christian Bible-based fundamentalist

[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:28.320]
Still seeded over this rejection

[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:32.060]
Then as now, Zalus Catholics and Protestants claim to speak for God

[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:35.520]
Versus enlightenment thinkers who boldly experiment with new ideas

[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.280]
Independent of Christian dogma

[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.040]
Today's clergy shudder if their members hear the Thomas Edison's of this world

[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.980]
His invention, catapulted American to prosperity

[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:45.760]
Explain as he did that religion is all bunk

[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.940]
The June 22nd International Hero Tribune carried an article by Peter Watson

[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.800]
Infettled the price of fundamentalism

[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:56.240]
It made highly pessimistic observations about nations under the influence of religious fundamentalism

[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.180]
And America's the present trends

[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:03.060]
Religious fundamentalism in Israel, the Roman Empire, China and the Islamic world

[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.520]
Had very destructive results

[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:10.700]
Israel BCE was consumed with religious zealotry and alienated itself from its surrounding Greek and Roman civilizations

[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.940]
Israel zeal for God got its reward in the 70s

[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.840]
The Romans annihilated Israel

[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.920]
The Roman Empire is unlikely to rise, came three centuries later

[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.400]
Edward Gibbon authored the decline of fall of the Roman Empire, laying his Romans falling apart on the ascendancy of Christianity

[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:31.600]
Buddhist fundamentalism in China resulted in centuries of chaos until the 9th century when the Song Renaissance restored the Chinese civilization

[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.000]
Islam's early success was spectacular

[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.180]
It produced many intellectuals and scientists until fundamentalism gained the upper hand in the late 11th century

[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.020]
leading to a millennium of backwardness which still afflicts the Islamic world

[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:47.380]
Christian fundamentalism has gained political ascendancy in America under President Bush

[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.900]
Science takes a vaccine to his right wing religious ideologues

[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:57.220]
In August 2003 the government reform committee in the US House assessed the treatment of science and scientists by the Bush administration

[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:06.160]
The report politics and science in the Bush administration found many instances where the administration manipulated a scientific process and disturbed or suppressed scientific findings

[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:13.800]
Former President George Herbert Walker Bush a decade earlier stated now more than ever on issues ranging from climate change to AIDS research

[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.640]
Government relies on the impartial perspective of science for guidance

[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:26.080]
The current Bush administration has skewed this impartial perspective generating unprecedented criticism from the scientific community and prominent Republicans who once lived federal agencies

[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:32.740]
In February the new scientists reported a survey in which fully half the science is working for the US Fish and Wildlife Service

[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:37.360]
So they've been pushed to change or withdraw scientific findings for political reasons

[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:44.160]
Fundamentalism's anti science attitude pervade society the science journal physical review reported in May 2004

[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.740]
That scientific papers published by West European authors exceeded those by US authors in 2003

[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:53.040]
In 1983 there were three American authors for everyone West European

[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.200]
The percentage of patents and I say patience whatever patents

[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:06.140]
The percentage of patents granted to American scientists has been falling since 1980 from 60.2% of the world's total to 51.8%

[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:10.100]
Falling faster than that number for Jimmy Cifalus and Joe Rose on the Sun Sentinel poll

[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:18.740]
In 1989 America trained the same number of science and engineering PhDs as Britain, Germany and France combined in 2004 the US is 5% behind

[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:27.940]
European scientists now lot number American scientists and citations awarded America is behind in cloning and stem cell research now led by South Korean Italian and British scientists

[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:34.180]
American fundamentalists seek to outlaw stem cell research on the arbitrary and totally improving premise that life begins a conception

[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:40.680]
A recent concept contrary to the teaching of St. Augustine and the allegedly infallible Roman papacy for some 1500 years

[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:49.480]
Fundamentalists use religious pretext against scientific and cultural objections religious sounding bumper sticker like rationality is usually sufficient to corralled the client followers

[01:51:49.480 --> 01:52:02.200]
Fundamentalism dictates on issues are arbitrary and cleverly manipulated to appeal to the emotions of voters whether the issue was evolution, game mirage, stem cell research, abortion, euthanasia or the environment the strategy is the same

[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:15.340]
President Bush's recent endorsement of teaching intelligence design perpetuates the same denial of science ID proponents have never had an article on ID published in any peer reviewed scientific journal they don't conduct experiments they would prove or falsify their hypothesis

[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:20.300]
Their religious conjecture under the guise of science makes no useful predictions nor can they model it mathematically

[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:26.240]
There are no research labs doing intelligent design science because intelligence design is not science it's religion

[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:36.240]
Those who can't learn from history are doomed to repeat it is a profound quote by philosopher George Santiana we used to be fearful that communism might bring America down history and current trends show the fruit of Christian fundamentalism

[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:44.240]
It's a far more insurious enemy it's seducing its gullible adherence with idle threats and false promises religious fundamentalist objectives have never changed

[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:50.800]
They seek vindication for their rejection and want Americans of beacons under George Bush it looks like history is repeating itself

[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:57.500]
They'll gladly need our lead our nation down fundamentalism proven path of destruction all the name of their God which unfortunately is not

[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:03.820]
They'll God this is meal Rogers this is 516

[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:05.600]
Q a F

[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.020]
It's day if I am what can I say how do you like that?

[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:14.020]
Oh

[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:44.020]
Oh

[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:31.880]
Oh

[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.540]
Don't forget we got the mole my steer mole how are you David at tubeless afternoon?

[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:43.440]
I'm not a man dog and then Marlon's baseball San Diego Padres what's the reason for that franchise still being around what do you mean?

[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.920]
Although actually they had they were after a great start are they still in first place in the division?

[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:57.580]
Well, I mean they're division sucks so that's why I just don't understand what the San Diego Padres the San Diego Chargers they just that market just has no reason to have any sports franchise

[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:02.660]
I mean I know the Padres in 84 won the National League of Pennant because they beat the Cubs

[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:11.880]
Cubs blew it but other than that and one was last time the Padres had a good year not that long go right I mean they're pretty good you know no they're not they're just a

[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:18.920]
It's just a fan in the sports market like Carolina you know same thing Carolina Carolina panthers my ass Carolina hurricanes my ass

[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:25.680]
You know something have to use other people's nicknames next thing to be like the Carolina Seminole's not anymore well

[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:35.860]
I once FSU has to drop it thank God that Jeff Bush is involved in important issues like nicknames of college sports teams and Terry and her cute thank God at your fat ass

[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:44.980]
Governor's involved in that speaking of crooks like your fat ass governor Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff accused of federal fraud charges and a casino fleet purchase deal

[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:50.540]
The Sun Sentinel just reporting this is wanting to admit to an interview with foreign investigators trying to solve the ganglion

[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:58.460]
Stan Stammerder of the businessman who sold the boats his attorney Neil Sonnet oh God being his bonnet it's old Neil Sonnet

[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:06.260]
Do you know he used to have a talk show and W. Just news years ago no and he also was on channel six he was on like one of those point counterpoint kind of stupid ass shows

[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:11.360]
With Mike Thompson on the far right in him on the far left old red headed Neil Sonnet boy he's an ugly guy

[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:18.600]
The lawyer Neil Sonnet said after a brief scheduled hearing oh I got another one oh man that we left off the pool speaking of old time radio people

[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:26.620]
Stan Major he makes me look like Brad Pitt you're gonna put him on it or do it now do you know Stan do I know Stan

[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:33.740]
Right remember Stan was the one that takes credit for introducing us as it were really suggesting you to or me to you whatever it was

[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:39.600]
Yeah I work with Stan many many many oh my God and you know just exactly how grotesque he is he's like a gnome

[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:47.660]
The lawyer Neil Sonnet said after a brief scheduled hearing in federal court that Abraham off had expected to meet with four Lauderdale homicide

[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:56.080]
He took for sure after the February 2001 style slaying of Constantino's Gus Bullis the interview never happened Sonnet said now four Lauderdale

[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:02.680]
It's actually expressing new interest in talking with Abraham off if they want a few Mr. Abraham interview him I'd certainly be willing to set that up son

[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:08.040]
It said he's always willing to cooperate well how do you like that funny that should happen because I just got through saying

[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:14.880]
The life story of Louis Lepke and also Joe Velachi I love that when a biography channel has the

[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:22.120]
Bographies of the different like their goddy and all the different gangsters my attacks and they generally do it like side by each back to back I love that

[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:27.000]
Big Sandy Montana not before the show I told you about this story you said you've been there or you know where it is

Toads on you a people I love that movie Magnolia each your hearts even though George hates it thousands of

[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:04.000]
Quarter size toads have invaded this north central Montana farming community causing slippery streets and raising the entrepreneurial

[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.160]
Spirits of some peoples the toads started showing up in the southeast portion of town in the past couple of weeks I have no idea how many

Thousands of toads are in town said Charlie Fussar at times you just about can't take a step I've been toad Karen

[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:06.500]
Larry office chief of the volunteer fire department said the toads seem to be migrating from east to west and believes they'll soon be on their way

[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:13.280]
It was just two years ago the town streets were blocked by ten foot drift of tumbleweeds firefighters had to hold the tumbleweeds way and burn them

[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.800]
The tumbleweeds were a hazard of said the toads are just a nuisance

The tragedy of a Bosch and what was that guys name it was I need to press bill dillman role he was not there all

I can't understand what you're talking about your son I understand it's hard for you to talk to you son about the details of this case

[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:18.800]
Why is that not see you just read it he just has no voice right she's on MSNBC now and they bumped up mother Tucker Carlson

[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:22.320]
Like 11 o'clock when everybody's going to bed I mean get serious

[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:29.460]
It's the rest of us feel real she can't speak I mean it makes you nervous watching and listening even for like 10 seconds like I don't have to

[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:36.740]
Read the cross me from Fox News we store away she's even better than Greta even other than Greta was just saying a lot

[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:43.740]
There's one for you Greta van Suster and with all of her he's coming down to be joking that day when he's talking about how hot she is

[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:50.020]
She's about as hot as an earth pole although we do have global warming but nevertheless Greta van Suster she is awesome

[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:55.020]
We got nasty looking thing as the young lawyer in the Reagan White House

[02:01:55.020 --> 02:02:01.920]
Supreme Court nominee John Roberts concluded that a groups memorial service for aborted fetuses was an entirely appropriate means of

[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:14.360]
Calling attention to the abortion tragedy Roberts wrote the advice in an atrobor 85 memo after he was asked to review a proposed telegram from president Reagan to the memorial service promoted by the California pro-life medical association

[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:21.020]
The president's position is that the fetuses were human beings or at least cannot be proven not to have been and accordingly a memorial service

[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:31.460]
I saw the words I could you step on a piece of like oh paid on the street okay you just step on as you're walking along how do you know that wasn't can you prove that it wasn't ever

[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:40.500]
Life what about all the micro organisms murderer and accordingly a memorial service would seem an entirely appropriate means of calling attention to abortion tragedy Roberts wrote

[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:49.560]
Roberts during his confirmation hearing to be a member of the US court of appeals for the district of Columbia Circuit had referred to Roe v. Wade in the case that legalized abortion in the U.S. as several law

[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:57.440]
Seven Democrats have been aggressively seeking nominees intermost thoughts on the 73 abortion ruling by the Supreme Court and the documents released today said more light on

[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:04.840]
See Bill Monroe was from Munn Boston and so he had this really exaggerated his abaction which was very strange that was Bill Monroe he's dead

[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:17.280]
The memorial service came at the end of a three year battle over how to dispose of some 16,000 fetuses discovered in February 82 and sealed plastic bags of formaldehyde and stored in a bin outside the California home of a man who would manage a medical lab

[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:29.640]
The then closed laboratory routinely examined a board of fetuses for clinics and hospitals the feminist women's health center of LA which endorsed women's right to abortion had sued to stop LA County from giving the fetuses to be Catholic League for religious burial

[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:38.600]
Oh God the dispute reached the US Supreme Court which upheld lower court decisions that the county could bury or cremate the fetuses but couldn't arrange to join in religious services

[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.840]
Maybe Phillips falling was in there too in the same crypt

[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.000]
Other documents showed that Robert's 50 in 1985 voice support for the notion of allowing prayer in public schools

[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.100]
Writing that a ruling to the contrary seems indefensible under the Constitution as a young Reagan administration lawyer

[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:59.860]
He wrote he would have no objection if the justice department wanted to express in portrait a constitutional amendment permitting prayer

[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:05.040]
Referring to a Supreme Court ruling issued earlier that year that struck down the Alabama school prayer law

[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:12.220]
He said the conclusion that the Constitution prohibits such a moment of silence reflection or even silent prayer seems indefensible

[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:18.320]
The Alabama law ruled unconstitutional by a divided court man day-to-day one minute period of silence for meditation or prayer

[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:25.720]
Roberts to paragraph memo written to White House counsel Fred Fielding was among nearly 50 400 pages erected released by the Ronald Reagan presidential library

[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.520]
They comprised a portion of material relating to Roberts tenure as member of the Office of White House counsel

[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:37.380]
And initial 478 pages that cover the same subject years mean under seal according to Alan Weinstein archivist of the US

[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:45.080]
White House spokesman Steve Schmidt said the library had withheld material based on requirements and the agreement information act to protect privacy and national security

[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:50.240]
Right the White House did not hold back any after reviewing those clearance for released by the library Schmidt said

[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:56.800]
The library contains an initial 40,000 pages relating to Roberts expected to be made public before Senate confirmationary could be suspended

[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.220]
Right Wayne fascist and of course from Bush you wanted it and you got it baby not to USA

[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:07.200]
As a matter of fact, yep no a suicide should have kept playing that thing we had on there in the beginning there

[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.500]
You all better start going off to invent Maxingala

[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:16.420]
This is part of the

[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:20.920]
new

[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:24.880]
516

[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.300]
The only thing bigger than the one that's two-hour is that Debbie Alice.

[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.160]
Boy, it's Shia Kow!

[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.240]
I'm here!

[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:44.700]
It's thirty a day, twice gas.

[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.880]
Well, I read it, Lincoln.

[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:50.500]
Dasha Krenn, I drove up in the hill.

[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.420]
You want me in shirts?

[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:55.820]
And we call how it happened, well it's...

[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:58.180]
The market still gives me change.

[02:05:58.480 --> 02:05:59.700]
And what a weirdo!

[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:02.500]
Followed my map of star how says...

[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:03.360]
Yikes!

[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:06.820]
And was shocked to see...

[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:10.860]
Sitting on her front porch was...

[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:12.520]
Angelina Jollin.

[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.160]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la...

[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:18.720]
I walked up like I knew her.

[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:19.820]
Hey, do I know you?

[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:21.760]
I saw her hesitate.

[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:27.280]
She's up at dawn, a bond started working then for her.

[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:29.280]
It was too late.

[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:34.880]
For her and my car and...

[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:37.040]
Roll the windows down.

[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.720]
Now she washed my queen and...

[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.060]
She blew!

[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.040]
I made her crown.

[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:47.700]
What a stupid crown on me!

[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.780]
And I've got Angelina Jollin.

[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:52.860]
In my basement.

[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:54.720]
I made the basement.

[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.460]
And I think I'd keep her there with me.

[02:06:58.680 --> 02:06:58.960]
Hello!

[02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:01.020]
And charge her rent.

[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:02.180]
I can rent.

[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:03.880]
Well, I hope she goes mine.

[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:08.480]
I hope that she'll find that she likes us a man.

[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.460]
And that is a great fact.

[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:17.000]
How wonderful life is with Angelina Jollin in my basement.

[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.340]
Wait, see! I'm here!

[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:21.960]
Watched in her panic.

[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:23.780]
Pull her in my head.

[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:26.740]
But I bet you'd give your last set.

[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:28.600]
Help me!

[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:35.460]
To have Angelina Jollin locked down in your basement.

[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.140]
Come here, questions!

[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:38.980]
Don't hurt my dog.

[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:40.880]
Don't hurt pressure.

[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.260]
Don't hurt your dog, Mr. Dog!

[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.540]
How could we have gone as far into this show and left out?

[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:47.520]
Don't be trusted us.

[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.780]
Brother, he's going to go zooming toward the top.

[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:50.280]
Larry King!

[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:53.380]
The hunchback suspended one.

[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.640]
Thanks to who sent it.

[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:56.280]
Thank you, Ed.

[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:57.460]
Our bad.

[02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:59.880]
Let's see, Will Fax is in the sense.

[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:02.180]
Some football Jimmy Walker, JJ from Good Times.

[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.400]
I would hardly agree with that.

[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.460]
I also always go for the sports nerds.

[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.640]
And they're not doing sports.

[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.060]
They're never worth it.

[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:09.400]
Good choices.

[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.540]
Erraki's led to abuse by British soldiers.

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.000]
Now, let's see, we're going to make 600 votes today or not.

[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.320]
I don't think you're leaning on it, Josh.

[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:17.880]
What's as I can?

[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:20.260]
Isn't that with the death code of this morning when you came in?

[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:21.460]
You're fairing!

[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.600]
535 votes on the poll.

[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.760]
I don't understand why we don't have at least 1,000 votes on it already.

[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.000]
They're too busy trying to vote on that sun-central ball

[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.120]
about how Jimmy Sifil is stuck on the dolphin games.

[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.680]
Which I told you, I know it.

[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.060]
Boring, coma inducing.

[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:35.680]
That's the operative term.

[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:37.800]
It seems to be the general consensus of opinion,

[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:40.820]
except for the A votes they got from the people inside over there.

[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.380]
Probably Dan LaBasterd and his boyfriends, like the booster.

[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:44.660]
Yeah, we get that real stupid.

[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.220]
Huh? I was going to say I've been getting some really bad reports.

[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:48.680]
Well, let's hear it.

[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.940]
I just, I mean, everyone that has listened said it's been really bad.

[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:53.360]
I've heard Joe Rose is okay.

[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:56.560]
But Jimmy is just a coma inducing.

[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:59.860]
Yeah. I think that's a very genteel nice way to gentile way to say it.

[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.440]
He's boring.

[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.860]
He just, he don't got it.

[02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:03.760]
You're not a play-by-play guy, Jimmy.

[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.960]
I hate to break the news to you.

[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.300]
Okay. There's nothing worse than X-Jocks.

[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:09.360]
X-Jocks as color guys.

[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.080]
You've got your Pat Summerall was great in his day before we came to see Nile.

[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:14.980]
Who else?

[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.360]
What other buddy, buddy?

[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.000]
Now Buddy Blanton, there was an exception.

[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:21.360]
Former Giants first baseman a hundred years ago.

[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:22.100]
New York Giants.

[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:24.720]
And he was on a Saturday games with Dizzy Dean,

[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.320]
who screwed him over in Blanton or got taken over.

[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.920]
But he went on to do the St. Louis Hawks basketball team.

[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:32.100]
See, he worked for all these, the phones, these teams that don't exist anymore.

[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:35.220]
But he was great. In fact, when he tried to retire at K-Lamuel X,

[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:38.040]
there was such a fan protest that they had to bring Buddy Blanton back.

[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:38.700]
I do like that.

[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.720]
So he was one of the few great play-by-play guys, X-Jocks.

[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:44.340]
But, you know, color guys, there was a few.

[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:48.920]
And then there were a lot of bad ones like Tony Kubak and the Pee-Wee Reese and people like that.

[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:49.680]
Horrible.

[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.620]
And like Tim McCarver.

[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.180]
Of course, in his Pac-Fan.

[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.560]
I mean, a real lump.

[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:58.700]
There's a lump, a big French lump in his Pac-Fan.

[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.180]
Remember, it hates you, by the way, in his...

[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:04.980]
But you name me like an X-Jock play-by-play guy.

[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.800]
Other than Buddy Blanton, who died, I'm sure, long before you were born.

[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.140]
You can't do it, can you?

[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.940]
Now, play-by-play is a...

[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:13.120]
You have to be a broadcaster.

[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:13.920]
Yes you do.

[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:17.480]
And even a lot of them suck like Kenny Albert, who's just, you know,

[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:19.480]
Mark Albert's son, so therefore he's got the job.

[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:23.480]
Because everybody named Albert, even herb Albert, is, I think, doing sports.

[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:25.680]
And his Tijuana brass.

[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:29.480]
Kenny Albert sounds like he's got 40 pounds of elephant to drop things in his mouth.

[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:31.700]
But you're like that. Like, kind of like Ross Morton.

[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:32.960]
You like Kenny Albert?

[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.260]
Uh, not really.

[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:36.320]
No, awful.

[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.540]
Anyway, what the hell was that talking about?

[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.700]
I got sidetracked with that.

[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.040]
Oh, about your spy reports about how bad Jimmy Sifilis is doing.

[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.160]
It's bad, man.

[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:46.260]
It's really bad.

[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:51.720]
And those people over there at the ticket and the Dolphids organization, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.200]
They had that kind of Mark Champion, who's an excellent play-by-play guy.

[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.060]
He'd have been great. Like a real guy.

[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.980]
You know, he could have picked up the mantle right where we were on mode.

[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:02.320]
That's the path from Zimphur and Weaver and etc.

[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:03.280]
Tickeries, every chance.

[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:07.300]
But no. Let's just put a bunch of ex-dolphin shells on there, okay?

[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:09.000]
Well, that's unacceptable to what it is.

[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:09.740]
Even the mad dog.

[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:10.160]
Oh, right.

[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:10.840]
What a deal with that.

[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:11.980]
Shameful.

[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:16.880]
British sold and Aguenti will never see the real result of that pull.

[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:17.780]
That's my prediction.

[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:20.560]
Because if it was available anywhere, we'd have had it already.

[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:23.180]
Somebody would have faxed it in or somewhere along the line.

[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:24.200]
We'd have gotten the MS.

[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:25.640]
I should have known.

[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.640]
I should have kept careful watching.

[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.580]
And you'll notice the day that I come back on it, it was there yesterday.

[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:34.780]
And the day that I come back on the year, it mysteriously is a prison of a sun cell.

[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.380]
Because they know that I would have leaned on it.

[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:40.820]
And would have boosted up all of our audience out there to vote how they really feel about those embarrassing Dolphids.

[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:44.780]
And let me just say one other thing, Sarney, you're such a jackass.

[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:45.500]
You're such a lump.

[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.480]
Another lump.

[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.080]
And then, you know, when all fairness to the guys is bad as syphilis may be,

[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:52.240]
they haven't even started the regular season yet.

[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.700]
You don't go taking a poll on people and how you like them.

[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:56.320]
And they're like one or two exhibition games.

[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:57.000]
Am I right?

[02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:57.660]
Right.

[02:11:58.180 --> 02:11:58.900]
That's not fair.

[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:01.800]
Wait until they play two or three regular season games.

[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:03.200]
And then let everybody say they suck.

[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:08.680]
But this business of, oh, man, you're such a, you see, and this is in lieu.

[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.300]
This is instead of a guy who's supposed to be a columnist instead of offering his own opinion.

[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:16.000]
Even if it's a crappy opinion, at least say something.

[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:20.760]
Same guy who a couple of weeks ago wrote the word that they got all these different names and all they need.

[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:22.400]
That was like a real play by play broadcast.

[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:24.300]
Well, that was real ballsy for you, Sarney.

[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:27.260]
It was like right on the verge of saying something, but you just can't do it, Kenya.

[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.560]
Because you want to schmooze.

[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.220]
You want to be like the pivot man and at the local sports fraternity.

[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:33.600]
Man, oh man.

[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:34.560]
What an embarrassment.

[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.220]
You know, anybody thinks that we have a real sports writer in South Florida.

[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:39.860]
Not that this is a sports show, God forbid.

[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:42.500]
But any, we don't have anybody even close.

[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:46.040]
They've hide like twice a year, write something that makes sense.

[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:46.720]
It's interesting.

[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:47.380]
It's provocative.

[02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:48.760]
Or maybe once or twice a year.

[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:52.120]
In fact, you ought to go to California with Tom Jicke and Mr. Hyde.

[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:55.160]
And of course, Tommy didn't write anything about the ratings about the spring book.

[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.740]
Because he's out getting wind in dining, California, previewing the new Hollywood shows.

[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:00.400]
Yeah, right.

[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:03.160]
But another excuse to like not write anything about the book.

[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.340]
Every time I get a great stupendous book, there's nobody around to write about it.

[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.880]
And then Sarah Tallahley writes about how I annihilated the juice, the juice master.

[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:12.800]
And what's his name, Mark?

[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:13.760]
What do they call him now?

[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:14.380]
Buddy Mark.

[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:16.440]
Money Mark now ready for overnight time.

[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:19.600]
If he's not ready for overnight, how can he be ready for the middle of the day, huh?

[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:21.980]
Stubots, you idiot, you quizzling.

[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:22.520]
You ferry.

[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.700]
British soldiers are facing French.

[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.660]
See, this is the thing about this radio station.

[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.520]
The other 20 hours that they were too passive.

[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:30.580]
We need to be a little bit more aggressive, okay?

[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:34.860]
If you're so concerned that they're fighting a little battle with you, go after them and kick their ass.

[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.680]
Like God said, kill every one of them, okay?

[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:38.000]
That's right.

[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:38.900]
Kill your enemies.

[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:39.760]
Don't sit back in.

[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:40.400]
But it would be better.

[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:44.440]
And a problem again is that all these guys, they're in this sports fraternity together.

[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:46.240]
In fact, I was shocked last two days.

[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:46.820]
We could go today.

[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:49.240]
Remember I was talking with Hank about it and he was saying how simple it was.

[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:49.840]
So I was shocked.

[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:50.860]
And I said, oh, I know that.

[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:51.600]
Yeah.

[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:58.580]
British soldiers are facing French allegations of using Iraqi prisoners according to an investigation by BBC's Newsnight Programme.

[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.420]
Oh, those Brits, man.

[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.980]
Program PROGRAMMME Programme.

[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.400]
Oh, man.

[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:06.880]
What a sense of humor, whether you...

[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.100]
Thank you.

[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:14.300]
Two Iraqi brothers, clearly, were beaten with sticks and denied water and sleep after being arrested at their home in Basra and taken to a British base.

[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:17.100]
The brothers said the soldiers abused them in 2003.

[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:21.400]
Only weeks after the Iraq invasion, one man says the soldier urinated on his head.

[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:24.320]
And the program to be shown this evening, meaning tonight.

[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:26.360]
Well, let's see what it says, six o'clock there.

[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:26.980]
Yeah, tonight.

[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:29.520]
Oh, you'll be able to see that on the line over the shoulder.

[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:31.680]
If it's on a BBC, I guess it'll be 109.

[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:32.840]
You can be BBC world.

[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.160]
I take it.

[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:35.100]
Do you?

[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:35.840]
I'm not sure.

[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:37.120]
It's a digital cable.

[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:45.480]
I think business as usual, we have to realize it's good to destroy water crimes.

[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:46.520]
I mean, certain months.

[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:48.680]
It's good to evacuate water criminals.

[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:49.860]
I mean, settlers.

[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.240]
Very good.

[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.120]
Very, very good.

[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:55.780]
That was cute.

[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.400]
I was like, what's up?

[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.980]
That was on the BBC.

[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:00.720]
You won't hear that kind of coming, period.

[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:02.440]
It's certainly not news network, okay?

[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:03.500]
That was good.

[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:09.780]
In the program to be shown this evening, brothers, Marab and Assad's eyes al-Sahir.

[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:11.520]
I mean, why do we even bother with these names?

[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:12.280]
And what do we know?

[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.860]
They intrude stole their family car in cash.

[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:17.180]
Marab said his brother was tied up after they were arrested.

[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:20.160]
And then they were both taken to an internment camp where they were abused.

[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:25.280]
Marab said they lowered me down while I was tied up through me on the floor and hit me with a stick.

[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:28.240]
And put these raw breaths afterwards and I lost consciousness.

[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:33.160]
I thought they would throw water over us, but he got his penis out and urinated on my head.

[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:37.120]
If he had a weapon, if I would have had a weapon, I'd have killed him myself, he said.

[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.220]
The brothers haven't made any official complaint.

[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.280]
They were cancer-confused.

[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.660]
They spoke to him and for the Ministry of Defense and Allegations could not be investigated unless they were reported.

[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:48.080]
She urged anyone with evidence to come forward so the claims could be investigated.

[02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:51.700]
Birmingham-based human rights lawyer feels shiner.

[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.600]
Well, there's another one for our poll, by the way.

[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:54.760]
Herb Shriner.

[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:55.080]
Who?

[02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:56.500]
And what about Phil Silvers?

[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.140]
Who?

[02:15:57.540 --> 02:15:58.520]
You don't know Phil Silvers?

[02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.160]
No.

[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:04.240]
Birmingham-based human rights lawyer, Phil Shriner, is acting for dozens of Iraqis who make claims against the British Army.

[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:10.760]
He says, I think there is fairly clear evidence that there's a policy within the British Army in Iraq of systematic abuse and torture.

[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:14.780]
Other claimed female soldiers were sexually provocative during interrogations.

[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.520]
Another man said he was held for more than two months without charge.

[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:21.700]
He said, troops punched him and made him make monkey noises in a dark like a dog.

[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:26.240]
Another man said he was held for 31 days without sleep at the old air-based embossed line.

[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:27.660]
All sounds like...

[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:28.060]
I forgot.

[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.460]
You're very big, we're familiar to me.

[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:30.560]
You don't know Phil Silvers?

[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:31.380]
No.

[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:32.540]
Yeah, out of here.

[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:33.560]
Glasses?

[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:34.360]
Where are we going?

[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:38.760]
I got one for him that you know and he goes farther back than Phil Silvers.

[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:39.780]
Ed Wynn.

[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:40.520]
Oh, yeah.

[02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:42.420]
Well, nobody else remembers it except Phil Silvers.

[02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:43.220]
You see, I remember you.

[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.340]
Well, Boca-Brion remembers him.

[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:47.660]
If it's good enough for me and Boca-Brion and even you, it's good enough for this audience.

[02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:47.980]
Okay?

[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:52.500]
We got a lot of old users out there where the old fart station now, where the...

[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:54.480]
What would be a good term for it?

[02:16:54.860 --> 02:16:54.860]

[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:57.780]
Fossil station, your Fossil station from the New Millennium.

[02:16:58.140 --> 02:16:58.520]
We're old.

[02:16:58.880 --> 02:16:59.420]
We're crusty.

[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:00.140]
And guess what?

[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:00.920]
We got an audience.

[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:01.860]
I didn't like that.

[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:03.560]
Mr. Hodge, out over there.

[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:05.700]
Mr. Labaster boy, you silly ghost.

[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:07.920]
I was starting to say before before Joshy interrupted me.

[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:10.400]
Well, he interrupted because he's so tight with Boob, you know?

[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:15.240]
Now, once I thought about that relationship there, I started my opinion of the Booster,

[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.000]
who started dropping several notches.

[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:17.920]
You know what I mean?

[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:18.640]
No, what do you mean?

[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.240]
Well, sometimes you have to judge a person by their friends, by the company they keep.

[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:23.060]
Exactly.

[02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:32.240]
Hey, I'd like to read a letter that I'm writing to all white people today in the spirit of unity and understanding.

[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:38.100]
Dear white folk, couple of things you ought to know.

[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:41.500]
When I'm born, I'm black.

[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:44.920]
When I grow up, I'm black.

[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:48.980]
When I get sick, I'm black.

[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:53.340]
When I go out in the sun, I'm black.

[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:57.760]
When I go out in the cold, I'm black.

[02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:02.080]
When I get scared, I'm black.

[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:06.820]
And when I die, I'm still black.

[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:09.880]
But you, my white man.

[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:12.980]
When you're born, you are pink.

[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.740]
When you grow up, you are white.

[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:20.760]
When you get sick, you are green.

[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:25.320]
When you go out in the sun, you go red.

[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:29.860]
And when you get cold, you turn blue.

[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:33.900]
When you get scared, you turn yellow.

[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.140]
And the happiest time of my life is when white people die.

[02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:39.940]
You turn purple.

[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:44.680]
And you've got the damn nerve to call me colored.

[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:50.160]
There was an old farmer who lived on a ride.

[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:53.900]
He sat in the meadow just shaping his face.

[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:57.000]
That some boys who were down by the frick.

[02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:03.760]
There'd be in the water, their hands on their marbles and play things and at half past four.

[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.840]
There came a young lady.

[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.760]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:10.580]
She sat on the grass.

[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:17.300]
People of her dress and she showed them her rumbles and laces and white plop be done.

[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:24.180]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin.

[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:30.940]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling refuse and litter from yesterday's time.

[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:37.680]
While the girls in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by the dock.

[02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:44.380]
It looked like a man with a side of a home in the country with a big fence out front.

[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:46.320]
It be asked her fun lightly.

[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:51.220]
She'd show him her little betta who was subject to this.

[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:58.020]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with the movement so quick.

[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:02.040]
And then she bent over and sucked on his candy.

[02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:04.800]
So tasty made a butter sky.

[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:11.640]
And then he spread whipped cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf.

[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:15.380]
If you think this is dirty, you can go fuck yourself.

[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:15.920]
Well, look at that.

[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.240]
Tom Price has taken continued with Chrissie of New Labor Day.

[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:19.580]
That's what your federal government says.

[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:23.200]
Thank you, Mr. President, for those very low reasonable gas prices.

[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:26.140]
Of course, enough that they're waping you or ripping you off.

[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:29.420]
It must be because there's a shortage in the heavy on all these mechanical problems.

[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:29.880]
That's right.

[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:34.900]
Because the king just died in Saudi Arabia, King Fahad, who's been a vegetable for 10 years anyway.

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:35.740]
Wow.

[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:37.320]
And the public says it's back.

[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:42.420]
But me put them up and you're like CNN and they come on there and give you a bunch of propaganda.

[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:44.360]
A bunch of crap. They lie through their teeth.

[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:47.880]
That little, that was lucky again, very fortuitous that thing I had from BBC.

[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.320]
Oh yeah, that was great.

[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:51.200]
So Phil Silvers was Sergeant Bilko.

[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:52.520]
You don't know from Sergeant Bilko?

[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:54.040]
I mean, I've heard the name, but I've never heard of it.

[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.120]
Well, you better get with it.

[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.580]
You better sit down with them. You better lunch with Bilko.

[02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:57.960]
Hello.

[02:20:58.340 --> 02:20:58.640]
What?

[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.420]
You cut off again for the second time today.

[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:01.520]
Why is that?

[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:02.660]
I have no idea what I'm doing.

[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.040]
For how long?

[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:04.380]
For like a second or two.

[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:05.640]
Well, they're too bad.

[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:06.860]
Keep you on your toes.

[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:08.040]
How the f**k?

[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:12.060]
How is that?

[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:12.920]
I like it.

[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:15.960]
Anyway, Sil-Dad Wata is Mexico.

[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:17.080]
And this article I love.

[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:19.840]
Another reason to stay the hell away from Mexico if you value your life.

[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:22.660]
Mexican, Mexicans take over drug trade to the U.S.

[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:26.500]
With Colombian cartels and shambles, Mexican drug lords run the show now.

[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:28.240]
Suidad Wata is Mexico.

[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.120]
The king pins of the Cemeteries drug trade are no longer Colombians.

[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:36.040]
In the largest reorganization since the 80s, senior U.S. officials say,

[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:42.060]
well, I guess what Frank Costello or the mob, he was, he must have been part of what they molded the Godfather after,

[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.220]
because he was adamant that he would not know drug dealing.

[02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:44.720]
Hmm.

[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:45.760]
And my neighborhood.

[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:49.720]
Senior U.S. officials say Mexican cartels have leveraged the profits

[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:53.100]
from their delivery routes to rest control from the Colombian producers.

[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:58.100]
The shift is also because of these success authorities have had and cracking down on Colombia's king pins.

[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:00.220]
Well, that's one great thing about the war on drugs.

[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:01.720]
It's just like the war on prostitution.

[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:02.160]
Yeah.

[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.640]
The more you chase it, the more it keeps moving from one hood to another.

[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.080]
And let me ask you this.

[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:07.360]
Yeah.

[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:08.280]
Where are you at?

[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:09.100]
Yeah, you'll.

[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:19.160]
As a result, Mexican drug lords are calling the shots in what the U.S. estimates is $142 billion a year of business in cocaine, heroin, marriage, wini, methamphetamine, and elicit drugs in the U.S. states.

[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:23.520]
Speaking of marriage, wini, how's that kid who is he still dead the one that cops shot up?

[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:24.500]
Yeah, he's still shot.

[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:27.060]
But it's safer now over there, etc.

[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:27.440]
Right.

[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.920]
Yeah, he was, he had a scale.

[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:31.860]
He had one or little scales and two ounces of pot.

[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:32.920]
Where you're ass on it.

[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.880]
He was a danger to the human race.

[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:37.680]
That's what all you left wing spin doctors better understand.

[02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:42.940]
Today, the Mexicans have taken over and are running the organized crime and getting the bulk of the money to John Walters.

[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:45.140]
The White House drugs are in a phone interview.

[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:46.720]
The Colombians have pulled back.

[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:48.620]
Oh, G.S. you're hoping out there for skin.

[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:51.260]
Man, what are disgusting thoughts that is.

[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:52.380]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:53.880]
They're a lot of really good looking Colombians.

[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.300]
I know I've told you that before and you disagree.

[02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:56.640]
Well, I didn't disagree.

[02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:57.460]
You didn't.

[02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:58.940]
Somebody here has half Colombian.

[02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:00.440]
Who is Shakira?

[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.320]
Oh, Shakira.

[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:02.160]
I love Shakira.

[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:02.800]
We all do.

[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:13.400]
One consequence of the new dominance of Mexican cartels is a spike in violence, especially along the 2000, my U.S. Mexican border where rival cartels are worrying not only against Mexican and the U.S. authorities,

[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:17.660]
but also against each other for control of the lucrative transit corridors.

[02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:18.680]
Oh, there you go.

[02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:20.080]
Just like the mafia man.

[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:21.700]
You're all like the mob warriors.

[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.780]
Not like all you, a Julio, is man.

[02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:24.540]
You all hate each other.

[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:27.740]
Mexicans hate the weekends and the Cubans and the weekends hate each other like poison.

[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:29.400]
And God only knows about the periguin.

[02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.060]
Yeah, but these are Mexicans killing Mexicans.

[02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:33.220]
And so, Dumbled Trump.

[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.280]
I mean, a bad hero, but Adam Dumbled.

[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:38.280]
He's ugly. He's horrendous.

[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:39.460]
You want to put him on air?

[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:39.680]
Sure.

[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:40.220]
Okay.

[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:41.220]
Adam Dumbled.

[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:42.200]
Let's put the whole of it in life.

[02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:44.220]
Boy, I grew the on-app, but I don't think he's that.

[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:47.400]
You know, put him in the same category with Carl Maldon or Marty Feldman.

[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:47.880]
Yeah.

[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.220]
Okay, we're Larry King.

[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:50.520]
Larry King's got one.

[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:54.540]
Now, we got to get a little push on here to get that 600 votes during the show, man.

[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:56.180]
Otherwise, you're going to be hearing Hungarians here.

[02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:58.040]
Hungarians, Chinese melodies.

[02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:01.480]
Starting tomorrow, 10 to 2.

[02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:03.620]
You want to see a little action here.

[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:06.480]
Now that the school is back in, no more excuses now.

[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:09.620]
This is the week that we have like the turning point, no more damn excuses.

[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.220]
Plus, we have all those naked pictures of Britney Spears on today.

[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.360]
Yeah, and he'll knocked up the milky.

[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:21.020]
565 votes, who is the all-time, ugliest male celebrity, movies radio or TV.

[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:22.780]
Marty Feldman, 116.

[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:24.120]
They can't touch Marty.

[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:25.080]
Number one, he's dead.

[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:26.260]
Number two, who don't want to anyway.

[02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:27.660]
Hank Goldberg, 78.

[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:29.880]
The poor Humper is taking it bad.

[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.260]
Lyle, love it, 55.

[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:33.260]
Look at the way he shot up the list.

[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:34.900]
Mojaro, David in 42.

[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:36.120]
Ron Jeremy, 33.

[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:37.180]
He'll Roger, 31.

[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.780]
Ron, the slip by me.

[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.760]
Carl Maldon, 22.

[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:41.800]
Slice to load, 21.

[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:42.940]
James Woods, 18.

[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:44.260]
Owen Wilson, 16.

[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:45.800]
Wayne Heisenberg, 15.

[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:48.140]
Man, a H2 like poison, Wayne.

[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.240]
I wish you would just, just crumble out, just die a horrible death.

[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:52.940]
Don I miss 14.

[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:54.160]
Steve Bushimi, 14.

[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:55.340]
Charles Bronson, 14.

[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:56.960]
Jack E. Lomontweve, old Jack.

[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:58.120]
Phil Henry IX.

[02:24:58.340 --> 02:24:59.560]
Edward James, almost eight.

[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:01.780]
W. C. Fields, eight.

[02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:03.740]
Peter C.

[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:04.400]
Laurie, eight.

[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:05.240]
Six.

[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:07.140]
Don King, five.

[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:08.520]
Richard Boone, five.

[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:10.120]
You know what, how they show he was on?

[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.040]
I give up.

[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.120]
He was on medic with William Shatton.

[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:13.860]
Oh, I never watched that.

[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:15.140]
Never watched that.

[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:16.400]
Well, it's before you were born.

[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.460]
Greta Van Suster in three, Bellagosi, three Gene Wilder, three Reds Gelton, three.

[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:21.800]
How about Rita Cosby?

[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:23.380]
If we're going to put Greta on there.

[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:23.880]
Hope.

[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:26.260]
Rita Cosby from MSNBC.

[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:27.500]
You know, Rita, the one that says,

[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:29.520]
I'm thinking of, you know, you talk about your story.

[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:31.940]
I understand it's hard for you to talk to you.

[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.460]
It's not about the details of this case.

[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:35.420]
Yeah, sure, sure.

[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:38.300]
I mean, I know we got Lenny Martez on here, but we're like little QA,

[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:40.560]
and we're like a little mom and pop station in Miami, you know?

[02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:46.500]
But this is supposedly a major network that's supposedly competing worldwide for viewers, okay?

[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.900]
Now, one of the peacock is molting all the time.

[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.640]
God, pathetic.

[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:52.860]
Rita Cosby, my ass.

[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.060]
A Reds Gelton three at Kaplan, two John Madden, two Boris Carl off, two James,

[02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:58.620]
Jimmy Walker, J.J. got one.

[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:01.260]
Very King one, Fred Gwynne one, F.M.A.

[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.220]
We're having finally got one.

[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.100]
They don't know who that is.

[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.660]
Well, I'm the four one, and none yet for Donald Trump.

[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:09.920]
Phil Silver's Ed Wynn, but a Yepson and a Sporne one, or even for Stan Major.

[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:11.360]
Oh my God.

[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:13.720]
How fast they forget, you know what?

[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.480]
Yeah, I don't have to play some of the Stan Major bits.

[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:21.720]
I wonder how much his name is doing.

[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.760]
J. Michaels.

[02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:23.820]
How's J. Michaels doing?

[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:24.620]
He's still on.

[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:25.640]
He's still doing a show.

[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.040]
Oh, that's right. He never did do a show.

[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.240]
Boy, did he butcher my audience in INZ when I went to Zeta?

[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:30.720]
Wow.

[02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:33.940]
27 after 1 at 5, 60 WQAM.

[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.080]
You're right. Just did.

[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:36.860]
What?

[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:37.540]
What?

[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:39.580]
You're not even paying any attention.

[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:40.440]
I was not a room.

[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:42.900]
I was paying for the sprinting.

[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:44.200]
I just come out of the shed here.

[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:48.160]
I thought that there was another spot coming, so I'm making me like a bratwurst.

[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.740]
I knew that I was testifying under oath, and I told the truth.

[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:55.820]
And today, I am telling the truth again that I did not do this intentionally or noranely.

[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.740]
The Orioles ain't winning.

[02:26:58.360 --> 02:26:59.880]
Get worse with every unit.

[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:03.080]
Miserly's afraid he's gonna lose his job.

[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:03.820]
And it...

[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:05.760]
Sooses got no call.

[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:07.980]
J. Ambees in New York.

[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:11.940]
Paparra shows us voice down with a night band for.

[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:13.820]
We're talking to Smolls.

[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:17.820]
So we need for the fences talking to Smolls.

[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:20.560]
Making this need of the fences.

[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.800]
The custom only juxtapunch aligns.

[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:25.040]
You have a new sterile.

[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:28.060]
Get full and free run shots with routine fights.

[02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:31.380]
Life on air rolls.

[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:33.760]
Go, set and big backs.

[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:36.220]
There's nothing for me to gain in everything but lose.

[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:37.700]
You know, why would I do it?

[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:40.300]
500-800-6-0.

[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:42.940]
It just makes no sense.

[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.000]
We get our six number.

[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:45.500]
We'll get there easy right like falling off along.

[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.960]
Yeah, I was popping up bratwurst into my flavor wave.

[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:49.360]
Deluxe.

[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:50.560]
And I was...

[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:51.300]
We were keeping up with bratwurst.

[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:51.860]
In the bathroom.

[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:53.500]
It's all turned back in here.

[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:54.340]
Well, there you go.

[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:57.400]
Some of the crashed airliners passengers alive on impact.

[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:59.940]
Yeah, it wouldn't have been something if I wouldn't have been paying any attention.

[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:01.360]
And Josh would have had a grab.

[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.360]
The thing I tell us all those stories about how Jimmy Cifalus really sucks.

[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:06.040]
So you're getting bad reports.

[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:06.760]
Is that what you said?

[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:07.180]
Yes.

[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:08.680]
I've gotten really bad stuff.

[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:09.900]
I haven't heard it myself yet.

[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:10.460]
So I'm waiting.

[02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:11.600]
Try to catch them.

[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:15.720]
Well, I've heard messages from people who have heard it and they say you can't believe.

[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:20.840]
And not only him being bad on the game but the pregame show is so embarrassing and so.

[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:23.120]
Juvenile and sophomore and Bushley.

[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:24.120]
Pretty exact same.

[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:24.760]
Yeah.

[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.840]
Pretty nice going over there at the ticket man.

[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:27.920]
Pathetic.

[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:31.700]
Anyway, contrary to other reports that are going around the Guardians usually pretty responsible.

[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:33.000]
They got some idea what they're writing about.

[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:38.400]
They say at least six of the 121 people killed on somebody in Greece's worst air disaster were alive.

[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:43.000]
When the jetliner plunged into a mountain outside Athens, all cops used to reveal last night.

[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:49.260]
I'm sure you've heard they were all frozen solid and the pilot turned blue and somebody sent a text message.

[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:50.120]
All a bunch of crap.

[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:51.600]
You using that?

[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:51.840]
Have you?

[02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:52.980]
Yeah, I've seen all kinds of things.

[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:54.080]
Well, they're full of crap.

[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:59.580]
Just like a sky miles of Brian and Wolf Blitzrey were full of crap in Pearson Airport here about two, three weeks ago.

[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:00.880]
Oh, man.

[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:02.880]
How can they both even still be on the air?

[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:03.880]
Irresponsible.

[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:06.620]
Absolutely unacceptable is what it is.

[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:07.300]
Unacceptable.

[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:08.620]
That's journalism.

[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:13.060]
After conducting first toxicological tests.

[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:13.860]
Careful.

[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:20.360]
On six of the victims, Athens, Steve Gorn, or Philip Kutsoffius, cities found evidence that they had circulation in their hearts and lungs.

[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.380]
They had circulation in bread so they were alive.

[02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:25.180]
He told reporters, I can't say if they were conscious or unconscious.

[02:29:25.780 --> 02:29:35.620]
If they were unconscious, the Helios Airways Boeing 737 crash into mountains near Athens, killing all 115 passengers, six crew, on a fight from the market to Prague with a stop in Athens.

[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:45.800]
They were rescuers had said that many of the recovered bodies showed signs of being frozen and solid prompting speculation that the passengers had died because of a dramatic drop in a cabin's pressure.

[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:48.060]
And they were comparing it to the golfer.

[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.060]
What was the golfer's name?

[02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:50.740]
Oh, Martin.

[02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:53.000]
No, not Casey Martin again.

[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.700]
The one at the loss control.

[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:55.320]
Huh?

[02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:56.240]
I'm thinking.

[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:56.760]
I forget.

[02:29:56.840 --> 02:29:57.420]
Okay, we're going.

[02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.020]
You know, I think I am with golf.

[02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:06.420]
However, last night, a police arrested a man who claimed we received a telephone text message from one of the past news before the crash saying farewell, cousin were freezing in here.

[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:07.640]
In other words, it was a hoax.

[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:15.960]
In a separate development yesterday, police and separers raided the offices of Helios Airways as we've been shocked to turn to anger against the alarm, which operated a Boeing 737.

[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:23.000]
The raid was carried out to secure documents and other evidence, which could be useful for the investigation into possible criminal acts.

[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:32.300]
A lead police officer from Nicoccia, the island's capital, were dispatched to Helios' headquarters in Lanarca after local authorities, including the chief police requested a search warrant.

[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.040]
How do you like that?

[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:36.100]
A lot of accidents going on these days don't fly.

[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:37.640]
You know, not a good idea.

[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:38.820]
Oh, it doesn't bother me.

[02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:39.580]
It doesn't deter me.

[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:40.620]
You fly every day.

[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:43.000]
Yeah, who is the golfer that his plane?

[02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:43.780]
Don't you remember that?

[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:44.740]
Yeah, I remember it.

[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:46.900]
But you know, all these sports names are all the same to me.

[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:50.540]
And he fell asleep. He became unconscious because there was no air pressure.

[02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:51.920]
And there was no oxygen in the cabin.

[02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:54.060]
And the plane was like the loose flying over.

[02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:55.320]
Yeah, that was his name.

[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:56.200]
It begins with an L.

[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:56.780]

[02:30:57.760 --> 02:30:58.480]
Len Martez.

[02:30:58.900 --> 02:30:59.660]
Lenny Martez.

[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.880]
Oh, boy, I remember him.

[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:01.400]
He was living soon.

[02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:04.900]
Oh, seriously? What the hell was that Fred Mertz?

[02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:07.580]
Sure, one of these ringing lines, I don't know.

[02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:09.620]
Okay, well, one I answered.

[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:10.740]
Somebody QA and hello.

[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:12.380]
QA and?

[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:14.900]
Yeah, the golfer was painless.

[02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:16.720]
Thank you very much.

[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:18.580]
As a matter of fact, thank you, sir.

[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:20.680]
Not only was the golfer pain stored.

[02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:21.880]
Oh, but where is that?

[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:22.520]
Isn't that in here?

[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:24.900]
I thought we had a drop in here with painstored.

[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:25.960]
We do.

[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:26.840]
I don't have it.

[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:27.360]
What's it under?

[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:28.720]
I thought it was under painstored.

[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.040]
P.A. Why any?

[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:30.800]
Yeah.

[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:32.540]
I just lost P.A. Alice.

[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:36.080]
I know that all of us American golfers on the one hand cup team.

[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.340]
We are Chinese too.

[02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:38.220]
There you are, everybody.

[02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:38.840]
Yeah.

[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:40.980]
How do you like that painstored?

[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:42.040]
He's still dead, by the way.

[02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:46.380]
Don Stout looked up into the Midwestern sky one afternoon

[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:49.580]
two weeks ago and saw a strange helicopter flying over his five acre

[02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:51.280]
piece of land in rural Albany, Ohio.

[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:55.060]
Before we knew what happened, the 77-year-old long-time resident

[02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:59.040]
law-abiding citizen and Korean war veteran had eight law enforcement

[02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:02.080]
officials swarming on his property checking the place out from

[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:02.560]
marijuana.

[02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:05.960]
Never before having had a running with a law, Stout said that heavy handed

[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:09.620]
looking group of law enforcement thugs came and went without saying a word.

[02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:12.860]
After suspiciously looking at large bush on his property,

[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.120]
not in the slightest bit resembling a plot plan.

[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:18.320]
I've been here since 94 and everybody knows me including the sheriff.

[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:20.000]
I never smoked marijuana and they know it.

[02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:22.880]
But I think they're just like terrorizing people, Stout.

[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:26.720]
In a telephone conversation from Rizor-Oll-Home, adding he still hasn't received an answer

[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:30.060]
from anyone as to why law enforcement officials invaded his privacy

[02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:32.100]
entered his land without a proper search warrant.

[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:35.400]
It's scared that hell out of me as eight or ten men swarmed my place.

[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:38.160]
I was weeding my garden next thing, you know, they run my property

[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:40.860]
and they looked at this, they looked at this bush and left without saying a word.

[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:43.740]
It was ridiculous, but the sheriff, the deputy sheriff and the game warden

[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:46.560]
all rated my place for no reason. I'm still looking for an explanation.

[02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:48.340]
Where is this? Sorry to interrupt.

[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.260]
Albany, Ohio.

[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:50.560]
Why, you want some?

[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:51.220]
Yeah, I do.

[02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:55.080]
Although Stout can't pin plug by authorities' enter to his property without a warrant,

[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:56.820]
earlier that day, he heard his strong opinions.

[02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:00.980]
Earlier that same day, he heard his strong opinions against President Bush calling

[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:04.320]
him an outright liar on a free speech and truth-telling talk radio show

[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:08.260]
on a popular W.A.I.F.A.M.770 local radio station.

[02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:10.100]
Waf, 77.

[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:14.080]
George Music, a variety of W.A.V.C.

[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.380]
O.M.F.L.I.

[02:33:16.580 --> 02:33:18.500]
Well, I know we want to have one, it's a 77.

[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:21.280]
Okay.

[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:25.260]
Stout said he had been calling in regularly voicing his anti-bush opinions,

[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:28.100]
saying people in rural Ohio are finally staring to wake up to lies,

[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:31.180]
these seed and treachery imposed on the American people by what he calls

[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:32.620]
a lying dog of a president.

[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:35.920]
I think he and arrest of his buddies are corrupt downright crazy and Bush

[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:38.560]
should be impeached, plain and simple for lying to the people about weapons,

[02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:42.000]
the mass destruction, and Iraq, to the former Korean War veteran who lashed out at Bush

[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.340]
were going to work illegally and in the process calling thousands of innocent civilians

[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:47.540]
including more than 1800 GIs.

[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:51.660]
I think George Bush is a liar and personally responsible for the deaths of many good young men

[02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:54.860]
in order that his rich buddies could profit from this illegal war.

[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.520]
He also talked about how he has stolen election in Ohio in 2004.

[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:02.120]
See, Florida 2000, Ohio 2004.

[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:03.780]
Never do it twice in the same state.

[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:04.340]
No.

[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:05.840]
Always move it around a little bit.

[02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:09.400]
20 chill 2 with 5, 60 W and 2 in point at Browers.

[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.660]
Oh, really smell good in my flavor way.

[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:14.780]
I'm in the summer first side, eight minutes on a certain side.

[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:16.500]
That's from a pre-cooked, by the way.

[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:16.920]
Okay.

[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:19.920]
I was watching, I don't know, something on the news last night.

[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.200]
I showed some pig rolling around in the slot and I thought to myself,

[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:24.420]
there's your Browers, man.

[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:27.160]
Ah, didn't debother me.

[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.540]
They cleaned up real nice.

[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:29.180]
They ho-

[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:30.540]
You can relate to that.

[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:31.100]
Yeah.

[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:32.540]
If you're looking for a high p-

[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:33.620]
Ha-ha-ha.

[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.560]
If you're looking, well, I got a story about that, by the way.

[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:38.220]
Before I do the spot, about pigs.

[02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:38.860]
No.

[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:40.520]
About pig squealing.

[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:41.880]
Oh, geez.

[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.860]
How come I can't find it right this second, you see?

[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:44.840]
That's bad.

[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:45.840]
Hang on, folks.

[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:47.040]
It's not really worth it.

[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.980]
Yeah, father and son win French pig squeal off.

[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:51.480]
Well, forget to that, Miss.

[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:51.680]
Sorry.

[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:53.040]
And Ed Bady wasn't in it.

[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:53.540]
It goes your oven.

[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:54.500]
Did you hear it?

[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:54.720]
Yeah.

[02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:55.520]
Could you hear the beep?

[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:55.880]
Yep.

[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:58.520]
It's beeping, which is perfect timing, because now I can flip it over.

[02:34:58.600 --> 02:34:59.560]
Well, I'll wait a little bit.

[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:00.500]
I'll just show it off.

[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:02.320]

[02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:49.320]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.520]
This is 5.62 AF.

[02:35:58.460 --> 02:36:00.600]
There's two new Duke phones.

[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:03.900]
And that orange car.

[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:08.520]
The new Duke's a hazards man.

[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.580]
I can say it's the worst remake of all.

[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.120]
Daisy Duke's curtains.

[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:18.040]
And she would be.

[02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:25.020]
Tell me how to Jessica since and get her own movie deal.

[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:27.980]
Movie's today.

[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:31.580]
They make my popcorn taste foul.

[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:38.080]
Ain't got no popcorn or more, but they're really loud.

[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:41.400]
I love the old Duke phones.

[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:44.440]
We're back when I was a kid.

[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:51.880]
Only wood takes my favorite shows and turns them into bad play.

[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:53.860]
Hey man, 145.

[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.940]
Carrot Top, it's as damn it.

[02:36:56.040 --> 02:36:57.720]
Carrot Top, how's he getting Carrot Top off?

[02:36:58.040 --> 02:36:58.320]
Got it.

[02:36:59.060 --> 02:36:59.860]
And what I got?

[02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:00.480]
What do you got?

[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:02.580]
I just printed it.

[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:03.700]
Okay, this is second.

[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:05.340]
I'm reading a mail based on that facts.

[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:08.500]
Fact is, we'd Michael, my pussy, or just like Dave Hyde,

[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:10.340]
Mike Mayo, who used to be a sports nerd comers.

[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:11.880]
And that was just a general nerd comers.

[02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:13.980]
I'm twice a year, he writes something fairly profound.

[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:17.940]
Says, read Michael Mayo's column in the Sunset Locals section about the kid in the Sunrise.

[02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:21.820]
And it was killed by the Swag Team in our, our, our unaffected war on drugs.

[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:27.480]
Michael Mayo writes an ounce of pot, ten bullets, and one failed drug war.

[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.580]
In the annals of drug takedowns, there was that annals.

[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:31.600]
This wasn't much.

[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:34.300]
Three quarter rounds bags in marijuana, bedroom refrigerator,

[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.240]
a joint and another loose ram on top.

[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:38.260]
Four grams scattered on a dresser.

[02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:41.600]
Six pipes with pot residue, three ash trays with less than a gram each,

[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:43.820]
three packs of rolling papers, and a digital scale.

[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:45.600]
Saturday had a scale.

[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:46.160]
Oh.

[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:49.680]
Thanks to the efforts of the Sunrise Police Department today,

[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.060]
a pot hit in West Broward might have to go an extra ten blocks to score some smoke.

[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.060]
An Anthony dietado is dead.

[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:57.360]
I still can't pronounce this like a name.

[02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:57.920]
Sorry, Anthony.

[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:00.420]
All for 30.2 grams of weed.

[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.420]
About 30, man.

[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.400]
One more than an ounce.

[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.700]
The drug inventory above is what Sunrise Police said they found an Anthony's home in the morning,

[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:09.040]
a SWAT unit shot him with ten bullets in a pre-dawn raid.

[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:12.040]
No coke, no heroin, no ecstasy, no meth.

[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:16.940]
What in the hell were they doing with a SWAT team as to Eleanor's shock at a retired dating circuit judge,

[02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:21.640]
who advocates a sweeping overhaul of drug laws, to break into somebody's home at six o'clock in the morning,

[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:25.380]
possibly awaken somebody from a deep sleep, someone who has a concealed weapons permit,

[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:26.720]
what did they expect to happen?

[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:29.080]
This is a tragedy it should never have happened.

[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:33.560]
Even if Anthony 23 was a small time popular, which his friends and family deny,

[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:36.900]
the methods used to show the madness of our countries were on drugs.

[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:40.100]
No discretion, no proportionality, no sense.

[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:44.460]
Using SWAT in this case is like using a sledgehammer on a fly, said Jack Cole,

[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.100]
former narcotics detective for the New Jersey State Police,

[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:49.460]
who had law enforcement against prohibition,

[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:51.240]
leap a drug law reform group.

[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:54.720]
I'd rather use a little bit of stealthy said.

[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:58.780]
Cole has spent 14 years as an undercover agent nearly three decades as a cop.

[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.940]
He doesn't understand why such a huge show force was necessary,

[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.100]
why he needed to be done at 6.15 in the morning,

[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:07.140]
or why detectives couldn't detain Anthony when he lets his house for work.

[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:09.940]
When you kick in a door, all it does is alert them that someone's coming

[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.300]
that they don't want to see cool, said.

[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:15.840]
Sunrise Police Chief David Boyett said yesterday he couldn't comment on these specifics of a case

[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:19.080]
but he said it's common to serve narcotics warnings early in the morning.

[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:21.160]
That's the time you find people at home.

[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:27.260]
The Howard Circuit Judge John Prisanti on August 3rd granted the search warrant for Anthony's home.

[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:29.380]
According to War It's It Tales released yesterday,

[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.600]
Anthony didn't even have to be home during the search.

[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.660]
The war at that time David said a confidential informant brought an ounce of marijuana

[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:41.360]
from Anthony the last month that came two weeks after an anonymous tipster told Sunrise Narcotics Officers

[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:44.540]
that cannabis and cocaine were being sold at all hours at the house.

[02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:46.060]
Melconsent Neighbor.

[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:50.340]
Sunrise Police, I hope the Melconsent Neighbor is real happy that your neighbor is dead by the way.

[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:53.920]
Sunrise Police used a SWAT unit to execute the search warrant August 5.

[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:57.380]
A few hours earlier, Anthony returned home from his bartender job in Western.

[02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.620]
Police say he had a gun and fled into his bedroom.

[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:00.960]
He had no history of violence.

[02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:04.220]
His only running with a law was an arrest for marijuana possession when he was 16.

[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:07.380]
He didn't have a concealed weapons permit.

[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:12.120]
And during their raid, police said they found a handgun, shotgun, rifle and BB pistol

[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:14.020]
along with 124 rounds of ammo.

[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:18.560]
Given the August 2000 for killing a brown chair softened deputy Todd Fata and a child

[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.140]
of a poor no warrant raid gone bad.

[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:24.200]
Sunrise's inclination to use SWAT for a suspect known who have weapons was understandable.

[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:26.960]
But as Shocket said, why not take him on the street?

[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:28.880]
Why not go to his job and tell him there?

[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:33.160]
Said Cole, when you have a war, there's going to be casualties and there's going to be collateral damage.

[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:37.440]
None of this would be happening if we ended the prohibition on drugs where we ended the prohibition on alcohol.

[02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:42.920]
Cole 67 is no pot smoking hippie, but a former drug fighter who knows when to say when.

[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:45.240]
He and four others started leap three years ago.

[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:50.460]
It now has 3,000 members, cops like himself, judges like Shocket, Prison Ward's FBI, D.A. agents.

[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:55.840]
They've come to realize current drug policies are doomed to failure, a colossal waste of money in lives,

[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.560]
add Anthony's name to the list.

[02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:58.300]
Right, Michael?

[02:40:58.380 --> 02:40:58.500]
No.

[02:40:58.640 --> 02:40:59.620]
Pretty good column, Mike.

[02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:00.380]
Nice going, Mike.

[02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:02.620]
No one to be an honest person or domo.

[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:04.520]
Oh, anyway, here's the sweep off.

[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:05.520]
Good.

[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:07.460]
Yeah, that's the case you weren't listening last week.

[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:10.340]
What was it Thursday when at SWAT team guy called in?

[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:11.880]
Yeah, he was a drug dealer.

[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:15.160]
Wow, he's left you left wing spin-meister, is he all right?

[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:16.260]
Right.

[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:17.660]
Thought of being your dad, baby.

[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:19.380]
Yeah, we had a scale here.

[02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:20.860]
We had a little digital scale.

[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:21.980]
Oh, boy.

[02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:26.900]
No coke, no heroin, no meth, but nevertheless, he's dead.

[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:29.780]
Father and son win French piggis wheel off.

[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:30.900]
Oh, how perfect that the French.

[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:32.560]
Oh, what a piggis wheel off.

[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:33.460]
Oh, brother.

[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:35.780]
Oh, brother.

[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:40.560]
Johann and Olivier Rousselle's performance climax to make a cavity of oinxen grunts,

[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.180]
unleashing an explosion of applause.

[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.280]
But it was only after lengthy jury deliberations that their hopes were confirmed.

[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:50.580]
The father and son team were French's official piggis wheeling champions for 2005.

[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:55.380]
The judges headed by a former champion have been impressed by their vocal limitations of pigs

[02:41:55.380 --> 02:42:00.400]
and all for the required categories, reflecting key milestones of poor scene existence

[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:05.000]
from noisy farmland birth to death under the knife by a suffering and inevitably mating.

[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.660]
France is handful of fate poor.

[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:08.880]
I'm hoping you say that.

[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.460]
I know nothing about French and I'm very proud of it.

[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:15.820]
Or crazy festivals attract a regular cult following and throngs of incredulous holiday makers.

[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:18.920]
One fate features in a claimed line contest.

[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.500]
Another boasted distance spitting competition.

[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.480]
Oh, the frog should have no problem doing that.

[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:28.220]
But the annual pig festival and French pig-squeeding championships in Trees-Sier Bra,

[02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:33.160]
a remote farming village in the foothills of the Pyrenees, are announced to be in a class of their own.

[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:36.800]
Beside the pig-squeeding, they are awards in the Sunday competition for picking out.

[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:41.940]
This year's winner ate 1.2 meters nearly 4 feet of blood sausage and under 5 minutes

[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:44.300]
and heavy gambling in the final 8 piglet race.

[02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:50.580]
Stepping up to the record and hastily improvised pig-off.

[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:50.960]
Wait a minute.

[02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:51.640]
What?

[02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:54.380]
Madonna just broke several bones in a horse-right-back riding accident.

[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:54.740]
Too bad.

[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:55.440]
Bitch.

[02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:58.140]
Stepping up to the microphone and hastily improvised pig-off.

[02:42:58.300 --> 02:43:00.940]
It's the decision whether the competition had been taken only the night before.

[02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:06.220]
The Roussells let rip with a chorus of uncannily realistic squeals, grunts, and snuffles.

[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:07.440]
What is a snuffle?

[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:12.420]
Before the 500-strong audience topped with a delicately choreographed courtship scene.

[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:12.860]
Ooh.

[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:14.880]
Now that must be the one from Deliverance.

[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:17.080]
Wasn't that a courtship scene?

[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:19.720]
Newcomers to the contest.

[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:23.900]
Beat six other finalists including regular contenders Jean-Paul Louge.

[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:27.400]
But they've very modestly downplayed their win as they wanted to collect first prize.

[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:30.900]
A whole pig butchered and cured with traditional local methods.

[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:32.080]
I don't even like that.

[02:43:32.180 --> 02:43:33.940]
Leave it to them a frog, sound them pipsies.

[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:39.140]
A man was shot by police twice in the same shoulder at two different times on the same night in college park Georgia.

[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:39.760]
You see this?

[02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:40.180]
No.

[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:41.860]
Talk about having bad luck.

[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:45.000]
This is worth them going to Woodbine and having somebody else get the good machine-mind.

[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:50.820]
The girlfriend of 33-year-old Kennyanna, Bostic called police when they domestic violence complaint early Saturday.

[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:54.820]
But Bostic, one of his kinder old Bostic, was gone when officers arrived.

[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:58.880]
He returned soon after but when officers ordered him to turn off his car engine he sped off.

[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:01.040]
Barely avoiding an officer who dived out of the way.

[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:04.620]
An officer fired through the car's passenger window hitting Bostic in the shoulder.

[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:05.840]
Every Bisco?

[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.240]
I don't even know what it is.

[02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:07.580]
Oh.

[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:10.400]
It's like what's that other like chocolate powder oval team?

[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:11.120]
Oh, okay.

[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:11.840]
All right.

[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:12.160]
Sure.

[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:14.820]
I like eating oval team with a spoon right there.

[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:15.620]
Just dip your finger.

[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.940]
Please change them to the Atlantic Metropolitan Area Atlanta Atlantic Metropolitan Area College Park Georgia.

[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:23.940]
Until Bostic returned to his girlfriend's apartment complex where he crashed his car set out on the foot.

[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.940]
An officer caught up with him and ordered him to hold up his hands.

[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:28.380]
He refused to show his hands.

[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:31.820]
They turned abruptly at the officer and the officer struck him in the same bad shoulder.

[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:32.780]
How do you like that?

[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:38.920]
He was treated and released being held on charges of aggravated assault on a police officer, criminal trespass and traffic violations.

[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:41.260]
A damn thing good thing he didn't have like a pot scare.

[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:44.020]
This is the main event.

[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:45.680]
Yeah.

[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.080]
Yeah.

[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:51.980]
Because after the beat goes off the second time and it just sits there and like continues, um, simmers, simmering and warming.

[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:54.060]
Heaps at warm and the brown worse too.

[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:55.900]
Anyway, what do we got?

[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.180]
We made our 600 votes on the pool like falling off the log.

[02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:58.580]
No problem.

[02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:01.100]
We could have gone for 700 if Joshua would have leaned on a real heavy.

[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:02.240]
Well, I pushed for six.

[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:03.140]
You did what?

[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.080]
I pushed for six.

[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:04.620]
We got it.

[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:05.840]
Yeah, 622.

[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.100]
Last time I checked.

[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:08.320]
Anyway, here's what we got.

[02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:11.240]
Who's the all-time ugliest male celebrity movies radio and TV?

[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.360]
Marty Feldman, 119.

[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:14.400]
Funny though.

[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:15.780]
See, it's one thing if you're ugly.

[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:15.920]
Right.

[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:16.320]
You're funny.

[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:17.000]
It helps.

[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:17.620]
Some guy.

[02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:20.260]
If you're ugly and you're not funny and then you've got the tourists.

[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:21.760]
Marty Feldman, 119.

[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.440]
The Humper Hank Over 83.

[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:25.060]
He didn't be funny.

[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:27.280]
Well, I love it 63.

[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:29.760]
Man, he is just, uh, I'm sorry.

[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:30.780]
What is it?

[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:31.740]
Where is it?

[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:32.320]
Where is it at?

[02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:34.220]
Moe Howard, David in 46.

[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:35.020]
He's standing by.

[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:35.620]
He's coming up next.

[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:37.240]
It looks a lot better without the muskrat.

[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:38.900]
Ron Jeremy 37.

[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.160]
Neil Rogers 32.

[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:41.800]
Right on Ron Jeremy's back.

[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:43.560]
What a grotesque thought that is.

[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:44.920]
Maybe I'll pass on the bratwurst.

[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:46.680]
Carl Maldon 26.

[02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:48.940]
I can't believe you don't know who Phil Silver's was.

[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:49.280]
Who?

[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:54.620]
Do a Google right now on Phil Silver's and like click on, um, like, uh, Sergeant Philco.

[02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:56.820]
As soon as you see the picture, you know who that was.

[02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:57.320]
All right.

[02:45:57.500 --> 02:45:57.780]
Do it.

[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:00.080]

World's Zitface.

[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:03.900]
What a pockin' focus.

[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:05.600]
Don I'm a 17.

[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:08.440]
I bet you nobody has seen that when we, uh, once upon a time in America.

[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:10.720]
When next time you have 708 hours free, you're watching.

[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:11.140]
It's good.

[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:12.840]
Uh, Owen Wilson 17.

[02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:13.820]

Phil Henry 10.

[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:20.800]
Are you sure Edward James almost nine looks almost human.

[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:21.500]
Oh, that's right.

[02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:23.380]
Oh, that guy.

[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:24.220]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:25.460]
We're talking about the Jackson and the ball.

[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:26.980]
It's a mad mad mad mad world.

[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:27.460]
Right.

[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:28.700]
WC Fields 9.

[02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:30.440]

Uh-huh.

[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:32.940]
Oh, he should be.

[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:33.940]
