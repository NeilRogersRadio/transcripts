[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780]
Vatican right exactly. We didn't know it's not dry or bad. Yeah, oh, we did do a hell of a good job of sweet

[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.480]
You must have had some fantastic carpeting there in the of Vatican because they swept all of that

[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.000]
Peter file stuff under the carpet again nice job

[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.160]
Keep using that body wash. It's great. I like to do one too

[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.820]
Well, do your room a steam if I ever see if I ever see a bar of soap anywhere near my shower man

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.020]
I'm gonna like race keen

[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.500]
Okay, sweetheart have a great day. Take care you too. Well pick your prepare a shower tone is that you can manipulate the soap with no

[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.700]
I don't want them any for the soap at least to get it into the garden. Oh no

[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.040]
Seriously just take a there's some clean extra piece of a water turl of paper and you grab that thing and it out

[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.080]
He even there you go far a fat

[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.480]
No, I was grossed out when I saw that and why would anybody need to like open up a thing of soap when there's like six different

[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.640]
Now I mean you name it. I got the aroma therapy once he's talking about it

[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.440]
I got the nicest St. Ives apricot body wash. There's like mix and match whatever you like. Okay, whatever

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.300]
You like you know, I'm gonna get a separate bottle and pour the body wash into it bottle with a pump soap is out

[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.920]
Okay, I hate to break the news to you. Sof is out. It's passing throw it away

[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.720]
1057 a Q.A.M. How come that didn't work? I give up why didn't it work in the wrong line? Oh

[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.060]
How the hell did that happen that must be an act of God because I didn't touch not

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.840]
When it comes to

[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.160]
Cool

[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.580]
He started

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.020]
And made me

[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.260]
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.

[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.060]
As time went by, his earthly means compromised his choice.

[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.060]
He found the way to get really by altering young boys, father of juice, and food.

[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:20.800]
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.

[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.560]
He was happy and gay till he got close by some title tale.

[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.180]
Then the Vatican said, everyone off and he didn't have to go to jail, father of juice.

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:45.400]
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, you've heard of juice, altering for a day.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.980]
They sent him to a priest retreat where the genu flagged him prey.

[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.280]
If it was you or it was me, they'd lock us up and throw the keys away.

[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:10.040]
Father of juice, amen, fun, holy food, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.840]
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, father of juice, amen, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.

[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.560]
Something like a bomb, it's 11.02 at 5.60 W.Q.A., and it's smoking.

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.520]
Well, they have two holes.

[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.120]
Oh, speaking of that, about one in five ninth graders report having had oral sex

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.820]
and almost a third say they intended triad during the next six months.

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.460]
A small study of teens in Duke California Schools reports.

[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.720]
The teenagers average age was 14.5, also say oral sex is less risky, more common, more separable for their age, group than intercourse.

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.120]
The researchers surveyed 580 ethnically diverse perverse ninth graders into California public schools.

[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:58.960]
Girls and boys reported similar experiences and opinions about oral sex, which surprised the studies lead author Bonnie Halpern Felscher, associate professor of pediatrics of the University of California San Francisco.

[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.020]
I think the stereotypes don't exist as much anymore, she said.

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.240]
Girls and boys both see oral sex as not being a big deal, et cetera, and so on.

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.380]
It goes on and on and on, but we don't want to get too deeply into that, do we?

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.220]
No, not under the present climate under which year we live and operate.

[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.080]
I'll say that 5.6.7, let's see if we can get some causes as good as the ones in the first hour, okay?

[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.200]
I think there were a bunch of your first grade, the alter boys calling that first hour.

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.120]
5.6.7.05.60? Why are they first grade?

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.920]
Because of the Pope ain't there no more to lend them a helping hand.

[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.020]
5.6.7.05.60 on the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.360]
WNQYM, hello.

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.880]
I'm kind of nervous, but...

[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.000]
Yeah, never less, I know. WNQYM, hello.

[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.540]
Morning.

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.060]
Yes, sir, good morning. Where is this?

[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.440]
The bonus, yes. Is this the new Roger Show?

[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.340]
Yes, sounds like it.

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.340]
Very good.

[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.980]
We answered you have like a pizza thing going on.

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.880]
Yeah, that was last week, two weeks ago, yeah.

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.940]
Right, two weeks ago.

[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.580]
Well, he mentioned my restaurant, this is Sarah's pizza.

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.080]
Right.

[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.500]
We're still here and we're still doing this favorite pizza.

[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.740]
125th and what?

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.040]
125th, Easter Biscayne.

[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.580]
Right.

[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.040]
We're still there, we go.

[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.280]

[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.960]
We've got that, that Pope's pastry pizza that we make for him.

[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.800]
Excellent, we'll listen, have a season pace off.

[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.120]
Yeah, two, I'll go for pace off.

[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.580]
Okay, and don't forget happy tissue book too.

[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.880]
Okay, give the Pope a kiss on a way out too, can't hurt.

[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.040]
Oh my god.

[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.060]
Exactly, okay, see.

[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.180]
Yeah, I think he said, Koshmer and talk of something like that.

[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.360]
Wow, that was great.

[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.520]
Well, that's good, no, Sarah's pizza.

[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.300]
That was good stuff.

[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.560]
Remember, I think they brought some bite of Koshmer pizza.

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.300]
Absolutely, very thin, every now and then.

[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.760]
And it was Koshmer didn't have all that tray stuff on it like there

[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.640]
with a meat and cheese.

[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.960]
Ooh, you'll definitely rotten hell of you, tray pizza.

[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.100]
That's what Gary Sarnas says.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.660]
So anyway, Greg has been evidently, I have another inquisition to find out

[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.060]
who said those facts is.

[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.780]
They're from outside the building from P.V. Lenny.

[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.100]
Well, they say that's a large bird.

[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.100]
Maybe he wants to give them a cash reward.

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.120]
Mark Eisenberg.

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.740]
No.

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.760]
That crants.

[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.640]
Yeah, remember they said nice things about it.

[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.460]
But it was being sarcastic, don't you understand?

[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.660]
Just trying to stir the pot.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.120]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.200]
W.A.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.880]
Feed me, baby, I'm hungry.

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.260]
W.A.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.820]
Neil, out of your back, you've got to go to Jackson's on Las Olas.

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.520]
And the only reason why that didn't get any votes on your check-up.

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.280]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.560]
People can't afford this.

[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.920]
What?

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.480]
What?

[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.920]
Wasn't that, how do we get back into this again?

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.680]
It was two weeks ago.

[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.040]
All of a sudden, now it's said, well, I'm not going anywhere for food.

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.660]
How do you like that?

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.840]
I'm not going into anybody's house for dinner.

[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.140]
Thanks to my friend, Ken Halpern, from an action level for picking me up

[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.520]
and taking me back next week and all of that to the airport.

[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.860]
But I'm not going to your house for dinner.

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.880]
And don't take it personally.

[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.440]
I'm not going to anybody's house for dinner.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.420]
I'm not going to restaurants.

[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.500]
I'm not doing these things.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.840]
Just when I was starting to feel like almost too many

[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.740]
and look at you, but a little who me, even with the balding eyes.

[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.480]
No, seriously, I mean, I'm not going to get stuck there.

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.940]
Well, not at your back, you've got to go here.

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.040]
Look, I saw the Humpern there on Saturday at the Florida Derby.

[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.340]
I watched that with Great This May.

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.780]
And remember that song, June is vusting out all over.

[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.640]
Well, that's what kept running through my mind.

[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.800]
Eating in all of these restaurants and just shoveling down all these big meals

[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.720]
that is not the way to survive and stay alive.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.540]
Just ask my good friend, Fat Rich, he'll tell you.

[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.220]
By the way, I didn't go to his funeral either.

[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.360]
I never even saw a death notice on his obituary.

[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.000]
I never, never made it.

[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.980]
Of course, I didn't go looking.

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.980]
But I did.

[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.680]
I went for days and days and didn't see it.

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.920]
I kept looking under Rich Lackawitz.

[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.820]
I kept looking under Fat Rich from the New Roger Show.

[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.600]
Couldn't fight a thing.

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.020]
None of his names, huh?

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.220]
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.820]
When did you get busted for drugs and...

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.400]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.520]
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.

[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.580]
Hey, Niels, you catch that Bristol NASCAR race this weekend?

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.420]
No, yeah, it was great.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.520]
Water race, baby.

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.100]
Yeah, okay.

[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.620]
560, 7.0560.

[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.840]
Tom 560.

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.100]
What are your bulls in your eyes for?

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.840]
Now you get like me.

[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.360]
You got all the other information there.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.860]
Jesus.

[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.720]
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.

[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.780]
Hi, I need a job.

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.300]
Okay, good.

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.360]
Yeah, you need one, all right.

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.920]
You need a hack job is what you need.

[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.760]
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.560]
Yes, Anne on the mobile.

[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.900]
What is the Anne on the mobile?

[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.800]
You don't sound like Anne.

[00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.180]
Oh, Anne.

[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.500]
Oh, Anne, how you doing, Anne?

[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.100]
Yeah, good.

[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.980]
How do you guys...

[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.660]
I'd like to talk to Neil.

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.400]
You're speaking to him.

[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.020]
Yeah, I'll hold.

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.200]
You're speaking to him, Anne.

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.960]
I'd like to speak to him.

[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.000]
Yeah, I would like to speak to him.

[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.240]
He knows.

[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.240]
He knows, no?

[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.580]
Yes.

[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.480]
He just being a schmuck?

[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:10.740]
Yes.

[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.260]
Okay.

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.100]
You're an idiot, Aaron.

[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:12.580]
Thank you.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:12.960]
Okay.

[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.120]
560, that was it.

[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.800]
That was our last call.

[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.040]
560, 7.0560.

[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.840]
I can get to my pile here or stuff, but good.

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.120]
No, I'm not good.

[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.480]
While I'm here, I don't want to go through all of this stuff.

[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.880]
It's more fun to be in touch with these people.

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.080]
Or a distance, start touching from a safe distance.

[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.880]
Can't you tell?

[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.420]
It's a bad news about Jerry Falwell.

[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.000]
He's getting a little bit better, so that's a bad.

[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:32.520]
David.

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.500]
Here's the fact that when I was trapped in Catholic school for eight years, I was told

[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.160]
that if we were good when we died, we'd go to heaven, and we'll be made whole again.

[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.420]
For example, if you're in one like a man, you get your missing leg back in heaven, so that Jews get their...

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.800]
Good Jews get their foreskin back.

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.580]
Good question.

[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.360]
That's a good question.

[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.820]
That it is.

[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.540]
Oh, boy.

[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.540]
We'll have work on it.

[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.440]
Let's see.

[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.140]
Pull idea.

[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.200]
What movie?

[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.880]
Oh, no.

[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.800]
Okay, so.

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.740]
One movie, are you most looking forward to this year?

[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.760]
No.

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]
How do we know that?

[00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.900]
How do we know what we're looking at the world?

[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.460]
We're looking at the world.

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.540]
I'll let you know.

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.420]
Finding Neverland.

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.960]
Neverland.

[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.180]
So you didn't watch it at all, because I wanted a review.

[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.780]
I watched Little Bits and Pieces when Johnny Depp was on the screen.

[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.380]
Of course I did.

[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.940]
He was just like they're looking at him, but then I didn't put the headset.

[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.700]
I know.

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.840]
I'll check it out on cable.

[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.760]
It did look too interesting.

[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.020]
David, a QAAM, hello.

[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:18.660]
Yeah.

[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.220]
Although Ruben Ciera was in it.

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.940]
I got one thing to say about how he rose.

[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.600]
How he rose.

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.480]
Who's how he rose?

[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.700]
You tell me.

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.420]
I have no idea.

[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.700]
David, a QAAM, hello.

[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.480]
How you doing?

[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:31.980]
How you doing?

[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.640]
Pretty good.

[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.340]
Oh, how he rose.

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.320]
How he rose.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:34.880]
How he rose.

[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.260]
How he rose.

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.420]
How he rose.

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.120]
How he rose.

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.420]
Yeah.

[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.700]
Oh, this right about that fight.

[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.500]
That's right.

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.640]
The big brawls coming at 155 this afternoon right out in the corner of Ivesdurian441.

[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.700]
Right in front of the truck sub center.

[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.380]
Should wait till tomorrow so I can bring my camera.

[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.820]
Okay.

[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.180]
WQAAM, hello.

[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.480]
I want to vote on the poll.

[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.040]
Whatever it is.

[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.580]
Yeah.

[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.560]
The poll is your out.

[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.220]
That's the poll.

[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.440]
Are you out in the answer with your unanimous?

[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.400]
You notice the disrespect that this audience shows here.

[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.300]
The holy father.

[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.660]
Right.

[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.500]
Just passed away.

[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.360]
You can't even turn on the food channel.

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.220]
Now without seeing specials on the Pope did this and a Pope ate that and a Pope has

[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.080]
been a rest of his yet.

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.900]
And exactly.

[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.180]
And look at that.

[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.540]
We're drowning in a sea of poppouris.

[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.200]
It's what we're doing.

[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.840]
That's good.

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.260]
Yeah.

[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.760]
Drowning in a sea of poppouris.

[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.960]
And I don't smell too good.

[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.900]
I'll give it to you there right now.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.060]
Just in madness.

[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.300]
And again, this goes to show if the Dalai Lama would have croaked would we hit like five minutes

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.960]
coverage on it?

[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.140]
No.

[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.960]
If the chief rabbi, the head Mashkiyach or whatever they come over there in Jerusalem, if he

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.680]
would have croaked would they have like two seconds on it?

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.040]
No.

[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.440]
If Pat Robertson died, we had like ten minutes on that and it would have been too much.

[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.060]
It went very foul while croaks which hopefully we very soon will have like ten minutes on that.

[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.280]
But the Pope man, the whole world was supposed to like goosefab, well there's the swish guard

[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.980]
and he perdi.

[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.220]
Huh?

[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.980]
And they have makeup on.

[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.620]
Did you see that?

[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.500]
No, no.

[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.620]
They have makeup on like clowns in a circus.

[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.020]
I mean that kind of makeup like Ruzgen mascara and little lipstick.

[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.560]
Oh my god.

[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.880]
Oh, it's a whole new moldy.

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.960]
WQAM, hello.

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.580]
Yes, hey good afternoon Neil.

[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.080]
Good afternoon.

[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.520]
Good evening.

[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.460]
Yeah, just a fight for rare visit for a few days.

[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.900]
And this is the welcome I get.

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.060]
This is this is your material.

[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.760]
This is what you got.

[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.160]
This is what you got.

[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.440]
Of course we are following guilty.

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.720]
We want to apologize again for a squeaky being on for Hank this morning.

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.440]
It was an absolute emergency.

[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.760]
Our intermediate management for people say hopefully never happen again.

[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.620]
At least not while I'm around.

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.480]
Oh, not in.

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.360]
Oh, brother.

[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.580]
And you see what we're getting now.

[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.720]
Let's blame him for it.

[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.840]
Or maybe it's anticipating that's right.

[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.360]
That's it.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.160]
By the way, Moll knows he knows man.

[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.160]
We just kicked ass on Friday with that big trend.

[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.340]
We had solid in the morning.

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.960]
Oh, you don't have rock solid on here.

[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:40.960]
That's what you don't have.

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.520]
Oh, okay.

[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.320]
I'm making the list.

[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.240]
Oh man.

[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.700]
What's the name of number?

[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.780]
Belsenar 39.

[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.080]
Rock solid.

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.080]
No wonder I don't feel.

[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.120]
I'm a little, you know, lost here.

[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:50.580]
Huh?

[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.480]
Is it in here?

[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:51.840]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.640]
Rock solid.

[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.260]
Aridis.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.660]
A little bit lower right now.

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.280]
Tool free.

[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.920]
One triple eight four eight three loan.

[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.120]
That's one eight eight four eight three loan.

[00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.740]
That's the main man.

[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.760]
This team put you into mortgage.

[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.580]
It meets your needs.

[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.620]
Avoid going to the wrong.

[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.860]
Or maybe being turned down because you call the wrong number.

[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.860]
Call the main man.

[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.240]
Exceptance cap or mortgage today.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.700]
One triple eight four eight three loan.

[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.180]
That's one eight eight eight four eight three loan.

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.800]
And don't forget every time they close alone.

[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.640]
A portion is donated to kids in distress.

[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.260]
So why would you want to call anybody?

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.500]
You also avoid the bait and swish.

[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.420]
Call the main man.

[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.540]
Anthony Calleander.

[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.420]
So today, Tool free one.

[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.360]
They say we never to the cold.

[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.840]
1118, you know, how difficult would it be for muff or clearance or both to go to the

[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.280]
morning wrecking crew in there?

[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.160]
The board often say, you know, when a hands-lapse break is over there like at 56 and 957, open

[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.540]
that pot all the way open.

[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.500]
Not just a little crack, you know, not the.

[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.900]
But like, yeah.

[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.280]
Excellent.

[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.320]
That's what you sounded like this.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:14.660]
Yeah.

[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.140]
I mean, why not?

[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.380]
Because they can't hear a damn thing anyway because they're just cracking it a little bit.

[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.960]
They got a little crack problem there and a more.

[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.840]
How difficult would you be for?

[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.560]
Right.

[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.800]
You should live so long.

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.480]
He never stole it for eight three and one or seven.

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.260]
I couldn't give a shaman about 98.

[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.500]
He preached bigotry in ignorance 83, which of course is the correct answer.

[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.000]
As close as they'll come to letting anybody say anything like that, they'll say, well,

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.660]
he was a little bit too socially conservative.

[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.320]
Yeah.

[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.560]
But once every six hours they'll let somebody sneak one of those lines in there and other

[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.860]
than that, it's all just falling and carrying on.

[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.500]
As if the whole world is interested in as much a getchke's over there.

[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.620]
I just, it's amazing.

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.220]
Or they'll mention it like it was a good thing.

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.200]
Well, you know, he stuck to his guns with a lot of controversial issues.

[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:52.640]
Right.

[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.480]
He preached bigotry in ignorance 83.

[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.400]
That's the right answer.

[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.380]
He was a decent, you know, as opposed to indecency 76 and he was a snappy dresser 41 out

[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.760]
of the first 549 vote.

[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.580]
Here's the fact that says this goes to show you the kind of irreverent bastards we got

[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:06.940]
out there.

[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.040]
As a veteran of 13 years of Catholic education, I have to say your comment on the church

[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.100]
is being occult is absolutely correct.

[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.260]
Do we have that on here?

[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.340]
We have that either, do we?

[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:15.640]
Absolutely.

[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.240]
Just put it in your erector, huh?

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.320]
You can also do it.

[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.100]
Recko, mo!

[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.780]
Were there crucifix on the end?

[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.000]
I'm not saying a word.

[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.760]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.060]
Go back to Canada.

[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.580]
Okay.

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.920]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.600]
Maybe sooner than you think.

[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.620]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.500]
Hello, Neil.

[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.620]
Sir, you guys are so correct.

[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.680]
I mean, so much can be said about the church.

[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.860]
I just limited it to this.

[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:45.800]
When the Nazis were stealing all those great worth of art during the Nazi regime, the church

[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.060]
was buying it for pennies from the dollar behind everybody's backs.

[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:50.280]
Yeah.

[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.800]
Okay, that's just one thing for information out there.

[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.340]
Bad for business though to be talking to stuff, it's very bad for business.

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.280]
Oh, it's terrible.

[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.880]
It's like all those tabaldasters out there.

[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.300]
They swept that under their good because it was bad for business and costing them a fortune.

[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.740]
And there was almost nothing else on it.

[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.240]
Higher though.

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.960]
Thank you, sir.

[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.400]
And Jimmy totally missed the point.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.440]
And that is I'm sure that there are many, many, many other important things going on

[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:13.700]
in the world.

[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.180]
For example, oil prices have just reached an all-time high at $58 of barrel.

[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.380]
People are paying $2.5 to $3 and more for a gallon of gas.

[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.720]
And there are people dying over in Iraq like craze, including more over the weekend.

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.360]
And I would think that a lot of people with even just one I would have, they want to

[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.300]
find out what's happening in the world, should have a little bit of a choice as opposed

[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.780]
to this non-stop feeding else.

[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.620]
You're the one that everybody would watch.

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.060]
Yeah, the panic is what I think one of them is seeing that.

[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.620]
But I guess that's the fact, right?

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.220]
Because if the ABC let's say doesn't show it, then you might leave them and go watching

[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.320]
out somebody else and get them.

[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.060]
God for great.

[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.500]
That's right.

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.120]
God forbid.

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.420]
God forbid.

[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.160]
I wonder if God's going to be pissed off.

[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.220]
I'm going to be worshipping America tonight.

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.520]
Oh, dammit.

[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.500]
You better cut that out, man.

[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.120]
You're going to be burning the hell pretty soon.

[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.760]
Brimstone in Hellfire, I can smell it.

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.000]
Rick, who's another chronic factor, says, let's not forget the dark age.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.040]
He has 800 years of no technological advances.

[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.000]
Who knows how advanced?

[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.180]
Pope was a little chubby there before all of it.

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.480]
He lost a lot of weight in recent things.

[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.500]
Well, yeah, that hospital diet does it every normal macaroni and cheese.

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.920]
W.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.660]
How you doing?

[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.040]
I'm sick of the pope, Nio.

[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.200]
I just want to voice my opinion.

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.140]
Queen Elizabeth, all these people have roles with no real job, no debt in society.

[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.400]
Yeah.

[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.240]
Royal family, who gives a crap about the world family?

[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:25.880]
I'm about any of them.

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.620]
Like a stuffy idiotic Brits.

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.120]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.480]
I'm a person.

[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.760]
I'm a person.

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.760]

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:46.800]
I'm a person.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.800]

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.900]
I'm a person.

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:46.900]

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:46.900]

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:46.900]

[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:47.580]
I'm a person.

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.480]
I'm a person.

[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.640]
I'm a person.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.180]
I'm a person.

[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.820]
I'm a person.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.680]
I'm a person.

[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.680]
I'm a person.

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480]
I'm a person.

[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.760]
Sweethearingham and being a real pro wrestler.

[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:14.760]

[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.780]
I've been beating him so hard

[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:16.780]

[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.480]
I've been beaten to 200.

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:18.460]

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.080]
Μoing fake commissionat sells my啊,

[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:19.720]
but right now, we have little stuff vibes today that you can grab down,

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:19.720]

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:19.720]

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:19.720]

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.460]
do it rock and roll and roll,

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:31.480]
His favorite show used to be Wonder Rama. He used to watch with his chimp and his Rama.

[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:38.180]
Like Peter Panie refused his to roll. I put the blame on his great father Joe.

[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.780]
Walking around never landing his PJs, putting the children in, oh Jesus, you're a better

[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:54.300]
wild part of that. I think you get added to it. I apologize. Wow, that is really bizarre. You are the truth.

[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.460]
Truth. You are truth. Well, anyway, we're going to have our big brawl out there on

[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.380]
441. We're going to be selling tickets here at about 1145, which is right now.

[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.740]
When you're going to be on a street corner selling tickets, going to be a wrap, have a big

[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.720]
raffle, play a little bingo there at honor of the Pope. Don't forget gambling is

[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.660]
evil unless it's church bingo, then it's okay. Because the money's going to the right thing to pay off all

[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.760]
them lawsuits. By the way, speaking of lazy people and fat people, which year is this?

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.140]
Agile TV is aiming to change away people watch TV with a voice control television control remote

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.920]
unit remote contract sort voice control. Sure. You may have to well flick it. The prompted

[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.780]
remote is designed to replace a convention remote control includes a talk button and

[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.640]
it built in microphone together with an infrared receiver used in conjunction with the existing

[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.960]
cable box. The remote control translates spoken commands into speech features that are

[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.640]
sent to the receiver and then to a small runtime application in the set top box. The

[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.780]
actual voice recognition is performed at the cable head on and on commodity PC based

[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.460]
Linux system. For 258. Remember we read that article. Yeah. Right. Your congressman. Right.

[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.080]
That's right. Right to your congressman say we're pretty pissed off and fired up and we want to hear

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.880]
QAM. And we're hearing this no a speaking English crap, which we already got more than enough of that in this

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:16.700]
market. WQAM. Hello. Carry who? WQAM. Hello. QAM. Oh, ah. Hello. Yes, sir. See, I knew there was

[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.460]
somebody good there. Here's me. You remember when the pub came to Miami way back in

[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.080]
Haiti. Sure. Greg Veeville was he was my modifying and whatever he was doing. Moderating.

[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.820]
You remember what happened. Yeah. You remember what happened that day when you guys were

[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.640]
on the air. No. Remember how remember when lightning hit your transit or did not you guys off the air?

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.420]
Must have been an act of God. You know what? That's what you said at the time. And then send it again.

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.240]
At least I'm consistent. Hey, we love you, man. Okay. Have a great life. You too. Yeah. I think Jim

[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.940]
Brosmer was on top of that. And Greg Veeville was the moderator in it. Yeah. Really?

[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.640]
I think that didn't surprise me. No, no, not this day. Because especially now we got the God squad.

[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.940]
I mean, we actually I think what we're going to have is a big war between the fundamentalist

[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.200]
Christians, the Bible, Thumping Born Against and the Catholic Church of Catholics.

[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.100]
Correct. They've been doing it for years like, you know, in Ireland, other places but colluding right now.

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.200]
No, they're not. No, they're not. They're they're at war for the they want the they want to take a hold of the reins.

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.540]
The pie. Yeah. They want the whole pie. They're like the Indians. They're not satisfied with their slice.

[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:23.840]
They want the whole pie with it without popper Roni pie without poppy Roni WQAM. Hello. Yeah. Hi, Neil. I shut my radio. Please.

[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:30.780]
There we go. You know, this this guy, this Pope, this guy, like the same crowd move like with Reagan who was great.

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.820]
They said he was great. Yeah. Of course he was. I mean, this guy, the Pope, he he presided over all the priests molesting

[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:46.280]
army's boys. Yeah. Nobody has ever you know, I know for getting into free passes, too. Yeah. And he would give more if he could be still.

[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.640]
I mean, what was his last act was boys for everybody? I don't know. Get out of jail.

[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:08.680]
Pope John Paul is gone. I just read he'd been hanging on by a friend when they found him in bed dead.

[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:22.860]
All the Catholics said they all said by Pope they said by Pope they said why did you have to go?

[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:35.280]
I told you so. I say I feel so bad. I'm gonna cry.

[00:21:35.280 --> 00:22:05.260]
I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go.

I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that

[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:47.040]
What is that? What is that? What is that? What is that?

[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.420]
That's the problem. Well, yes, come to Q. I. M. Hello.

[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.760]
You know, God. Yes, sir. Welcome back to the set pool. That is my life.

[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.900]
That's pool is the world, man. This is it. Two quick stories. One last week.

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.200]
I'm in the car with my girlfriend and you're about to sign off and you break the news with the the fake.

[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.860]
Number two, and then run it over while you're at it.

[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.460]
Number two, you did the you've always talked about fish food.

[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.000]
So I go to the supermarket last week. And I buy two small.

[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.360]
I don't know. Pints. That stuff is like crack, Neil. Yeah, that's right.

[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.160]
I ate one. The other was in the freezer and I passed it by every day.

[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.360]
And I'm going to eat it. No, I'm not going to eat it. I'm going to eat it.

[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.440]
No, I'm not going to eat it. Just either. All I got.

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.680]
Yeah, just either.

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.840]
Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it?

[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.460]
WQ I am. Hello. Yeah.

[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.780]
How come Jimmy Saffalo always sounds like a fairy?

[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.660]
Well, I probably call him up and ask you ferry. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the

[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.080]
horizon and singular. Why was that? What do you laugh at?

[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.480]
I never gave it a thought really. Well, why? Give me syphilis?

[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.840]
I don't want to get into that. Okay, he is whatever he is. I mean, he's got a wife.

[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.020]
And I don't know what the deal is. And I don't care. He's an okay guy.

[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.840]
Kind of boring, but he's an okay guy. WQ I am. Hello.

[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.900]
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay. Hey, Neil, are you going to be at treasure item?

[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.640]
Is one day? No. Are you? Come on, man. Yeah.

[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.860]
Are you? Yeah, man. Okay. You're going to be a big kiss right on the lips.

[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the is a wireless thing.

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.960]
They can have two birds. They want to have a color. Where are you driving today?

[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.420]
WQ I am. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Now that the boat died, you know, and

[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.620]
it was Polish. You know, all these things came up and everybody is coming with a

[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.960]
police jokes. Actually, I want to say that Polish are very smart people.

[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.460]
Do you know that they invented a toilet seat? Really? Did you know that?

[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.860]
No. And then they showed it to the Hungarian. They car a hole on it.

[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.840]
Have a nice day. That's older than he is. That's older than the

[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.400]
wireless older than toilets. Wow. That's older than John Krapper.

[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.080]
WQ I am. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Here's a go, sir. Did you have a

[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.900]
pro? Surrounded. Here's a go, sir.

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.720]
Come on. I wanted to know where you was going.

[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.440]
So I fought boy this morning with his walking stick and he said, be sure

[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.420]
to tell them about dial mattress. I said, okay. That's a good idea. Now what

[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.720]
he said? Something like that. Yeah. How about listening?

[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.620]
Besides stories about PD Lenny and about Skippy. He had a kid or whatever.

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.640]
See, these salespeople here, they think that we care about those.

[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.120]
I mean, PD Lenny had a different story. He's a different breed.

[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.860]
Kind of like a half breed. Look for it. But Skippy, I mean, he don't even

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.000]
exist as far as old. They're gone. What is it? He's like a non-factor.

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.620]
Anyway, dial mattress is a big factor for you because if your mattress is

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.480]
lumping, you want to get you a great new one. All you do is make one easy call to

[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.280]
So there's no risk. One 800 mattress has got more repeat customers than

[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.980]
And James, four 30 or five 50 people. He went here.

[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.420]
The bad date of quitsnithing glued.

[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.000]
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the TruHollywood celebrity music

[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.300]
biography profile story, they give us an introspective music that made us see

[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.540]
exactly how sucky things were in 1985. They were the Smiths.

[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:31.700]
So can we stop the interview? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I do these things all the

[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.540]
time. I mean, you're morisy, right? Yes. The guy from the Smiths? Yes.

[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.600]
I've had a solo career for many years now. Dude, I thought you were dead.

[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.160]
I thought you killed yourself for sure. Come on, you were so damn depressing.

[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.940]
How could you not kill yourself? You had to have at least wanted to kill yourself.

[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.220]
Did they send some other whiny, no-whole, Englishman in here just a fool me?

[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.180]
Look, I did know man, it's just so unfair. It's just not right that you are alive.

[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.780]
You know, I mean, what was that song about your girlfriend?

[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.580]
Girlfriend in a coma? Yeah, girlfriend in a coma. Oh, oh, damn.

[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.220]
Dude, when I heard that one, I wanted to slick my wrist. That's enough.

[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.380]
One and no from your feel sorry for me, Lyft.

[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.100]
And I wanted to take a header into a thrashing machine.

[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.760]
Hearing you sing made me want to lay myself down in front of a hammer.

[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.640]
Your music made me pray that a freaking serial killer would grab me and skin me alive,

[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.380]
hanging me from a meet-o until I slowly fled to death.

[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.020]
Whenever I heard your voice, nothing has. I don't need this.

[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.420]
Dude, what did I say?

[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.780]
But we're not doing the interview now? God, you're so depressing.

[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.600]
This myth, another reason it's a miracle we survived the 80s.

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.140]
It's a big, juicy, sapping, with, look at your business tonight.

[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.480]
Uninside the behind.

[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.600]
Dude, they ought to make your comeback because there are a lot of coma and be giant now, right?

[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.500]
Yeah, everything is timing. Everything in life is timing folks.

[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.600]
Should've thought of that soon.

[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.900]
Probably 18 to 560 WQA and we got Moa too. We got the Mad Dog if foe. What's not to like?

[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.080]
Here's a fact from Mark and Helen Dale Beach.

[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.380]
Helen Dale Beach, that's not to like. He says,

[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.680]
Hany Ellen George heard the Old Testament will be read of the Pope's funeral.

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.420]
You think they'll read the chapters regarding mass murder as a result of the alleged great flood?

[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.240]
The killing of man and woman and children who were sacrificed to appease God?

[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.720]
The condoning of slavery? The stoning of adulterers, women only of course?

[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.700]
In fantasize, partisize, a patricide, brother killing brother, cane and able,

[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.600]
self abuse, pluck out that eye, sexual mutilation, men cutting out their testicles,

[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.300]
those proof to God of their devotion, and on and on.

[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.220]
Great book, huh? The good book, baby.

[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.080]
Also my wife and fellow atheist grew up in South America.

[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.480]
At the age of 14 she figured out the Catholic Church was about two things, power and money.

[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.380]
Absolutely.

[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.400]
Her local and loving church responded by attempting to make her life miserable.

[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.920]
Fortunately she had a strong family that backed her decision to stay out of that house of hate.

[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.700]
Adios Nilo, thanks again for filling in for George.

[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.060]
No problem, Mark. Price is right.

[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.840]
Now Miguel just brought in and this is still in its original wrapping.

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.700]
Still taped up.

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.800]
So where did he get this?

[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.460]
Oh, I think that's one of our giveaways, as a matter of fact.

[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.060]
Oh, I see.

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.340]
So they certainly nobody here bought it.

[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.700]
Finding Neverland.

[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.820]
And now you found it.

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.300]
With Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and by the way, he's a pretty rinshius.

[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.240]
Yeah, no.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.680]
Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, in fact, I guess of the whole bunch.

[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.560]
And there it is.

[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.440]
Best picture of the year since the National Board of Review.

[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.540]
I got it in my hand right now.

[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.720]
Now do I take it home and watch it?

[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.720]
Do I take it back with me to T.O. and watch this?

[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.060]
On my high definition?

[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.160]
Well, we'll find out.

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.900]
I don't know what I want to get some reviews.

[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.800]
Award winners Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie.

[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.520]
Starting this magical tale about one of the world's greatest storytellers

[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.040]
and the people who inspired his masterwork Peter Pan.

[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.760]
Well-known playwright James Embiri, Depp finds his career across roads.

[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.140]
When his latest play flops and he and Daugler's question is future,

[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.180]
then by chance he meets a widow Winslet and her four adventurous boys.

[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.680]
Together they form a friendship that ignites the imagination.

[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.540]
He did a produce of Barry's greatest work.

[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.420]
And in Channing Big Screen, too, with an acclaimed cast of stars,

[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.100]
Finding Neverland has been hailed as one of the year's best motion pictures.

[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.800]
Yeah, somebody hailed it.

[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.760]
Oh, Michael Jackson.

[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.240]
I don't know.

[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.060]
Maybe he likes those boys.

[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.600]
Now seriously, I mean, Finding Neverland.

[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.580]
I mean, talk about time.

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.620]
I just have a little tacky right now.

[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.060]
Yeah, well, the way things are going right now.

[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.060]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:14.400]
I know.

[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.080]
Catch my drift.

[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:15.560]
Coincidentally.

[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.800]
Anywhere I'm still thinking, you know, girl on a coma, bring it back.

[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.020]
Which I'd have thought of that sooner.

[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a variety of singular wireless lines.

[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.760]
A marginal response here today at best, I would say.

[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.740]
By the way, we're praying for the hopper to be back tomorrow.

[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.320]
Wow!

[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.500]
That was really great.

[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.400]
The Rosary is later.

[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.300]
Yeah, I'm rubbing my rosary beads.

[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:34.860]
Very hard.

[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.180]
York, this is the 14 years of his life here.

[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.480]
And a Chris Blow it out, your ass.

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.720]
Chris Matthews there on the MSNBC.

[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.160]
No wonder nobody watches that crap.

[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.520]
W and Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.200]
Damn, peach to the media.

[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.880]
Yeah, and peach to media.

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.840]
I'm with you, Pally.

[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:48.860]
And peach all of them.

[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.540]
Butchered, raver, rubbing, lunatics.

[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.320]
On and on and on.

[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.840]
In a feeding frenzy.

[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.140]
The holy father.

[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.520]
He ain't my holy father.

[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.960]
He ain't my unholy father.

[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.420]
My father was unholy enough.

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:00.580]
Fasted.

[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.120]
W and Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.680]
Back at you, dad.

[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.300]
W and Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.440]
Nill.

[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:07.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.920]
Damn, that time, if only you threw to you.

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.860]
Yeah, well, here you are.

[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.360]
Here you go.

[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.120]
Here's your big chance.

[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.780]
I listen to you every morning at work.

[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.100]
And I love you, man.

[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.000]
You're a wonderful show.

[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.260]
I am a wonderful show.

[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.260]
Yes, you are.

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.420]
I give you credit.

[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.140]
I don't know how you put up with someone before.

[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:21.360]

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.460]
But you get called.

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:22.920]
I know.

[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.240]
So what do you got, man?

[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.520]
I don't know what to think about.

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.820]
This is the whole Pope thing, man.

[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.600]
At first it's Terry and I spoke.

[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.160]
God, what else are they going to talk about?

[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.820]
Don't forget, Johnny Cockerman.

[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.860]
What does he, small potatoes?

[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.480]
Yeah, hopefully, maybe Bush's next.

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.340]
Hopefully.

[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.140]
Hopefully.

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.820]
God, I hope.

[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.580]
Hopefully.

[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.240]
Okay, thanks.

[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:40.580]
What do you say?

[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.000]
Who's next?

[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:41.640]
Right.

[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.360]
5670560.

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.500]
What do you say?

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.300]
I dumped it.

[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:45.940]
That's what he said.

[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.460]
I told you to earn the break.

[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.940]
Oh, now I see him.

[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:50.200]
Yeah.

[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:50.680]
He's mumbling.

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:50.960]
I know.

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.860]
I'm glad you were able to hear it.

[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:52.900]
That's all we did.

[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:53.700]
A little knockout.

[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.100]
A little knockout.

[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:54.720]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.160]
Just a joke.

[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.820]
I got the sentiment.

[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.120]
Right.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.060]
Oh, nice.

[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:57.560]
Very nice.

[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.540]
Okay, don't call us again.

[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.220]
Okay, keep listening.

[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.280]
We're glad you enjoyed it.

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.640]
But you're like a little bit like that.

[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640]
Okay, a little slow.

[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.060]
WNQAM.

[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.360]
Hello.

[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.200]
But the two guys there.

[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.260]
WNQAM.

[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.520]
Hello.

[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.780]
No, folks, folks.

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.220]
No, no, no, no.

[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:10.940]
WNQAM.

[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.520]
No red neck, right?

[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.380]
WNQAM.

[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:12.680]
Hello.

[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:13.460]
Okay.

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.020]
What do you know?

[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.720]
Just relax.

[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.840]
Just the guy's voice.

[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:17.980]
WNQAM.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.520]
Hello.

[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.700]
Sounded like Duford.

[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.140]
Like Ed Wood.

[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.960]
Ed Wood.

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:23.220]

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.840]
QAM.

[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:24.500]
Oh.

[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.060]
WNQAM.

[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.420]
Hello.

[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.400]
Hello, Neil.

[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:28.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:34.060]
I like that a bit you did for trying to get carry elected and stuff.

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.800]
And then a couple of summers ago when Penialist was trying to get that metro rail group.

[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:39.880]

[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.200]
But I think what we should really be worried about is not all these dead old crap as well.

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.780]
But the guys who got over in Iraq and Afghanistan that are getting blown up.

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.360]
Who are they?

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.060]
I don't know does anything going on over there.

[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.800]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.640]
We're going to ask you V drivers that don't they should hand out body bags with the gas station.

[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.080]
But these people can think about what they're doing to our father, sons, and daughters over there.

[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.620]
I'll do great.

[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.920]
Robbers driving them gas sucking SUVs, George.

[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.340]
We're going to give you a body bag out of way out of here today.

[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.040]
Don't blame me.

[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.700]
90 bells got one ready for you already.

[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.560]
There's nothing to do with mine.

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.500]
90 bells got one ready.

[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:12.940]
Okay.

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.460]
Body bag.

[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.460]
Your name's on it.

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.120]
He told me.

[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.080]
Come in to QAM.

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.460]
Hello.

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.240]
Hey, Neil.

[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.940]
Two good to meet you.

[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.260]
Thank you.

[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.200]
I have no idea what it was.

[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.760]
I'm just on the sofa.

[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.320]

[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.460]
Discussing.

[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.140]
Go test.

[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.420]
Go wash out your mouth with body wash.

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.460]
In fact, don't go wash out your mouth with soap.

[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.740]
Might as well do something useful for you.

[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.640]
I got no bar at home.

[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.360]
You can have fast.

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.700]
Take a bite.

[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:33.900]
QAM.

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.220]
Hello.

[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.120]
Hey, Neil.

[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:35.860]
It was going on, man.

[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.580]
How are you doing, pal?

[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.280]
I take this out.

[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.920]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.880]
Do you ever watch South Park?

[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.340]
No.

[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:40.920]
No.

[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.340]
Okay.

[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.520]
Well, you missed this week.

[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.020]
I don't remember.

[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.940]
I'm hopefully George saw it.

[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.580]
George, why did you say everything I really just said?

[00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:05.280]
I was just going to say, you know,

[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.560]

[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:31.700]
30.

[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.640]
That's there.

[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.580]

New York Sticks Cooked Order 2.

[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.660]
Top off, you didn't would deserve

[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.520]

[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.680]

[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.060]
as marshmallows,

[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.300]
of the decade and treats as well.

[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.060]
And don't forget,

[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.080]
you don't walk out of the Emerald Coast

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.020]

[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.320]
because they don't use any MSG.

[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.100]
You know, cornstarch,

[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.540]

[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.900]

[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.240]

[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.520]

[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.320]

[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.940]

Just about every street corner now,

[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.220]
I've got imitators,

[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.920]
but there ain't nothing like the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.300]

[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.160]

Well, that's why it had to be a virgin birth.

[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.060]
You wonder, of course.

[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.400]
All those virgin births.

[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.960]

[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.160]

[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.780]
All these virgin births.

[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.320]
That was part and part of all religions.

[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.440]
It was that it had to start with a virgin birth.

[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.360]
It was an act of God.

[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.480]
How dare you all be so insulting to us.

[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.880]
It's the Christmas season and you represent them as a Pope.

[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.200]

[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.680]
That's a fuzzle and anyway, here's the facts that says from Charles these

[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.480]
Faxes are I think some of these late they are coming from our friends across the street

[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.460]
That's okay, right come to dinner by the way, but kick your ass big time you ain't see nothing yet

[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:19.360]

That's what ductile music. Oh, they're doing a guy show. I said how would you know?

[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.060]
Fairy anyway, here's a fact he knows about guys. What would you say that?

[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:37.300]
It says Mr. Rogers I dare you to read this on the year as a sign of your reading selected emails

[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.420]
Well, first of all we don't do any emails. It's a fact

[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.340]
Yeah, see that it's a fact there is so much there

[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.580]
There was not that much difference between listening to Goldie on the earth

[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:49.060]
It's more and less than a hanged Goldie sounds like a five-year-old and Hank sounds as though he is drunk or just got out of bed

[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.380]
Hank can't speak either Charles. Yeah, so what's your point? So revolutionary

[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.440]
There's a big difference we like Hank

[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:01.180]
I like that a lot I held up a lot and Hank's got a big following out there

[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:07.200]
Okay, and then what's wrong with here and somebody that sounds a little in coherent or very in coherent as opposed to that sound see

[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.560]
That's what's objectionable. That's what we can't say that

[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:10.540]
Trill

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.040]

Okay, crying I can handle crying babies. It's annoying, you know, but crying I can handle but little kids don't cry

[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.820]

Here's your passion, but okay calm down now. Okay. You he then bastard you're gonna burn in hell

[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.200]
You'll see Cliffs says since the media wants to keep us all involved in the Pope's death

[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:37.980]
I think it's fair

[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.480]
We should all be involved in voting for a new Pope like the Pope idol if we vote for American Idol

[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.580]
Why not to put an Eric Idol the Pope idol and will stretch it out for weeks and then we'll all both smoke at the end George

[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:51.760]
Bies all right George will hook you up. How's that? That's right with the hose right

[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:58.840]
Could be a lot of smoke blow in fact is not the specialty of the church is blowing smoke sure no one does it like these guys

[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.340]
Right I could say something about altar boys there, but again

[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:07.700]
I better not not now George move along right five six seven oh five sixty and what is this Carl bird a Bernstein

[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.580]
A Woodward and Bernstein. Oh, he's the author of his holiness. He's trying to pedal his book

[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:17.160]
I'm not fostered by the church not foster you it but yeah Carl Bernstein

[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:21.520]
What is that all about I understand it all you got explain it to me. I don't want to find out

[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.840]
1256 at few a.m. And by the way in case you missed it Terry Shavoy still ain't saying much

[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.800]
What a contest for you

[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:39.980]
I'll bounce in your son of a bitch. Well, I wish was granted and I'm sure gonna miss listen to the Nile Roger's fair and balanced

[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.580]
Well, the two of you son of a bitch

[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:50.280]
You probably wondered why gasoline is three dollars a gallon although the experts say there's really no shortage and

[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:56.240]
Maybe you've also wondered why when the price of oil goes up your local station raises gasoline prices immediately

[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:04.480]
But when the price of oil goes down it takes forever for those gas prices to drop and maybe you've also wondered why the price of gas is at an

[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:11.100]
All-time high even though we've spent billions of dollars and thousands of lives to make Iraq our bitch

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.000]
Well now there's an oil company that tells you the truth

[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.800]
We're April fuels at April fuels. We're not afraid to tell you there's really no oil shortage

[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:28.680]
In fact half of our wells are shut down and we've got refineries running at less than half their capacity

[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:33.460]
Why so we can charge more of course at April fuels?

[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:39.880]
We don't care if our stations are colorful and well-lighted because you're gonna pay whatever we charge

[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.760]
At April fuels we believe in the law of supply and demand

[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.340]
We've got the supply so we make the demands

[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:56.060]
So remember the next time the president tells you we have to invade a Middle Eastern country or go under endangered wildlife

[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.900]
From a national park it's because of us

[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:04.040]
We're April fuels of the vision of Chevron oil

[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.680]
You better

[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:12.180]
101 at 560 WNM. I'm all how we're David whatever his name is coming along with two in the Mad Dog at four and then after that well

[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.200]
Now as far as Iraq is concerned speaking of that

[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.880]
It's interesting that one of the few areas I would agree with a Pope on was he was

[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.580]
vehemently against the war in Iraq the Iraq attack

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.740]
He was right on that spoke of it often and we hear almost nothing about that all these

[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:31.900]
Any trade-in words that are being spoken now non-stop on every American news outlet including even the

[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:36.220]
Discovery Channel is just incredible even on TV land

[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:40.260]
It's just everywhere and they say nothing no because that's just

[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.860]
It just don't fit in with the a plan right now

[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:48.100]
Because the Christian the organizing of America you know has to step aside for a moment so that the Pope

[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:51.240]
I mean that's all a part of it and it would convert all those people back over to likely

[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.380]
I know whatever separate jet bush

[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.980]
Well, she smelt it in that religion and it kind of

[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.780]

They're all gathered around in sweet water right now holding hands rubbing each other's beads W.D. Q.A. M. Hello

[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.720]
Neil yes, sir in his travels once he went to

[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.960]
Nicaragua during the Thunderous Triging and then you know even

[01:00:54.520 --> 01:01:00.860]
People with respect him in his speech, you know, he's gonna criticize the contrast, you know the terrorist murderers

[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.900]
Hires by the CIA. What have you been do that? What he

[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.880]
For an hour he talked and he mentioned stuff that took Chris at the revolution and

[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.660]
Crowd started to

[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.800]
Whistle and boo him and all and he turned the blue the holy father. Oh, yeah, they pulled the holy father

[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:23.140]
Holy Father turn be dread, you know, it didn't know how to handle that because wherever he went

[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.920]
Spreading his nose

[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.680]
Spreading his tone is bullshit everybody's just listening to him, you know all these moronic

[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.760]
Faithful graded, but this one he didn't know what to do with then finally he grabbed the microphone and yelled into it

[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.060]
Philancio now that people didn't want any more of that because he had enough Philancio during the Somoza regime

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.160]
And if the army wasn't there to safely would have clinched him right there and then wouldn't that have been something

[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.760]
That's the only only

[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.820]
Five millions of people in Africa would still be allowed today for all

[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.380]
Yeah, that's listen to his tone is bullshit about

[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:58.480]

560 505 60 pound 560 on the Verizon and singular Ridesline even of course he is going to agree

[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:11.020]
Yeah, you can't speak the truth. Okay, make no mistake about it. This is America. You cannot speak the truth

[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.780]
What's your take on Pope John Paul the tooth and we want the truth

[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:22.040]
886 votes look at a thousand like fall off the log today. How do you like that easy? What a phenomenal response and of course

[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.480]
That's because I'm such a heartless cool bastard. How could you say these because they're true then to a side chapel at the

[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.360]
Basilica and then prepared oh and I haven't seen an outfit like that now look at look at the array of outfits there the gold

Yeah, clothes closet. I'm talking about it. You know, it just it just gets me

[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.560]
I just can't imagine the average person if there is such a thing watching all of this just not being

[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.700]
Gross out by this display of absolute

[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.160]
Faggery you pretend you're not brainwash for it. Yeah, just just for a moment

[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.780]
Set aside all the brainwashing and the fact that your parents did evil things and put you to you know

[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:09.100]
Perky school, but just pretend that you're like a rational thinking human being and you look at all to say what a crock

[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:14.180]
A crowd whatever he was just saying there's tried like if you were walking on the street or the mall or if you opened your front door and

[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.540]

How'd you like to wake up next to a saddle like that every day huh? Yeah

That's why most men are in a screwed-up condition that they're in today is because they've been nagged all their lives

[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.440]
nagged by their mothers then nagged by their wives and their girlfriends all of them at the same time

[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.740]

Chomolestation's right because you see the way these things fit together

[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.520]

[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:07.820]
God it's just that's what's out there then as you're driving around you wonder what were these maniacs or this you call

[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:12.960]
Is driving and then you understand? Yeah, these are the people these these be the people our neighbors

[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.480]
Yeah, these are your neighbors. These are your friends and neighbors actually saw my neighbors across the street

[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.180]
Yeah, but there was like swapping cars with the Dave were took the old vet for a while and getting the new one

[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.840]

[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:32.260]
Now these are the people that had he is risen. Oh, whoa see that flag now. I'm waiting for the one to go up. It says he is fallen

[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:38.460]
Why for this one? Yeah, well, don't you think that would be appropriate? Sure. Oh, maybe he's rising too

[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:43.640]
No, no, you mean like maybe a cake. Well, they like a cake in the oven tip that board up a little more here

[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:49.000]
Yeah, yeah, and they're all wrong. Hmm. I don't think those people were rising in the ovens back during the day

[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.400]
You know when Pope pious to 12. How do you know? I don't think you're looking in there. They were for fallen

[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.340]
Yeah, I just watched all of these car nose and they're all greeting and the meeting and the eating and I'm thinking to myself

[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.840]
That's a cake club you wore

[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.780]
Yeah, well, I mean how how could anybody be so slow is not to realize that right like the guy said before a much old

[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.480]
Fat geckys is what it is

[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.740]
So they club you more dresses slippers right those little hats. Oh, sorry. Yeah, and it desired alter boys

[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.280]
Oh, by the way, speaking of religious nuts remember the story had last week about the

[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.120]
Pharmacies that didn't want to issue or the do much of orders for birth control yes

[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.440]
Illinois governor rod black and black goge of it

[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:31.620]
Yesterday issued an emergency rule that would require pharmacies to accept and fill prescriptions for contraceptives without delay

[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.640]
Without Tom delay after a growing number of complaints nationwide that some pharmacists are refusing to dispense

[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.760]
Birth control pills in the morning after pill

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.560]
America is suffering from a

[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.680]
festering from a disease a

[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.000]
Religious fervor and just lunacy that's just sweeping the country the all-new dark ages

[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.160]
The God squad is taking over America like old jubich also established a toll free number that residents can call the report

[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.780]
Refusals by pharmacies turn them in turn their ass in okay

[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.900]
Reproductive rights groups here all the dissections the first statewide regulation to address the issue

[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.140]
We're hopeful that governors across the country will follow his leads in answer Nancy Keenan

[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:11.800]
National president of the name route pro-choice america and I'm sure that our fat ass governor will follow his lead not

[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.360]
Not no, he's too busy some more those choose life bumper stickers

[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.460]
I mean the license but whatever the room. I mean he couldn't get that

[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.040]
Chew back into teres puppets. So he's gotta do something further what yeah, he couldn't get the old jub back in there

[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.820]
He'd probably to get to the old lube tube. That's right. That's what Randy says the old jub

[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:31.360]

You know nobody knows who he is even George don't know who he is even I don't know who he is

You know with the steroids and he's penalized me go those who is a 10-day suspension

[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.680]
Even the general man who the Yankees last night they asked him oh by the way. That's a hot babe. They got there in a broadcast

[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:04.880]

But Sam something she's pretty amazing at the fox. No, Sam her name is Sam. Okay, but anyway

[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.960]
So she's asking the gym in the Yankees now is that 10 games or 10 days and he's like

But then and the rules don't include amphetamines or heroine or anything else

[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.920]

[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.360]
Moody. There's some real mung in this joint. Well, maybe I won't be able to stay all week

[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:58.900]

Wtqam hello

[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:17.340]
No, the late one Wtqam hello. I don't know. Okay, sir. I was wondering

[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:24.800]
You think you could maybe read us by chance the Empire America peanut report. It'll be nice read no no

[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.060]
567 05 60 pound 560 on neighbor rising in singular wireless line

[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.340]
Yeah, the peanut before how about if I just read you the encyclopedia Britannica? I was at Wtqam. Hello

[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:41.080]
Neil yes, sir now I was wondering if you were George who had to help me out and finding out if

[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:50.380]
Edward died on Friday or not we died. I don't know about Friday, but he died he died. He's dead. He's definitely is he's definitely a dead is a donail. How's that?

[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.180]
I'm gonna cry about that. Okay. Have a good cry. Oh

[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.700]
Although maybe not maybe not completely dead. Maybe he was likely killed. There you go. Maybe there she's on a tube

[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.940]
Right. Maybe they were keeping him alive. We run them real long. She was

[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.580]
Saw Ken Maul in there. Ken got a little uh, he grew some of the hair on his chin that I got out of my head there go tea

[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:14.820]
A little bit of a growth Berkeley since he's got a growth Wtqam. Hello. Yeah, she can't tell us where it is though. Yes, sir

[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:19.460]
Hey, uh, just uh wanted to say something about the Pope sorry he's gone and

[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.900]
Well, hopefully they take a young one because according to some

[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.360]
Book that the Catholic Church saw it out about a hundred years ago

[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.960]
The next troker is the last one and then it's the end of the world. Oh, no

[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.800]
How do you like that really the next one that's what no stir it and no stir old aim is said

[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.780]
Well, then they better get a young one right yeah about 15. Oh, in fact, maybe the Cardinals can like pass them around a little bit first

[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:47.420]
Prober 13. How many QAM hello? Yeah, yes, sir. The only good thing the Pope ever said by the way

[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:52.180]
Yes, you know that guy where you had a conversation with earlier. He was against the Iraq war

[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.140]
Yeah, I remember Bush went over the before the war and then Bush went over there after war

[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.100]
Come on like you know join me on this and he wouldn't do it

[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:04.780]
So that's the only thing that I ever agree with him being a next Catholic and you know knowing that they're all full of Christ

[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.460]
And don't forget he also said come on Easter come on Easter. That was about it. That would be

[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.640]
One another thing he had issues with memory with the priest thing

[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.880]
I think they were saying that the Americans are making too big of a deal about it. Yeah, that's right. They swept it out of the carpet

[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.820]
Yeah, they did okay, see you and they did a very good job of that too

[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.940]
It surfaces ugly head if I can say that briefly here a couple of months ago

[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.900]
But then they just swept it back under there again

[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:32.120]
And now of course with all this going on and you notice every once in a while I'll make sure about that and and they're praising him

[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.820]
That's the thing that's amazing to me. They're praising him for confronting and tackling these sex abuse issues so strongly

[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.820]
Which occurs is ludicrous while they were schlepping him from one one that dies

[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.880]
East to another and then of course you'll recall cardinal law it took about how many trips

[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:52.200]
They finally came to okay the pressure is too great. You got to step down over a thousand reports

[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.900]
Just last year's right the dog and pony should right over with the over fantastic job like I said it

[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:05.120]
Not ending it of covering it up. Yeah, we're gonna get out of the carpet. Okay, because it's a brotherhood of pedophiles is basically what it's all about

[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:11.200]
So what can I tell you everybody needs a group to belong to right? Right. That's right. They make Namla look like a bunch of bikers

[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.700]
At least Namla's honest about it and it plus they got a good text in them status. What's not to like

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:16.780]
Namla

[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.360]
QA.A.M. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I'm moving to Canada. Yeah

[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:27.220]
Yeah, you want to move all right real fast in fact go have a movement sounds like you need one

[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.060]
And don't send us any more factors. Okay. We're not interested. We can't stand you

[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:36.100]
Well, in fact that fat boy see he encourages this crap. He does yes, because he thinks it's very amusing

[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.500]
He does next time he comes waddling in here again before I leave this week

[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.860]
I'm gonna take that walking stick a his and just stick it. You know try to have a serious conversation

[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.360]
You can't do it about that. Yeah, you want to about that phenomenon

[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.740]
Can I tell you something? Keep this in mind. I don't forget this. You cannot have a serious conversation with a silly person

[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.860]
You know how you're always saying about you can't you can't say crazy people right well silly people are no better

[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.200]
No, it was in a different way. Maybe they're not quite as dangerous, but they're annoying

[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:06.560]
They're crazy and you cannot have a serious conversation with a person who is perpetually a silly person

[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.880]
Just like that whole thing in here this morning about PD Lenny and his cat and about Skippy

[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.780]
I don't care about any of that or the cat all of a cat did find his way back home. I don't believe it. I don't believe it

[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.320]
Cat found his way home from the Everglades the

[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.300]
The guy the neighbor takes the cat dumps it out in the middle of the Everglades and the cat finds its way back to their house

[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:32.500]
The PD Lenny house you believe that no although dogs if I'm the way yes across country right in Green Bay, Wisconsin

[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.700]
I don't forget that with a bloody pause and the whole thing the dog came like to the door and like

[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.860]
Die it over you know like that a dog yes cats are

[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.500]
Dumber than sawdust man

[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:48.720]
They are I know they are put it in the microwave for a couple of minutes. You'll see I think that's a perfect idea

[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.100]
Just a joke. I'll do little kids out there do not put their hand in the microwave for more than a hand

[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.940]
Conviction of love and please right on slow cook

[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.420]
First of all if PD Lenny's got a cat he deserves to have the cat take out

[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.020]
First of all his cat was dumping in his a neighbor's truck over and over again from that story

[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.360]
I got here even brought me the story like I care about that yeah

[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.920]
Yeah, the cat was dumping into guys truck and the guy finally dumped him in the Everglades

[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.920]
Now if you want to do a real service you could dump PD Lenny out there too. It would have been a good idea

[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.740]

So Berkeley from our sales department just comes in with a lovely gift for yours truly from borders

[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.700]
And I thought oh, this is neat and I started opening it up and I saw picture on the back

[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.760]
I thought it was you read through Franklin from an angle. Yeah on the back kind of back pain

[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.620]
Oh, and apologies to you read through it too because believe you me and I open it and here on the front cover presenting

[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.060]
Celia Cruz and I thought to myself

[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.800]
I mean that is got to be she makes me look lovely and I don't care what anybody said us seriously

[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.620]
She has got to be the most grotesque bitch. I have ever seen in my life

[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.440]
But enjoy the book on the

[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:14.300]
In La Coye don de vivo and that lovely don de vivo. Sorry. Sorry context. Oh, and there she is with Mark Anthony

[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.520]
Can't ask my motto. That's a question there, huh?

[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.980]
Holy moly rat man. Mark Anthony look at her. She looked like she went to hell and died or the other way around

[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.120]
Man, and she looks like a guy cedar Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised. I've been sent after a long time

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.260]
I know she might have something there. She had a husband, you know, well, maybe he didn't maybe she didn't and he didn't

[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.120]
I have I mean, you know, it's not bad enough with all this stuff with the Pope

[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.020]
And now we got to get to see the crews again today, which was the farthest thing for my agenda

[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:44.120]
I think Berkeley's trying to throw us off the scent off the trail

[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.120]
In fact, you ever see the Pope and see it together maybe same person, huh?

[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.300]
Maybe that's when she disappeared. She became ill papa because she sure had the goods now

[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.280]
I got a good article here speaking of goods and that's it read it though

[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.280]
Because I see Miguel's he's still hanging out in there and I have no idea why by the way

[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:02.200]
I think he's hiding from somebody. Oh, well from Josh's mother

[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.160]
Melton

[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:08.360]
Victor and hysteria in gulf republicans. This is so good by Michael Goenda

[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.180]
US correspondent for the age

[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:17.080]
He has received death threats has been vilified by evangelical Christians right wing radio talk show host and senior republican politicians

[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:23.160]
While Terry Shiveau lay dying in her hospice he was escorted to and from work by armed police and his home and family have been under police guard

[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.660]
He's been sent tens of thousands of emails many calling him a murderer and threatening him with harm

[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.860]
Some of the local papers in Florida have been prepared to publish the most extraordinary letters about him

[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:37.420]
One letter writer asked whether he was related to the Nazi mass murderer Joseph Mangala or was just a student of his

[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:42.240]
George Greer is a 63 year old judge of Florida Circuit Court the equivalent of county courts in Australia

[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.380]
He's a conservative evangelical Christian. They committed republican in 2000

[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:51.760]
He ruled that Terry Shiveau who had spent 10 years and what doctors who examined her said was a persistent vegetative state

[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.340]
Following a heart attack would not have wanted to be kept alive. He ruled that her feeding

[01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:02.820]
Tube be removed and accordance with Florida law or husband Michael rather than her parents was her legal guardian able to make decisions about her treatment

[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:10.200]
There followed five years of court appeals against his ruling after the US Supreme Court all dismissed and two failed attempts by president George Bush's brother

[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:16.080]
Fat ass jab the Florida governor the past legislation over ruling him when the appeal process seemed exhausted judge

[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.380]
Greer ordered miss Shiveau's feeding tube

[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:22.500]
Removed while judge Greer had been subjected to abuse and threats into his initial ruling

[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.720]
It wasn't until the order they feeding tube

[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.920]
Removed two weeks ago, which prompted leading republicans in congress and president Bush to get involved in the Shiveau case

[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:38.780]
That the vilification and death threats seriously escalated the flight of judge Greer in battle threatened and vilified as a murderer has become a metaphor for the way of life and death of miss Shiveau

[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:44.460]
As been used by some republicans including George Bush to assuage the party's conservative Christian evangelical base

[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.580]
Many believe it was evangelical activists who brought off the voters that delivered Mr. Bush's second term last November

[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:56.200]
And republican majorities in both houses of congress pressured by conservative activists senior republicans house majority later

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.800]
Tom delay and senator bill first decided congress had to pass legislation forcing me federal court to review judge

[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.260]
Greer's decision and look at giving guardianship of miss Shiveau to her parents

[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:10.220]
What had been a private family tragedy with all the bitter family disputes is often a company such tragedies

[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:13.120]
became a fearsome ugly battle in america's culture wars

[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:19.880]
Mr. delay under pressure for taking questionable junkets from lobby groups and with some of his Texas staff indebted for leds campaign finance offenses

[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.560]
Set the tone for what was to follow

[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.780]
He justified the extraordinary Sunday sitting of congress to pass what he called emergency legislation to save miss Shiveau's life

[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:32.200]
The calling judge Greer's decision and active medical terrorism and the removing of her feeding

[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.140]
Sheeube murder

[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:38.480]
Bill Frist a well-regarded heart specialist and potentiary republican candidate in for president in 2008

[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.340]
Said he had looked at video of miss Shiveau and concluded she was conscious and responding to her parents

[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.880]
Members of congress at the start of a two week break were called back to Washington and forced to vote on the bill

[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.260]
Most admitted they knew a little about the Shiveau case

[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:54.900]
George Bush flew back from his Texas ranch to sign the legislation while he didn't repeat mr. delays in

[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.280]
Climateary language his support for mr. delay was implicit in his dramatic return to Washington

[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.880]
Two weeks later with miss Shiveau having died and perhaps it last allowed a return to the private obscurity

[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.940]
She apparently always wanted there is going evidence the republican party is split over the involvement

[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.780]
Some say exploitation by congress and the present of the Shiveau case

[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.860]
Poles have consistently shown that despite the radio shock jocks and the history on the Fox cable TV network

[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.120]
About 80% of Americans say congress and mr. Bush should not have gotten involved mr

[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.940]
Bush is approval rating as slumped over the past two weeks falling seven points to 45% in the polls

[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.560]
And after the federal court and floater refused to hear the Shiveau

[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.300]
Rehear the Shiveau case rejecting three appeals by miss Shiveau's parents for the feeding

[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:39.120]
To be reinserted many republicans expressed concern at the way mr. delays in temperate language had encouraged vitriolic attacks

[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.080]
That's just on judge Greer, but all the judges involved in the case

[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.280]
The splitting republican parties between the so-called social conservatives for whom the main issues are abortion

[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.260]
Game marriage and the defense of what they call Christian values and economic conservatives who want small government

[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.100]
And believe congress in the prison have no right to involve with decision made by state courts writing in the New York Times

[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.380]
former republican senator and former ambassador to the when John Danforth said

[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:04.160]
Republicans have transformed our party into the political arm of conservative Christians

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.780]
The elements of this transformation have included advocacy of a constitutional amendment to ban game marriage

[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:14.140]
Opposition to stem cell research and the extraordinary effort to keep Terry Shiveau hooked up to a feeding tube

[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:21.060]
He said Grover norquist leading republican strategist and self-described economic conservatives said senior republicans in congress and mr

[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.000]
Bush had misread the public on the Shiveau case

[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.980]
I think a lot of conservative leaders assumed there was broader support for saying that they wanted to have the federal government save this woman's life

[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:34.660]
He said David Davenport a senior fellow with a conservative Hoover institution said the bitter attacks on judges by mr

[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:41.580]
And other republican politicians was disturbing the court process has worked even if it hasn't given the result that the social conservatives

[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.160]
Want he said for congress to step it is really a violation of federalism

[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.440]
After learning that mr

[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:54.760]
Shiveau had died George Bush was circumspecting his response extending his condolences to her family and urging Americans to continue to fight for a culture of life

[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.460]
But mr

[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.500]
Lay was no less inflammatory saying mr

[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.960]
Shiveau's death was a moral poverty and illegal tragedy

[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.800]
This loss happened because our legal system did not protect the people who need protection most and that will change

[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.800]
He said the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior

[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.380]
There was outrage even among republicans that this clear threat to the judges who were involved in the Shiveau case more than

[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.280]
30 of them, but that's unlike the the consul judge Greer in other words

[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.560]
Watch out when you start your car in the morning right right so there you go

[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:29.440]
That's America for you baby as the lunatic right wing God squad has taken over. It's all over now

[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.420]
And all this window dressing going on today with the apope and people running around in there in their beautiful

[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.800]
God is I'll just frosting on the cake for the God squad. Mm-hmm the holy father

[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:46.200]
You got a better chance of seeing a cruise here in your prayers than the holy father

[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.200]
I'll tell you there right now they talk about saint cilia saint cilia

[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.720]
What if you'd like to do an air-spirit time cilia cruise? Oh

[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.640]
What's your take on Pope John Paul II who just died over the weekend? Oh my god

[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:04.640]
What are we going to do the holy father 960 votes? I thought we were a shoe in for a thousand. We still got some work to do

[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.660]
Yeah, well what it'll happen. We got 40 to go. We only got 20 minutes. That's two a minute. He's a cake cake

[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.940]
Quarantine mark. He was a great man 264. I couldn't give a Schmidt about him 185

[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:19.620]
He never stole a freight train 169. He preached bigotry and ignorance

[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.680]
140 he was decent 132 and he was a snappy dresser

[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:27.520]
70 and we got 40 to go to go to go to go to the town. We don't get a thousand. We got to stay until midnight

[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.740]
Okay, hey, let me tell you right now about dry concepts

[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.240]
I've been talking about these folks for way over 20 years

[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.920]
And they've been doing things great for people in this market for over 26 years dry concepts

They use a rapid cleaning techniques your carpets are dry dry are you clean today and you can entertain tonight

and

[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.160]
and

[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.300]
When you put the genocide with the blueprint of Nazi occupation

[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.880]
I write and strike you defense, their homes against us instead of the Saudis

[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.320]
But with certain retaliations, you need only one, the soonies gonna get dressed

[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.860]
The soonies gonna get dressed in one more year, you'll never win

[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:51.220]
You need no child, be high, by sending them off the dial, or that's insane and homicidal

[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:55.580]
And some them are genocide, they expect that they don't be fired

[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.140]
They expect that they do lose their choice, I don't need Jesus for sure

[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:07.120]
I don't need the Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.260]
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:20.160]
The soonies gonna get dressed, the soonies gonna get dressed in one more year, you'll never win

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:45.840]
You need no child, be high, by sending them off the dial, or that's insane and homicidal

[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.100]
And some them are genocide, they're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.060]
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.460]
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.600]
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:04.660]
A majority of the U.S. Catholics surveyed what the next pope would have a theological outlook similar to that of Pope John Paul the tooth

[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:11.060]
But they would also like to see changes on issues such as birth control, stem cell research, and allowing priests to marry

[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:16.740]
According to a CNN USA Today Gallup Poll, released yesterday, large majorities of Catholics and non-Catholics

[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:22.200]
They believe the next choice of Pope matters to the world in telephone interviews mostly conducted before his death

[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:27.400]
2-3rd to the 254 Catholics, Paul said John Paul the tooth will go down in history as one of the greatest pountiffs

[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.600]
Not the greatest, but one of the top 500

[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.300]
21% of respondents said he'll remember it is great, but not among the greatest

[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:39.780]
And 9% of those surveys said John Paul be considered a good or average pope, only 1% said he'd be below average

[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:44.560]
Of course average, I mean look at the group back in history

[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:51.720]
Asked about the select of the next pountiff, a third said they want to poke more liberal, just 4% said they want somebody more conservative like a till of a hun

[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.100]
More than a half, 59% said they want somebody about the same as John Paul the tooth

[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:01.120]
78% said the next pope should allow Catholics to use birth control 78%

[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.640]
63% said he should let priests marry so that we don't just have this fag club going on

[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.480]
It's not a democracy

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.120]
And 59% said the next pope should have a less strict policy on stem cell research

[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.840]
That sounds like that scientific mumbo jumbo to me, you know, God's rule is that a matter of human polls

[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.200]
55% well it seems to me the church is a little bit too interested in everybody's poll

[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:29.120]
55% said the next pope should allow women to become priest, 44% said he should not

[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.040]
55 to 44% said the next pope should allow women to become priests

[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:33.860]
Bible says no

[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:38.820]
A majority of you as Catholics pulled support John Paul's unwavering stance against a vassion

[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:43.540]
Asked whether the next pope should have a less strict policy, 59% said no, 37% said yes

[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.540]
And respondents were split on the question of divorce

[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:53.600]
Asked whether the next pountiff, unlike John Paul, should allow Catholics to divorce and remarry, 49% said yes, 48% said no

[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.740]
See this is what's been going on forever

[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.320]
Forever and ever

[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.220]
Oh, well we like him so much and he's so inspirational and the holy father he's like forever

[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:05.180]
But in the meantime all in, like in Italy they don't pay attention to anything they keep having elections

[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.120]
They keep having a referendum

[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:07.680]
Wow

[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.400]
Undevorious

[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.760]
All of these things and whatever he says they do the opposite

[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:12.660]
Overwhelmingly

[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.000]
And that's because 90% of them don't go to church

[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:15.580]
Good

[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.560]
Right, exactly because they're onto it man

[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.720]
See, see when something is right there in your own backyard

[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.240]
Right

[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.340]
And when you realize that it has been there for a long, long time

[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:28.360]
And when you're under their thumb and you realize how repressed you are because of their attitudes and their behavior

[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.540]
And their stranglehold they have on your lives

[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.500]
Oh, you resent it and you don't participate and you don't support it

[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:38.100]
As opposed to the not in Germany where they love the people they love the Nazis

[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.380]
Right, they did

[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:39.960]
Sure

[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:45.000]
Yeah, in the beginning they were a little bit suspect but after a while I saw in Deutschland who Boralos sounded pretty good

[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.260]
You know how hard is it to put your arm up and you're going, how Hitler, how Hitler

[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.160]
You know, like that

[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.660]
Neville Chamberlain founded very easy

[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.060]
Pope Pius thought it was okay

[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.040]
Joe Kennedy, I didn't have any problem with it

[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.360]
Charles Lindbergh thought it wasn't too bad either when he came right down

[01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.740]
But what can I tell you?

[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.560]
Just believe whatever they tell you on television that's all

[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.880]
Here's the religious impact of the death of the Holy Father

[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:09.680]
She was a worldwide terrorism which is really the threat of our time

[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.380]
Right, let me say again the Pope was vehemently opposed to the Iraq attack

[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.620]
How come we're not hearing a lot more about that?

[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:20.160]
How come we're not hearing about the fact that El Presidente was going there on Friday to put on a good dog in Ponyshow

[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.320]
and make his obligatory appearance

[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.860]
How come he just ignored him? He snubbed his nose at him

[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.380]
He gave him the old Bafangula

[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.900]
He still do that over there right?

[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.000]
Oh yeah, even though he's Polish he knows how to do that

[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.400]
Oh that's right and he probably threw him one back

[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.060]
That's right, he gave the old Italian salute even the Polox can do that

[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.860]
We got our thousand votes I believe

[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.940]
You think we got him?

[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.160]
Oh yeah, thousands of peace of cake, Trojia, cake

[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.520]
WQAM, hello

[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.500]

What did I just get to saying?

[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.640]
Schmuck, 567.0560, Pound 560

[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.680]
You see when you're counseling people on marriage and on sex and all of a sudden

[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.800]
And you're supposed to be celibate somehow it's like being a vegetarian and counseling people on great state houses

[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.040]
And good recipes

[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:17.460]
Right

[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:22.200]
And somehow it just don't fit and if you don't fit then you must acquit and you're full of it

[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:24.320]
WQAM, hello

[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:26.800]

[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.080]
WQAM, hello

[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:29.880]

Mama, mama, me, ya

Oh no, now that's not in here, is it?

[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:46.020]
Oh my god, father, stuff should be in here

[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:51.660]
Oh no, now that is not in here, I can't operate even nowhere it came from, I got it, I'll tell you what else isn't here though

[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:52.760]
Where did you learn your strength?

[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:56.000]
Who ever told you that you could work with men?

[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.400]
What's your high and full?

[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.240]
It's to help us, does that seem clear to you?

[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.360]
To help us?

[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.000]
To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living?

[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:07.320]
You company man?

[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:08.400]
You're fairies

[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:09.800]
WQAM, hello

[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.720]
Neil, hello

[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:14.820]
Why are you so angry to Catholic Church, I've never fully understood that part

[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.600]
I beg your pardon?

[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.520]
Why is it that you're so angry with the Catholic Church?

[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.900]
I'm not angry with the Catholic Church, I'm angry with all churches and all religions

[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.760]
I'm not angry

[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.660]
Were you molested by a priest when you were a child?

[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.560]
No, I was not, because I wasn't a child

[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.580]
Are you angry because you were a child?

[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:30.480]
Were you molested by a child, sir?

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.100]
Were you molested by a child?

[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.100]
It sounds like I am a child, you were a priest

[01:35:54.300 --> 01:36:06.080]

[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.160]

[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:02.780]
Wouldn't you think?

[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.220]
You would be kind of sad if they didn't.

[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.160]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:06.920]
Hey Neil.

[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:07.380]
Yes sir.

[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.540]
People need us because they'll capture us in a new coat.

[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:10.800]
Ha ha ha.

[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.520]
Only when he picks up an address code pal.

[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.120]
It leaves a good.

[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.340]
Take a thinkin' all of it.

God even the grass, the power of stomp stomp.

[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.180]
He lets it smoke in mass.

[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:30.040]
The power of stomp stomp stomp.

[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:30.780]
He lets it smoke in mass.

[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:30.780]

[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:30.780]

[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:30.780]

[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.340]
In case you think he eats ass out that's all contempt.

[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.400]
The power of stomp stomp.

[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:41.060]
O yeah, all years, all years.

[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.060]

I go home.

[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.120]
No, no, no.

[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.780]
And I don't know why, though.

[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.020]
In the beginning, he had seven of his three in the heart.

[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:48.240]
For the greeting, he speaking of a non-juove wive...

[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:48.760]
is what I'm hearing.

[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.740]
Or is there just a bong?

[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:52.480]
You knew he had some pull of Harvey.

[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.320]
Anyway, disrespectful, shameful on you, terrible.

[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.560]
You don't want to jump on a bad one.

[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.180]
You don't want to participate because the media tells you you should say this.

[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.500]
And you should think that and I say screw the media, okay?

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.840]
You're a bunch of lunatics.

[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.160]
You're a bunch of crazy people.

[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.060]
Why can't you leave all the rest of us alone?

[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.040]
What they're doing is exactly the reason why so many of us resent this whole.

[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.760]
In other words, if you want to get all weeping and all bent out of shape,

[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.480]
great, go ahead, go do it.

[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.600]
But it's a private, religion is private, okay?

[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:17.780]
It's like taking a dump.

[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.160]
And they're dumping on us big time with this crap.

[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.480]
I'm pretty tired of it.

[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.160]
Not yours though, he can't get enough of it.

[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:23.440]
Oh yeah.

[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.500]
Don't interject so much.

[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:24.920]
I'm sorry.

[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.700]
What's his, she was good.

[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.340]
Yeah.

[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.660]
He's in the dressing room.

[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.620]
I haven't listened to why I'm with him.

[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.920]
Go get yourself straight now, honey, okay?

[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.140]
Go get yourself some help.

[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.120]
Go get a psychiatric exam.

[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.540]
Go get a lobotomy.

[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.620]
We didn't stick a shoe.

[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.820]
Your brain is supposed to be 1024 votes.

[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.100]
What's your take on a pope on the late pope?

[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.440]
I'm not so sure.

[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:48.220]
Well, I'm almost as upset about him as I'm the late Jesus Christ.

[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.020]
He was a great man, 272.

[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.560]
I couldn't give a shmit about him, 201.

[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:55.380]
Never throw a freight train, 183.

[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.840]
He preached bigotry ignorance, 154.

[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:01.500]
He was decent as a, you know, okay, 142.

[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.860]
And a snappy dresser, 72.

[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.660]
Speaking of snappy dresses,

[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.300]
we got Mohawar David standing by.

[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:09.740]
