[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]
For David's a bitch.

[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:14.880]
On the good ship, on the stud, it's a slave ship and it's very hot when you walk all day.

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.260]
And the wind you underback with chains.

[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.100]
It's a wooden ship and it smells unlust like an iron,

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.640]
It's all about egg-hearted when you die of the sea.

[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.400]
It's all about the embassy.

[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.240]
It's a ship in the whole of toilet for your pillow is a rat.

[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.460]
And if you complain, oh no,

[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.080]
Why'd there be two in the rustic place?

[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.000]
It's a slave ship, they don't serve no food when you can cheat.

[00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.460]
They feed it back to you. Life is very hot on the good ship of the star.

[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.240]
25 past 10 at 5.60 W.D.Q. I'm happy Thursday to hear.

[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.100]
We still have no information on our new lineup from Monday.

[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.640]
We don't like to plan too far ahead.

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.280]
We like to keep you like hanging on a string.

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.060]
You know where it is your seat. Suspense.

[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.620]
We like a little suspense.

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.960]
If you were to have some suspense in a stomach this morning because he made a bad tool in every disown.

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.580]
Not had. That'll teach you to serve anybody that would eat thinnies right there.

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.780]
What? It was right there, you know.

[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.220]
Yeah. They didn't have burn every day.

[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.760]
That's the excuse it was right there and so you made that bad mistake.

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.960]
Oh, it was brutal.

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.880]
Lanny's asked America what they want. They did it all. You can eat breakfast.

[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.540]
There's more more than just a lot of food.

[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.780]
I'm a lot of choices.

[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.640]
Bacon, pancakes, and eggs. Anyway, I want them.

[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.760]
Oh, and sausages. Those little sausages that look like daugherts.

[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.920]
Yeah, the ones that always come stuck together. Why is that?

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.020]
They don't want a warm under a heat lamp at some fast food place.

[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320]
I want a warm under a heat lamp at Lanny's.

[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.720]
Tell you how I want it. I want bacon really fatty and lean to the one you pick it up.

[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.540]
You sort of droop off your finger and eggs with the yolk broken so they're hot as they're rotten.

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.440]
And I want it served by a fat solid waker so the muskets so I am an excuse to skipper.

[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.480]
Hey, bring it to me, bitch! Now!

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.780]
And I don't want to stand in line. I want to wait in line to get seated for a really long time.

[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940]
They do that at Dany. Lanny. Lanny.

[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.100]
America, there's a new all you can eat. Grand Slam breakfast venue.

[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.940]
At Lanny's. It's everything you already expect from Lanny's.

[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.540]
Just a lot more of it. At room temperature.

[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.100]
So you like it, huh?

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.300]
Oh, no!

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.720]
Don't make the mistake. Although I'm sure we have a lot of people out there in the audience who love Dany's.

[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.220]
You know, they've been in this so long you think after so many years they've got to have the rack together by now, right?

[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.140]
They do have the rack together. What you ate is what you get.

[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.380]
There are people who like what you had this morning.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.220]
Cold people who enjoy being sick all day and puking their guts out and having a wild screaming diarrhea for two days.

[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.720]
For hashed, bread, slur, eggs.

[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.760]
Yeah. The pancake was all right.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.340]
Hey, look, well, I can take up lots of places that are incredibly popular.

[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.280]
We don't have to go through the whole litany of McGinn that are just really crap.

[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.480]
But that's public taste, man. I keep going back to the gold standard vanilla ice cream.

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.840]
It's the most popular selling flavor in the entire world, vanilla ice cream.

[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.260]
There's nothing that even comes close.

[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.600]
I don't have to do this because people are putting stuff on it.

[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.940]
Yeah.

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.620]
Or you also say that anything you have to put something else on to embellish it like French fries, for example.

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.480]
Or like what's another example?

[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.060]
Or like mashed potatoes that you got to like, douse gravy all over because it has no taste.

[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.020]
It's just not a potato guy.

[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.220]
No, no, I like mashed potatoes if they're good.

[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.160]
I like potatoes.

[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.120]
I like it.

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.680]
What's really the best is really good homemade mashed potatoes with butter, melted butter.

[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.660]
Forget about dousing it in gravy.

[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.100]
Butter.

[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.740]
Chucky with the peels still on them.

[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.260]
Mmm.

[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.440]
Now we're talking.

[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.500]
Anyway, a 28 after 10.

[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.820]
I guess I don't know whether they're like in denial or whether they're just, I don't know what all the legal shenanigans are going on.

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.760]
But all the articles that I'm reading and even stirring himself, they're talking about Citadel dropping him on those four stations in Syracuse and Peoria and Poeton, can whatever.

[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.280]
Nothing is said about the fact that tomorrow is his last day on QAM.

[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.500]
So I don't know what that means.

[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.460]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.920]
He has that one call about it.

[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.240]
So obviously they're screening those calls out because they don't want to talk about it on their show.

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.820]
Maybe word beneath his notice.

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.960]
Is that what it is?

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.760]
They're just, they're just, plus they can always promote the buzz in Palm Beach and pretend that people in South Howard and did counter can hear it, you know.

[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.480]
At least they don't chop it up like something in a meat grinder or poke holes like Swiss cheese in it.

[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.120]
At least they carry the show the way it is.

[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.200]
I'll say that.

[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.420]
Which goes to point out that it was a bad, bad mistake.

[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.240]
But then again we're famous for bad mistakes.

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.680]
You know, usually by the same person.

[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.740]
Hey, ring in the new year with a new car truck from the folks in Armstrong, Florida Homestead.

[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:49.520]
You've been putting off buying anything but now don't wait another minute because for a limited time get yourself 0% financing on any of the following new O-5s and stock ready for immediate delivery.

Escapes, free stars, toruses, F-Super duly Harley Davidson trucks and the all new Ford 500.

[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.420]
Want more than how about 1.9% financing on all new O-5 expeditions, explores F-150s and Rangers, even Bruce Ranger is discounted.

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.660]
Certain restrictions apply.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.780]
By lots of Armstrong, Florida Homestead are jammed in their cutting prices right now.

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.820]
They offer more vanity too because when you buy your Ford from Armstrong, Ford you'll get their exclusive unmatchable, unheard of, tires and batteries for life program.

[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.980]

[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.760]
All waiting for you at Armstrong, Florida Homestead, 307.25, South Dixie Highway, 20 minutes south of the A36.

[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.740]

[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.060]
At Armstrong, Neil Rogers, mornings and we did. And, sports around the clock, no fights.

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.800]
We're here.

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.320]
Hey, it's Howard. How it's bamboo?

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.640]
He walks in the boardroom, sits in his lever chair.

[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:25.060]
He's got a $5,000 suit and free dollar hair.

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.020]
Someone's time on the show is about to expire.

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:49.340]
When Donald Trump says, you're fired, Caroline and George are shipping by his side.

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.840]
Pretty soon so we knew.

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.120]
He's gonna take a taxi ride.

[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.460]
You say you feel better, but...

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.280]
But you know you're the liar.

[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.520]
Because we all love to hear your tired.

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.460]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.540]
You're fired.

[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.600]
You are so fired.

[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.400]
Get out of here, you're fired.

[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.360]
It was a tough one, but you're fired.

[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.640]
1034, 206, 411 and 560 W.J.A.N.

[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.780]
Yesterday we had a little technical problem. It was my fault. A little accident.

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.540]
I was just moving that schedule around, which of course is a Q.M.

[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.860]
That's one of our favorite homies, it's shifts in the schedule all around.

[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.580]
And I accidentally hit a button, kind of like that. And then I pressed this button over here.

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.740]
Hello, and I went into Winneco.

[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.220]
All right, you heard it again?

[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.020]
I was hoping you remember how you did that.

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.940]
You know what I did.

[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.300]
Just to bring it back in.

[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.300]
And then come to find out that there are people inside the building.

[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.160]
To say them the embarrassment, we better not mention any names on here.

[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.540]
People thought that that was intentional, or we should stick.

[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.380]
Oh, that was really funny, you guys did yesterday.

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.520]
Man, we got some morons in there or what?

[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.620]
Some real morons inside that Q.M. building.

[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.840]
That's another good reason not to be there.

[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.540]
Although it is snowing like crazy and ice pellets in the nasty here right now, but it's okay.

[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.700]
Don't bother me, it's nice and toasty inside my little studio here.

[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.540]
There ain't nobody here to bug the crap on me, you know?

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.920]
It's a lot to be said for that.

[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.900]
How's Tommy's van doing?

[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.420]
He's got any gifts coming up that we can promote?

[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.720]
Yeah, actually, but I don't know in there.

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.460]
We can find out.

[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.480]
Well, I have them right there.

[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600]
It's a double-decker of it.

[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.200]
I think that's where we can miss in the vote.

[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.540]
I don't understand what that whole deal with the Stirring Q.M. is all about, because it's like...

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.980]
It's been everywhere.

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.440]
Every radio trade publication has been in billboard.

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.260]
It's been FMQB and radio ink, radio and records.

[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.280]
The weekly reader, readers digest.

[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.560]
Every newspaper, every TV.

[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.320]
And I don't understand that.

[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.580]
Maybe they just don't care.

[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.000]
Maybe they're trying to snub us, you know?

[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.980]
Like, we're small potatoes and we don't care anyway.

[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.940]
You think that's it?

[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.740]
Here are some good news to start out today.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.700]
Here are some great news for all of us who despise the Nazi vune that's running America today.

[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.860]
And the last two very dubious elections.

[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.840]
A small group of Democrats agreed today to force House and Senate debates on election day problems in Ohio

[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.240]
before letting Congress certify President Bush's election victory over Senator John Kerry in November.

[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.760]
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democratic California.

[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.260]
We love Barbara and she's got the balls to be a boxer.

[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.920]
She could probably knock Mike Tres on his ass.

[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.440]
She's our boy.

[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.640]
You go, boy, girl.

[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.640]
Barbara Boxer decided to challenge mounted by House Democrats to all Ohio's 20 electoral votes, which put Bush over the top.

[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.840]
By law, a challenge tied by members of the House and Senate requires both chambers to meet separately for up to two hours to consider it.

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.500]
Lawmakers are allowed to speak for no more than five minutes each.

[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.120]
Of course, this is the challenge that they tried to do in 2001.

[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.460]
It was obviously election was rigged and they're not one member of the Senate.

[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:50.700]
Now, one Democrat, not Al Gore, who was sitting up there as President Pro Tem, not Ted Kennedy, not John Kerry, not anybody.

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.500]
Had the balls not even rust-fine gold to say, yeah, we'll sign on with all you four bastards.

[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:03.240]
While Bush's victory is not in jeopardy, the Democratic Challenge will force Congress to interrupt tallying the electoral college vote that was scheduled to begin on one o'clock today.

[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.080]
It would be only the second time since 1877 that the House and Senate were forced into several meetings to consider electoral votes.

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.920]
And we're worried about having fair elections in Iraq.

[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.720]
That's what work he's earned above.

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.920]
Yeah, I'll tell you what, we ought to start pointing to elections in other places like Ukraine and anywhere else in the world.

[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.300]
After we start figuring out how to fair a press word of the elections in the US again, eh?

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.500]
But maybe that they will never come.

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.340]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.660]
This is the tone center.

[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.420]
Q-A-M, hello.

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.160]
Hey, BLA, two things I have for you.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.200]
You know what really hurts me when people call up and they go, is this me?

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]
No, it's not my uncle.

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.260]
Who do you think it is?

[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.840]
I don't know.

[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.380]
I mean, I don't even think by now we've been doing screenwriters for about 75 years on the show.

[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500]
What do you think they would understand?

[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.500]
Rather, they should act on the show.

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.080]
They should act on the show.

[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.420]
You act on the show.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.020]
That's the technical problem that I created yesterday by accident.

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.780]
And people inside our building were supposed to be radio people.

[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.120]
I was thinking that it was like intentional, like we would do.

[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.320]
Exactly.

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.400]
What is that?

[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.440]
Talk about this stupid.

[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.160]
Exactly.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:06.260]
Hey, the second thing I have for you is, you know, they've collected already $4 billion for this tsunami garbage.

[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.560]
You know what I don't like?

[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.020]
Why are they asking me for more money?

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.220]
When you use the $4 billion, then I'll give you my 10 bucks.

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.700]
Yeah, well, let me say this to you.

[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.040]
When you know how it's going to be used and if it's going to get there, that's my concern.

[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.260]
There's million dollar companies right now in the States that have a whole army of people trying to figure out what to do with their money.

[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.400]
No right $4 billion.

[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.200]
Who's making the interest on that?

[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.920]
Anyway, that's what I just got that all about.

[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.080]
Oh, that's really good.

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.080]
I'm not good at it.

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.120]

[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.900]
Okay, thanks.

[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.220]
Exactly.

[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.200]
Not that I'm a chief skater, it's just that I'm very dubious about a lot of these relief organizations and then you fight.

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.120]
I just like to think about this stupid ass that's either cutting.

[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.440]
Anybody heard it yet?

[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.840]
No, because it hasn't been done yet.

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.500]
We are the world.

[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.040]
There's people dying.

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.800]
We're singing as fast as we can.

[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.120]
What is that?

[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.700]
I think Bob Gildoff would be strung up by his nuts if he has any.

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.260]
I mean, that's just the dumbest pile of crap I've ever heard in my life.

[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.840]
Let's see, we had farm aid and band aid and cool aid and what else?

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.680]
USA for Africa.

[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.180]
Now I don't remember what they called us when we had that story that they were.

[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.960]
What is that?

[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.040]
Like people who had need immediate desperate urgent help, assistance and...

[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.200]
And we're like cutting records, you know.

[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:13.760]
Cut a check.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.620]
Oh, no, that requires these people really.

[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.280]
And don't forget, Sir Cliff Richards is in on this and Ronan Keening, if he gets a break during his vacation in Switzerland,

[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.700]
if he can find a studio within a two-block radius of where he's hanging it out, he'll go and participate as well.

[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.980]
The marginally talented Ronan Keening.

[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.440]
He's all right.

[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.120]
He's got a couple of good things.

[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.480]
You don't like Ronan Keening?

[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.460]
I don't know who that is.

[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:35.760]
Okay.

[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.400]
WNQAM, hello.

[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.500]
QAM.

[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.720]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.820]
Pretty good, Pali.

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.200]
What's up?

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.000]
K-Paso, man.

[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.120]
K-Paso.

[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.740]
Yeah, I heard some rumors that tsunami wasn't even a natural occurrence.

[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.000]
And that people want to occupy it.

[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.020]
So I just want to hear it.

[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.600]
Yeah, right.

[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.580]
Yeah, we want to occupy Sri Lanka.

[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.060]
I think we probably were behind it.

[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.960]
You know, Bush probably had one of his Nazis down there in the depths, you know.

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.300]
Low enough charges, whatever they were doing.

[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:05.920]
Right.

[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.680]
And that guy's got a good head start on it.

[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.620]
Now, what just happened there?

[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.320]
Oh, I see.

[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.680]
Well, you know, these new CD deaths are great.

[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.900]
The only problem is they go to sleep.

[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.880]
If you don't play them like right away, I don't know why that is.

[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:15.240]
Huh?

[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.180]
Just slap them.

[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.100]
No, you know what that means?

[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.160]
They go in a sleep mode.

[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.340]
Actually, they just sleep on there.

[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.480]
And then you have to hit the cue thing to make sure they're going to start right away.

[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:21.960]
God.

[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.820]
Interest, hate that.

[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.740]
WNQAM, hello.

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.080]
QAM.

[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.960]
Okay.

[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.440]
WNQAM, hello.

[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.440]
Okay.

[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.200]
QAM, hello.

[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.160]
Let's get there.

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.740]
Okay, let's go.

[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.940]
Okay, what's up?

[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.940]
Keep my soul, man.

[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.120]
Oh, that is the thing, man.

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.400]
Oh, well, we're going to have to go to the other side of the oil.

[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.480]
Rumors that, uh, that's...

[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.140]
Yeah, that was interesting.

[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.360]
We're at about a seven minute delay.

[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.340]
I can't believe this.

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.340]
You talk about a chicken Schmidt operation, man.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.100]
We used to be on a seven second delay.

[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.520]
No, we're on a 75 minute delay.

[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.300]
Just to make sure who's being the audio nice.

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.000]
And of course, that's because somebody put for well and howard on here.

[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.260]
Well, I was not probably a good idea.

[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.100]
Well, we'll start to show it now, I think.

[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.200]
You know, I don't want to dittle around since we only got one more day of this anyway tomorrow.

[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.400]
Right, vote dittle.

[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.240]
Think we ought to have a party.

[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.020]
Vote, dawdle.

[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.580]
I mean, dittle.

[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:13.560]
I think we have a ticker tape parade for the fantastic job that Stern and Robin and Arty and Bababoui and all these people did.

[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.080]
Well, how do those?

[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.460]
Let's see.

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.180]
A Duff tape parade.

[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.460]
A Duff tape parade?

[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.480]
Sports!

[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.660]
70 QAM, hello.

[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.000]
I'm there.

[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.500]
90 QAM, hello.

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.160]
Here's the real reason for that long delay you guys are on.

[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.640]
Yes.

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.480]
It's because of that digital broadcasting it requires an eternity to turn the analog signal into a digital signal.

[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.180]
This is the appeal.

[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.140]
This is the appeal from a light one again, 101.5 again.

[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.020]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.520]
I mean, you can even leave it in the back if you're full of it.

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.980]
You must be obsessed with this show.

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.680]
Good God.

[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.960]
At least you got good taste anyway.

[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.740]
Well, thank you.

[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.780]
All you never know about that music you guys are playing.

[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.680]
Oh.

[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.340]
Thanks for calling me for Thanksgiving.

[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.380]
I'll have to do that, too.

[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:50.960]
Thanks.

[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.640]
What is it?

[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.500]
I thought I was calling you from Naples, who I'm listening to you from.

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.320]
Oh, I see.

[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.180]
But, yeah, that long, long, long delay is because of the digital signal thing that's on there.

[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.540]
It does.

[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.300]
Inband on channel.

[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.560]
What does that mean?

[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.620]
I don't know.

[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.440]
It sounds impressive.

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.580]
No, that's when they take the A-A analog signal and make a digital and it's both in the baby parade parade.

[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.500]
That signal sounds so...

[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.480]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.380]
It's two and a half of it.

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.000]
That's how we're getting that noise.

[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:18.640]
Right.

[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.060]
That's super-heter-dine wine.

[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:20.840]
That's why people...

[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.200]
You got it.

[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.980]
You're not whining all the time.

[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.400]
It's not us.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.940]
It's the signal.

[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.640]
Okay, pal.

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.180]
I have a great day and day out of the business.

[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:25.900]
And you, too.

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.740]
That's how we like that guy again.

[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.300]
Thanks, Robert.

[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.720]
What's your guy's name from a light?

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.400]
Rob Sydney.

[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.180]
Rob Sydney.

[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.040]
He's the PD, a competitor.

[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.160]
Well, they're not really competitors.

[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.380]
Slosh Music Station, light 101.5.

[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.360]
What's used to be a life, didn't it?

[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:38.940]
I don't know.

[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.500]
That's what it is.

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.240]
There's the call letters.

[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.300]
W-L-I-S-D-B-W-R-G-B-D-L was working recently, most recently.

[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.520]
Oh, and before we went back to the country kitchen to be the major D, I mean the server, I mean

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.940]
the greeter, whatever the order.

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.660]
The chief cook and bottle washer or dishwasher.

[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.220]
And anyway, we have all these technical problems yesterday and our good friend from light called up.

[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.100]
And if you missed that, that was some pretty scintillating radio.

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.120]
That was one of the highlights of my mediocre career.

[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.640]
I'll tell you that.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.700]
We're having problems that we had...

[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.280]
Again, just because I accidentally hit a button here, and then I tried to correct it by hitting

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.040]
another button which sure had to be the wrong one.

[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.080]
And low-end behold, here comes a guy from right across the street calling in and like he was our engineer.

[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.060]
That was very nice of me.

[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.760]
He didn't have to do that.

[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.760]
And he knew exactly which button was where and where to stick it.

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.360]
And of course if you work for that crowd anyway, fair-cars in pilot.

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.480]
And Dennis Collins, you know where to stick it to, you know.

[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.540]
That's a cool name though.

[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.120]
What's that?

[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.940]
Jefferson Pilot.

[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.140]
It's an insurance company.

[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.520]
It's an insurance company.

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.260]
Although it's not as cool.

[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:30.800]
It's such a nice wire.

[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.180]
There's certainly not a bunch of broadcasters.

[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.320]
It's an insurance company.

[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.260]
And of course they once upon a time owned WNWS after they bought it from Woody Subway.

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.420]
They were on the brink and then we had the snooze crews remember that?

[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.260]
Oh yeah, I do.

[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.260]
We had the snooze crews after we put the tombstone right there in their front yard.

[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.480]
We put a new one around.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.280]
Oh it's, it's, there was there on the causeway.

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.280]
They wouldn't receive it.

[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.240]
They wouldn't allow you guys out of the property remember?

[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.820]
Oh yeah, they were all foaming at the mouth.

[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.060]
And there was Dennis standing in front of the building with his hands on his hips like indignant.

[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.900]
Oh gee, you guys.

[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.460]
Yeah, we were dancing on your grave.

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.380]
That's exactly right.

[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:06.220]
When we forced him out of their so-called talk format in those glory final days when they had Miss Aller.

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.720]
I don't think Alice was even there anymore.

[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.600]
Well she had this rent house.

[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.260]
She was already on the light bulb and holding for her friends to drag her ass out of the closet.

[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:18.120]
They had such notables as surely tweeters, aka what's her other phony psychic name?

[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.840]
I don't know.

[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.600]
I never listened to that today.

[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.300]
Gypsy Rose Lee, whatever one.

[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.480]
It was a pretty weak.

[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.500]
It was pretty weak Dennis.

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.760]
Okay, WS snooze, we did the crews and you lose.

[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.840]
Anyway, here's the Barbie Benton's R.

[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.720]
We got a little bonus for it today.

[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.240]
We got a package deal for today.

[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.460]
Try to do that a little bit too.

[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.400]
Here and there as they come in.

[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.840]
Barbie Benton and also Alia.

[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.880]
How's Alia doing?

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.840]
Still dead?

[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.860]
Well, low likely.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.080]
Oh.

[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.560]
Barbie Benton January 20th 1950 was born Sacramento, California.

[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.660]
Everybody knows Barbie Benton.

[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.860]
He's going to be an old bag now.

[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.340]
And it's your fifth, huh?

[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.100]
She's old.

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:51.860]
54.

[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.560]
Anyway, sometimes credit is Barbara Benton.

[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.200]
Okay.

[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.000]
Here's your philography that goes on for about 75 pages.

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.900]
I'm not going to waste your time.

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.440]
And the wall came tumbling down 84.

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.380]
84, but that's a long time ago.

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.600]
I guess we haven't seen her lately.

[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.440]
The hospital massacre, death stalker, for the love of it, sugar time.

[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.280]
Oh, it was a TV series on Max.

[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.700]
I don't remember that, do you?

[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:12.880]
No.

[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.420]
Remember sugar time by the McGuire sisters.

[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.420]
Remember Phyllis McGuire, who was girlfriend of Sam G. and Con?

[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:18.740]
No.

[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.800]
Sam G. and Con of the mobster from Chicago.

[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.680]
Oh, I remember him, that is long.

[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.860]
Who was also doing Judith X. and her Campbell, who was also doing J.F.K.

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.200]
Wow.

[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.340]
Everybody's doing everybody.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.080]
Connections.

[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.540]
The third girl from the left, the great American beauty contest.

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.820]
Mirajat S. Emmer Spas Gamost.

[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.040]
I love her.

[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.800]
Even though I can't do it right, because I don't know German, although a few of the words are like Giddish.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.320]
A.K.A.V.

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.820]
Kump, Ainsor Reisens, Malfon Zudiesen.

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:41.880]
Ooh.

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.540]
You just say it in the hair on the back of your neck like curls, you know.

[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.680]
Your blood hurdles, just to hear German.

[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.640]
Oh, a one-wattil, Kulp, or Perfecto.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.460]
A one-wattil, Kulp or Perfecto.

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.540]

[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.520]

[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.760]

[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.680]
A.K.A. Ombre, the Gold Bay Perfecto.

[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.900]

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:18:59.520]
What?

[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.800]
No, it just sounds like you're saying something dirty.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.040]
No, it's hot diamonds and cold blood.

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.280]
Okay. Ombre?

[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.040]
Deltkul, I don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.780]
It sounds like we're saying the Delta.

[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.260]
Don't say it!

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.680]

[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:29.260]
We conclude there is reasonable likelihood that Dr. Dietz's false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.

[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:37.620]
We further conclude that Dr. Dietz's false testimony affected the substantial rights of the appellant jurors in 2002 sent in states to life in prison in 2001,

[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:41.100]
that's the three of her children. She was not riding the Sothe of the two.

[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.060]
So what does this mean? They overturn the conviction.

[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.160]
Oh, we're going to have a new trial and actually turn her loose if you turn her on some other kids.

[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.040]
Why don't we put her in the same cell with Susan Smith and see what happens?

[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.000]
We're not being good ideas.

[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.580]
We're not taking a show together. Like maybe a bath would be good.

[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.620]
When Meryl Streep, they can all happen the same hot tub together.

[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.520]
What thing about Meryl, man? She don't go easy, you know?

[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.220]
What does that mean?

[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.480]
Just what I said, she keeps her every time she thinks she's dead, she just keeps coming back.

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.800]
Meryne Dowd writes, don't torture yourself, that's his job.

[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.140]
We'll get to that. That's about Alberto Jose Gonzalez.

[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.140]
Jose Jimenez Gonzalez.

[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.300]
Oh, here's the thing. Speak it. This is timely.

[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.840]
Broward likely to approve slots in March vote.

[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.680]
And let me, can I just preface this by saying one thing?

[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.500]
Because I used to go to Vegas like once a year for a long time.

[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.520]
And then I got really tired of slipping all the way out there in the desert.

[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.840]
Even though the Vegas is very exciting, it's a fine place.

[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.340]
But there's a certain burnout factor and going all the way out there, you know?

[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.400]
Especially when a 25 minute cab ride from where I am right now, I threw a woodbine.

[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.880]
I can go in all the slots you could ever lose your money in.

[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.260]
So now that we're going to have slots in South Florida,

[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.040]
there's going to be all these fear mongers and scare mongers.

[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.980]
And you know something, just like opening up a bar.

[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.160]
It's the same thing.

[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.520]
There are alcoholers who are going to come in, who are going to go home,

[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.340]
stinkin' drunken, wasted, and are going to be slavered all over

[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.800]
and maybe a drive in drunken, whatever.

[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.340]
That doesn't mean that prohibition is going to come back

[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.900]
because we tried that once it doesn't work.

[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.720]
Because we have about a small percentage of people who are just out of control,

[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.800]
who have addictive personalities and don't care enough that it gets them help.

[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.280]
It doesn't mean the rest of us can't have enjoyed life, right?

[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:10.720]
Right.

[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.380]
And can't raise a lot of money at the same time for a good cause

[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.480]
as opposed to letting the Indians chop it all up.

[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.920]
So they're going to, I can tell you all kinds of stories.

[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.580]
There's one guy out there who would buy and tell me,

[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.040]
I see him there almost every time I go.

[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.960]
We're in the same beat up old dirty jacket, by the way.

[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.100]
Get some new clothes, okay? Go at a good will.

[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.840]
Go steal a jacket somewhere at the sears.

[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.940]
And he's got the same story about how he lost his house

[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.980]
and he lost his whole life pension and his wife and his family.

[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.440]
And when I always say to him when he starts telling me,

[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.740]
which I've heard it a million times, or somebody else's story,

[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.020]
I'll say, yeah, but you're still here.

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.640]
What are you doing here?

[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.760]
And what this guy does is he's a tout.

[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.600]
He stands around behind people over their shoulder,

[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.780]
and watching them play.

[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.040]
Oh, you ought to cash out.

[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:51.960]
Cash out and I'll take it.

[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.700]
And the meantime, he's not playing anything, even with himself.

[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.880]
He just touted.

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.460]
And I say, what are you doing here?

[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.560]
You've got a problem, obviously.

[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.380]
Why are you here telling everybody your tales of, oh, we don't care.

[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.640]
I'm not losing my house or my car or my pup tent or anything.

[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.340]
If you can't handle it, if you don't have the money to be there, go away.

[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.000]
That's all. Don't show up.

[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.520]
Go play in traffic.

[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.280]
Anyway, I just mentioned that in passing, because you know you're going to hear that.

[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.080]
You're going to hear those stories.

[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.560]
And I will also mention this that those people who have gambling problems

[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.680]
have ample opportunities.

[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.340]
Every kind of gambling and food are right now with the acceptance of this,

[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.580]
which we will have this year.

[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.340]
You name it, we got it.

[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.980]
They'll be playing poker in the garage with their little buddies.

[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.260]
We got poker.

[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.680]
We got poker at all the tracks.

[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.700]
They're leaving newer.

[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.320]
Like the guy said, if you like your poker,

[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.500]
Howard County in the permutual industry have reached a grant agreement

[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.440]
that could bring the county as much as $10 million a year of voters agree

[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.920]
in March through expand gambling and lost lot machines, which they will.

[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.460]
The three-broward cities along with dog track, horse tracks and high life front

[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:50.740]
also run negotiations that could bring them a percentage of the proceeds from as many as

[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.340]
10,000 slot machines.

[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.640]
Florida voters in November,

[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.460]
made it the state constitution, let Howard and Dave Grissin vote our mother

[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.940]
to lose lot machines at permutual facilities within their borders.

[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.980]
Now, pro gambling lobbyists are trying to persuade commissioners in both counties

[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.460]
to hold referendum as soon as March.

[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.340]
I thought we always knew it was going to be March.

[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.420]
This is in the herald by the way.

[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.140]
So it's marginal.

[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:08.820]
Marchional.

[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.540]
So far, only Howard has made any serious headway in the negotiations

[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.400]
and county commissioners will decide on Tuesday whether this case will vote

[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.140]
that's next Tuesday.

[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.220]
The money the county is seeking is supposed to cover the cost of additional

[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.960]
police protection, added traffic and they have a social cost of expanding gambling

[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.860]
at Pomato Park, Danya High Life, on Tone, Gulf Stream Park,

[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.100]
and Hollywood Greyhound Track.

[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.140]
It seems to me it's perfectly reasonable that a business should cover the cost

[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.920]
of the impact in our communities that Brown County Administrator Roger De Jarlay

[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.020]
sounds like a frog to me.

[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.420]
It's no different than a developer paying impact fees.

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:41.740]
The county's estimates are based on the premise that each slot machine nets at,

[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:42.580]
what does this say?

[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:47.720]
Nets out 200 bucks a day after payouts and expenses initially about 4,000

[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.500]
machines would be in place.

[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.640]
Many as 10,000 could be operational in four years.

[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.060]
Howard wants 1.5% of the revenue from each machine calculate

[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.440]
winnings after winnings are paid out.

[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.420]
Per mutual lobbyists have counted what they 1% offer.

[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.560]
The county is also trying to negotiate a deal that brings

[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.560]
Pomato Beach Day and the Beach and Helen Dale Beach, 2% of the revenue from each

[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.640]
of the machines within their borders.

[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.180]
It's interesting they're doing it like on a per machine basis.

[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.400]
I understand based on the number of machines I see.

[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.240]
There have been some language hangups but I think they're close

[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.060]
at lobbyist Ron Book who represents the per mutual's industry but they'll get there

[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.440]
and you know what he's right, they will get there.

[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.500]
The county commission's auditor Evan Lukich said Wednesday he's been reviewing the

[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.300]
contract to ensure the county rangles as much as possible out of the deal.

[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.180]
They squeezed the blood out of them so if you're losing your ass just blame the

[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.960]
county on it. They're just squeezing too much.

[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.260]
Our biggest thing is protecting the community that what protection the county has

[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.180]
and how the deal is structured.

[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.120]
Luke, Luke, it said.

[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.600]
But come Tuesday the referendum will probably be approved.

[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.100]
The hero says only mayor Kristen Jacobs will live in Vegas and has moral objections

[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:42.620]
to gambling.

[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.260]
More objections to gambling.

[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:48.240]
Oh my God. We'll vote against the referendum when it first came up late last year.

[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.520]
Everyone keeps being dazzled by these numbers but they're not based on anything

[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.700]
real. Jacob said still the Broward County commission which includes three lawyers

[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.740]
and is known for hanging over the smallest details of contracts during meetings

[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.180]
probably they know Joyce is likely to join Jacobs in tough negotiations.

[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.800]
Obviously we're trying to get the best deal for the county's advice mayor Ben Graber.

[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.560]
It's interesting he's the vice mayor.

[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.940]
That's probably what he's involved in this.

[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.560]
Jacob said that since it's clear her eight colleagues on the county commission want

[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.240]
the issue on a ballot she'll work next week to negotiate the best deal she can for the county

[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.380]
but once her colleagues approve it she'll begin working to defeat the referendum.

[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:23.080]
Fat chance hunting you got no chance none and much much much much less than none.

[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.260]
There's about as much chance to that as all of a sudden date and brow returning

[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.200]
like a paradise.

[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.740]
No chance in your pants hunting.

[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.100]
I make my point clear good.

[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.000]
Let's get about a hundred more things on here like eating Gilbert's grapes.

[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.480]
That's an old movie.

[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:38.120]
Yes.

[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.780]
I don't think anybody we ain't writing this audience will want to even be near Gilbert's grapes.

[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.320]
What do you think was the best movie of 2004 we got 255 votes not too bad considering

[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.040]
that's maybe not the greatest pull question ever.

[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.320]
It's certainly not assimilating is what do you think a hours during go off QA and Monday

[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.100]
where we had like almost 2000 votes.

[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:56.720]
Remember that?

[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:57.240]
Yep.

[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.140]
That was hot baby that was big it was some mokin.

[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:06.420]
Farron height 9 11 109, Spider-Man 220, passionate the Christ 19, Shrek 2 18,

[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.400]
team America highly recommended by George 14.

[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.860]
He said there's a lot of hot young people in it.

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:12.720]
Yeah.

[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.100]
No.

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.680]
It's puppets man.

[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.600]
What's the movie you told me that I had to see with all the hot young naked people in it?

[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.720]
Team America is puppets.

[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.800]
He said there's a lot of hot young puppets in it.

[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.200]
What's that movie you were telling me?

[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.300]
I forgot.

[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.860]
Oh jee good on it.

[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.960]
If there's not a lot of it what do I want to see puppets?

[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:31.560]
It's funny.

[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.580]
Get out of here.

[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.600]
Puppets my ass.

[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.860]
I like South Park but the puppets.

[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.340]
Michael Moore's in it.

[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.680]
Oh I want to see it.

[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:42.940]
The Incredibles 11.

[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:43.500]
Kill.

[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.920]
I know you told me about some other movie but it must have been so outstanding you already

[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.240]
forgot.

[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.300]
Kill Bill Volume 2 8.

[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.820]
Born supremacy 7 with the lovely mad Damon who's got a very strange mouth.

[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.660]
Garden State 6 kind of looks like his lips have been stretched.

[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.300]
Sideway 6.

[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.340]
Meet the fuckers.

[01:16:59.280 --> 01:16:59.580]
Five.

[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.280]
That is their name by the way.

[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:01.520]
Yeah.

[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.320]
Like the Hustle Bulls, the fuckers.

[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.980]
There's Papa Focker and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 5.

[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.260]
Harold and Kumar go to White Castle 5.

[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.940]
I don't think they really go to White Castle is way hard.

[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.260]
What do I know?

[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:13.460]
I don't know.

[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.000]
I give away the ending.

[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:15.760]
No but is that what it's all about?

[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.020]
Really going to a White Castle?

[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:17.920]
That's what it's all about.

[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.340]
It's an Odyssey.

[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.020]
It's not fresh onions on the very young stoners.

[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.120]
Oh I see.

[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.600]
Collateral 5.

[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.900]
Polter Express 4.

[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.240]
Million Dollar Baby 4.

[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.920]
Before Sunset only 3 with the Ethan Hawking.

[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.300]
What's your name?

[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.580]
Kinsey 2.

[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.920]
Closer 2.

[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.660]
Nobody ever told us what the real name of that is.

[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:37.180]
Closer.

[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.760]
It's about the White Wheelhelm.

[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.160]
It's about Elroy Face.

[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.360]
Lemony Snicket's a series of unknown events.

[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.820]
Unfortunate events 1.

[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:45.920]
The Aviator 1.

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.540]
That's with lovely Leo but it don't seem to be doing all that great, Carolyn.

[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.820]
I guess you're the only one in this audience because we don't have a bunch of teenage silly little girls out there.

[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.160]
Listen, you're the only one that's got the Hustle Leo Carolyn.

[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.580]
Although we do believe you that you don't.

[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:56.840]
Going?

[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:57.220]
Not?

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.700]
A writing Giants 1.

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.180]
House of Flying Dagger is 1.

[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.660]
And Dogville has got the big...

[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:02.440]
Oh!

[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.300]
He's in it by the way.

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.520]
You're the same as me.

[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.840]
He's called one-files.

[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.260]
Exclusively.

[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:08.020]
Unfifx.

[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.540]
QAM.

[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.960]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.740]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.300]
We are the new Christian energy.

[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.940]
George Boyce's our Christ and King.

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.420]
We are our end of ignorant but once.

[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.600]
Praise to the Alaprinx of dumbness.

[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.440]
We sacrifice we must ingest.

[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.280]
The Bion blood of Paul Will's flesh.

[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.920]
We choose Lord and Diver of life.

[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.260]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.100]
We choose Lord and Diver of life.

[01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.440]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.720]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.200]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.320]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.800]
And so is the 4-shot toughness.

[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.460]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.360]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.320]
We're sounding the highest.

[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:11.800]
And so is the 4-shot toughness.

[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:11.800]

[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:11.800]

[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.400]
You know, it's interesting.

[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.080]
I was just thinking about that Barbara Boxer is the one senator that signed on to that...

[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:18.540]
Resolution.

[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:18.960]
Right.

[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.200]
Joint House Senate Resolution.

[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.200]
Not to certify the election results in Ohio.

[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.540]
Now, what was John Kerry?

[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.280]
You know that article I mentioned that we had on a website by Robert Perry.

[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.400]
On January 6th, what's John Kerry reports for duty?

[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:31.840]
Oh, man.

[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.540]
We could call this the Boxer Rebellion.

[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.060]
I love the way that he dragged Theresa around like a rag doll.

[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.100]
And that was kind of a mead.

[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.040]
Well, she wasn't going to do it out of her nose.

[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.100]
Here's the incoherent bitch who's got big $1.

[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.600]
And her husband is drag.

[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.380]
She's always like stone off her ass.

[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.260]
Plus, she takes a lot of pink cameras, I guess.

[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.200]
She can afford it.

[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.820]
And he's dragging around like a rag doll.

[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:53.060]
And her hair looked like a rag doll.

[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.980]
She was definitely an ass.

[01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:02.720]
At 5.670560, and John Edwards, he was really a big asset to when he looked at the way that he helped sweep the South for carrying the Democrats.

[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.860]
5.660 on the Verizon signal.

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.320]
Look at that.

[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.640]
There's now one call on the board right now.

[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.300]
What's that all about?

[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.060]
I can't remember the last time I saw that.

[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.300]
There must be some kind of an accident.

[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:10.960]
Look at that.

[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.500]
The one who did that.

[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.180]
The confirmation hearings.

[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.360]
Oh, is that one it is?

[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.080]
They're all watching the Alberto Jose Manez Gonzales?

[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.060]
Yeah, fat chance.

[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.780]
I think they're so mesmerized.

[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.020]
But whatever the hell we were talking about.

[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.040]
Which I have no idea what it was.

[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.060]
Oh, about Leo.

[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.600]
I think the Leo talk is what probably drove this crowd away.

[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.940]
Although I will say this, I like him better than Mel Gibson.

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.620]
If I never saw Leo the Capitol again, I'd be very happy.

[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.640]
But I like him a much better than Mel Gibson.

[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.580]
And every respect.

[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.260]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.400]
Hey, Neil.

[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.140]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.600]
You're asking, uh, ma'am.

[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:39.720]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.260]
You were asking about that movie, uh, Closer?

[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.020]
Yes.

[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:43.940]
Closer, is that it?

[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:44.700]
It's Closer.

[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.960]
It's the one with Julia Roberts and Jude Law.

[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.400]
Oh, I like Jude Law.

[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:48.960]
Yeah.

[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.120]
Robert's I like occasionally.

[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.200]
Once in a while, he's pretty good.

[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.900]
Yeah, well, you won't like him in this movie.

[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:53.560]
Really?

[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.960]
Yeah, it's not very good.

[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.040]
It's kind of like a love triangle, but there's four people.

[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.260]
And they just bounce around back and forth.

[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.020]
I love my back door, yeah.

[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:02.580]
Yeah.

[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.880]
And I don't think it was very good.

[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.420]
I was wondering if you had ever seen or anyone had mentioned to you the movie,

[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.520]
owning Mahoney.

[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.400]
Now, I remember Jerry Mahoney, Paul Winchell.

[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.420]
Well, it's a pretty good movie.

[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.200]
It stars, um, oh.

[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.960]
I remember Reverend Pat Mahoney was always on Mr. Ego show screaming about abortion.

[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:26.040]
Is it Philip Seymour Hoffman, the kind of overweight guy, ready to do it?

[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:26.560]
Yeah, right.

[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.340]
Yeah, it stars him in a space on a...

[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.940]
He's also been telling Mr. Ripley he played Freddie.

[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.000]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.760]
And, um, Boogie Knight, he was the...

[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.020]
Right.

[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:35.900]
Yeah, he did.

[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:40.500]
Well, he stars in this movie, and it's based on a true story.

[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.960]
There was a guy, Dan Mahoney, in Toronto in the early 80s,

[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:48.900]
who develops, um, he's addicted to gambling, and he works in a bank.

[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.240]
Um, he has the authority to give out loans, and he keeps overriding loans.

[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.320]
And instead of a $200,000 loan, he'll make it for $300,000,

[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.640]
and then take the 100 grand to the casino.

[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.720]
Who sounds like a plan?

[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.320]
Well, he eventually did get caught.

[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:04.920]
Oh.

[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.960]
But if you get a chance, you should check it out.

[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.040]
I think he's like it.

[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:08.980]
What's it called?

[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.580]
Oaning Mahoney.

[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:11.320]
Okay.

[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.660]
And that's about it.

[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:13.660]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:14.520]
Have a great new year.

[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.280]
Okay, you too.

[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:15.780]
See ya.

[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:15.980]
Bye.

[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.240]
Ow!

[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.060]
Where the hell is this thing start already?

[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.020]
One moment is so lonely, it's no longer that you ever do.

[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.380]
Can be if that is...

[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.520]
See, now you might not like Magnolia like I do,

[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.760]
but anybody doesn't like Amy Mann.

[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.120]
As far as work and concern is the comedy pink O'Peece of crap

[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.300]
ought to be deported immediately if not sooner.

[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.940]
I liked her since till Tuesday.

[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.440]
How can you not like Amy Mann?

[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.100]
She is just fine as wine.

[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.220]
What's that really depressing?

[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.240]
Well, that one's really depressing too, but what's that other one?

[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.020]
The other one.

[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.300]
The other song from Magnolia.

[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.280]
Oh, I don't know the name of it.

[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.440]
It's track Mood.

[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.060]
Huh?

[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.620]
I think that's the one you're talking about.

[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.700]
Oh, I'll find it.

[01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.060]
You'll find it.

[01:22:59.060 --> 01:22:59.060]

[01:22:59.100 --> 01:22:59.100]

[01:22:59.300 --> 01:22:59.780]
You'll find it.

[01:22:59.780 --> 01:22:59.920]
You'll find it.

[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.160]
It's a really pretty person.

[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.420]
No, but it's great song.

[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:04.880]
It's called...

[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:06.900]
It's called...

[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:10.360]
Why's up?

[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:11.020]
There it is.

[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.980]
And it's enough to make you commit suicide as a matter of fact.

[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.260]
Get Maddie Bell to let you go.

[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.920]
Oh, man, it's just the...

[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.420]
But if it's right in with that part of the movie, you know?

[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:20.840]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.740]
People with problems.

[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.560]
Like, what do you make to me?

[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.620]
So, he's got a small problem.

[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:27.880]
Yeah.

[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:28.360]

[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.680]
What's he up?

[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.340]
When we start...

[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:42.380]
Began...

[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.520]
Oh, she's just...

[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.000]
She's so...

[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.740]
And the music, which I think she wrote a lot of it, didn't she?

[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.340]
Yes, she did.

[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.660]
Uh, it's so perfect.

[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.820]
It fits with a movie like a rubber glove right inside your...

[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:50.960]
Right.

[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:51.580]
Yeah.

[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.640]
Inside your ringus.

[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.900]
Probably your space cadets.

[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:58.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, and they Verizon and please do yourself a favor.

[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.500]
Go out and rent or buy or steal, Magnolia.

[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:01.700]
I don't care what George says.

[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:07.900]
It's long when you got like, kind of, weekend when it's really boring and it's cloudy and rainy and breezy and windy and you'll want to go out and like, you know, go...

[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.660]
Make up your own ending.

[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:08.940]
Make up your own ending, etc.

[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:09.320]
Huh?

[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.420]
And you can make up your own ending.

[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.200]
I don't care whether George likes the ending or not.

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.700]
Believe me, you go watch it for yourself.

[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:15.420]
Don't listen to him.

[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.600]
He's just always looking for a Mr. Negatory, you know?

[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.680]
One of the great movies ever made in history with an air-reacting...

[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.420]
I think it's for air-reacting performance and it is sen-sational.

[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.700]
Even if you don't disagree with that.

[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.280]
No, that's like.

[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.080]
Okay, so shut up.

[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.660]
Somebody QAM Hello.

[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.300]
Henry Gibson, that's the name I can never remember.

[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:31.900]
Okay, that's it.

[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.020]
That's it.

[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:32.280]
At the bar.

[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.480]
Somebody QAM Hello.

[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.760]
Yeah, Johnny Mahoney here.

[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.000]
The best movie of the year was Collateral.

[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.440]
Collateral, okay.

[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.520]
That was the best movie.

[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:50.340]
And nothing I was trying to call a couple days ago is, you know, it was all the hype that Howard had with the, you know, the serious announcement and not so much.

[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.080]
You know, they only scattered up a little over 200,000 additional subscribers.

[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:55.480]
Right.

[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.540]
You know, I don't know if it could have been any hotter than he was at the time when he made the announcement and the, you know, carmas and went over there.

[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:01.720]

[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.020]
He needs a million subscribers a year.

[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:04.620]
Yeah.

[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:05.100]
Additional.

[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.400]
He shared to make any money.

[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:07.520]
So, I don't know.

[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.540]
Doesn't look too good.

[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:13.640]
No, I look sick of this sure thing, okay, because even though I might have to wait next to a day for my paycheck, at least now it's coming.

[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.840]
Yeah, yeah, I wrote an email, but of course they would never put that on here.

[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:18.980]
Okay, that's a lot, Pally.

[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:19.720]
Sure, see it, Pally.

[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.340]
No, they would not put it on here because it's something negative, right?

[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.280]
And he doesn't want anything like that.

[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.280]
In addition, which I'm sure this screening up to calls from Florida, they're, they've got to be, oh, people have been calling their all week long.

[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:34.360]
Without the articles, we're in a heraldous, unsentil, they want to weekly reader, they want like, uh, everywhere.

[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.220]
Maybe we don't have any answers in this, Todd.

[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.260]
Yeah, right.

[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:38.460]
Right.

[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.200]
Especially radio, you know, this man, we got him by the zygian, the diamond doesn't.

[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.840]
So, for whatever reason, they're keeping it mighty low, but then come Monday when he doesn't show up on here.

[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:47.920]
Oh, what happened?

[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.660]
Well, he's not going to be on on Monday, okay?

[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.620]
It's going to be the Hank Goldberg early morning showing.

[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.140]
And then this morning, Duff says to me, oh, should we put him on the list for how he's?

[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.520]
Are you crazy, Duff?

[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.580]
That's how it's.

[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.580]
Hank Goldberg is not going to be eating salads.

[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.540]
The man doesn't need to be eating in the morning, okay?

[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.800]
Let him have some of that nice bacon like I have.

[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.140]
Some of that microwave bacon, he can pop it into microwave, even though he doesn't, you know, cook at home.

[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.480]
He can pop it in right there.

[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.880]
He can borrow our microwave.

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:15.640]
How do you like that since we're nice, uh, generous guys?

[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.680]
Just nuke it right in there, Humper, and have a little bacon before we go on here.

[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.680]
It's something that won't raise your blood sugar or something that's not going to kill you.

[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.800]
Because if you guys put, or just get the bacon from how he's, there you go.

[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:26.560]
Right?

[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.280]
Of course.

[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.340]
And don't let them give him like they did that one time, 700 strips of it like they gave him to me.

[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.440]
I thought my insides were actually going to fall out.

[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.500]
I mean, I was, I was lubricated like you.

[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.060]
Like even the finest running machine in the history of the world has never been lubed up like my insides were.

[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.340]
Holy cow.

[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.760]
That was unreal.

[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:43.880]
Now, you remember that day?

[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:44.440]
I do.

[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.880]
I mean, it's one thing to bring a guy.

[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:46.860]
Yeah, I love bacon.

[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.360]
A little bit.

[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.520]
It would be nice, a little raster, whatever the hell they call it.

[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.400]
Why do they call it a raster?

[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.600]
I don't know what they call it.

[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.160]
It's a certain amount.

[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.000]
But they're very likely in about 7,000 strips of bacon.

[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.060]
See, it's calling killing people with kindness.

[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.740]
I've talked about that till I'm blue in the face.

[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:01.760]
People don't get it.

[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.420]
It's like that broad I used to bring into smarties at the hockey games.

[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.200]
Every time she'd be there, big loose fan.

[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.480]
Every time I'd be at the Yantos center out there for the Panthers and Leafs or whatever games she had to show up at.

[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.460]
Oh, I brought you all these smarties from Toronto.

[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.740]
And I'd say to her, I'm diabetic, please.

[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.020]
Oh, no, here, take them.

[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:17.780]
I know you love them.

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:23.120]
Oh, and of course, I would eat them being the, you know, addictive to sugar person that I am.

[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.420]
And by the time the first period started, my head was spinning.

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.940]
I thought that Frank Mahaviris was out there playing it.

[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.420]
I know what that was going on.

[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.720]
Curling people with kindness.

[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.120]
Here's a fact that says, please see City of God that is my favorite for the year.

[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:38.960]
City of God.

[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.240]
Now it says for this year, but what city you've got out in last year?

[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:42.680]
I don't know.

[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.060]
Well put it on there maybe oil.

[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.480]
Maybe it was or maybe it won't.

[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:45.920]
Maybe it will be.

[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.060]
I mean, it's not scientific.

[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.380]
I always say what these polls mean.

[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.880]
People, oh, they didn't come out until, wow, you have a tough, uh, teeny, okay?

[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:52.840]
Tough toddy.

[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.340]
I do like hot toddy though.

[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.200]
Haven't had that in years.

[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.540]
What's the little hot toddy?

[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.020]
Mm-hmm.

[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.460]
What's that all these hot toddy?

[01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.220]
It's not hot chocolate.

[01:27:59.380 --> 01:27:59.640]
I don't know.

[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.180]
It's like a noggin.

[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:01.900]
Nog family.

[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.420]
It's kind of like a melted milk.

[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.080]
Right.

[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.640]
We've been through that a million times too, man.

[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.480]
It's looking like white.

[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.280]
Original melted milk.

[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:08.800]
Oh, man.

[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.740]
We've got to get, that's what we need.

[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.960]
It's a real soda shop with a soda jerk.

[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.500]
They make really good ones over at the, uh, what you call it, starlight diners.

[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.800]
Yeah, that kind of a place.

[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.840]
But like, uh, like in a Walgreens, you know, that was it all.

[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:24.660]
Yeah, so the ice nerds are one of those places where they stand their own soda fountain.

[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:25.760]
Was it walworths?

[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:26.900]
Yeah, that might have been it.

[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:29.400]
And they had like the cherry coke out of the real fountain.

[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.580]
You know, real fountain coke.

[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.360]
Not this water down.

[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.000]
Green wrap.

[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:32.880]
Egg creams.

[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:36.260]
Real cheeseburgers that they cooked on a real fresh would like a real meat.

[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.640]
So it is a patented rubber that they got like a burger king.

[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.700]
Good ice cream floats.

[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:41.340]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:45.440]
And that's probably why people weren't dying quite so much from oil clogged arteries like they are now.

[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.040]
They used to make things like fresh and delicious as opposed to not like everything is prefabricated for a shelf life.

[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.200]
And it's made with like 85,000 chemicals.

[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.340]
They're killing you, man.

[01:28:53.580 --> 01:29:01.340]
And then of course, you do realize, and probably don't realize, that advertising pharmaceutical prescription drugs on television or radio in Canada is illegal.

[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.680]
As it ought to be.

[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:03.120]
Right.

[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.220]
They can advertise over the counter drugs, but advertising prescription drugs is illegal in this country.

[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:14.340]
But in the USA, if you watch the CBS Evening News or any other damn program, now every other ad is for lipitor and viox.

[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.180]
When that was spelled off, they decided to kill and people.

[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:17.940]
You name it.

[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.380]
And of course, the Olympus Cialis, the Olympus member crowd, you know.

[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.020]
Aerovy, other spot.

[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.280]
In fact, sometimes they're like, started by each fact to back.

[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.540]
You know how they got those piggyback 30 seconds?

[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:29.740]
Back to back for pharmaceutical drugs.

[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.340]
So they're thinking continue killing you.

[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.660]
And then after you start taking it for six months, you go to your doctor.

[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.720]
Oh, that's not a really good give me a prescription for that.

[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.260]
Oh, guess what? It's killing you. You're going to have a heart attack. You're going to die.

[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.640]
Oh, but well.

[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.080]
Pretty sad.

[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.620]
See when the health of the public becomes nothing more than business, then you got a real serious problem.

[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.000]
You follow what I'm saying, follow my drift.

[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:47.660]
What do you say?

[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:51.760]
Resolve yourself to a better night's sleep in 2005 by calling 1-800-max.

[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.080]
That's what I'm saying right now.

[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.240]
Nothing's got a bigger impact on your daily health, well being in productivity than a good night's sleep.

[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.380]
And you can get a great night's sleep tonight without sleeping pills, by the way,

[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.280]
from dialymythrus because if you have a great mattress, you sleep like a baby.

[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.280]
So call 1-800-max right now.

[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.620]
If your mattress is more than 10 years older, it's sagging or lumpy, bumping like crap.

[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.100]
Then that was the time for a new one.

[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.920]
And you can get a great deal from our friends at dialymythrus, like always.

[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:17.140]
Two is from a seedy, a seedy, a seedy, a seroton, a Simmons-King-Quil,

[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.260]
10-perpetent concerns, and bananas foster too.

[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.300]
Boy, I sure love bananas foster. Wow.

[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.860]
That is one of my very favorites. And also, what's that other stuff?

[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:24.760]
That's tiramisu.

[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.080]
What's that other chocolate thing?

[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.640]
How about the chocolate fondue found at the Emerald Hose?

[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.680]
Phytonum actress takes sand day orders all day long from Kendall Stewart from Palm Beach to Fort Myers.

[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.980]
And they still like to pick that to our window for delivery whenever it's convenient for you

[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:41.620]
when you're going to be there, as opposed to sitting around killing a whole day, praying and hoping somebody shows up.

[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:45.980]
And dialymythrus, they're proud of their delivery record on time 99.7% of the time,

[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:51.000]
which is why dialymythrus won the 2004 Better Business Bureau Local Torch Award for Excellence.

[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:51.960]
Have a newsroom for years.

[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.240]
Next time you need a new mattress, you ought to be doing the same.

[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.440]
Just pick up that phone one easy call 1-800-MATRUS or log onto their website mattress.com.

[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.780]
Dialymythrus 1-800-MATRES.

[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:03.640]
Sure.

[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.920]
It's a new rocket.

[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.020]
It's a good experience.

[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.040]
I don't know what you think.

[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:08.240]
A-M.

[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:11.800]
Oh man, what's up with your footcar?

[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:12.560]
Dimash Poha.

[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:14.920]
I hope you.

[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.900]
Yeah, hi. Is this Brainerd?

[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:17.340]
Yeah.

[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:18.480]
Where Fargo was filmed?

[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.480]
They just left.

[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.400]
No, no, Fargo.

[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:20.980]
Yeah?

[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.900]
Is this where the movie Fargo was filmed?

[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:23.520]
No, I'm not.

[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.860]
Yeah, but this is Brainerd, right?

[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.240]
Yeah.

[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.580]
Have you ever seen the movie Fargo?

[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.040]
What do you mean, the movie Fargo?

[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:30.400]
The movie Fargo.

[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.840]
Do we need to know suit anything?

[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:32.440]
No, no.

[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.280]
Is your manager in?

[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.260]
This is manager.

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:37.780]
Okay. There's a movie called Fargo that was filmed at your place.

[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:39.640]
Okay. What time, do you know?

[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.540]
It's mail to Greyhound Line.

[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.060]
Are you kidding me?

[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.760]
Fargo. It's a movie.

[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.040]
It was filmed at your hotel.

[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.080]
I don't know what you're saying, sir.

[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:48.660]
Okay. Let me.

[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.520]
Hey there.

[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.180]
Yes.

[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.100]
What's up?

[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.040]
Yeah. They filmed the movie Fargo there.

[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:53.320]
Yeah.

[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:53.780]
No.

[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:54.540]
Yeah.

[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.920]
Sir, this is lodge.

[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.760]
I mean, the people stay here.

[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.120]
They don't mail here the Fargo movies.

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.280]
No, no, no.

[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.340]
The movie was filmed there.

[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:05.660]
Yeah.

[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.660]
No, no. Nothing is here.

[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.520]
I want to put you through all one shiver.

[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.040]
1218.

[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:16.040]
I was thinking and thinking and thinking.

[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:16.860]
So I just looked it up.

[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.520]
I did the easy way.

[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:18.560]
Francis McDormand.

[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.540]
Oh, yeah, there she is.

[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.300]
She was in Fargo with Woody-Mitch, may say.

[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.340]
Well, she was really, I mean, he was good.

[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.120]
There's always, he's great.

[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.580]
But she was spectacular.

[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.360]
And who would have ever said, who would have asked Francis McDormand?

[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:29.780]
Right. Who would have.

[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.940]
She's in practically all of the Cohen brothers movies, which are almost all good.

[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:33.760]
Is she really?

[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.060]
She was in Raisona and Blood Simple, for example.

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:37.300]
Oh, Blood Simple. That's right.

[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:37.760]
That was good.

[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.580]
Raising Arizona, I never saw.

[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.100]
It's good. It's a rye.

[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:41.860]
You might not know.

[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.420]
Was that about Phoenix? River Phoenix, Arizona?

[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.040]
No.

[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:44.960]
Paonics?

[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:45.380]
No.

[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.280]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:51.340]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:51.340]

[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:54.980]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.080]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:57.860]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.100]

[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:58.620]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.280]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:59.280 --> 01:32:59.740]
I'm sorry.

[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.300]
I'm sorry.

[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:00.520]
I'm sorry.

uh... what do you think that socialize medicine where everybody has uh... you

[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.460]
know health care what are what a concept

[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.420]
and not have everybody run around with guns murdering each other

[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.380]
you know how many murders we had in the city last year i think it was sixty one

[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:26.080]
which is still too many and they're all a gas to about that and uh... you know

[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.120]
city of comparable size in the west it like four five hundred a year three hundred

[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.840]
and fifty and really clean your you know say we're better at everything

[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.460]
yeah that's right just like Florida man whether it's uh... sexually transmitted

[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:39.000]
diseases whether it's murders you know uh... south Florida generally like and not

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.760]
only south Florida but camp on west palm jackson bill usually florida cities are

[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.820]
right up there in the running all those horrible categories whatever it is

[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.320]
and then there's some people have the audacity all this is paradise

[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.080]
but the dot the guys i guess when you can't go any place else well he didn't know he

[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.820]
just got here yeah then i guess once you work the qm a few months he realized there

[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.660]
was a living hell how do you like that that's why he was trying to make it living

[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.180]
pal for all the rest of us see i was thinking about that this morning

[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:07.820]
i mean somebody brought it up the other day joking about mad dog and uh... him

[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.760]
doing the games together about some comment that he made about how great it was

[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.120]
work it was working with mad dog and and manage just just pretending to be here

[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.520]
just move on to some other comment uh... when you when you work with it within a

[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.800]
group of people not just in one place but in a number of places in every single one

[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.740]
of them hates you like poison now maybe that's why he finally flipped his lid

[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.920]
you know i'm saying maybe finally that he did some us grab

[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.240]
and i've got the stuffy stuff with a checkered pants and all that you know put it

[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.100]
on the pretenses and pick them dingle barriers you know that maybe that's the

[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.680]
reason i'll admit that it was a little bit too late that much too late but it

[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.660]
but for me in other words if i worked in that environment and everybody in a

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:49.820]
building hated me like poison which i'm not the kind of person as you know that

[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:53.240]
cares about what other people think but if everybody hated me with like a

[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.320]
passion i'd have to say well yeah must be doing something wrong must be really

[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.920]
bad guy i must like need some social skills something right it's everybody else

[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.820]

seven thousandth person that you work with finally i hate you like poison turns on you like a

press headline that came over the bar yesterday said it all Gonzalez will follow non-torture policies

[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.980]
you know how bad the situation is when the president's choice for attorney general has to formally

[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.680]
pledge not to support torture anymore now bertho Gonzalez may have been willing to legally justify

[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.360]
something that was important to everything america stands for but it's all relative given the

[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.840]
mr. Gonzalez is replacing the odious john ashcroft democrats didn't seem inclined to try to

[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.180]
derail the hispanic nominee even though his memo forced the fostered the atmosphere that led to

[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:19.420]
disgusting scandals in abu garrabe and getmo just to get things started on the right foot though

[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:23.540]
mr. Gonzalez planned to go the extra mile and offer the quaint obsolete senate democrats a more

[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.300]
nuanced explanation of why he called these in eva conventions quaint and obsolete before we

[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:32.340]
help president for circumvent the accords and reserve the right to do so in this or future conflicts

[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.980]
you had a tune into an old movie with nazi generals or vietcong guards if you wanted to see someone

[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.620]
sneeringly shrug off the international treaty protecting prisoners from abuse you worthless running

[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:45.980]
dog truck norris what do we care about your sole geniva conventions how are you to believe mr.

gonsolas when he says he's through with torture his mission is clearly into whatever he thinks mr.

[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.060]
bush wants after gall that's spelled g a l l and this column all gall is divided into parts of

[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:59.980]
what's next the commerce department nominee promising that giveaways two big big giveaways to

[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:04.500]
big business will be done with salty the environmental protection agency nominee promising that the

[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:08.940]
toxin content and water will never rise to use chanko level it's comforting to start the new year

[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:13.240]
in the hands of a party that cares so much about morals and values time delay and oily house

[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.300]
republicans inaugurated their new term by gutting ethics rules there's in case any of them get caught

[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:21.520]
in whatever misconduct they're plotting ramey continued on his oblivious dissembling path

[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.600]
refusing to admit that he's tapped out the army and broken the army reserve with what lieutenant

[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.520]
general james helmy the frustrated chief of army reserve calls dysfunctional policies we've

[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.160]
gotten so numb on a rack that when eight american soldiers and over eighty Iraqi police officers

[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.420]
have get killed when the governor of bag that gets assassinated and when our puppets plead with mr.

[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:41.980]
burs to delay the elections it all seems like just another week of pre-election maneuvering

[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.620]
in the late times we learn that bush faith supreme court justice clearance token thomas has

[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:50.160]
accepted tens of thousand dollars worth of gifts and joining the high court including twelve

[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.640]
hundred dollars worth of tires valuable historical items and a fifty five thousand dollar personal

[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.120]
check to help pay a relative's education expenses a guy we pain nearly two hundred grand a year

[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.260]
can't pop for his own tires whatever happened to the dignity of the role at least we know where

[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:07.800]
our possible future chief justice stands for on the side of personal corruption he also took a

[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:12.120]
free trip aboard a private set to the exclusive bohemian grove club in northern california arranged by

[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.640]
wealthy texas real estate investor who helped run an advocacy group that filed briefs with a supreme

[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:21.080]
court the paper said the early times reviewed the disclosures of all nine justice for the years 98

[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.420]
through two thousand three and found that thomas accepted forty two thousand two hundred dollars

[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:29.880]
in gifts making him the top recipient next in that period was just a standard aoconner who accepted

[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.420]
almost six thousand in gifts mostly small christine crit a christle figurines and other items

[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:39.760]
thomas follows aunt and scalea's lead on the law while so not on ethics just as scalea defended

[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.280]
taking his relatives on a ride on air force to de Louisiana with the chaining to go duck hunting

[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.940]
even though the VP had an important case before the court by saying that it would have been a

[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:51.940]
considerable inconvenience to fly commercial going through a blistering confirmation hearing

[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:55.920]
where his inappropriate behavior was questioned didn't teach thomas much can we hope for anything

[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.060]
better for mr. Gonzalez after he's waved through to be man in charge of enforcing our law

[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:04.240]
or your biden was given him the what for but you know it's just a dog and pony show

[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:09.560]
right right we all know exactly what's going to happen just like we should know what was going to

[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:14.160]
happen with a fixed election for example Ohio's Republican secretary of state Kenneth blackwell

[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:18.000]
you'll love this story man this will make you like pissed off him fired up Kenneth blackwell

[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.020]
boasted of helping deliver Ohio from president bush said he was truly pleased to announce bush

[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:26.400]
of one Ohio even before all of the states votes have been counted in his own fundraising letter

[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:30.580]
the letter which was received by a Butler County resident December 31 is a pre-disappointed

[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:34.760]
blackwell's campaign for governor the resident who gave it is asked to remain anonymous he

[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.340]
liked to stay alive in a practice regard for his nonpartisan role as Ohio's chief election official

[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:43.620]
the Republican secretary and chairman of Bush's Ohio Relection Campaign slammed John Kerry as

[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:47.640]
a disaster who would have reached terrible and horrible results on both Ohio and the US

[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.720]
a further blackwell's use of the word deliver finds striking residence with another controversial

[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:57.620]
fundraising letter sent by the CEO of voting machine manufacturer dive all the no del in the

[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.760]
summer of 2003 when he said he was committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the

[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.580]
president next year blackwell's campaign office confirmed that they sent a letter but offered

[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.360]
no further comment without your enthusiasm generous support and vote I'm afraid the president

[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:13.500]
would have lost blackwell wrote and an unapologetic liberal democrat named John Kerry would have won

[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:18.160]
thankfully he adds you and I stopped that disaster from happening blackwell also noted that he was

[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.880]
truly pleased to announce president bush the victor no Ohio even before all the votes had been

[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:28.280]
counted he adds that he declared the victor on his own personal belief but is this sound like

[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.660]
Catherine Harris or what or Glenda in the hood in the late hours of election night I was truly

[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:36.240]
pleased to announce president Bush and won a critical and clinching victory here in Ohio on the

[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.600]
belief that it was statistically improbable senator Kerry to recover the secretary penned even in

[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:44.200]
the wake of a house judiciary committee investigation by democrats in the voting irregularities no

[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:48.580]
Ohio blackwell goes as far as the same that he was proud to prevent voting fraud myriad published

[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.460]
reports have noted that blackwell went out of his way to keep voters from voting at one point in

[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.860]
system that voter registration cards be accepted only on a paper of a certain weight I have never

[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:00.000]
shot away from giving the liberal spits he remarked in the letter and I'm sure that with all the

[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.520]
voter fraud we prevented during the last election that we looking to get even with me my next

[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.160]
political campaign representative john conures of michigan report on voting irregularities will

[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.820]
blast blackwell for his transparent partisanship uh raw story which is the website this is on has been

[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:18.120]
given the copies of that report many are strongly suspected that the inexplicable that arbitrary

[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.440]
decisions of secretary blackwell stem from partisan political motivations conures staff report

[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.400]
declared this is efficient apparently is bolstered by secretary blackwell himself and he recently

[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.880]
sent fundraising letter conures report showers scorn on blackwell for his pleasure announcing

[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.960]
Bush's victory such a blatant statement acknowledging the co-mingling of his official duty to ensure

[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.960]
a fair election with his partisan duty to reelect president Bush made in a political fundraising

[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.360]
appeal evidence of secretary blackwell's poor judgment at best and the manipulation of election

[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.560]
administration for partisan purposes and worst the report asserts

That's the extent of their publicity, you know?

[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:53.180]
The little brown baguette, the hero, who's probably sitting on mommy's knee right now,

[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.200]
getting spoon fed along.

[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.000]
Probably yogurt, yogurt and peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.640]
You and that the Georgia Tech basketball 7 to 9, 8K follows that.

[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.080]
That's the correct schedule for today.

[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:05.200]
And of course, when you're a QAM, we're there never sure if you have the correct schedule

[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:05.460]
or not.

[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:09.220]
But it would just seem to me that it would probably be a real good idea, guys, to have

[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.760]
like a schedule for Monday come out tomorrow.

[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.380]
And I'm probably being Sarni's column and being Barry Jackass.

[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.320]
When you think, no.

[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.540]
We'd like to know, just for the hell of it.

[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:17.760]
70 QAM, hello.

[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:19.460]
Hey, Mr. Bill.

[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:20.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:21.400]
I got a question.

[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:28.420]
The Democratic Party right now, why is anybody's right mind with anybody both Democratic, a bunch

[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.900]
of finalists who can't defend anything?

[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:35.540]
I mean, Ralph Nated hasn't had the chance in hell, but at least he has the goal to speak

[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.100]
his mind.

[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:37.060]
And what is that?

[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.160]
What did he speak his mind about?

[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:38.720]
What did he say?

[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.780]
The same old tire crap he's been saying for 30 years?

[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.840]
Well, you remember on the Wolf Bluffer Show when he said we got to get that Bush regime out

[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:45.040]
of it.

[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:45.580]
Yeah.

[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:47.280]
And Bluffer tried to correct him up.

[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.840]
I mean, I've never even heard Quentin or Gore.

[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:54.680]
I mean, thousands of votes were stolen and the Democratic Party was back in the

[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.140]
middle of the day.

[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:58.100]
You're trying to convince me that the Democrats are a bunch of finalists, whims.

[01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:59.340]
You're preaching the choir, baby.

[01:56:59.340 --> 01:56:59.900]
Absolutely.

[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.520]
I've been saying that for a long time since before Jesus was an infant.

[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:04.360]
I've been saying that.

[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:04.980]
That's true.

[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.060]
So why would anybody want to support the Democratic?

[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.040]
America like...

[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.560]
Well, you see, you've got to have a buffer man.

[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.880]
You've got to keep the fascist out.

[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:11.660]
That was the whole thing.

[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:13.040]
And I blame them.

[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.020]
I don't blame the other side.

[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:14.560]
I blame them.

[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:17.660]
Just like they did the previous time, two times in a row of disaster.

[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.400]
They're the masters of disaster.

[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:19.980]
Yeah.

[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:20.880]
All right, Neil.

[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.860]
I love you so much, George, man.

[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:23.440]
Okay.

[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:23.860]
Thanks, Charlie.

[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:25.300]
He says you'll see him at around 730.

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:30.380]
When you can have four or eight years of prosperity like we did under Bubba, when you can have a nation

[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:34.260]
relatively at peace, I mean, we had a thing in Bosnia where we were in Kosovo, we killed

[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.620]
a bunch of people, but nevertheless, and a few bombs on Iraq.

[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.760]
But everything is relatively acopacetic.

[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.300]
And you can wind up losing an election after that.

[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:47.240]
After telling everybody it's the economy, stupid, and everything was going so well.

[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.340]
And we had unprecedented all those new jobs.

[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.320]
America was coming right along.

[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:53.340]
And of course, Al Gore and Jew Lieberman.

[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:56.180]
And I'm still the only person in America that's going to tell you the truth.

[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:59.660]
That's why that ticket didn't have a China man's chance, even though they want a popular

[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:00.780]
vote in the deep south.

[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:05.580]
You put an Orthodox Jew on it, especially a whiny, fanatical Orthodox Jew like Jew Lieberman,

[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:09.320]
whose pathetic and best and embarrassment to the human race at worst.

[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.440]
What chance any of those mugwumps in the south are going to vote for him?

[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.800]
Can you see the people in Tennessee vote for Jew Lieberman?

[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:15.900]
Completely.

[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:20.480]
And I realize that people don't vote first for a vice president, but nevertheless, when

[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.620]
you put somebody like that, his presence is there.

[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:24.380]
You know, you don't count into his kin.

[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.040]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.100]
His type, his kind.

[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:26.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:28.160]
Go back to Connecticut.

[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.260]
All right, go rub your tisses together.

[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.840]
Go grow up, put your pay us on your lobes or whatever.

[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:33.840]
Get out of our face.

[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.180]
You crazy person you.

[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:38.680]
Well, I know, and the Tom Ridge is a very honorable person.

[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.320]
He wouldn't ever get out of here.

[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:40.800]
Go away.

[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:43.860]
Talk about, in fact, he's the poster child for whiny and wimpy.

[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:47.360]
And they made him the vice presidential candidate four years ago, five, whatever it was.

[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.100]
There he is.

[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.320]
The poster child for whining, wimpy, equivocating, piece of third.

[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:54.760]
Who, by the way, is on the bad wagon for the war to rack thinks it's a great idea.

[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:55.600]
Good.

[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:56.460]
God almighty.

[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:57.600]
That's a democratic party.

[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.420]
This collar is right.

[01:58:58.820 --> 01:58:59.940]
They're both parties suck.

[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.240]
I've been telling you that for a long time.

[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.160]
I'm not here telling you all the Democrats are great.

[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:03.800]
They blow.

[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:07.360]
And the proof of it is they blew two big elections two times a day.

[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:10.300]
We couldn't afford the luxury of having an incompetent party like that.

[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:11.860]
We were on the right track.

[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.100]
Thanks to the internet, man.

[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:14.160]
Thanks to the internet.

[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:15.460]
We were definitely on the right track.

[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.780]
And then they noticed the rail is okay over like a phony-dub video tape of, you know,

[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:24.460]
with the audio all phony-dub to make it seem like power being was a loose cannon.

[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:25.400]
He was a crazy person.

[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.140]
He was a ragster.

[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:28.100]
When, in fact, it didn't matter.

[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:31.040]
As all he was trying to do was scream over the crowd if you heard the real audio, which

[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.620]
they didn't bother showing for about a week or ten days later and then ABC apologized.

[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:37.740]
Well, it was really kind of like taking it out of context because you couldn't hear the

[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:38.240]
crowd noise.

[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.320]
It was a directional microphone.

[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:40.900]
So what you heard was wrong.

[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.200]
But of course, that was after all the damage it was done and everybody was thinking,

[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.500]
oh, this is a crazy person.

[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.740]
Yeah, we can keep it an up for him.

[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:51.640]
And as Carl Rose said later on when all the smoke cleared, that was the guy we were

[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:52.360]
really scared of.

[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.880]
Of Howard Dean because he wasn't an old political hack like John Kerry.

[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.620]
He wasn't an old walked in insider like Dick Gebhardt.

[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.000]
He wasn't one of those old hacks.

[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.020]
He was a guy with a pair of balls, man, who told it like it was.

[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:08.060]
Who had the balls to go on on national TV, on network TV that after Tom Ridges election

[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:13.420]
geared terror warning, yellow alert, whatever it was, pink alert, orange alert, and go on

[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:14.980]
and say this was all politics, man.

[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.060]
It's all based on crap.

[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.800]
And then they have to guess what was they put on them?

[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.760]
And he found that by the way, speaking to the devil to the bunk, what he just said,

[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:23.600]
Julie Burman.

[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.580]
Oh, I know Tom Ridges is a very honorable man and he would never do anything like that

[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:29.440]
for political prayer.

[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.680]
Where I blow it out your ass, Julie Burman, you make me embarrassed every veganist,

[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.400]
sick of halavai, you phony, valoni.

[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:37.920]
Man, you tear my kishis out.

[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:39.360]
Although I do like good kishis.

[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:40.320]
Oh, great.

[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:40.780]
God.

[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.220]
Oh, would you like to grave you on it?

[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:43.840]
That stuff will tear your guts out.

[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.780]
1252 at 560 WQM from Incoherity 5, no idea.

[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:48.740]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:50.100]
That makes several of us okay?

[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.240]
And that's the way I like it.

[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.120]
You just wait.

[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:53.100]
You ain't heard nothing yet.

[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:55.660]
Now that I reupped on here, no holes bar, Joyce.

[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.460]
I'm letting all hang out right out there in the window.

[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.380]
Wait till you're this by the way, speaking to letting all hang out.

[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:01.960]
Okay.

[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.240]
Indecency provisions that died last year could be making a retune as soon as representing

[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.740]
the front up in Shireman of the House Health Communications Subcommittee and I say they'll

[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:11.980]
put a new bill back on the table.

[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.080]
The Michigan Republican, plans to reintroduce the bill allowing the FCC to dole out indecency

[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.820]
fines for stations and performers.

[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.500]
According to Broadcast and cable, Upton's new submission will, one, boost the maximum

[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:29.060]
indecency fine from 325 to $500,000 for incident for stations and individuals.

[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.200]
So in other words, if Stern played 10 parts at 500,000 a piece, that's 5 million right

[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:34.420]
there.

[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.900]
You can do that in like in six seconds.

[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:42.120]
Two, require a license revocation hearing after three violations and three put a 180-day

[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:46.400]
shot clock for FCC actions out of complaint and four, strike the current provision that

[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.640]
individual cited for indecency can get a warning but not a fine for the first defense.

[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:55.220]
Kansas Republican Senator, the anxiously right-winged elunative Sam Brownback is also expected

[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:57.460]
to submit a new version of this indecency bill later this year.

[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:00.460]
This is what you're dealing with under the current Nazi climate in America.

[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:02.580]
That's why Howard Stern is going to serious.

[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:04.300]
That's why we can't play fart sounds.

[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:08.420]
That's why sex like that other caller said before that punk who called in, sexes verboten

[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:08.580]
man.

[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:11.560]
We can't even say the P word of the V word or even think about it on the show.

[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:15.640]
If we even think about anything like a cucumber, that might look like a sexual thing like a

[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:17.320]
phallic or the shape of the state of Florida.

[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.200]
Joyce is going to be like on a hotline and a bat line in two seconds.

[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:20.980]
I do like that.

[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:22.860]
Sticking her and nosing our ass.

[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:24.880]
It's good things for any there anymore.

[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.340]
I'm saying what do you say if she found a spot she might get nervous.

[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:30.160]
Oh, the spot we were talking about before.

[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:34.300]
I said she had spots up the open screen was there.

[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:34.940]
It's what I said.

[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:37.040]
We understand where they came from too.

[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:37.800]
Believe you me.

[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:38.160]
Wow.

[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:43.120]
I wonder speaking of the devil what our friend truly thinks about that probably should

[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:43.880]
have told him first.

[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:45.240]
I'm afraid we work at party.

[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.800]
Where's your five six seven oh five sixty.

[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:48.880]
Don't have to say anything.

[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:50.500]
It's just just a rhetorical question.

[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.000]
You were there.

[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.020]
I wonder what the hell really went on.

[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.060]
I mean, was it like I don't want to go in detail.

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.520]
I don't want to like to be well.

[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:58.280]
She's not there anymore.

[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:58.880]
So we didn't say whatever.

[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.660]
I don't want to be.

[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.940]
You'll be in subordination gets suspended.

[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:04.440]
By the way, we're going to be taking a pull them on the first hour.

[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:08.280]
Who will fill in for Hank on his first suspension when he goes to do morning shows.

[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.820]
Family QA and hello.

[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:10.740]
Hello.

[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:11.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:12.120]
Hi.

[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:13.720]
Happy New Year to you, Neil.

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.580]
And the same to you, sir.

[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:16.440]
To you and the whole crew there.

[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.460]
You and your crew as well.

[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:19.260]
Okay.

[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.700]
I think my wife and I would would talking about something today and that's probably.

[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:25.460]
And then you're speaking.

[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:26.340]
That's a good sign.

[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.360]
Well, you know, she only knows one thing.

[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:32.340]
She doesn't, she only knows not one thing, not the kitchen.

[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.340]
If you know what I mean, we're talking about Henning Youngman.

[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:35.960]
We were just curious.

[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.980]
This gets overlooked.

[02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:45.380]
When do you think the statue of limitations runs out as far as saying to your neighbors, to your friends, your co-workers, happy New Year?

[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:46.340]
I'll hang up and listen.

[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:46.720]
Love you.

[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:47.400]
Okay.

[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:47.720]
Thanks.

[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.000]
The statue of limitations that's right here, the statue of liberty.

[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:51.520]
Right.

[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.320]
I think what he's trying to say is one, one's a good time.

[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.580]
I think right now is a good idea.

[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:56.240]
Right.

[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.320]
Thank you very much.

[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:00.080]
You're coming today very serious and important pubic service there.

[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:04.180]
I think January the 6th at 12.56 pm is a sensational time to say,

[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:07.740]
okay, it's like the people that were calling in December wish me happy birthday.

[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:09.920]
I'm sorry, my birthday is on November the 5th.

[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:12.380]
And I'm not that I'm an ungrateful bastard, all the way.

[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:12.980]
Actually, I am.

[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.600]
But it's just the idea that it doesn't mean anything anymore, you know?

[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.680]
And it loses the significance.

[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.260]
Plus, you don't have to wish me happy birthday.

[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.360]
When you get to be my age, it's not a happy birthday.

[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:26.260]
Believe me, every birthday is one giant leaf closer to the box, okay?

[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.940]
It's not like a happy occasion.

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.920]
Now you should look at it as an accomplishment.

[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:30.480]
No.

[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:31.600]
What does that mean?

[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:33.240]
It still lies.

[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:33.900]
It still lies.

[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:35.360]
It still lies.

[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.180]
And your hands, you look at your hands like you're standing like,

[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.380]
like your skin is starting to get flabby and loose.

[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:41.800]
Think of all the things that you're dropping.

[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:43.880]
The topic is dropping out of where your knees used to be.

[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.520]
Reddy White died at 43.

[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.280]
Well, good.

[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:46.940]
That's that.

[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.140]
That's news I've heard, okay?

[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.080]
Big of a nasty rotten lunatic.

[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.940]
With his scambles soup, man.

[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.280]
That'll take you kids out there to be eaten too much at scambles soup.

[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.240]
Or your fatal, he just like reddy White.

[02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.820]
I've heard of the Lord smitten him, man.

[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:00.420]
He smote him.

[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.340]
He smitten him.

[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.860]
Because he was full of smit.

[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:03.900]
Smote him if you got him.

[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:04.520]
That's right.

[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.040]
The Lord let him have it, baby, full barrels.

[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.140]
That's why he didn't wake up.

[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:09.420]
He said, I'm so sick of charity.

[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:10.720]
You're participating in my name.

[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:14.580]
That's viewing nothing but hatred and intolerance and stupidity ignorance.

[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:17.760]
And sitting there reading, pouring over to Bible and all this crap written by

[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:20.980]
Ignoramus is 5,000 years ago who didn't know they were asked for my elbow?

[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:22.120]
For giving them all.

[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:22.500]
Give me the ball.

[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:24.160]
See, that's what we're supposed to admire him for.

[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:24.960]
He's a football player.

[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.700]
Well, who gives a flying crap about that, huh?

[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.140]
Just like Pat Tillman.

[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:30.720]
I mean, you know, also he died a hero and said it and so on.

[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.260]
And he could have continued playing football.

[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:36.280]
He wanted to defend his country and Afghanistan wherever they sent him.

[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.480]
But the fact of the matter is there are a lot of other faceless people who weren't football players

[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:41.160]
who were just as brave, maybe braver.

[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:41.980]
And they died too.

[02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:45.780]
We don't hear a damn thing about them except every night on the CBS even news for about 10 seconds.

[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:48.880]
When Dan Redder shows a picture of another guy who's dead now or woman.

[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:51.880]
Who's dead now because of your butcher, the butcher of DC.

[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.840]
They keep talking about the butcher of Baghdad.

[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:54.800]
Forget about him.

[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:56.220]
We got the butcher of DC.

[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:59.160]
Boy, you better calm me down a little bit.

[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:01.820]
Well, I can't pour water on you from here.

[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:02.840]
Just a little bit.

[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.000]
Call that.

[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:04.500]
No.

[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:15.760]
If you decided to start the New Year off, right, and trim down with Atkins or South Beach or Sugar Busters or any low-carbs,

[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:16.620]
you can buy it in their weightlosses.

[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:17.020]
Absolutely.

[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:17.980]
Incredible.

[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:21.840]
For years, Delights has helped thousands of low-carb diners achieve their weightloss goals.

[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:25.980]
Delights are wise, because your low-carb one-stop shop for the right supplements and the best selection.

[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:30.800]
And the best tasting low-carb foods, which of course is most important of all, to keep you on a straight, near-or-pant.

[02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:37.060]
Stop in and sample any of their over 1200 low-carb products like their new chocolate dip cheesecake on a stick.

[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:38.260]
Well, that sounds really good.

[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.340]
And their famous carbolite software, rice cream.

[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:44.660]
The staff at Delights knows low-carb dieting inside and out to open every 8-till 10 in the PM and don't forget.

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:50.960]
At Delights, they offer you their guaranteed lowest-priced policy on all Atkins, carbolite and pure-delight products.

[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:51.780]
All of these things.

[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:52.400]
That is correct.

[02:06:52.800 --> 02:07:05.820]
Delights at West Booker guarantees they will not be under solitude or fight them on the northeast corner of blades and 441 right next to Boston Market or call them tool-free at 1-877-Low-Carb-L-O-W-C-A-R-B-R-On-A-Wicked-Web at LowCarb.com.

[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:11.680]
There's only one Delights at West Booker. It's an incredible store for all you fat folks out there. It's your official Atkins retail centers.

[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.360]
You will listen to new Rogers.

[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:18.280]
It's a classic 10-car, about 566-A-R-B-U-A-N.

[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:23.400]
The Bloodheads. It's the one to do our retinas back.

[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:25.360]
And more popular than ever.

[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:27.440]
God, and you can take that to the bank, man.

[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:30.540]
It's a classic tale of good-coffed-coffed-coffed-coffed-coffed-

[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.260]
And you and me, we're gonna dance, brother.

[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:34.700]
Only this time, it's the same cop.

[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:37.000]
Hey, rooster, what's the word on the street, bud?

[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:39.820]
Well, everybody's saying you did it, Tony?

[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:40.740]
Oh, is that right?

[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:44.400]
Well, let me tell you something, brother. You gotta pay to fare if you want to take the ride.

[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.360]
You know what the hell is that supposed to mean?

[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:51.920]
Tell you what it means, man. It means I hired a really expensive mouthpiece-type lawyer who's gonna get me off the hook, man.

[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:57.320]
I'll write a spack on TV all day, every day on every cable news channel.

[02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:00.400]
Dead, dead, man. You got that. And it don't come back again.

[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:03.600]
Yeah, I said never a 15-minute-only MSNBC.

[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:04.540]
Can it, rooster?

[02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:08.440]
So, don't watch Burretta 24 hours a day. Keep your TV on.

[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:10.600]
And keep your eye on the sparrow.

[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.500]
And that's the name of that zoom. Right, Fred?

[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:13.000]
Ah!

[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.420]
You killed him!

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.940]
Shut up, Burr Brain, I'm the heat. I'll whack you, too.

[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:22.640]
103 and 560 WQM. She had a come and you ride. The bitch had a come and let's move on with other important stuff.

[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:23.460]
Right, slow down.

[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:27.100]
Okay, here's the deal on the pool. What do you think was the best movie of 2004?

[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:28.760]
We really haven't added much to that.

[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.500]
And that's what we got along with. 434 votes. Plus nobody's been catched fair and high.

[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:35.620]
And it's got 188 votes. It's got almost half of the votes in a whole pool.

[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:39.960]
Passed to the crisis, tied with Shrek 2 for second. And of course, they're both fantasy movies.

[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:42.360]
33, both fairy tales.

[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.500]
Spider-Man 2, 27. Team America, 22. I heard that's got a lot of young naked puppets in it.

[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:48.340]
Yes, it does.

[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:50.820]
Meet the Fokers, 19. Where's that Fokers?

[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:53.800]
The incredible 17. Kill Bill Vydem 2, 16.

[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:58.140]
The Born Supremacy 14 with the White Mouth, Matt, the Born Dylan.

[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:05.200]
Garden State 10, Sideways 9. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 8, Collateral 7.

[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.440]
Harold and Kumar go to White Castle 6. You said I would like that?

[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:10.240]
No, I did not.

[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.160]
Oh, Polaroid Spurs, oh it's a drug movie.

[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:16.920]
Right. Polaroid Spurs 4, Million Dollar Baby 4. Before sunset still only got 3.

[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.580]
Oh, poor Ethan Hawking, what's your name?

[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:24.020]
Closer 3, Collateral 2, Lemony Snicket's a series of unfortunate events too.

[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.140]
The Aviators only got a small pair of Caroline.

[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.620]
This crowd don't like Leo de Capri, okay?

[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:31.020]
We don't want any party him. We don't want to smell him.

[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:33.420]
We want to know him. We don't want to even see him ever again.

[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:37.840]
Leo, Kinsey 2, Doggill's got one, Writing's Rises got one.

[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.420]
And the House of Flying Vagres has one.

[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.840]
You can add some more if you want this. Our or not is the case maybe.

[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:42.420]
Whatever you like.

[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:44.820]
We are easy on this show.

[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:45.360]
Let's see.

[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:49.020]
Neil, can you get Seespan, their counting electoral votes.

[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.380]
Boxer is contesting.

[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.480]
We know that. We talked about that two hours ago for a crime.

[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:59.120]
I'll ask two and a half hours ago that Barbara Boxer was signing the resolution

[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:02.880]
and that to contest the not certify the election results in Ohio.

[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:05.140]
We know that sir. Thank you very much Fred.

[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.280]
Also, see Tucker Carlson. I hope you're not faxing me that because I know that.

[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:10.400]
No, no, no, no.

[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.060]
Tucker Carlson is getting asked by CNE's all done.

[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.620]
And Prof. Fier is toast as well, which is probably a great thing.

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.860]
I'm sure John Stewart is very pleased about it as well.

[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.740]
Thank God.

[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:20.260]
Prof. Fier.

[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:21.540]
What's Bob Novak going to do?

[02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:22.780]
He had to be on death row also.

[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:24.080]
How's Valerie Plain doing?

[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:25.880]
Is how we know I never hear another word about that again?

[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:26.180]
Nope.

[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:33.740]
All of the scandals, man, those secret energy meetings and run of Valerie Plain, Joseph Wilson, all of these things, man.

[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:34.640]
All of these things.

[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:36.100]
Just skate right on by.

[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:37.840]
Talk about the Teflon presidency.

[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:40.240]
It's the Teflon Nazis is what it is.

[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:42.440]
Even Hogan's heroes would be amused at this.

[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:44.880]
Richard Dawson, who else was on that show?

[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:45.680]
Bob Crain.

[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:46.320]
Of course.

[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.260]
Bob Crain. He's still dead by the way.

[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:49.240]
And he's still doing all the fun.

[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:52.020]
Warner Clemperer, right?

[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:54.680]
Warner Clemperer, I think he's in a new cabinet, isn't he?

[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:57.200]
You are lying to me, snap open, snap open.

[02:10:58.380 --> 02:10:59.900]
Oh, wait a minute, man.

[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:01.380]
WNQA, I'm hung.

[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:02.580]
Uncle Neil.

[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:03.400]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:04.120]
How you doing?

[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:04.880]
Pretty good.

[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:10.760]
A few things, I guess congratulations on your contract extension.

[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:12.780]
Why do you say that so reservedly?

[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:18.280]
So, I mean, we've had the rest of the nation is missing your great work.

[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:18.660]
I know.

[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.560]
Yeah, I'm going to make a big difference, man.

[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.760]
No, no, no, no.

[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:22.840]
I'm going to change the world, man.

[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:25.520]
I didn't say change the world, Neil. I just love your show.

[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:26.980]
Yeah, but let me say this to you.

[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.380]
And there's no reason in the world why XM or Series couldn't pick up the show.

[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:34.860]
They're picking up other so-called terrestrial shows now because they have a dearth of material to fill their purge.

[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:36.440]
I mean, they could pick us up, they'd have anyone.

[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:41.100]
So, okay, so you and Norma don't have to go through, jump through Hoops to have that happen?

[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.660]
Well, I mean, they approached me, they approached us already a couple of months ago,

[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.960]
so there still could be more discussion with that.

[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:47.460]
Right.

[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:53.660]
And it's good that Barbara, she always had a pair, but she put them out on the table.

[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.260]
You bet.

[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:55.120]
Right on Neil.

[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:56.160]
Thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:56.720]
Later.

[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:57.840]
They showed the prayer.

[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.020]
What's she's not impressed about?

[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:01.460]
Just like that last show before vacation and all this.

[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:05.820]
Oh, and of course the one was definitely a set up call about Don Buckwald and Ouyota Dudes.

[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:06.960]
And get out of here.

[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.400]
Go run your own life, okay?

[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:12.660]
If serious, what I wanted to be serious, if they want to live up to their name and make a deal,

[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.360]
they didn't have to make it all headed to say, well, you know, as soon as we get there, like, what we'll do this,

[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.120]
they didn't say that.

[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:20.660]
They didn't even put a tentative, anything out there.

[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:22.100]
It's like, well, you know, we'll talk again.

[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:23.600]
Well, that's great. We'll talk again.

[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:24.660]
Fine. Whatever you say.

[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:25.200]
Jeremy.

[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.440]
They don't seem real serious to me.

[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:28.800]
And who knows if it's going to fly or not.

[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:31.540]
I'm not interested in being like Marco Polo with his advanced slaves.

[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.260]
Don't you understand?

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.140]
I want, I want, I'm very happy with my life right now.

[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:36.520]
I'm looking out there at the snow.

[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:37.940]
It's nice and toasty and warm in here.

[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:41.000]
When it shows over two o'clock, I'm going to go out and get some necessarily turtle ice cream

[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.620]
with the new little turtles in it.

[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:44.400]
You got a half a gallon would be good.

[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:45.440]
You're going to do some more plunging.

[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.580]
No, not today after that episode.

[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:49.300]
Listen, I'm going to tell you something, man.

[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.880]
It's like, no, it's like somebody goes to the track every day.

[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:52.840]
A gambler.

[02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:56.640]
If you keep pushing your luck and going too much, you and guarantee you're going to lose.

[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.400]
Since I've come, since I came back after vacation, I've been very, very lucky.

[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.040]
And I'm not going to continue pressing my luck.

[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.140]
I have a limited schedule in addition to which if you saw the roads and what it's like here right now,

[02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:09.720]
this would not be a good day to be hopping in a cab and venturing out.

[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:10.700]
You follow what I'm saying?

[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:11.220]
Mm-hmm.

[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:15.620]
It's a good day to go and get like a big tub, an industrial sized tub of ice cream,

[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.640]
or maybe buy a nice CD or rent a movie at, you know, at HMV.

[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.180]
And then that's it.

[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.340]
Lock yourself in the rest of the day.

[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:23.860]
Speak on diets.

[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:25.540]
When they're just talking about that eating the ice cream?

[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:26.060]
Yep.

[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:27.420]
I do like ice cream.

[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:28.020]
Candy, oh.

[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.440]
If I had a narrow with candy, I could live without.

[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.940]
If I never had, not that I don't like it.

[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:35.480]
Like a crunchy, you know, with that honeycomb that I was talking about.

[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.800]
But if I never had that again, I could survive that.

[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.080]
But ice cream man, I've obsessed.

[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:41.540]
And I think I have like lactose intolerance.

[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.120]
I think, you know, because I don't drink milk.

[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.600]
Milk is bad for you, by the way.

[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.440]
Other animals don't drink other animals.

[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:50.840]
Milk man is the only animal on the face of the globe that drinks the milk of another animal.

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:53.360]
So if you like milk, drink human milk.

[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.020]
Well, we don't get that too late.

[02:13:55.500 --> 02:14:01.180]
Only one in four people can stick to a diet for a four year study comparing adherence to weight loss program said Tuesday.

[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:03.920]
See, this is another one of those very profound studies.

[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.060]
Everybody's doing studies.

[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.860]
And of course, I would be surprised if a lot of these are government subsidized.

[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.080]
And we're paying our tax money for these stupid ass studies.

[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:16.800]
In the study, four groups of 40 overweight or obese fat slabs each were assigned to one of four weight loss programs.

[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:21.980]
The Atkins Low Carb Diet, the Ornish Vegetarian, the Weight Watchers Plan, or the Zone.

[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:25.400]
You know, Dr. Barry Sears, no relation to Gene J or Brian Sears.

[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:29.180]
Participants were enrolled in two month classes to help them and then were on their own.

[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.220]
We found that all four diets worked well for weight loss and heart disease risk factor reduction.

[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.980]
But only in the people who could follow their diet closely for a year since studying author, Dr. Michael Dancinger,

[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:40.320]
who are of tough, New England medical center in Boston.

[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:43.660]
Did I tell you about Boston and bring him ice cream? Oh, God is that crazy stuff.

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:44.660]
Wow, man.

[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.780]
Three and four participants quit their diets before the year was out.

[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:49.040]
See, they're going with that ice cream again.

[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:52.500]
I'm obsessed. I'm an ice cream addict and I admit it. I need some help.

[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.440]
Forget about the gambling thing. I don't need to go there.

[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:57.400]
If I wanted to stop tomorrow, no problem. I can live without it.

[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:00.760]
But ice cream, I can't live without. Like Snickers ice cream. That's very good.

[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:04.140]
You know, the one thing I've discovered is the ice cream is like with the candy flavors.

[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.300]
Like him and him. Have you ever seen him in an ice cream?

[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.120]
I think I've seen it. I don't think I've had it.

[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:11.220]
Yeah. And what are some of the other one? Carmelo? They're not good.

[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:14.020]
Oh, the Heath bar crunch is good. That's got the cars in it.

[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.260]
Like Ben and Jerry's, remember? The tall.

[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.020]
Oh, yeah, but that no, that's Ben and Jerry's. There is no bad than in the middle.

[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:20.400]
Ben and Jerry's flavor. Step vanilla.

[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:23.400]
But I'll tell you the coffee toffee crunch. That is.

[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.940]
That should be illegal. They're making drugs illegal.

[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.980]
Coffee toffee crunch is so addictive that there's nothing in the world even company.

[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:32.780]
Even heroin isn't in the same league with it.

[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.300]
And anybody who thinks I'm making that up, you're crazy.

[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:41.120]
Sugar is addictive. It's the number one. It's the number one killer of fat and the stroke and heart attack.

[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.380]
There is no question in my mind about, okay, what anybody else tells you about fat, dietary fat.

[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:47.420]
You're full of crap, okay? You're full of fat.

[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:50.820]
Overall, successful dieters lost an average of 5% of their body weight,

[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:56.080]
or roughly 10 to 20 pounds after one year, and one in 10 diners lost a more than 10% of their weight, or more than 25 pounds.

[02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:00.740]
Dan Singer writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association said no single diet work for everyone,

[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.780]
especially low carb diets like Actions that are in Vogue.

[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.340]
You know, it's interesting. One day they tell you, oh, the low carb diets are out, and then the next day they're back in.

[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:09.480]
Why would they be out?

[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.820]
You see, low carb diets don't work if you're reading ice cream in between.

[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:17.760]
You know, it's like the beast when he was doing balance for life, but he was also eating his regular food in addition to it.

[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.280]
So he thought it was like not in place of your other food, but like in addition to it.

[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:26.040]
So he'd go out and like, go to your garage, I'm like, four of those monster burgers and stuff like that,

[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.140]
and six orders of fries and underings, and then he would like have six double orders of baba ganoush.

[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:32.600]
What a pig he is, you know, that's disgusting here.

[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:35.580]
I mean, I'm a pig, but not in that league. He's just, he's nauseating.

[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.320]
And then of course, Zach that used to be with us, it's with Joe Rose over there at the other place right now.

[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:40.900]
So that's a good guy, but another pig.

[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:41.880]
Am I right?

[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:43.800]
Well, now he is.

[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.140]
He's a pig.

[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.640]
They were bringing food from how he's there in the morning.

[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.440]
He would eat like the food for four people before the other people even saw that it was there,

[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.440]
which he did just to make sure they didn't get it.

[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:56.240]
The good guy, listen, you can be a good guy and still be a pig.

[02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:57.900]
Just ask down the delivery, so tell you.

[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.080]
To find a diet that's best for you, says this bogus latest piece of crap,

[02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.700]
try dating the diets as if looking for a lifelong partner.

[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:08.040]
You may kiss a few frogs along the way.

[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:08.960]
Oh, God.

[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:13.340]
Especially if you go to Montreal, you might kiss a few frogs,

[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:16.900]
but once you find the one you can live with forever, stand by your plan.

[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:18.480]
Okay, cheer that song right now.

[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.500]
Tammy, one at stand by your plan.

[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:21.040]
Can't you hear it?

[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.440]
Hey, Tammy, how you doing, honey?

[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:23.280]
Isn't she dead?

[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:24.260]
She must be.

[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:25.200]
Mine is well-being.

[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.340]
That's country music, man.

[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:30.500]
That is just the report came on the heels of another diet study published Monday in the

[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:33.480]
Aynoles of the Internal Medicine that concluded no one really knows.

[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.640]
Ha ha ha ha!

[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.420]
This is great!

[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.940]
We finally, we finally got the answer that a lot of us have been searching for.

[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:41.000]
All is fact, desperate, as you want to hear it?

[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:41.380]
Okay.

[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:45.940]
The Aynoles of Internal Medicine study concludes that no one really knows which diets work

[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.320]
and which ones are wasted time with the possible exception of weight watchers

[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:51.200]
who have had scientific research to make its approach.

[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.480]
Nobody knows the trouble we've seen.

[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.060]
That's all you like that.

[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:56.580]
That's something?

[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:57.700]
That's all you like that.

That's all you like that.

[02:17:58.240 --> 02:17:58.540]
That's something?

[02:17:58.540 --> 02:17:59.080]
That's all you like that.

[02:17:59.080 --> 02:17:59.080]

That's all you like that.

[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:39.920]
Then

[02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:46.240]
17 at 560 WQAM police are checking suspicious device at Dorao City Hall.

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:48.860]
I'll tell you the worst one because the movie freak out is a backpack.

[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:54.360]
You know, and I otherwise it's revolutionary if somebody forgets and leaves a backpack laying behind like you know the school or somewhere.

[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:59.580]
They police and fire rescue were called to Dorao City Hall around 1120 this morning because of a bomb threat.

[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:05.100]
A official set a small device with some wires visible was founded building an 80 300 Northwest 53rd Street.

[02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:06.060]
That's on the Harold website.

[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:11.500]
No more details yet but I'm sure that our crack QAM news department keep you abreast of that situation all day long.

[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:12.360]
Right? Right.

[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:17.860]
I still can't get over the fact that when we started working on this I just I can't believe it.

[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.000]
Even seven years later and it came time for like news at the top of the hour and we were doing like sports updates.

[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.240]
That was our idea of the news.

[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:29.660]
Like the day that kid called in we were in the middle of the discussion about saving the world from itself and the kid calls in.

[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:31.160]
Oh, Wanky's got a broken foot.

[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:32.280]
Wanky's got a broken foot.

[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:32.600]
Remember that?

[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.120]
No.

[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.400]
Well, of course now you wouldn't know Chris Wanky from.

[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:37.900]
We let me say that anymore.

[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:39.480]
No, we can't say Wanky.

[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:40.160]
Oh, sorry Joyce.

[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:41.180]
Sorry Chris.

[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:46.820]
Whatever's name was got a broken foot like we care about that stupid crap.

[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:47.180]
Okay.

[02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:48.300]
Grow up already.

[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:49.380]
Will you freaking get a life?

[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:49.900]
I have no life.

[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:51.740]
I'm silly juvenile jackass.

[02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:52.580]
God.

[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:59.680]
And our strength and suspect held by the US and Guantanamo Bay has alleged he was tortured by water and electrodes during interrogation in Egypt.

[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.680]
Egyptian board mom do Habib.

[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:08.400]
A Sydney father of four is one of two Australian Australians held by the US following his capture in Pakistan in 2002.

[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:16.740]
The Australian broadcasting corporate president obtained previously sealed court documents detailing Habib's claim to torture while in custody in Egypt before his move to Cuba.

[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:23.740]
According to the papers Habib alleged his captors filled his room with water until it was just below his chin, forcing him to stand on tiptoe for hours.

[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:33.080]
Habib also alleged he was suspended from a hoax on the wall of his cell with his feet resting on a large drum into which an electric current flowed from Mars apparently attached to a battery.

[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:39.760]
If he did not give the answer his captors wanted they threw a switch and an adult of electricity would run through the drum forcing him to dance on it.

[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:41.760]
Habib alleged the documents currently at ABC.

[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:47.520]
The claims are made to his lawyer several weeks ago amid suggestions that US authorities were considering returning him to Egypt.

[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.040]
Yeah, if you think you've seen torture or not, just wait.

[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:56.280]
Habib is one of 15 detainees considered eligible by the US government to face trial by a military commission.

[02:21:56.540 --> 02:22:05.060]
His case along with that afel Australian detainee David Hicks has been a car-seller in Australia as the conservative government has done little to press the US to return either to Australia for trial.

[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:11.480]
Prime Minister John Howard has been one of US President George W. Bush and Starchist allies in the war against terror and the invasion of Iraq.

[02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:13.280]
Well, what does that tell you?

[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:15.100]
About those Aussies, huh?

[02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:21.940]
It's probably a Brit thing. You know, the Brit said, oh yeah, well we'll join you in because we got naked pictures of Tony Blair and a Billy Goat and Prince Charles as the pivot man.

[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:24.640]
And so as a result of that the Aussies would do whatever the Brit's want.

[02:22:24.820 --> 02:22:29.700]
You know, they're still under their thumb. Just like in Canada, we still got the Queen on the $20 bill.

[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:34.560]
What the hell is that all about, eh? Get the Queen off of there. Cut the umbilical cord for Christ's sakes.

[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:39.760]
And when they went there, what did she call it? She has this speech every year. It was like a couple of weeks ago.

[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:46.200]
I don't know. There's some stupid ass speech on the on the state of the empire, you know, about Los Melvinis, whatever's left.

[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:53.300]
And they can't say carry the gun TV here. Who wants to see that silly old pussy bitch with a little tiny purse and those plaid dresses?

[02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:57.440]
My gosh, it looks like Mo Howard David it on a bad day. Good God almighty.

[02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:06.560]
I think British ever going to grow up early, ever outgrow that silly. I mean, there are countries that have, you know, royalties, figureheads like Holland has got that and like Denmark, I think.

[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:12.920]
It's just, it's just for fun. It's pomp and circumcise. But the Brits just kid. They cannot escape from that crap, you know.

[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:22.640]
And then the tabloids obsessed with William did this one and the Harry did it. Who cares? Who gives a crap? You know, most of them are a bunch of flaming fags anyway.

[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:29.380]
So who cares? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6. You let's get a few more movies on this list. I feel like we probably sold some short, don't you?

[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:34.280]
What about us to there must have been thousands of great movies in 2000 for the same. Just a couple.

[02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:38.520]
Pound 5, 60 and a Verizon singular wireless lines WQAM. Hello.

[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:43.300]
Hi. Yes sir. George George. You're a gem. Oh, Neil. Hi.

[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:51.820]
My nephew wants to join the army. Didn't you guys have on your website something showing pictures of the soldiers best were.

[02:23:54.360 --> 02:24:02.480]
The wounded. Yeah, I want to recuperate wounded. Right. Yeah, we did. Can you where can I find that? I want to show it to them.

[02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:07.620]
To a search. Yeah, do it. Do a search. But I don't know what would I put in there. Wounded.

[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:14.100]
Wounded American soldiers. It doesn't have to be on our website. I'm sure that all over the net. You'll find plenty of protest pictures that you can

[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:20.000]
see. Is it your nephew? You said. All right. If he dropped out of college, he wants to join the army. I want him to see reality.

[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:26.120]
Exactly. Wake him up before they bring him home in a box pal. All right. Okay. Good luck to. Okay. How do you like that?

[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:31.400]
Want to join the army? Maybe he's suicidal. What do you think? Maybe he's stupid. That's why I dropped out of college.

[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:36.240]
That could be it. Oh, no. He wants to serve his country. Yeah. Well, if you want to serve your country, do something productive. Okay.

[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:40.680]
Which is not going to a rack to get yourself killed and to kill people who do. And to kill lots of people.

[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:47.200]
Or anything to us. Okay. Kill a bunch of people that just, you know, why don't live their lives and work quite frankly doing all that bad.

[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:53.640]
We're doing a hell of a lot better before we went in there, March of last year. You're going to pull it up somehow. Huh? They weren't blowing up before.

[02:24:53.960 --> 02:25:08.800]
No, that's right. They were still alive, which is more than we can say for thousands of them. Since the late 1800s, this is an objection by Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs, Jones, of Ohio and Senator Barbara Boxer.

[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:26.820]
In California, there's a public law that indicates in the event of an objection, which has to be in writing submitted at the time, the ballot from the particular state in question is opened both sides of the House and Senate will retire to their separate chambers.

[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:36.400]
Debate the issue of the objection for up to two hours, then presumably dispose of it and come back and continue with the counting.

[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:49.920]
This, of course, is something both Bob's and, I'm sorry, Boxer and Stephanie Tubbs, Jones say is simply a protest to try to draw attention to questions surrounding the Elections and Ohio.

[02:25:49.920 --> 02:26:18.520]
The first election is ended in a number of questions raised, particularly by House Judiciary ranking member John Connures, who's raised about the number of ballot machines that were available, the exceptionally long lines for voting in Ohio as well as some rulings by the Secretary of State related to the election in Ohio, all of which Democrats say, raised questions about the vote in that state.

[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:30.640]
No one I've heard yet in so far has suggested they think the President Bush did not in fact win Ohio by a fairly substantially sumptible 100,000 votes.

[02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:48.040]
Nonetheless, they want to raise attention to this. They're also doing this in part because four years ago, there were a number of House members, particularly members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who wanted someone on the Senate side to raise the objection so this issue could be debated.

[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:54.420]
They were not able to find a single senator who would do that partly because Al Gore asked senators not to do it.

[02:26:54.620 --> 02:27:05.120]
That also was an issue where a number of media really, a lot of people said, under reported the story. All of this, of course, came out in the movie Fahrenheit 9-11.

[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:10.660]
There you go. It just happens to be your favorite movie of 2004, overwhelming. What a nice segue. Thank you so much.

This crap about, oh, well, no question that he won it by a right. Nobody questions that he won it fair and square. He stole it fair and square just like it last time.

[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:39.300]
That's why all this exit polls should have been losing the election and Ohio and floored a two-hour added Glenda in the hood and Theresa, poor Theresa.

[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:48.480]

af

[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:40.980]
I think,тобыlla.

[02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:45.280]
this but I guess you created a little extra work which is fine because with all the business

[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.540]
this coming I'm very pardoned I told them not to because these both I played in both of

[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:53.000]
the Jesus Land and Sunni earlier which are two my favorite book of Brian Bits for the last 800

[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:56.920]
years and they both sound distorted now which they did not sound before they sounded better before

[02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:00.840]
or then play the originals I told them don't do anything well what do you mean play the originals

[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:04.320]
I replaced them in there so now I have to re-replace them there which has been take me at least

[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:08.060]
four or five minutes work say you're making me work real hard for my money I'm never saying

[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:12.580]
anything again I don't know what the problem was they were great you didn't hear that

[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:18.380]
I made a statement in the summer story and I said it was a little hot on some of those and some

[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:22.720]
of the lyrics were hard to understand the first time through and you know Brian in case you don't

[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:26.000]
know Brian he had a nervous breakdown went and re-cut him even though I begged him not to

[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:33.220]
what did Rumsfeld know says the real boy says that and the president's sister defense secretary

[02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:37.200]
Donald Rumsfeld will remain in office and on December 19 Bush's chief of staff and

[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:42.240]
required junior seven ABC news this week that secretary Rumsfeld is doing a spectacular job

[02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:47.120]
and the president has great confidence in him however on December 9th Senator Jeff

[02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:51.380]
Bingham and Democratic New Mexico wrote Rumsfeld to express his deep concern over issues related

[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.760]
to detainees being held in Iraq at Afghanistan and Guatana Move Cuba recent reports indicate

[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:59.120]
that I don't really were detainees mishandled and interrogated in a manner inconsistent with the

[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:03.040]
Geneva conventions but that subsequent internal reports of the superior to events suppressed

[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:08.060]
while the abuse of detainees is unacceptable under any circumstance reports of the suppression

[02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:12.100]
of evidence regarding abuse are extremely disturbing he wrote please inform me of the actions

[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:18.000]
you intend to take as of this writing there's been no response for two years in this column as

[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.580]
well as from the human rights groups in the press especially reporting of Dana Pris and the

[02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:25.840]
Washington Post there's been mounting evidence of torture of prisoners by American forces including

[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:30.760]
ghost prisoners and secret CIA interrogation centers these reports include stories of extreme

[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:35.660]
interrogation techniques used by special special operation forces navy seals delta force etc.

[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:39.160]
out of the direction of Donald Rumsfeld and his close associates in the defense department

[02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:44.440]
Rumsfeld is longing towards the use of special operation forces but now with a release by the

[02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:48.680]
ACLU of actual government documents not intended for the public to see the president's

[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.400]
confronted with irrefutable evidence of continued violations of not only the 1949 Geneva

[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:57.920]
conventions and UN convention against torture but also our own torture our torture statute

[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:02.120]
forbidding such practices as for the suppression of evidence there is this December 8th

[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:06.940]
report in New York Sun by paisley dots of the AP on the documents released by the ACLU

[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:19.960]
they saw U.S. Navy documents released by the ACLU include interviews with Navy personnel about

[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:24.700]
routine abuse of treatment detainees by U.S. Marines in Iraq in one interview a Navy Medical Officer

[02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:29.260]
described the regular process by which Iraqis classified as enemy prisoners of war would be

[02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:34.420]
taken to an empty swimming pool handcuffed leg cuffed and have a burlite bag placed over their head

[02:33:34.420 --> 02:33:38.100]
it would then remain a kneeling position for up to 24 hours waiting until irrigation

[02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:42.640]
despite this description the Navy Medical Officer stated that he never saw any instances

[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:47.940]
of physical abuse toward the detainees and from March 8th, Serrano in the December 15th LA Times

[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.800]
well no he says don't understand it resistance use for example we're just used this is

[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.580]
excuse to put the effort on our folder what the after we know you can put the whole effort because

[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:58.820]
it's actually the title of the movie you're familiar with that movie what the after we know never

[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.940]
heard of it no oh well here's a review of it just use the whole effort and there's the excuse for

[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:07.880]
right put the effort on a pool today we always need some excuse someone must have read Sophie's

[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.340]
world decided that a movie about quantum physics has applied to the life of an emotionally troubled

[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:15.780]
woman would have peeled away similar ticket buying demographic hence the movie what the after we know

[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:19.980]
which might just as well have been entitled Amanda's world are still better better living through

[02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:24.700]
weird science the story of Amanda Marley Matlin a bummed out death photographer sharing a

[02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:29.600]
apartment with a sunny pigtail friend Elaine Hendricks is interwoven with commentary from physicist

[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:34.760]
theologian psychiatrist and physicians of various specialties and RANFA a spirit who's being

[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:40.380]
channing through a medium blonde hair bright red power frou suit centurion speaking saw style

[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:44.500]
surely the direct sense belongs to the ethereal being two in order to bestow his gallactin wisdom

[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:49.120]
to we ignorant earthlings the movie is promoted as being about the mysteries of quantum physics and

[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:53.140]
opposed visual effects designed to give us graphic representations of the true nature of matter

[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:58.340]
electron clouds swirling around hard knotted little kernels of information single photons appearing

[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:02.600]
to be in two places at one time and perhaps too readily available conceit that our universe may be

[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:08.620]
in fact a giant holodeck blue grid lines instantly recognizable any start for track band is holodeck

[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:13.400]
grids wavering congeal like holy nimbus is a rather man she confronts various possible alternative

[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:17.500]
to work and it goes on and it sounds like a sued thing to make sure to hold you soons out there

[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:02.400]
little help on a spelling couldn't hurt okay if you want the real results this is the way to go

[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:08.320]

[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:46.180]
a dud because Fahrenheit nine level one by so far with this crowd it's not even a contest it's got

protest and everything or they I remember watching the election and I remember watching the news

[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:52.380]
and it was like they were they were quoting the exit polls oh it looks good for carry

[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:57.620]
and they were like five o'clock five o'clock some of the posters were declaring that

[02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:03.100]
uh thanks to zogby john zogby declared uh carry the winner at five p.m. I printed that out and

[02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:07.720]
it's like then the official numbers come in and they didn't even say anything about the exit

[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:12.860]
polls right they were just pretending it never happened the last hour and that would be like

[02:46:12.860 --> 02:46:17.640]
that would be like if you bought a lottery ticket right and you swatched a lot of results on tv

[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:21.160]
that night and you checked them in the paper and you had all winning numbers and you went

[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.480]
right commission to cash and and they gave you a set of different numbers you said yeah but these

[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:29.280]
are the numbers yet to be all in all those of the right numbers and they were like the

[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:33.340]
motion administration I mean they were like quiet and then the carries were like are you

[02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:37.200]
are you are you gonna celebrate they said oh we're just you know we're gonna wait and see how it

[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:41.780]
goes and yeah and the numbers are totally opposite like Ohio and Florida in particular but

[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:46.700]
the faster still is the correct yeah well listen if they stole that it had practiced

[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:50.440]
makes perfect you know what they say man they know your job in 2000 they didn't even better job

[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.620]
this time yeah but no one talks about that how did they change they talk about news for five

[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:58.280]
hours and then afterwards they don't even talk about it anymore there you go okay sure

[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:03.220]

all right

[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:37.620]
all right

[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.260]
all right

[02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:41.260]
it's

[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:47.260]
it's an all new british invasion with the mad dog singing like a man

[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:50.420]
I like it

I like it

[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:53.340]
I like it

[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:58.280]
and the truth is finally out that you managed was truly the fifth people

[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:08.040]
yeah

[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:12.300]
yeah

[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:12.580]
oh

[02:49:12.580 --> 02:49:13.660]
right

[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:14.260]
all right

[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.440]
all right

[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:15.660]
all right

[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:15.660]

[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:16.180]
all right

[02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.820]
here's the mad dogs

[02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:19.540]
and you're

[02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:20.240]
a team

[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:22.100]
tribute to the king

[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:24.400]
Oh

[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:24.840]
I

[02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:27.960]
Oh

[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:28.320]
right

[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.940]
all right

[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:32.520]
anyway

[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:40.280]
the mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again

[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:42.240]
nothing i don't think so

[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:47.480]
so we had look at Rodsy pay him a little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would

[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:48.800]
Why do fans are contrast?

[02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:51.060]
That's some of a dishless cute.

[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:54.560]
Alright!

[02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:58.400]
Alright!

[02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:02.420]
Alright!

[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:04.100]
And it's Z.

[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:05.200]
I'm new.

[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:07.560]
Available now if you move quickly.

[02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:08.740]
Alright!

[02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:09.520]
It's Z!

[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:11.300]
Alright!

[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:12.680]
Alright!

[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:13.940]

[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:14.480]
I'm Z!

[02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:16.200]
Alright!

[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:16.220]

[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:19.100]
Alright!

[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:19.100]

[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:21.940]
Alright!

[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:22.620]
Alright!

[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:23.680]
Alright!

[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:23.860]
Alright!

[02:50:24.700 --> 02:50:25.060]
Alright!

[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:26.160]
Alright!

[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:26.160]

[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:30.720]
You know, that one is overmodulated and bizarrely mixed and distorted.

[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000]
And that's what makes it so good.

[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:34.200]
Don't ever do that one again, Baldi.

[02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:37.280]
That's what the meat and potatoes is about, particularly.

[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:39.840]
And anyway, Mad Dog will be along the two vlogs.

[02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:41.400]
We'll be more of what you just got through hearing.

[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:41.840]
Oh right!

[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.300]
And also, hopefully educating us into what else is going to happen on Monday.

[02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:47.900]
Since tomorrow is, unless I'm mistaken, let me take a look at the,

[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:50.000]
Tomorrow's Friday, January 7th.

[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.300]
That's what it says here on my schedule.

[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:56.380]
And we don't have any schedule for next week because the powers that be are busy,

[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:59.740]
uh, concocting, you know, plotting and planning and whatever they're putting together.

[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:03.580]
Wouldn't be, like I said, wouldn't be nice tomorrow to have some ideas so we can tell the audience,

[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:06.080]
Hey, Monday morning at 5, we got, uh, you know,

[02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:07.840]
We don't hang, Monday morning at 7, we think.

[02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:08.920]
We're pretty sure, right?

[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:11.160]
We know the Mad Dog Monday afternoon for December.

[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:13.820]
We know starting Monday, we're on every day 10 to 2, the full four hours.

[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:16.200]
Stern goes by by on the station and, uh, whatever.

[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:17.980]
But other than that, we're like two to four.

[02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:19.800]
You know, I still say it's going to be default.

[02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:24.520]
He's been sniffing around man for anything to get back in the door and sniffing and sniffing.

[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:25.260]
Can you smell it?

[02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:26.000]
I still smell something.

[02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:29.820]
Peter Mersky, now CNN was hyperventilating about this, uh, this morning.

[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:33.600]
It's not really a major story, but because Stern has his last show on the station tomorrow.

[02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:37.580]
Peter Mersky and Analyst from Open Hiber and Company suggested that's Oppenheimer.

[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:41.520]
Suggested that Viacom might let Howard Stern head out the door to a serious satellite radio

[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:45.080]
before his contract inspires an exchange for a stake in the satellite.

[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:46.560]
They want a stake.

[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:48.820]
Ruth Chris and Toronto, by the way, is outstanding.

[02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:54.300]
He gives Viacom a stake in the technology that AdVirus are using as a stalking horse against broadcast radio.

[02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:56.420]
And it brings a fast-growing investment into the fold.

[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.200]
Mersky was quoted by CBS MarketWatch.

[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:00.680]
Infinity COO, that's C.

[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:01.660]
Oh, oh, oh!

[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:08.840]
Joel Hollander has said that he doesn't want to let Stern out of his contract as the company stands to pull in significant ad revenue from his show during its last year.

[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:15.040]
But, but the stock for Stern's raid might be the key to end of the syndicated morning show on Terrestrial Radio.

[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:15.600]
And there it is again.

[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:17.260]
See, every way to Terrestrial Radio.

[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:20.240]
Now, I'll put this whole thing started with series and XM.

[02:52:20.340 --> 02:52:22.920]
Did we ever hear the term Terrestrial Radio ever before reading?

[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:23.260]
No.

[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:23.840]
No.

[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.420]
I mean, even like once.

[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:25.860]
No.

[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.700]
And I would say Terrestrial Radio as opposed to satellite.

[02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:30.940]
All of a sudden, the crowd went, everybody's got three shades.

[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:32.480]
Everybody's got buzzwords.

[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:34.540]
Everybody's busy programming UC.

[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:36.080]
Repeated a whole pile of a schmidd.

[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:39.380]
Let's take a look at that poll one more time.

[02:52:39.380 --> 02:52:44.160]
And like I said, it's kind of like a little bit of a downer because I knew Fahrenheit and 11 would probably win.

[02:52:44.220 --> 02:52:44.840]
Would do very well.

[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:47.300]
But I never dreamed like in a massive runaway.

[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:48.100]
Did you?

[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:49.120]
No, I didn't.

[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:50.580]
Five hundred and sixty-five votes.

[02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:52.360]
What do you think was the best movie of 2004?

[02:52:53.060 --> 02:52:54.080]
Fahrenheit and 11, 235.

[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:57.640]
Pax of the Christ, 43, they love Michael Moore.

[02:52:57.760 --> 02:52:58.760]
They're lukewarm about Jesus.

[02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:03.900]
Shrek 237, Spider-Man 237, meet the Fokkers 28.

[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:05.900]
Kill Bill 2 of Item 225.

[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:09.900]
And Team America, where they're yanking in puppets 25.

[02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:10.740]
Bye, bye, bye.
