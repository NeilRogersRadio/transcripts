[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660]
Hello, or not pretty good on the uptake there, huh? Yeah, when he said, you know, the hair on the head business. Absolutely

[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.720]
Even the former broadcast of it all. Yeah, you're right about that

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.600]
Big announcement today. We lost the dolphins. What was us? I've actually somebody's in here crying right now

[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.000]
I don't want to say that our operations manager and program director are emotional cripples

[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.240]
I don't want to rehash what happened here yesterday

[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.200]
I apologize to you for like leaving you hanging there because I know what was going on

[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.440]
Well, yes, what that makes two of us and

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.300]
It was certainly unnecessary for that bizarre and ever with the behavior in their parts to take place

[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.400]
They're just lucky. I didn't get up and walk out. Yeah. I was I was sitting here watching

[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.560]
Yeah, Duff sitting in there monitoring your show and I'm yeah, I'm thinking of myself this is the most repulsive

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.260]
Yeah, disgusting moment. Yeah, that will never happen again. It shouldn't. I mean if they can't trust you

[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.980]
Who can they trust? Yeah, well, so he can't trust me here is Johnny

[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.680]
Yeah

[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.500]
Well, if Gus for Watts coming in as the dolphins backup quarterback

[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.860]
I think that tells you everything you need to know about this come and see and I don't want to you know

[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.080]
Break the heart of that last guy to call you from Coco Beach

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.180]
But if I were him I just keep walking straighties and they're saying and they're saying he's they took the deal here

[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.980]
Because he's gonna compete with field he yeah, it tells you what they think of field

[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.900]
Right, and so I'm thinking about the right things here

[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.540]
Here's a looking on the bright side of this thing with the dolphins going over there is 790

[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.400]
Is that everybody on this radio station now will feel 200% free to say whatever they want all

[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.840]
All your sports nerds out there including you and ripped the dolphins and asked deservedly so because if you thought last year was bad

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.300]
Just wait

[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.580]
You know the one thing about Farat he said that he wanted to go someplace where he had a chance to compete and he has that opportunity here

[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.280]
Which he was denied by 31 other teams. That's all

[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.860]
Yeah, now don't start right off the bat. Well, I couldn't wait taking team shots unless of course you want to

[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.660]
I couldn't wait. Yeah, good

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.240]
Anyway, I was hoping for uh, I hope you're at ease today and I'm so I'm completely at ease and they were reading ourselves of the disease and life goes on

[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.780]
You know, all right as it should be right. Well, if any nervous Nelly sitting in there

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.300]
I'm gonna tell you something seriously if they had a group rate at a lobotomies man at that place

[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.880]
It'd be the number one customer on the list. I think if you had been here yesterday you might have walked out

[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.500]
Yeah, instead of anything I didn't see it. I'm glad I didn't see it

[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640]
Yeah, I had to leave it was so only if you could have heard it if you could have heard what I heard it

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.740]
Not what I was waiting to talk to you and all of a sudden you disappeared and there come the two of them and it's always in tandem

[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.480]
They're like joined at the hip those two, you know

[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.720]
I got you the operations manager and our junior program director joined at the hip

[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.380]
Well, I will say this our salesman where uh, what's his name? Stiffy?

[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.200]
Stiff. Yeah, yeah, the stiff he's uh, he don't like me now because I ripped him on a year

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140]
So he's not gonna come back and talk to me anymore

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.000]
But I guess I must have embarrassed him yesterday because in the last 24 hours we got three new pieces of copy

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.060]
Which is more than we've had in the last four years

[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.040]
Nice going there, Stiffy

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900]
I wonder where my new copy is I must be lost in the mail don't get carried away. We don't want to overdo it

[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.460]
I was one day at a time right one word at a time

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.780]
Copy

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.220]
Anyway, I won't lose too much money today. Please don't it's only Tuesday it's early in the week save the big plunge

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.680]
Oh, yeah, all this and of course I bet everybody and their brothers bidding on the NIT

[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.160]
That's probably tastes a lot of heavy betting. I don't think so but tomorrow tomorrow

[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.380]
I'm doing my annual NCAA preview show. Yeah, I heard the promo for that and we got about 14 guys coming on for people who have

[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.180]
Office pools and whatnot just for great

[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400]
You don't have to stock in coming on do you? No good?

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.140]
I like the dollar

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.520]
Oh no

[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.820]
Have a great day

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.580]
Yeah, maybe

[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.140]
Hi

[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.140]
In the Banana Republic, Sammy only in Miami

[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.420]
Bye bye, Dauphin. Bye bye, Volody. I guess we're finally with a wing all together. All right

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.120]
Rockmark's a face wing to life to receive

[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.040]
Volody in wind

[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.060]
No one's ever seen there on the ground. That's where they'll stay there never in control

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.360]
And when you say Miami you're talking toilet folders there that Miami Dauphin

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.580]
Miami Dauphin

[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.700]
Miami Dauphin's number how many teams in a week?

[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.480]
I'm not sure, man. Miami Dauphin

[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.700]
Miami Dauphin

[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.540]
Don't bet on them you'll always lose

[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.060]
They don't know how to tackle they don't know how to block their coaches ought to tell them to

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.700]
Bend day in their jocks then they would run much faster and even in

[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.260]
When we go to the stadium we'll see Miami

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.580]
They're the Miami Dauphin

[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.200]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.700]
Miami Dauphin's number how many teams in a week?

[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.920]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.500]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.960]
The team that hasn't got a clue

[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.560]
Miami has the dolphins but the dolphins have no fans

[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.560]
Just 50,000

[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.400]
Sitting in the standers

[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.580]
They watch the game and all they do is mone and gripe and bitch

[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.100]
I wonder how joe robby got the piece of

[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.740]
Emerge and they're the Miami Dauphin

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.360]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.920]
Miami Dauphin's number how many teams in a week?

[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.880]
I'm not even sure

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.280]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.920]
I hear the crowd begin to boo

[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.680]
The dolphins have their feet worth that quarter facts that you

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.260]
Run down the field and he will throw a pass over you

[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.720]
All he'll never win a super bowl you shouldn't be surprised

[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.760]
When he gets cut that doesn't mean that he was certain size in there

[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.040]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.080]
Miami Dauphin's number how many teams in a week?

[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.280]
I hear the crowd

[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.320]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.420]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.000]
Jake calls his signals in Hebrew

[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.940]
The dolphins have no deep fence and their offences at jokes

[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.440]
Like George Bush heeding pretzels

[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.420]
You know they're gonna choke

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.960]
Tell always just the point you win there in a playoff race

[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.320]
With fewer points than Pac-Marx on hyzinga's a dweeper

[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.540]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.800]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.840]
Miami Dauphin's number

[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.940]
All what the hell

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.820]
32

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.600]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.980]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.160]
Miami Dauphin's

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.620]
Now they're through

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.400]
A night out there

[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.280]
There's great work

[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.320]
10-06-5-60 WDQ and happy Tuesday to you

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.900]
Before we talk about that Dauphin thing which is official today

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.960]
We all knew about it and I'm telling that a long time ago that we'll be like that

[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.640]
But the big story of the week is a fat boy

[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.040]
He's still alive

[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.560]
Now we talked yesterday about the fact that they brought in all those crispy cream donuts

[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.540]
There were like boxes and boxes and boxes

[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.320]
Josh Cord is straight to 10

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.120]
He ate 10 out of the 12 in one box

[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.280]
Which is why he's not here today

[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.680]
Places on jury duty again

[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.820]
I'll teach you to vote smart ass sugar shop

[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.140]
But fat boy

[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.420]
We have it on very good authority from no less than the Carmelito

[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.920]
A lot of her name is

[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.800]
Hiya, Tawi

[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.900]
Fat boy ate three boxes of a crispy cream donuts yesterday

[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.980]
Count them that sounds like 36 to me

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.360]
Does the term

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.160]
Death Wish

[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.300]
Start rolling around in your mind

[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.700]
Rolling

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.060]
Hiya, Tawi

[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.460]
Yeah, rolling around on the floor

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.200]
How can anybody?

[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.540]
I mean I love crispy cream

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.280]
I can't eat less than three

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.440]
I might maybe could eat five or six on a really desperate day

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.420]
Like yesterday I would have probably eaten five or six

[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.680]
With all that aggravation that was posted by our

[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.500]
Operations Manager and Program Director

[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.220]
And our corporate legal

[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.080]
Corporate legal

[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.720]
Joyce

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.460]
But other than that

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.300]
Are you there there has to be something desperately wrong

[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.100]
For anybody to eat like three boxes of crispy cream donuts

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.740]
I mean

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.200]
Death Wish

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.040]
Hiya, Tawi

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.020]
Wrong with that

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.780]
And of course we have the greatest sympathy for that

[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.100]
Don't we?

[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.460]
No

[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.800]
Yeah

[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.660]
Anyway, radio station

[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.460]
Waxy 790 becomes the new home of the dolphins today

[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.080]
All right

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.800]
Good

[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.600]
Maybe now we can concentrate on selling the

[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.380]
Meat and potatoes in the bread and butter of their station

[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.040]
And quit with

[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.220]
You know we had the same thing at IOD member those days

[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]
Instead of concentrating on selling the talent

[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.140]
Especially when we had the great lineup when Phil was

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.560]
Had his head on straight and we had all the good stuff going

[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.060]
Instead of that it was always hurricanes

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.260]
And adoptions

[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.620]
Doffing

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.420]
And they were selling all this super solace crap

[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.580]
And a post game and a pre game

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.920]
And then between game and the four hour pre game

[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.760]
All this other garbage

[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.840]
You know I was always anything except those of us who were on the air

[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.760]
Who were supposed to be like the meat and potatoes of the station

[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.560]
And don't forget on the programming side

[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.140]
It like took 10 people for all the different this one and that one

[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.260]
Oh I have absolutely no question about it

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.600]
Absolutely

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.060]
Must have networking on all that

[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.280]
But anyway so

[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.540]
Bye-bye to the dolphins man

[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.080]
Is Wayne finally gets even with us

[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.300]
That'll teach us a lesson or two

[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.300]
We need like a hole in the head

[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.740]
The team and the station announced a new

[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.600]
Relent partnership

[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600]
Which has been expected for several months now

[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.440]
Joe Rose this morning show this morning

[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.540]
On Waxy 790

[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.340]
Let me say it again

[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.420]
Joe Rose before they announced that was all they had

[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.300]
And he's still all they got

[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.180]
Waxy will replace WQAM as the flagship station of the team

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.360]
The flagship station

[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.380]
The next step will be choosing the announcers

[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.780]
How are David and Jim managed to the games on QM rights

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.560]
The Unchist Jim Sarni this morning

[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.720]
David will not be back

[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.940]
I don't know

[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.980]
I'm going to go on the air not only ripped the dolphin organization and asked

[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.660]
And they can go back to tell us how he's really a jazz fan

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.080]
Which he uh that sure you're correct

[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.680]
Okay

[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.680]
I can't wait for that announcement at two

[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.900]
I'll be glued to the radio

[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.820]
Uh man is his fate is not been resolved though it's this

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.880]
See if they were smart if they had any brains at all

[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.400]
The dolphin organization which I'm sure they don't

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.080]
Look what they've done with the with the franchise

[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.660]
But they would keep him around

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.960]
Because mad dog is like the signature voice of the dolphin broadcast

[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.220]
Even though he's only the color analyst but nevertheless

[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.240]
He recently signed a five year deal to do in afternoon show on QAM

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.080]
And believe me me he's probably having second thoughts like some of the rest of us

[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.460]
And as two years left on his contract with the dolphins

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.940]
So if he does the games he gets paid and if he doesn't do the games he gets paid

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.420]
That's the kind of deal I like a lot

[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.700]
Name is being mentioned as possible replacements for Moe and or the mad dog

[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.720]
John Boob Shamby former Marlins announcer as a show on 790

[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.640]
The Booster

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.920]
I don't know if we ever heard him do football again

[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.560]
I have not no I mean he's he's read on baseball and maybe he would be real good on it

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.340]
I don't know I'm I certainly wouldn't pass judgment prematurely

[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.240]
Uh Boob's a good good play by play guy although it's a lot different doing baseball than football

[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.520]
But nevertheless Jimmy Cifilis former dolphin is now the sports canker at channel 10

[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.500]
And his weekend show on 790 I'm sure they must be talking about the color

[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.600]
Analyst for that certainly not play by play Jimmy Cifilis now the chance

[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600]
And Mark Vandermeer now that would be a good choice

[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.640]
From where you and football announcer who's the voice of Houston Texans mark is excellent

[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.060]
But why would he leave Houston an outstanding franchise like that to come to a toilet

[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.200]
Dragging team like the dolphins right right right. I mean Houston. You know, they're they're a new team

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.020]
And they got the good young team and every now and then they win a game upset somebody that they

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.140]
Oh, whatever but the dolphins of course are going in the wrong direction. We know that

[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.820]
I mean any team that signs best for rot is their backup quarterback

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.000]
And then you find out he's not only going to be the backup back challenging for the starting roll behind

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.340]
AJ touchy feely who's already shown us his

[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.740]
Forplexing and perpetually injured modus operandas. Uh, what can I tell you?

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.760]
So that's the deal five by dolphin somehow will survive. You know all of these things

[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.900]
We've survived all this time and I guess some hobbles with again. Now what did I do with the pool from yesterday?

[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.460]
Here it is

[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.480]
If Hillary and condoliza were the candidates for president in 2008 who would you vote for Hillary?

[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.420]
We had 17 number 51 vote Hillary a

[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.960]
1334 I leave the country 382 condoliza

[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.080]
196 and I wouldn't vote 139 out of 17 number 51

[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.760]
So Hillary spiced condoliza in his crowd. It's like about the same as it was on the

[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.520]
On the slot thing, you know, and it's well, but uh, and that's our audience

[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.060]
And either audience doesn't really bother voting or else they're just totally non-represented

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:45.100]
We have the cream of the crop and the rest of the people out there just we got the creak crop and they got the crap the rest of them

[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.980]
But anyway speaking of crap we got a little Kim on our beaded curtain today

[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.600]
We apologize profusely for that. I have no idea why George was compelled to put that on there

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.280]
But because she can't make it in favor. Oh, I see. I make it in famous. Not all looking all that great

[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.120]
Not any of it for my personal opinion if you don't know a little Kim then we can't but you up a little okay

[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.160]
Even I know that she's not done any official nudity. This is unofficial nudity. So there's no extra choice

[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.640]
Anyway, zest body wash. That's what I wanted to be sure mentioned today

[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.240]
Even Josh Cordis who's on jury duty again today. I hope don't let me forget tomorrow to bust his balls about that when he comes back

[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.260]
Okay, even he went out and got some body wash

[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:27.040]
We thought he was not the unmannedly thing to do and the zest I saw a spot last night for zest body wash

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.860]
And of course I can't think there other than what's the one that's like Thomas lava nobody who has lava

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.760]
It's like we're trying to take a shower with a body wash. I'd use it

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.840]
But zest has made a whole bunch of different flavors of body wash

[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.500]
So if that's the case all you guys out there who are really uptight nervous about that in fact look at this new pull

[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.880]
We're doing although body washes at the bottom of the list say real men aren't that insecure

[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.780]
Soap is passé. Soap is old soap is ancient soap is like

[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.020]
Washing with a lard, you know, it's smarmy man lard. It is if it's nasty

[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.440]
But body wash it's it's in the bottle. It's in there and you squeeze when it out you squeeze it out

[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.120]
And then you should go or he and you stand out of that shower and you wash it off

[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.560]
And I remember one judge said that he got out of the shower felt like it was still on him. Yeah, I guess he forgot to turn the water on was the problem

[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.960]
That boy's got problems. But anyways zest body. What now? What did you tell me? He got a devious or something?

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.960]
I think it's very masculine. Yeah, definitely very insecure that time that very you kept me

[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.740]
And of course Miguel was sitting in his seat today

[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.320]
He definitely would not use body wash. He still likes the hair on the soap. Oh, no, he's Cuban. Oh, that must be it

[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.600]
That's right. He's got to prove his much. He's motor the entire world

[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.540]
So he definitely still a soap man and likes to drop it on it. No, you miss the point Cuban swear all kinds of food fruit

[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.440]
Fruit stuff and how to problem with that you know, I see clothes

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.920]
No, you know you but he doesn't use body wash. We already been through that with him, right? I got a bottle of the veil actually

[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:53.480]
In three samples the old man. It's all right old spice. Yes. Oh man. That's for old men

[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.680]
Right 1014 at 560 WQM

[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.500]
I'm sure you're familiar with Anthony Kelli and of the main man by now to sevenths capital mortgage

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.980]
So before you call any other mortgage company let the main man tell you what you don't know

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.140]
Did you know that most banks only work with three different mortgage products?

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.880]
And if your credit's less than absolutely perfect

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.900]
You're waiting to hear the most famous two-letter word in the English language

[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.980]
No, that's the word if you're not working with the right lender the chances for getting approved are 50 50 at best

[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.540]
So do yourself a favor call now one triple eight four eight three alone

[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:29.480]
That's one triple eight four eight three loan let the main man in this team put you in a mortgage that meets your needs

[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.400]
Avoid going to the wrong lender or possibly being turned down because you call the wrong number call the main man

[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.120]
It acceptance capital mortgage at one triple eight four eight three loan. That's eight eight eight four eight three loan

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.940]
And every time they close a loan of forces donated to kids in distress

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:50.900]
So why call anybody else? What's not to like avoid the bait and switch call Anthony Kelli into the main man two day one eight eight eight four eight three loan

[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:57.640]
Holy

[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.220]
Oh

[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.060]
Bar with

[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.740]
We're back in the private room

[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.120]
What the hell?

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.580]
Dog!

[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.180]
Dog!

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.660]
Dog!

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.660]
That's that dog!

[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.400]
Take your clothes off, she is fit!

[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.540]
I'm gonna hold it down, and then I can shoot her face

[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.680]
Take it up a big roll with all of this fat

[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.780]
You don't think I'm a fat little kid, she can't wear it fat

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.540]
I'm gonna hang out

[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.560]
I'm gonna hang out

[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.440]
I'm gonna hang out

[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.840]
That's that dog!

[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.660]
That dog is kinda moving fat guys

[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.480]
She ain't no other way to hold it dry

[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.100]
That's the shit she's shouting at us

[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.280]
We need to skip one of the towers

[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.740]
Dog!

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:35.920]
Dog!

[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.160]
Dog!

[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.300]
That's the dog!

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:44.780]
Craig!

[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.320]
Craig!

[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.760]
Craig!

[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.040]
Craig!

[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.680]
So, back boy, eat three boxes, that's three dozen crispy cream donuts here today

[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.860]
And the best part of the deal is he's still alive, is he in the building?

[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.020]
He actually shot today?

[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.640]
I spoke to him this morning over the little fella, so I guess he's in the building

[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.020]
So he's actually back there in sales?

[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.460]
Man, how can he move?

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.480]
How could you possibly even move?

[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.820]
Practice, he's got practice

[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.160]
Here is the uphold today, what's the most embarrassing thing you could have in your car or your house?

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.820]
And so far we got to, well let's take a look at the boats we got

[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.920]
I like putting these up early around 8 o'clock, 8-ish

[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.380]
190 boats, and the reason we don't have more than that boat is because there's a whole lot more choices on there

[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.920]
than I'm sure we'll hear from the audience today

[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:32.400]
Blow up to all 76, butt plug 55, 0.23, car air freshener 14

[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.740]
Now we're talking about those little trees, little evergreen trees that you hang around

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.340]
I think that could apply to the crown also

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.140]
The crown?

[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.520]
The crown, you haven't seen the crown?

[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.500]
No, it's popular amongst the brothers

[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.420]
Is it really?

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:45.700]
Yeah

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.640]
Now what about that liquid cherry?

[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:48.820]
Likewise

[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.640]
Oh, anyway, car air freshener 15, I mean that's just my spouse, 13

[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.500]
Now that was George's pick and for quite a while there was only one, but then a lot of other guys decided

[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.820]
Yeah, or our women I guess, but probably mostly guys

[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.660]
13, so that's pretty embarrassing

[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.460]
And body washes in last place, thank the Lord, thank God

[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.280]
Thank God for spreading the word, I only got 10

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.380]
I don't think I'm really spreading the word, I think everybody in their brother realizes that soap is past say

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:17.500]
And when even being soap makers like Zestid, and I love Zest's soap, that's one of the ones I used for years

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.840]
What's not to like?

[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.500]
That's just good, I just like safeguards

[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:27.440]
But now that Zest is making body wash, even the most manly men can use it and feel very, very safe

[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.040]
So that's our choice for that stuff for the pool so far

[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.220]
Bad news from Baghdad again, but just very quickly because I know you're burned out just like the city

[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.460]
A child was killed at least four people seriously injured today when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle in Baghdad

[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.840]
The bomber also died in the attack

[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.660]
Also, a US Marine was killed in combat yesterday in Western Iraq's Ann Bar province

[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.860]
And yesterday there were five people killed in three different suicide bombings in Baghdad

[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.480]
But other than that, everything is just as Okidoki is Bob Sheeper, which is a weird fight

[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.200]
Last night speaking of Bob Sheeper, I'm done with the CBS TV news

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.160]
All new people at the CBS Bureau on Miami, bye-bye, nice knowing you

[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.480]
And I don't care Mike Walker from the inquire, I can write all the trash he wants about Dan Rather

[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.520]
I really don't care, I like Dan Rather and I don't care what anybody else says

[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.960]
I watch Dan Rather for years just like I had watched Walter Cronkite for years

[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.000]
I like CBS news, period

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.780]
But not no more, but after two nights of Bob Sheeper and that Okidoki line and his other

[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.840]
Okidoki and Okidoki and Senator the Okifin Okiswap, that's a good place for him

[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.520]
What a Yahoo man, God!

[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.200]
Plus a good personal friend of the Bush family so I certainly am not going to watch him

[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:36.080]
I'm not going to watch Brian Williams on NBC because he's a personal buddy of Rush and a regular caller on the Fathas Limbaugh Pillpop in show

[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.920]
So that leaves me with what you said yesterday and I hate to break the news to you but that man can barely speak anymore Peter Jennings

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.900]
Yeah, I know, but whatever

[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.500]
No, no, seriously, he, he, I don't know how old he is whether he's like 60 or something or what his age is

[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.020]
But he's like about 95, he can barely speak, he's like from them to the stories

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.380]
I don't know maybe he's got a bad cold or something, I don't know what his deal is right now

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.920]
I think he's putting himself to sleep

[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.000]
Is that what it is?

[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.220]
Well he's Canadian, eh?

[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.900]
But I watched that last night for about 10 minutes and I thought to myself I've got a real dilemma here now

[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.300]
What, what do I do at 630?

[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.180]
Who do I watch?

[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.340]
What's the story?

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.080]
They all suck

[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.540]
Yeah, I mean, of the news deliverers I will grant you Brian Williams even though he's got that funny nose

[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.980]
It's kind of like out of joint ear off to the side, kind of like AJ Touchy Feeling

[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.060]
But he's certainly by far and away the most articulate

[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:29.600]
I mean Peter Jennings is like a dotting old fool now, I couldn't believe it because I haven't seen him in years and thankfully

[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.800]
And she for of course, Okie Dokie

[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.560]
So, no, no, sir, somehow I just can't imagine Walter Cronkite getting a report from some news reporter from Daniel

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.740]
Sure out in the field and coming back saying, oh thanks Dan, Okie Dokie

[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.440]
Can you imagine Walter saying that or Dan rather even Dan with all his ratherism?

[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.760]
Somehow I can't imagine John Cameron Swazie or Douglas Edwards saying Okie Dokie

[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.960]
But then again, maybe America likes Okie, we'll see

[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.500]
WDQ-YM, hello

[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.860]
Hey, good morning, Neil, how you doing?

[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.780]
When is the, it's good

[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.240]
When is the, hang on, let me turn you down so I don't have an interfering signal

[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.620]
Ok, yes

[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.600]
There's a couple of things I want to talk to you about

[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.280]
And there was one thing I want to mention last because it's probably going to make you angry

[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:09.920]
Really?

[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.760]
Yeah, oh yeah

[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.480]
And that good old Miami Hate

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.660]
First off, Barbara Hale was the name of Delas Street, that's the moment

[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.940]
Right, that's the actress who played Delas Street on Fermatian, absolutely right

[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.440]
And of course, don't forget Raymond Burr with you, just in case Moe's listening, which I'm sure he is, yes

[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.360]
Yeah, big deal

[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.920]
And I want to make a comment about a signature voice

[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.260]
Ken Maulden to me is a signature voice

[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.080]
Right, I love Ken Maulden, he's one of the fine people in the world

[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.940]
When I first came down here back in the 70s, that was the first voice I heard and I said

[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.980]
It's a good town if they got a voice on the air like that of course, then I switched to some other stations and well

[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.780]
There you go

[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:49.540]
Yeah, doesn't the CBC on CFPB Channel 9 have their own version of the Nightly News

[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.940]
You know, so that you could watch that instead of having to see

[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.920]
Well, I do watch, well, I got the CBC right here, I got the all different, huh?

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:04.580]
Yeah, you got CBLT Channel today, the day of Band M9 and they did unfortunately in late April, early May

[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.060]
Yeah, but the CBC News number one is almost all Canadian oriented, which let's face it, I'm not talking about Canada

[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.800]
Number two, it's very, it's so dry that you can almost like start gagging, you know what I mean?

[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.640]
I understand, it's about as exciting as listening to someone reach author

[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.240]
Right

[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.980]
Hi, Georgia, the other thing I wanted to get to that, that's got to make me very angry, yes?

[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:32.580]
No, no, no, I want to, yeah, Jeff, I've seen Jeff high and clearly, clearly there's something wrong there

[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.480]
So what am I going to be angry about that?

[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.920]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I wanted to ask you, isn't a part where I'm getting closer to the Joyce comment I want to make

[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.720]
That's what I know is going to make you so upset

[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.920]
Oh, I see, I'm leading up to that

[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.260]
Let's get to it

[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.420]
Okay, isn't a fart just a rectal belch?

[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:49.820]
Yeah

[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.520]
Alright, so what's that going to make me angry about?

[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:59.080]
Well, I'll cut to the chase this morning when you were doing the change over with Hank, something was said that was, I think about Mo

[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.100]
And you guys got, that's number one, there's two

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.980]
You guys got dumped because the middle of the door he came in and you guys were both laughing and I could tell it was clipped

[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.400]
Well, who dumped that?

[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.820]
I don't know, I don't, did you say something about Mo?

[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.640]
No, I was talking about Dick Stockton and Hank, he fell into the way I, he stumbled on his toe on that, but anyway

[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.820]
Yeah, no, there was somebody else that was mentioned and...

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.560]
You were so old, I admit, you didn't hear Dick Stockton's name?

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.860]
I don't think I heard it

[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.420]
Then that would be what got dumped

[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.960]
Okay, that's why I have an idea who dumped it though, that would be interesting to find out

[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:35.980]
The other interesting thing was at 1021, you were down for about 15 seconds now, you were not off the air

[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.540]
Yeah

[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.520]
There was a solid carrier, but there was no sound and you were going down the stuff over the pole, so I don't know what was...

[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.600]
Oh, then, well that's part for the chorus, I'm not angry about that, listen as long as I get paid, I don't care about that

[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.700]
Have a great day, Pally

[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.360]
See you, Pally

[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.320]
Say hi to Jeff High

[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:58.260]
27 out of 10, boy, that guy, he must keep a log at 1021, you did this in a 957, now who would have dumped that on, I guess his board off, huh?

[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.280]
I guess, so it was an accident?

[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.240]
No, well, what he knew was an accident, but nobody got hurt?

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.640]
Right

[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:28.900]
Oh, God

[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.220]
No, nobody watched it

[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:16.520]
I have this fact that you just sent me, I want Miguel to do something right now, I realize it's a little bit too much like work, I want you to get up and walk out of the hallway, I want you to look into the other studio where anybody would be monitoring dump buttons, I want you to come back and give us a report what's going on

[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.760]
They're not doing anything over there

[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.880]
You're positive of that

[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.440]
Beacons in here, yes, positive

[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.420]
You're sure of that?

[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.740]
Because I wouldn't want to think that anybody a QM would lie to me, because that would be very much... I'm sure that Greg wouldn't approve of that

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.680]
Is there recording something in there?

[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:29.820]
Yes, that's why

[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.580]
There why?

[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.840]
In other words, in switching around to whatever they needed to do, they must have knocked us off for a few seconds

[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:43.460]
And the only reason I was a little bit suspect there is because there are some things on the pool today which aren't even close to FCC guidelines, I mean, but plug is just a device

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.960]
You know, it's what you do with it, that's an reassuring report

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.020]
But you're a Louisiana, but we can still say that

[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:55.700]
Well, anyway, Rick Faxon says they're doing it to you again when you're reading the results of the pool, the first half of the pool was dumped out and we had 20 seconds of silence

[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:03.460]
So in other words, somebody we had a technical, although I am wondering who's the one who dumped what Hans said there, because that was very funny there at the end and there was really nothing wrong with it

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.780]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.920]
I don't

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.740]
Oh, you didn't hear it either?

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.360]
No

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.980]
No, we heard everything, but which part do you mean? It was all fine

[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.580]
Well, I was talking about Dick Stockton

[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.300]
We heard it

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.700]
I'm not going to repeat it, I'm going to, you know, well

[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.620]
Anyway, it says what the F is going on, are they going to treat you like Howard Stern and dump you all the time?

[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.760]
Well, I have a very good authority from them from all the powers that be, not that they would lie of course

[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.120]
But that's done, that was a one day disaster and will not be done again

[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.380]
They've already declared all of our show so much anyway, there's really not much left to a worry about

[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.800]
There ain't nothing to worry about

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.340]
And we'll deal with the other part of it in court where it should have been dealt with a long time ago

[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.040]
234 votes on the pool, what's the most embarrassing thing you could have in your car or house?

[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.160]
That's the pool today, if you're missed they hear it

[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.880]
Now I'm not sure that they were talking about the Hillary kind of Lisa pool got the bleeped or what?

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:48.900]
I don't know

[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.540]
But you tell me that it wasn't a bleep it was like somebody hit the wrong button and they're knocked the software for 20 seconds

[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.200]
That's my thing

[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.020]
Which sounds more likely

[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.520]
Anyway, here's what we got so far embarrassing in your car or house, a blow up doll 92

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:06.480]
But plus 75, Dillro 31, car air fresher 17, my spouse 16 or body wash only 10

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.260]
Still only 10 in last place, and I'm sure we can add lots and lots of wonderful things to that

[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.280]
My spouse 16, but that's banned

[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.700]
Somebody QAAM, hello

[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.680]
Yeah, Miguel?

[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.440]
Yeah

[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.360]
Hey, it's Winnie

[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.640]
Hey, what are you doing?

[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.760]
Okay, listen, I heard it was a dick stop that coming

[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.940]
What are you on here?

[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.360]
What are you on here?

[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.860]
You know, at first I just had a dog up in the back of you idiot, you pony-tailed clown

[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.420]
It's not Miguel

[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.000]
Hello

[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.600]
What happened to him?

[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]
We're not having a nut

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.560]
Why aren't you speaking to me?

[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.780]
I'm speaking to you

[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.800]
Don't worry then, why do you keep saying hello like you're some kind of a moron?

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.880]
I'm going to be a person like dog with a lot of my kids

[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.200]
I said, kill a dog, okay?

[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.820]
Kill that damn dog, what kind of a dog is it?

[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.700]
It's a nut

[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.160]
Well, what's it said to me?

[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.000]
I think we said it was a bandit out in the Redland area

[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.240]
Well, isn't that cute?

[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.260]
You're not talking to Miguel, I mean for quite a lot, what's wrong with you, man?

[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.840]
I sounded like you, I sounded like you

[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.860]
Give me the atmosphere, what were you just telling me?

[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.700]
I heard the dick stocking car was driving back there

[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.080]
I heard the talk about dick stocking, I heard the stocking's name, so I don't know what those other people were saying

[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.500]
Everybody's trying to stir the pot today

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.060]
These are probably people from 790

[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.200]
They're all as swelled up with pride, they got the dolphin

[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.060]
They got a horse ball team under station

[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.460]
They're all whipped up into a frenzy

[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.740]
Right, right

[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.300]
Yeah, definitely, I'm a build fan, that doesn't matter

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.220]
And I'm a pay-pick-up fan, so like I said, it's really dolphins, you know?

[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.080]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.580]
My dog's not a dolphin fan either

[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.560]
Yeah, good, he's a little high rate

[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.320]
Well, sounds like you're barking up the wrong tree

[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.200]
Have a great day, Woody

[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.380]
By the way, the buffalo is the armpit of the universe, believe me

[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.580]
Like today, it's sunny here, they probably got three feet of snow in buffalo with sunny and beautiful here

[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.340]
So, just for that

[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.220]
I definitely, definitely, but they got great feet for that

[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.480]
Well, I'm real happy for you

[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.340]
Have a great day, see you on what he said good-bye

[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.020]
Take care of my life

[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.420]
Oh, that was good, wouldn't it?

[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.880]
What the hell was that all of a sudden?

[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.560]
Oh, let's go home, let's call it man

[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.700]
How can you top that?

[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.140]
Then when he started saying hello, hello

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.200]
We have a little communication problem here at WQM

[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.360]
In case you have a notice, folks

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.720]
Let's get some more things for this poll here, huh?

[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.780]
The most embarrassing thing you can have in your car or house, besides Woody Graber's dog

[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.560]
WQM, hello

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.260]
Uncle Leo

[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.060]
Yes sir

[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:14.940]
Good morning, how are you?

[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.680]
I'm great

[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.140]
That's wonderful, you're on comments out of the 40 thing

[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.460]
I love Richard, went out loud and clear

[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.840]
No, that's not what it was said, that's not the answer

[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.860]
I know that's not what it was

[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.240]
That's okay, so nobody did dump that thing, I just made that up

[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.040]
Okay, we got some trouble makers out there looking to stir the pot

[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.720]
Okay, what's the one obscured by the dodo dodo dodo dodo?

[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.580]
That's it, I'm out of material

[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.860]
Thanks for the good news, pal

[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.080]
567-0560, pound 560 and they've arrived in a singular wireless line

[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.720]
Seems to me like this audience is obsessed with the big stockton

[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.480]
WQM, hello

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.020]
Yes, I like one number one supersized with Coke

[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.000]
WQM, hello

[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.560]
Hi, I like to be for the poll

[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.540]
Yes sir

[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.320]
An AT track player

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.040]
What?

[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.380]
An AT track player, okay, AT track player

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.180]
I've actually done too many of those saying it around

[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.480]
Although we would like to hear a player

[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.080]
And this time I'm in for love on an AT track

[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.700]
I had that once upon a time, really

[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.500]
Wow, yeah, aren't you impressed?

[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.900]
I had yellow on an AT track

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.540]
Oh, well that's much better than player

[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.260]
That's much better than player

[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.820]
Well, they had a couple of songs, they had one song I liked

[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.120]
Okay, and right away I got to pay a wicked penalty for that

[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.960]
Oh, you're tasting music, man

[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.000]
It's so bad, you and I crack you up

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.740]
Let's look up the player

[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.640]
What's that?

[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]
Actually, this is a group called B3 from Germany

[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.960]
And it's a, all of their, uh, Julio is from Spain

[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.400]
I'm sure

[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.480]
And it's called IO IO

[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.260]
I, oh, yeah, that's what it's called

[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.100]
And they can't sing at all

[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.420]
But for a couple of them look pretty good

[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.480]
So I'm sure that they'd be very big in South Florida

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.560]
But you'll never hear it because who the hell would play it

[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:52.940]
Do you understand?

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.440]
Nobody would play it

[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.580]
That's unfortunate

[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.600]
Because they would be humongous in South Florida

[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.440]
Believe you me, especially in dead county

[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.100]
They'd be big, huge

[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.240]
But, and maybe they do play them

[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.200]
I don't know, we don't listen to that

[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.200]
That's the Gucci, Gucci stuff they play

[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.300]
Who knows what they're playing

[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.200]
I don't know

[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.720]
Somebody's listening, a lot of them

[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.300]
20 me 4, 11 at 5, 60 me

[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.080]
We got Mohawar David

[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.440]
Mad Dog at 4, 7 o'clock

[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.920]
Yeah, UN South Carolina, NIT basketball, man

[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.240]
The NIT, that's the big time

[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.060]
And it, oh yeah

[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.740]
NK after the basketball game

[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.120]
That's our lineup, our award winning lineup

[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.420]
And we just continue showing up against all odds

[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.140]
Here at QAM

[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.900]
And now that we lost the dolphins, man

[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.300]
How are we gonna, how do we continue?

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.720]
How are we gonna be able to be up and owning?

[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.140]
Man, you know, even after all this time

[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.660]
After I've told you a zillion times, some people still think

[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.480]
It's just a little pqier to buy a bet over the phone

[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.600]
When you call this number 1-800 mattress

[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600]
The number for dial amateurs

[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.620]
You'll find out for yourself

[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.180]
You've got the most liberal exchange policy

[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.140]
So there's absolutely nothing to risk

[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.020]
That you know that 1-800 mattress has got more repeat customers than anybody else in industry

[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.740]
So once you try it, I'll guarantee it

[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.980]
I'll bet you're a pair of his life on it

[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.480]
You'll never go back to a showroom again

[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.720]
And by the way, speaking of losing the dolphins

[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.200]
What's a pair you're gonna do now, huh?

[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.260]
Panthers don't exist?

[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.080]
I don't know

[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.160]
We don't got the heat

[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.800]
I mean, he's gotta be Mr. Marlon, I guess, huh?

[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.040]
Anyway, dial amateurs will get no nonsense

[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.980]
No run-arounds, no showrooms, shenanigans

[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.200]
Just factory direct prices

And the best brands you know trust and love

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.280]

And the business they got

[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.140]

Rogers, X, Lusica, and Y-60

[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.920]
I was a kid

[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.480]
Oh my friend, just to come on over to my place

[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.340]
Because they knew my mom had been down to Windixie

[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.740]
She'd always have something good to eat

[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.160]
For all of us

[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.380]
There one day my sister found his dog running through the store

[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.800]
Called it, and he guessed it, Windix

[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.680]
Nowadays though, things are getting tough

[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.740]
Ever since Windixie declared bankruptcy, it's been slim-picking for her

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:24.460]
Good thing Mama went belly at the pool Windixie dear, it would have killed her

[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.820]
But everybody still comes over to my place

[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.680]
And all over, the cupboards getting bare, we can always look up something good

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.160]
Windix, come here

[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.420]
It's your real tender, aren't you?

[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.380]
I'll show you something I learned in Korea

[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.440]
Have anybody complained about hair in their food?

[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.280]
Well, just blame it on Windix

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.500]
When we the first time I guarantee that

[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.680]
14-4-11-5-60 WQM

[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.420]
Here's a fantasy letter it says

[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.140]
From Greg Reade

[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:58.740]
Formerly the broadcast station of the Miami Dolphins WQM

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.380]
From the desk of Greg Reade General Manager to all staff

[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.800]
Again, this is a fantasy letter

[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.000]
As you all know by now WQM has lost the rights to broadcast the Miami Dolphins

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.140]
This decision should in no way be a reflection of the way I have managed the station

[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.160]
My daily attention to detail and my open management styles

[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.280]
Always put a smile in your faces as has my cheerful disposition

[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.500]
In lieu of the unforeseen decision of the Dolphins organization

[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.820]
The following employees should immediately start looking for another job

[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:29.360]
Josh Dero, Dufflin Z, Curtis Raymond, Gary Sarner, Todd Greck, Jeff High, Troisdrat for George Corso

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:58.520]
How are you David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and David and

[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:20.700]
and David and David van Vovsage

[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:20.840]
John David Lango

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:20.840]

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.020]
John David Lango

[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.080]
My spouse 18, bodywashed 12, and the ATRAC clear one.

[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.280]
I got to call it in obviously.

[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.880]
WCWAM, hello.

[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:36.960]
The Roger the God.

[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.400]
How are you?

[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:37.960]
Okay.

[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.640]
Hey, I was thinking I heard the caller with the dog and that maybe think one for the

[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.160]
poll.

[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:43.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.280]
A little toy dog where they'd be a little poodle or a little chihuahua.

[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.820]
Got the guys over for the game and a little thing won't quit y'all.

[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.160]
Right.

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.900]
That's a toy dog.

[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.220]
He's good.

[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.620]
I like that.

[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.120]
All right.

[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.040]
Thanks, Kelly.

[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:53.500]
Yeah.

[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.780]
And some people put those little toy dogs on the back of their, the back inside the

[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.480]
rear window at a car.

[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.900]
Oh, man, the bubble head dog.

[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.100]
Oh, gee, that is so tacky, so red, Nicky, so sad.

[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.400]
First of all, it's also against the law, by the way.

[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.180]
Is it really?

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.120]
Yes, it is.

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:14.980]
I'm putting any, putting any object in your front window or rear window in the bed.

[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.900]
In any way, block portion of your view is illegal, but nothing to anybody ever gets

[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.540]
ticketed for that.

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.520]
I never heard a such thing.

[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.200]
But, they all come to QAM.

[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:22.500]
Hello.

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.780]
Oh, cute.

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:25.520]
I mean, come on.

[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.640]
I mean, come on, you back.

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.560]
Okay, come me back or not.

[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.080]
WQAM, hello.

[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:30.800]
Hey, Neil.

[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.280]
I don't know if you happen to see the God Squad without a full effect on the chat shows last

[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.020]
night, divine intervention.

[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.500]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.040]
Oh, and no question about them, and CNN even had to go on the bottom of the screen.

[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.580]
They're the big thing.

[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.800]
The power of prayer.

[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.820]
And now this whole thing, then come to find out that this Ashley Smith, her background,

[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.440]
she was a real slime ball.

[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:55.360]
Yeah, well, you know what they didn't bring that up, but the nut case lunatic Bible

[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.860]
bumper that killed all the people in the church, but got a lot of people doing that.

[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.200]
They're not talking about that story at all.

[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.440]
For whatever reason, then, I guess we know what the reason is.

[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.320]
But in this case, we got a wonderful story because she was a slime ball teenager, but

[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.300]
then she found God.

[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.660]
And then this guy just, this brand, it was just having to wander into her and then the

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.500]
apartment and she turned them on to God and they yaddy-addy.

[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:14.760]
And all that stuff.

[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.020]
Yeah, it kind of curious in that he happened on her.

[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.140]
And he happened to go to that house and heard that will all come out too later.

[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.860]
I think he was doing that.

[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.840]
He's the divine intervention.

[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:26.640]
That's right.

[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.640]
The divine intervention is absolutely correct.

[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.000]
And the Lord had that road map in his head.

[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.320]
All the wacko pastors and priests, they're all alone.

[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:35.540]
Yeah.

[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.260]
And he was reading this top one, number one selling book by this pastor with a flower shirt

[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.560]
that gets 80,000 people a week in California.

[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.740]
It's just pathetic.

[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.600]
It makes me a little far.

[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:46.660]
Thank you.

[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.480]
Thank you.

[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.380]
Good point.

[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.600]
Just like last night, I saw biography, the Abel Lagosi biography, which was great.

[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.440]
And just before that, I'm just channel surfing.

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.280]
There's nothing on.

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.480]
I got 700 freaking channels on here.

[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.000]
There's nothing on.

[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.500]
And so I watched 7th Heaven.

[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.680]
Not that it's a good show.

[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.620]
It's an awful show.

[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.380]
I mean, even family was a fabulous show compared to this and family was corny.

[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.180]
But I watched it because there's some hot people on there.

[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:09.780]
Definitely could be.

[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.300]
But anyway, so now you watch that show?

[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.220]
Just for her.

[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.500]
Did you see it last night?

[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.460]
No, I haven't seen it.

[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:16.920]
Okay.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.280]
So the young daughter, I don't know what her name is, but she's cute.

[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.060]
Anyway, she's a candidate.

[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.520]
And so she picks out this one kid in school of Victor.

[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.180]
He was cute.

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.740]
And anyway, so finally, she makes a deal with her brother, who she thinks the brother

[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.020]
was shocked up with some.

[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.400]
He's living in the garage or something with his own apartment.

[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.360]
And he made it look like he was just spent the night with some other chick.

[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.300]
So anyway, to make a long story short, she blackmails him and she won't tell anybody

[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.820]
as long as he gets hooked up with Victor.

[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.640]
So finally, Victor calls the daddy, which is you know, the daddy in that story is a minister.

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.180]
Even though there's all this hanky-panky going on and everybody as his horny is can be,

[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.140]
and the hormones are raging on that show, but daddy's a minister.

[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.200]
Even daddy is horny, to as a matter of fact.

[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.120]
But anyway, so the kid calls up and daddy invites him over to talk about whatever his

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.580]
problems are.

[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.840]
And the problem is that the parents, the kids' parents want him to go to church and

[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.340]
he's never gone.

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.420]
Now in the real world, a real person would have said to the kid, but you know something,

[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.280]
if you don't believe in his crap and you don't want to go, no problem, you can still

[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.640]
be a good person without going to do it.

[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.960]
But of course that doesn't happen because on television, even on the WB, that can't

[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.200]
put, isn't that WB or whichever one it is, whichever.

[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.840]
That can't happen though, inconceivable.

[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.480]
Right.

[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.600]
You've got to go to church to be and find God in order to be a good person and to find the

[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.400]
answers to life and all of this other bull crap.

[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.460]
You've got to be one of our customers.

[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.720]
And so as a result, Victor says, oh yeah, I'll go to church.

[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.340]
And he kisses his young daughter and that's it on the cheek and bye-bye.

[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:45.960]
By the way, speaking to kissing on the cheek, the FCC yesterday rejected complaints alleging

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.000]
that affiliates of the ABC Television Network broadcast in decent material.

[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.220]
Oh, some a high act.

[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.240]
Now what movie was she in?

[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.020]
A minute, a few.

[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.280]
Now, why does that come to my mind because there was an interview with her last night?

[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.960]
She was in 54 with Ryan Philippe.

[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.640]
Oh, you saw that movie?

[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.120]
Yes.

[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.540]
That was pretty bad movie.

[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.080]
Yay.

[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:02.980]
It was.

[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.720]
Come on.

[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:04.840]
Yes, you're right.

[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.220]
Well, of course it was because Steve, almost like I wrote Bell, was that his name?

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.020]
He was the founder of the partner.

[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.780]
He was the partner.

[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.180]
That was Mike Myers in the movie.

[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:13.680]
Right.

[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.760]
It was a horrible movie.

[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.060]
And I liked it because Ryan Philippe was right around naked, the whole movie and Miguel

[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.620]
liked it because Salma Hayek was in.

[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.080]
Yes.

[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.620]
He was at El Rey del Aerys.

[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.060]
Huh?

[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.300]
And the old lady was hilarious.

[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.540]
Now the old lady was great.

[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.540]
And then of course the bad part of it is he croaked.

[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.600]
Oh, I shouldn't have told him that.

[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.980]
Oh, you know.

[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.160]
You know, well, of course that was a true story.

[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.460]
I don't know if that's true or not.

[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]
Is that part true?

[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:33.980]
Do we know?

[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.500]
I don't know.

[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.160]
I don't know.

[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.960]
Well, she was popping a few too many pills.

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.620]
That was the problem.

[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.160]
Of course, everybody knew it was popping something.

[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.020]
Wonder if Rush ever went to a studio 54 before his time, I guess.

[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.220]

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.920]
The FCC yesterday rejected complaints alleging that affiliates of the ABC television

[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.200]
network broadcast and decent material last year, prior to a Monday Night Football

[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.900]
telecast, the fact that they were even considering this, the fact that there was even a minor

[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.860]
stimulus about that episode indicates how far down the food chain America has come.

[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.340]
I feel so bad for you.

[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.980]
The segment featured a steamy encounter between Eagles-wide receiver Tyrell O'Hones and

[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.460]
actress Nicola Sheridan from ABC's Desperate Housewives.

[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.740]
That's Nicola Sheridan who used to be on Ots Landing with Pat Peterson.

[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.260]
The commission concluded in a memorandum opinion and ordered that the episode broadcasted

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.740]
9 p.m. was not sufficiently explicit or graphic to be deemed indecent.

[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.300]
During the scene, O'Hones who was suited up for the game is a lone and locker room with

[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.940]
Sheridan who was clad only in a towel.

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.400]
Oh, the FCC described the scene as follows.

[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.060]
After he rebuffs her advances, telling her that the game is about to start and that

[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.680]
his team needs him, she drops her towel.

[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.460]
The camera shows her from the back nude from the waist up.

[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.940]
The viewer cannot see her body below the waist.

[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.140]
He responds, all hell, the team is going to win.

[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.160]
We have to win without me.

[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.680]
And then she leaps into his arms.

[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.740]
The scene concludes with two other characters from Desperate Housewives watching the locker room

[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.940]
encounter on their TV who remarked how desperate Sheridan appears and then changed the channel

[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.840]
to the game, repeating the traditional Monday Night Football introduction, are you ready

[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.460]
for some football?

[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.320]
The game broadcasts and commences.

[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.140]
Though federal courts at Opel Congress's authority to regulate the hearing of indecent

[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.960]
speech, the first amendment is a critical constitutional limitation that depends that demands

[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.500]
that in decency determinations we proceed cautiously and with appropriate restraint the agency

[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.000]
said, oh, when's that going to start?

[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.720]
Right, we proceed cautiously.

[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.760]
The commissioners concluded that the material was not patently offensive and thus not

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.480]
indecent.

[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.240]
The Monday Night Football segment, although sexually suggestive, is not graphic or explicit,

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.880]
as the order said.

[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.800]
Except for a moment when her back is exposed to camera, Sheridan and Owens were fully

[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.060]
clothed throughout its end.

[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.680]
Although the scene apparently is intended to be titillating, it simply is not graphic or

[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.760]
explicit enough to be indecent under our standard.

[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.820]
The order was signed by FCC Secretary Marlene H. Dorch.

[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.820]
Dorch, she's sitting out on a porch in a rock and chair.

[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.060]
After the segment air, the FCC received many complaints, alleging that it contained indecent

[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.160]
material agency said in news release, as spokeswoman on Monday said, they would not devolve

[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.220]
how many complaints they received.

[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:53.900]
I would think,

[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.880]
but third, man,

[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:55.460]
coughs.

[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:55.960]
Oh, you're generous.

[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.500]
Yeah, probably about two.

[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.380]
Despite the FCC decision commissioner Michael J. Cops chasing the network anyway in a separate

[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:07.020]
statement, oh, yeah, at a time when recent surveys show that substantial majority of parents

[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.780]
are very concerned that children are being exposed to too much inappropriate content.

[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.960]
No, that I would hope that television broadcasters go the extra mile in exercising self-discipline

[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.400]
when airing or promoting programming that may not be appropriate for younger viewers

[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:19.980]
he be saying.

[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.280]
There wasn't much self-discipline in this particular promotion.

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.360]
As stewards of the public airwaves broadcasters can and do better should do better.

[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.460]
A spokeswoman for the network said she had no comment.

[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.840]
Last week, FCC chairman outgoing Michael Powell, his last commission meeting he had said he

[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.240]
would leave the agency this month announced Friday that he'll spend three months as a senior

[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.680]
fellow at the Aspen Institute, a Washington-based organization who stated mission is to foster

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.980]
enlightened leadership and open-minded dialogue.

[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.020]
Oh, boy.

[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.340]
What?

[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.820]
FCC spokeswoman Janice Wyce says she didn't know who replaced Powell, who stirred controversy

[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.360]
last year when he led the charge against CBS and its affiliates for the Janet Jackson

[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.080]
Booby flat.

[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.000]
ABC of course is owned by Walt Disney who's got bigger fish to fry.

[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.940]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.160]
This is the Neil Rogers.

[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.060]
Okay.

[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.280]
Waterport down.

[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.660]
We like to drown with the waterport down.

[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:30.640]
That's what you do when your country is run by a fact that there are any Neocon punks.

[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:37.140]
We like to make the fifth information up and agonize and up for a waterport dunk.

[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.040]
We like to take these in a pyramid pile.

[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.380]
Not to torture all American style.

[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.740]
We like to take these in a pyramid pile.

[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:57.380]
Everybody is a terrorist and so we must mercenaries to rape a pin of pile.

[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.820]
We've already cowboyed his good Christian cops.

[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.040]
Have no shame about how they make up the talk.

[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.760]
Even if they have nothing to say, occupiers always act this way.

[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.920]
Break the little boy until he's free.

[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.480]
Hey, they're just letting us see the middle of Christian cops.

[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.760]
We call this freedom that we have to spread.

[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.060]
They should be happy that we're making them dead.

[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.360]
Capture makers off the quota of income.

[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.100]
We're scared.

[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.780]
And write it off as college, Frankster, pun.

[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.180]
That's the solid impacts of American weight.

[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.460]
Complex the USA.

[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.640]
Now the insurgents are us.

[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.440]
1103 at 560.

[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.220]
WQM, we got some very good news for you today from the new national inquirer, my Bible.

[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.440]
See, that's one thing.

[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.240]
If Brian Nichols would have broken into my apartment, I'd have the inquirer sitting here.

[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.240]
And I would have held it up in the ear and he would like...

[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.920]
He would have recalled like...

[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.240]
Recorded.

[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.200]
Speaking of Belonga Gosele, that was a good biography.

[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.460]
That's God, I love that channel.

[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.720]
Oh, and look at what's on the back page.

[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.420]
No, remember I told you before to show how they wrote this glowing article of luck?

[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.100]
Kristie Alley and she lost 20 pounds.

[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.840]
Guess what's on the back page?

[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.540]
Oh, the inquirer.

[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]
An ad for Jay.

[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.940]
A big full page ad in color.

[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.800]
Kristie Alley is fat actress, premieres Monday, March 7 on Showtime.

[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.240]
That's up there.

[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.120]
Oh, ad, how do you like that?

[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.740]
With that purple outfit she's got as fat as a cow.

[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.260]
And she's even got her finger in her mouth like she's going to start chewing on that too of that.

[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.140]
She's going to cry, don't arrive real quick with that.

[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:32.920]
Chocolate cake!

[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.160]
And of course the fat is teeny.

[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.120]
She is... I can't... I just can't repeat it often enough.

[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.480]
Maybe I'm going to say it every day on the show.

[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.720]
She makes me gag.

[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.400]
Although fat boy with a three dozen donuts I guess puts her to shame.

[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.260]
Has there been any denial of that?

[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.500]
Have we had any more feedback so to speak on that?

[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.600]
I have not heard a word.

[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.280]
Wow.

[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.800]
I mean, I know that.

[00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:00.140]
Now I'll admit yesterday because of the stress that it showed yesterday in the kind of emotional cripple behavior of Dufflinzi and Clarence Darrell put me like way over the edge.

[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.120]
So I went out to the two Dominion and I bought me a box.

[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.840]
But at least you have, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:11.060]
In America and I've said this before, I've been in supermarkets all around Europe and the here.

[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.120]
Nowhere anywhere they got the selection of food that you've got in the US.

[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.100]
Which isn't necessarily good because that's why everybody's fat and died.

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.560]
But nevertheless as far as taste is concerned, variety.

[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.940]
But anyways, so I bought a box of four, score Eskimo pies.

[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.820]
Remember I told you about those?

[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.140]
Yeah.

[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.540]
It's Eskimo pies with score ice cream inside.

[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.620]
Of course I eat them.

[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.040]
Although they're fairly small, they're not the full size Eskimo pies.

[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.980]
They're not like I would say two thirds of the size.

[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.860]
And I ate them.

[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.820]
One after the other side by the end.

[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:39.660]
Yeah, why?

[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.180]
No, it's depressing.

[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.320]
Well why is it depressing?

[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.320]
I've loved you with this going as great as 108.

[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.800]
That's an absolute number, man.

[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.640]
I'm doing fine.

[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.740]
My weight is 190.

[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:48.380]
Okay.

[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.580]
But I just, I had the need, man.

[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.620]
I had to get that stuff going in your brain.

[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.020]
And do I have to get my serotonin levels up.

[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.760]
What do you laugh about?

[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:58.660]
I can relate.

[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.960]
When these people continue dragging you down.

[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.960]
And I don't know what's the matter with Miss Lindsay.

[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.520]
Well, I do know in a social cripple she's got a lot of issues.

[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.740]
I don't want to deal with those people.

[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.940]
I don't want to talk to them.

[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940]
I've told them this.

[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.900]
I don't know how many times.

[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.440]
She comes in there again this morning.

[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.460]
You know, because if he doesn't talk to me, I guess he's not going to have no reason to

[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.000]
put on his resume and why he continues being in the building.

[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.500]
I mean, you know, and why was it necessary for the two of them to have to come in there together

[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.320]
yesterday?

[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.380]
Have you noticed this new deal like I told Hank where they're joined at the hip, a duff and

[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.420]
clearance and clearance and duff and Jimmy and Danny?

[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.200]
What is it?

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.040]
Why was it necessary for the two of them?

[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.600]
Like the world was coming to an end.

[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.620]
Strength in numbers.

[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:36.720]
Oh, is that what it is?

[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:36.960]
Sure.

[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.860]
Yeah, one day needs strength in numbers when you've got a couple of cowards like that,

[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.960]
a couple of emotional cripples.

[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.520]
Oh, gee, I got a hangnail, Greg.

[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.640]
Oh, Maddie Bell, look to me, dirty Greg.

[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.600]
Boy, what's up already?

[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.660]
Will you please you pathetic quizzlings you?

[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.240]
And when I come back to town very soon, I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.720]
I sure as hell don't want to be involved with those people.

[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.100]
Don't even come around me because I won't even look at you.

[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:57.960]
Just get lost.

[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.860]
Anybody who would do to anybody else, I told Duff this yesterday on the phone.

[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.520]
I called him the afternoon.

[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.920]
I said, I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy if I knew who that was.

[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.540]
I wouldn't do it to anybody, which you people did to me like four minutes before I'd go on here yesterday.

[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.320]
Like there was some major crisis like the world was, which there was not.

[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.120]
It's just more of the same old crap.

[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.100]
There was no big deal.

[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.640]
But oh my god, like the sky is falling and the world is coming to an end.

[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.860]
And let me say it again.

[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.500]
I didn't put Scott Ferell or Howard Stern on this radio station.

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.860]
Go look elsewhere to find your problems.

[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.780]
Okay, it's not in our studios.

[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.720]
So while you're rifling through their run a weekend, don't be looking for the solution of that problem.

[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.200]
Now, getting back to the story in the inquirer.

[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.180]
Dick Clark ready to die.

[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.500]
Sources say he's defeated at home and partially paralyzed.

[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.220]
Oh, right.

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.020]
Now, this is a guy that we used to like.

[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.400]
At least most of us used to like him.

[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.340]
I think Hank liked him, too, as a matter of fact.

[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.240]
Is that what he said this morning?

[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:48.420]
Okay.

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.460]
But nevertheless, yeah, that's right.

[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.240]
I don't have to repeat it.

[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:57.740]
But once he was outed by Michael Moore as being the slime ball that he is,

[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.100]
the exploiter of human suffering that he is.

[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.060]
And then you'll notice very shortly after that, God smoked him, man.

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.140]
He smited him.

[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.300]
He struck his ass down with a first stroke.

[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.700]
And then when that didn't do the job, the Lord looked down and said,

[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.120]
Hey, let's try it again.

[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.380]
Okay, practice makes perfect.

[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.920]
And what I'm being that was it.

[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.840]
The music icon Dick Clark, the man hailed as America's oldest teenager,

[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.260]
is ready to die, say, sources, to which we can only say,

[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.780]
sadly, according to insiders, the once vital radio and TV legend remains partially paralyzed

[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.240]
and barely able to speak after suffering two strokes in early December 2004.

[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.460]
Now 75 Clark has been in seclusion since returning to his malleable home

[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.360]
after a seven-week hospital stay in insiders' series living on borrowed time.

[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.520]
Dick Clark, as America knows him, no longer exists,

[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.200]
a source close to the beloved entertainment revealed.

[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:51.280]
The strokes he suffered were extremely serious, not just serious, but extremely serious.

[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.400]
Although it's nearly impossible to get any concrete details out of the family,

[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.960]
it's clear that he's not well enough to leave the house or function on his own.

[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.220]
While initially he couldn't speak, Dick cannot speak on a limited basis,

[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.700]
as in, like that.

[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.100]
But he still struggles to talk and he's partially paralyzed and spends too much of his time in bed.

[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.240]
Another Clark camp insider added,

[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.060]
I think Dick is completely demoralized.

[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.940]
He's doing rehab in his house every day, but his heart just isn't in it.

[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.080]
Entertaining people was his reason for living.

[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.040]
I thought it was making money was his reason for living, making huge chunks of it.

[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.180]
Dick would rather go out now with the public remembering him as being the great impressario

[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.000]
who looked and acted decades younger than he was, and they got a recent picture of him here now.

[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.920]
Believe me, he's making up for lost time.

[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.040]
Ironically, Clark's worst nightmare was that he'd spend his final days debilitated and unable to work.

[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.220]
Dick's greatest fear, especially since he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a decade ago,

[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.000]
was that he'd be incapacitated by either a heart attack or a stroke of the source.

[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.000]
He knew that diabetes sufferers are high risk candidates for stroke and heart attack.

[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.940]
Eerily, just prior to these stroke crisis, Dick said that he hoped he'd die while he was still vital.

[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.980]
He built up an image of never ending youthfulness, always felt obligated to live up to that image,

[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.580]
and he never wanted to be a burden on his family, especially his wife, Carrie.

[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.640]
Right now, Dick's life consists of physical therapy sessions that is malleable home and not much else.

[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.380]
The family has purposely been trying to paint a picture that he's fine.

[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.320]
He's just fine.

[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.340]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.280]
And only sufferer to minor setback, but I don't think Dick is coming out of this.

[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.320]
When contacted by the inquire, Clark's longtime publicist Paul Sherpren insists,

[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.740]
Clark is fine and denied that he's experienced any depression or expressed the will to die,

[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.240]
but a neighbor in front of the American bandstand host added,

[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.320]
poor Dick is a shell of his former self, the strokes have ravaged his entire body.

[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.580]
It seems like his wife and three children are keeping a tight little in his condition

[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.980]
because they want people to remember him as he was, not as he is now.

[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.440]
They're hoping against hope that it'll make a miraculous recovery, but one top TV executive told me,

[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.900]
Dick's outlook isn't good. There isn't a lot more doctors can do for him.

[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.440]
Meanwhile, his daughter Cindy's running Dick Clark Productions,

[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.460]
which produces New Year's Rock and Eve, American dreams go to global war, the American music way out of it.

[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.480]
How do you like that? There are some good news for you.

[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.380]
For those of us who find him repulsing and disgusting and a grave robber.

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.720]
How do you like that? WQA, not there. QA Am Hello.

[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.100]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:02.660]

[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:03.660]
QA Am.

[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.720]
See, I was reading too long with Gell, I should probably interrupt it instead of boy, you're reading too much.

[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.340]
Okay, I got a lot more whether you like it or not. We don't really care.

[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.300]
We don't care what you think, smart ass. WQA Am Hello.

[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.960]
This is Andy.

[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.340]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.640]
Hey, Molly.

[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.300]
Yeah.

[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.320]
How are you doing today?

[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:19.900]
Okay.

[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.140]
I got one for your poll.

[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:21.880]
Yes, good.

[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.460]
How about an autographed picture of Don't Come All down at the end?

[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.840]
Yeah, that's cute.

[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.320]
Well, I got another one. How about Take Girl Magazine?

[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:35.140]
Alright. Now would be embarrassing for more to these guys since we have like 99% of me a lot of you.

[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.740]
Take Girl Magazine. Get it on there.

[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.040]
I thought this would grow by a leaf side. I thought this was a good poll today.

[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:40.180]

[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:40.720]
It is a good idea.

[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.980]
You thought it was a good poll, but sure.

[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.020]
We know Lana.

[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.320]
We know Lana.

[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.000]
Just like that first caller.

[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.360]
He was right when he talked about being just a sour, a South Florida piece of crap,

[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.240]
who we just wanted to steer a bunch of negative and insert a pot again.

[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.680]
And pick up what we left off yesterday.

[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.560]
Not interested.

[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.040]
Well, I got something legitimate to get psychotic about.

[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.160]
Like yesterday, I'll do it.

[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.360]
But I'm not going to like when you snap your fingers, get psychotic on demand.

[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.320]
Okay. Sorry.

[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.040]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.820]
Yeah, hey, Neil. Looks like they gave it to you a good yesterday.

[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.320]
But you're going to both do think that.

[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.260]
Thank God.

[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.840]
Got one for you.

[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.680]
A two pay. No offense.

[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.200]
Okay. Good one.

[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:18.660]
Thank you.

[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.240]
Too pay would be good.

[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:21.940]
The old muskrat.

[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.660]
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.140]
Ramble.

[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.420]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:25.940]
QA Am.

[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.080]
Hey, how are you today?

[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.580]
Good.

[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:28.320]
Neil.

[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.380]
Yes, I am.

[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.780]
Hey, listen, I'm wondering why we haven't been able to find a lot yet.

[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.500]
You think we're still looking for them or we just over there to reach the change?

[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.720]
He's probably having dinner with the Asadie Roe family right now.

[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:41.960]
Okay.

[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.580]
With Van Banderbush and a whole of the Gonsa Mishboha.

[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.620]
What were you that come from?

[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.080]
What was that all about?

[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:50.240]
Huh?

[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.000]
I don't know.

[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:51.980]
Lash of summer.

[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:52.640]
Yamama.

[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]
That's my comment to that.

[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.480]
12 minutes after I've been speaking of finding a bad hair piece in somebody's house.

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.420]
Here's the deal.

[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:04.900]
Chuck Alphiri would like to avoid you the embarrassment of putting a dead mouse on your head or muskrat or any of those other horrible looking things.

[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.120]
They all look the same.

[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.040]
Well, not the same.

[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.000]
It's just a matter of degree.

[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.180]
Some of them are embarrassing.

[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.320]
Some of them are humiliating.

[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.160]
And some of them are totally degrading because they all look silly.

[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.320]
But Charlie's got his new skin-like hair system that is 100% undetectable.

[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:18.260]
That's right.

[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:18.860]
Let me say it again.

[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.400]
100% undetectable.

[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.400]
It's the natural hair line system that's the best looking piece anywhere in the world.

[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:31.780]
And the reason it does look like one of those mousey looking things is because it looks like the real hair like it's grown out of your scalp as opposed to a barnyard animal infested your head.

[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.080]
Try Charlie's system for just 30 days.

[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.080]
Lots of 30 months.

[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.440]
And after a month of eating all of the way looks and feels and smells.

[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.780]
If you're not getting clawed at and clawed at and just grabbed that, return it for full refund.

[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:46.660]
So you have nothing to lose but that ugly ballspot that makes you look pretty sad and a lot older too.

[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.560]
Call Charlie today, tool free 1-800-321-2413.

[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:59.040]
And tell the Alphair refokes you heard about it here on the New York Roger Show to get you your special $200 discount off the regular $800 price of Charlie's natural hair line system.

[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.960]
Don't forget the secret to a great hair system is make sure that nobody can tell you where it wants.

[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.040]
So if you want something that looks great like real hair, this is the only way to go.

[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.280]
Call Charlie Day Tool Free 1-800-321-2413.

[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.740]
That's 1-800-321-2413 around the web.

[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.940]
It's Charles Alphairi.com.

[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.980]
Your sneaks and real Rogers.

[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.700]
The rest of you on 566-QAM.

[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.560]
I've been given it some stories.

[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.960]
Oh, what I think it is.

[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:35.160]
I know that me and you can do much better go with 6 to 10 and not 5.

[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.420]
I've been given a gentile in the cranky tool.

[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.320]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.640]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.980]
You got to have your weary bed.

[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.480]
Step on to time.

[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.960]
No chance I'll always show it to you.

[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:56.420]
I'd rather die with the crappy tangerz.

[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:03.720]
Why I'll have you know that I'm a big fucking Jew.

[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.560]
A Brooklyn High.

[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:13.220]
I've been raised in high and very funny but you're not my type.

[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.220]
Me and all this crap would blow the way that if we had a fight.

[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.780]
That you'd survive.

[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.660]
You'd wanna hear a gentile and push it tight.

[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.520]
That's crap we just get out.

[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.200]
Stop!

[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:30.940]
Stop!

[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.080]

[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:31.920]

[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:32.080]

[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:32.640]

[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:34.220]

[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:34.720]
Stop!

[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:36.440]

[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.620]
Stop!

[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:39.520]
Stop!

[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:39.520]

[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:39.920]
Stop!

[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.140]
Stop!

[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.440]
Stop!

[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.680]
No, not 5...

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.580]
That's the only UK limit that can get it for later.

[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.800]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.460]
Stop!

[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.240]
Stop!

[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:17.600]
Stop!

[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:18.160]

[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:18.460]

[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:19.420]
Stop!

[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.320]
The first time!

[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.280]
The first time!

[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.420]
11-19 at 5.60 WDQM.

[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:39.040]
We got 265 votes, but evidently, Chip, he was probably the first call of this morning, Chip.

[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:39.500]
What do you think?

[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.620]
What are you eating now?

[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:42.460]
Not more donuts.

[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.040]
No, they sell it from publics.

[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.340]
Oh, a shallad from publics.

[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:45.740]
Well, that's nice.

[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.380]
I bet your old friend, Marc Schullo, would be happy.

[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.220]
Remember the shallad behind?

[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:49.780]
Well, I thought what a hit, salad.

[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:50.980]
Marc Schullo, would a shallad?

[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.320]
Well, we haven't heard from him in a long time.

[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.080]
But see, I don't forget.

[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:53.780]
I don't know.

[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.420]
Anyway, Chip, Vax, isn't says, very sad.

[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.360]
This goes to show you what this is pathetic.

[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.320]
I don't give a crap what anybody says.

[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.240]
I talked about doing this poll last Friday.

[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.420]
I told you I was going to do this.

[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.300]
I don't see anything wrong with this.

[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.620]
He says, Neil, what kind of, what the hell kind of poll is this today?

[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.460]
Why not just ask what flavor, barium, andema did you use today?

[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.040]
Who is responsible for this Schmidt?

[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.680]
God blanked Joyce DeHell, it says.

[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.740]
Well, guess what?

[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.160]
I'm responsible for this.

[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.420]
My idea, if you don't like it, Chip, blow it out your behind.

[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.060]
How do you like that?

[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.040]
Your big fat ass.

[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.480]
That's what's strawberry, by the way.

[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.600]
Yeah, strawberry andema.

[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.940]
I like a poisonberry myself.

[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:30.740]
I know.

[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.760]
What are you all boys?

[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.360]
He was watching you get some Florida.

[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.140]
Just like the very first color this morning.

[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.220]
Yeah, you're going to be my upset.

[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.400]
No, I'm not.

[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.100]
Not the least bit.

[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.220]
Vernon, by the way, who doesn't understand that the Dildo

[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.360]
and the vibrator are the same thing?

[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.700]
What's wrong with Vernon?

[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.740]
What vibrates and what is done?

[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.340]
Well, I mean, we regard this.

[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.840]
Let's not get too deeply into that.

[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.580]
Okay, hey now.

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.700]
But he also says preparation age.

[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.040]
I guess even though there are many of us,

[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:56.360]
he would have preparation age around because life is hand in the butt.

[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:56.800]
Right?

[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.480]
But I guess preparation age would be fine.

[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.280]
Since we're not getting a whole lot of additions of this pool,

[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.220]
and maybe that's because it's such a terrible pool,

[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.580]
it must be Joyce's idea of dang it.

[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.580]
According to Chip, when you grow up already and cut the crap,

[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.560]
Jesus, line nine, you know, this is going to be great.

[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.340]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.900]
Hey, do you know who's going to be great?

[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:13.400]
How are we going?

[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.260]
All right.

[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.020]
I just want to say congratulations for Q-A-M

[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.200]
because the Dauphin Organization blows

[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.540]
and he's a rip of an ass without any repercussions

[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:25.440]
for the management of the Dauphin Organization.

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.040]
That's so rosy, correct?

[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:27.540]
Right.

[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.120]
And good for lot.

[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.740]
I mean, that's the answer.

[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.060]
That's why I'm glad I used to be a Dauphin fan.

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.440]
Good for lot.

[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.160]
Good for lot, just not a lot.

[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.580]
And if that's part of you should learn the people on ClearChannel,

[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.480]
jumping up and down.

[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.720]
Just, you know, who cares about the Dauphin?

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.120]
Wait a minute.

[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.800]
What does ClearChannel have to do with it?

[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.360]
What station are they on that one?

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.380]
No, they're on 790.

[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.600]
They're on that one.

[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.120]
They're on that one.

[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.360]
Certainly shows you like, oh, those A-holes on Q-A-M,

[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.180]
they're on that one.

[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.260]
You know, if they want to dance on your funeral.

[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:57.960]
Yeah.

[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:58.860]
And I'm like, here.

[01:01:59.080 --> 01:01:59.660]
You know what they say?

[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.180]
What shows with those, sir?

[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.340]
What shows are we talking about?

[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.720]
We can name names on this station.

[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.300]
We're talking about a parade.

[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:05.980]
Yeah.

[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.920]
The old Jackass Ron and Paul.

[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.780]
Oh, who cares about that?

[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.720]
Isn't that a joke?

[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.620]
This is a guy that was desperate to get on this radio station.

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.600]
Couldn't get hired if he had a bag of money with him.

[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.380]
Give me a break.

[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.620]
Ron and Paul dancing on our grave.

[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.480]
That'll be the day.

[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.580]
Guess what, Ron?

[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.600]
We still don't want to hear.

[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.320]
How do you like that?

[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.280]
Or Paul?

[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.300]
Or was everyone a Paul?

[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.100]
I can't even separate him anymore.

[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.120]
Old Paul, ancient Ron.

[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.560]
Castron over, man.

[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.940]
We had, remember the Duff Lindsay calls, the PD Lenny calls.

[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.600]
And I got calls up here from PD Lenny.

[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.460]
Oh, what do you think?

[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.260]
That was when we were going through our 85,000 changes in the morning, which is not all that long ago.

[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.880]
Those calls that never actually took place.

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.100]
Right.

[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.060]
Because he never wanted on this.

[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.080]
You're a full of it, man.

[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.480]
You hate clear channel like poison.

[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.980]
Why don't you at least for once in your life tell the truth.

[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.220]
You'll lie and sack a crap.

[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520]
Mr. Ripoff artist.

[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.440]
But anyway, who cares?

[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.840]
As if the Duff and Jorua are success came from.

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:58.100]
Right.

[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.180]
First of all, it's been years since the Duff and Ted A numbers on Sunday because number one they force you to carry him on your FM.

[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.300]
And number two, because every game is televised.

[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.660]
And number three, another on XM or serious.

[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.540]
Who's got it, Miguel?

[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.420]
XM.

[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.260]
Next, M's got all the NFL games on here.

[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.260]
So there's nothing there except a hell of a lot of work.

[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.940]
And you struggle to try to make your money back.

[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.720]
And it's basically a lost leader.

[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:18.840]
So who needs them?

[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.140]
Pack up a salami sandwich, the Duffins, the four and 12 Duffins.

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.980]
Gmail Pornos, okay.

[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.220]
That sounds fine.

[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.080]
Gmail Pornos.

[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:26.440]
Sure.

[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.420]
Somebody faxed in.

[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.320]
Inversing.

[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.340]
Oh, here's a poll suggestion.

[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.400]
Okay.

[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.460]
It says, by the way, have you heard the midday show on 790 with OJ McDuffie?

[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.940]
How would I hear that if I wanted to?

[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.040]
Oh, my God.

[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.920]
Sounds like Michael Irvin on a bad day.

[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.520]
What an abomination.

[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.080]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.780]
That's that stiff competition rough against there on 790, the ticket.

[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.840]
They got the ticket, baby.

[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.920]
They're in a dream world.

[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:48.400]
They're fantasizing.

[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.260]
They're hallucinating.

[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.200]
They're in La La land.

[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.260]
We got Joe Rose.

[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.320]
And now we got the four and 12 Duffins.

[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:56.600]
Okay.

[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.140]
Like I said, all you got is Joe Rose.

[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.580]
I'm never going to knock Joe.

[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.780]
Joe is, we like him.

[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.380]
He's a great guy.

[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.300]
He's good on the air.

[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.080]
He's got a good following.

[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]
That's what they got, period.

[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.640]
I'm not one of these guys that's going to start knocking him just because he went across

[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:07.940]
his street.

[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.700]
In fact, quite frankly, I say more power to him.

[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.320]
I say kudos to Joe.

[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.760]
I like how he was treated.

[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.580]
He was treated.

[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.340]
He was treated not just once, but twice so badly on this radio station that you can't

[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:23.840]
even begin to imagine the way he was treated, which is probably why his sponsors don't

[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.980]
want anything to do with this station.

[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.900]
I can't, I give second thoughts about the other day.

[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.520]
And now I realize what that's all about.

[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.920]
All the lies he was told in the meetings that didn't materialize and he was just being

[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.640]
strung along while they were making the deal to get stern on you in the meantime.

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.940]
And that's where I talk about the stern experiment.

[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.800]
Here's another thing I just finally commented today.

[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:47.580]
Another thing that blew up right in Greg Reed's face, Dan Corporate, okay.

[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.400]
And that is Viabuy of the Duffins.

[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.800]
And they can make up all the stories in the world about where, and like I just said, it's

[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.020]
true as far as the numbers are concerned.

[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.440]
But from a press to East End point, let's face it.

[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.420]
Everything else in sports in his town is like way, way behind.

[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.720]
The offense, the NFL football is head and shoulders above any of the sport.

[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.340]
Not just in this market, but all the markets.

[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.120]
So they can thank the stern decision again for saying Viabuy of the Duffins because that's

[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.840]
what put the nail in the coffin if you recall those ugly days.

[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:14.440]
Yep.

[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:15.760]
Nice going.

[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.540]
And of course, the stern still on the air was it a, what a disaster.

[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.120]
What an absolute, and I tried to tell him, I don't want to keep repeating this every day,

[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.540]
but nobody will listen to old Neil.

[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.240]
He's only been in the market a hundred years.

[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.100]
He's only been around a block what he's made in the X-100 years.

[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.760]
Oh, brother.

[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.140]
Oh, I saw him right here.

[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.200]
What was the expression he was the very jackass kept writing?

[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:38.300]
He was intrigued.

[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.520]
He was intrigued by the idea putting stern, he's intrigued.

[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.260]
Well, how you intrigued are you now, sweetheart?

[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:43.920]
Huh?

[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.340]
I'm actually really intrigued.

[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.820]
Now that you're a paper tiger.

[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.020]
Now he's got to check with Joyce every couple of hours and see which hand he can

[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:50.440]
wipe with.

[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.220]
That's the kind of boss he is now.

[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.080]
Straw boss.

[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.780]
See, we used to think that Duff and parents were the, the, the straw bosses.

[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.380]
They're the straw under boss now.

[01:05:59.060 --> 01:05:59.460]
Get it?

[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.060]
Huh?

[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:00.460]
I'm sorry.

[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.440]
He's got a pecking order.

[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.640]
That's the pecking order.

[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.340]
Get it straight.

[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.040]
Duff.

[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.660]
I, I don't want to see those people.

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.940]
I mean, what they did to me and he, and he comes in this morning and I, I almost fell

[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.340]
off his chair when I heard that voice.

[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.140]
At least give it a couple of days rest so I can like cool down after, after the crap

[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:14.700]
that you pulled.

[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.120]
Oh no, he's got to come right back.

[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.840]
Oh, we're not going to be, we're not going to be a monitor reader doing any dubbing.

[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.460]
Like, as if I don't know if I know that.

[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.880]
Why do you think I'm here this morning?

[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.060]

[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.940]
If you're over 55, yes, not gonna affect you right, but it's not gonna happen anyway

[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:18.920]
They read my lips. It is not going to pass. There was a there was a Chinaman's chance in in a hell that it's gonna pass

Here's a guy he doesn't want to listen to my answer

[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.740]
He wanted my comment, but he just wants to keep repeating the same thing and he is right if you're over 55 if they did pass

[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.600]

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:58.680]
The Roman Catholic Church in Italy has spoken out against what it says are shameful and unfounded lies in the best selling code novel, the Da Vinci code, which means it's all gotta be true. Cardinal, Tarsicio Bertone, Tarsicio Bertone, Archbishop of general, broke the Church's official silence on the controversial book. See, I like it said in words even though I don't know what a lot of them even mean. See, is this something? I don't know. I love that language. You know, I can't speak it. It's story about the Church's depressing the truth that Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene has given as many fans.

[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:28.560]
I think it was with Mary Magdalene, don't you? Who? Mary Magdalene had a suggest cardinal's wife, that would explain a lot. That Republican flunky, that right-wing nut job, but the Cardinal's spokesman denied reports that the clergyman was asked by the Vatican to hit back at the book. They hit us? We hit him back. Carlo Arcolau told the BBC's news website that it had been the Cardinal's own decision to make a public statement about the book. Mr. Arcolau confirmed that the Cardinal told him to tag a newspaper. It astonishes and worries me that so many people

[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:58.540]
believe these lies. I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Arcolau. It astonishes and really, really worries me that so many people believe these ridiculous stories, and that worship an old, daughtering man. I love the story that they had on C in a couple of days ago. The Pope speaks. He actually spoke a couple of words. They showed him sitting in the window there, and he's looking out and he's doing the whole deal with a hand up the armpits, the roasted earring, and on the Pope spoke here that he uttered a word. Yeah, that's right.

[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.220]
is it? Give me a break. The Archbishop told Il Dranali the book is everywhere. There's

[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:06.220]
a very weird risk that many people are reading. We'll believe that the

[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:09.860]
fables it contains are true. Yeah, I know another book like that. The book's

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.960]
publisher's Random House were unavailable for comment. The Da Vinci code by

[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.660]
US author Dan Brown has been a publishing sensation around the world and is

[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.580]
still in Vesella list. It's conspiracy theories and thriller style in which two

[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.500]
codebreakers try to track down the truth behind the Holy Grail have caught

[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.160]
the imagination of millions. I wonder if Monty Python is in this one. You think

[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.760]
Eric Is it? They are. It said to claim is that the Holy Grail is really the

[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.460]
bloodline descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene which the church is

[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.440]
supposed to have covered up along with the female rule and Christianity. Brown

[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.080]
has previously said all of the art architecture, secret ritual, secret

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.980]
societies, all that is historical fact. How do you like that? How do you like

[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.280]
them, Green apples? Tomorrow, Cardinal Bertone will host a seminar called

[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.200]
Stority of Sands Estority, a story without history to rebut the claims. He's

[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.120]
gonna rebut it. Yeah, he said he wanted to unmask the lies. So we just

[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.340]
could see how shamedly unfounded the book was. The Cardinal has been

[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:05.280]
deputied to Cardinal Joseph Raxinger, the man known as the Pope's enforcer, and

[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.140]
a possible successor to the ponder. I wonder how many button-man

[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.420]
of Vatican's got on the street, huh? I know we blot.

[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.480]
The third man wants to be a little Roger's.

[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.560]
Yes, we'll see. On 5.60, I am a.m.

[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:25.820]
Celiana Ross-Latin. And I like rubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap

[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:30.540]
made from jewels and lacing into the near roe, okay? I'm gonna use the

[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:31.780]
hour. Take high a.

[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.920]
The Pope's, my stout. The Pope's, my stout.

[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:41.480]
God, they've been like trash. The Pope's, my stout. He likes it.

[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:46.380]
Stuck in mess. The Pope's, my stout. He's a key. He has a

[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:55.000]
Pope's, my stout. The Pope's, my stout. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.580]
I am a skill in. Take this higher fact. Once in Rome, give

[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:06.000]
him a shot. Don't run bad. Jesus brings out back. Jesus, my

[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.760]
dress is super. Have we never shot a joke? Once in Rome, give

[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.660]
him a load. We've been church-it-truck. The Pope's, my stout.

[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.400]
God, they've been the grass. The Pope's, my stout. He likes his

[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:31.220]
fucking man. The Pope's, my stout. He's a groovy

[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.000]
man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy

[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.700]
man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man.

[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.360]
He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man.

[01:28:59.360 --> 01:28:59.380]
He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man.

[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:01.200]
He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man.

[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:31.180]
He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man.

He's a groovy man. He's a gro

[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:37.540]
He's a groovy man. He makes his neck and eyes the gu сожалению a

[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:43.280]
ส apart in the fog. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy man. He's a groovy��幫

[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:56.940]
it. He's a groovy man. He put it in his pocket. He was like a bark, a letter, you

[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.420]
He's like, if somebody hit you over the head with a baseball bat and you're like, like

[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:09.040]
your skull was cracked open and a blood was pouring all over the floor and then he said,

[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.740]
gee, I'm really sorry I did that.

[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:11.880]
You know what I mean?

[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:12.240]
Okay.

[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.100]
That's him.

[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.460]
Are you hurt?

[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.000]
He survived two days in a concrete hole after falling off a bridge at the port of Miami.

[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:25.320]
Now, David Estegadebia is out of the hospital and talking about how he survived off dirty

[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.760]
water and pigeon blood.

[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.580]
Well, I thought after it said pigeon was going to say something worse than blood.

[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.340]
How did he get that pigeon blood?

[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.960]
Less than two weeks ago Estegadebia fell 40 feet off of bridge in Miami.

[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.200]
Channel 6 reported last Tuesday.

[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:39.540]
But I sure didn't get him out of this.

[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.100]
He was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital yesterday and his doctor said if it wasn't for

[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.840]
his mental strength and ingenuity, he may not have survived at all.

[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.220]
I don't know how I did it.

[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:51.120]
He said, all I know is that during those days I was down there and refused to die, I refused

[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:51.660]
to give up.

[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.920]
Just like us here at WQAM, that's it, David.

[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.080]
Refused to die, refused to throw in the old bloody towel.

[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.240]
Estegadebia said he tried to escape twice by going up an old ladder, but he was so we

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.500]
can readily enter he couldn't do it.

[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.780]
He said he fell 20 feet back to the ground each time.

[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.920]
Just like that.

[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.320]
Estegadebia had a smashed ankle broken ribs and it collapsed lung.

[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:15.100]
The trauma was so severe that the skin actually threw on the inside portion of his ankle, exposing

[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:17.800]
the bone to the air Dr. Raymond Topp said, you.

[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.960]
In and out of consciousness, Estegadebia said he survived by drinking filthy drain water

[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.120]
and pigeon blood.

[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.680]
I hadn't said this before because I didn't know how graphing it would be, but I actually

[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.760]
wanted to drink the blood of a pigeon that I had killed on one of the legends.

[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.260]
He said there was a nest there.

[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.060]
I didn't have any liquid.

[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.260]
I was just so thirsty I needed to drink something.

[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:35.760]
Pigeon blood.

[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:36.740]
Freshly squeezed.

[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:41.480]
Estegadebia was rescued after a pork worker walking by the concrete hole, heard his cries

[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:41.900]
for help.

[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:45.580]
Well, thank goodness for a happy ending, finally, for a story like that with it without the

[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.160]
pigeon blood.

[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:47.280]
All right.

[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.160]
Better pigeon blood than pigeon.

[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.220]
That's what I say.

[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.620]
Well, I hate pigeons, don't you?

[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.400]
Yeah, the nasty.

[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.140]
They sit outside here on my little balcony.

[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.060]
I got a small balcony that would never go out on, but they sit outside and they're

[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.600]
balcony and make those cooling sounds.

[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.020]
Oh, man.

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:02.960]
They are.

[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:03.200]

[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.460]
They know what to get for your birthday next year.

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:05.860]
What's that?

[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:06.420]
Hell it done.

No one-

[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.320]
Why there-

[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.580]
I just allowed my mic in Beader

[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:44.580]

[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:44.580]

[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:49.020]
She went to Pickups

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.040]
I also went to Pickups

[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:00.060]
I also went to Hartford,

[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:00.060]

[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:00.440]
wrote.

[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:01.420]

[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.240]
Yeah, we're seeing them and people were calling when we heard such a thing

[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.760]
Oh, you see everywhere truck notes. You see them all the time down here

[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.500]
When you talking about truck driver and not so you're talking about the drivers are the thing on the back

[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:25.020]
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna have to when I come back to town

[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:28.380]
I got a look for those I never saw those before truck nuts. Do we have any the parking lot?

[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:32.640]
Let me go if Tommy's got him. He's the only truck. I know now and I went when did that start?

[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.120]
We're back home from I apparently started a long time ago and I hadn't noticed it

[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:36.700]
You know how?

[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:40.480]
We missed that exactly. You know what it was like sleeping through disco?

[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.200]
There's a phenomenon when like someone brings your attention something right your attention and all of a sudden

[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:50.680]
You see the line you start seeing everywhere you start looking for nuts. Yeah, like a squirrel truck nuts

[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:54.400]
Okay, that'd be a good way to put it on a writer although I saw one on a car as well

[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.100]
But most of you will see the money trucks

[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:03.140]
And what is the significance of that as it was explained to me it shows that your vehicle has balls. Oh

[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:09.380]
Yeah, yeah, well guess what I got two vehicles. I have really big ones and I have to put any truck

[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.820]
And therefore you must also if your vehicle has a well, I know

[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.460]
70 Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, yeah, how's it going? Okay, palie? Hey listen

[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.740]
I caught that thing a few about a week or so back with Rolls-Stem. It looked like the biggest huge

[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.440]
The weatherman leaving and they had like a plaque for the guy they're all crying at 1130

[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.480]
You have to be kidding. No, and and at silly. What's the name that the woman?

[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.280]
That I don't watch it anyway

[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.660]
But the other thing was they did that a few months ago with Michael Williams and here's a dive

[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:40.780]
He's back. So what is all these people they leave they make a big party from they come back now

[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:46.860]
And also in the dolphins is Jimmy Saffler gonna be one of the broadcasts because that's the same guy to lift that wife at the

[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:50.660]
All through that one time right? Right. That's right. That's the same very simple as that is correct that Jimmy

[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:54.860]
Saffler. Oh Jimmy Saffler is right. Yes. Bye. See you

[01:45:54.860 --> 01:46:02.240]
I remember that I was at I and Z in those days in fact I had Jimmy on a show and then I was a memory

[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.460]
He probably don't get that horrible TV show on Channel 10 for about five minutes

[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.680]
I know because I hit him on my show to promote his TV show they hit me as a guest on that show

[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.000]
Oh, how about that? Well, I've been on some great TV shows. I'll tell you that that old candle to the the

[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.880]
Informersials of Mark Jacobson and get off the late Don Cox

[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.240]
Very sad and the Jimmy Saffler show which I forget what that was a call. Yeah, but he never Jimmy Saffler

[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.680]
You would have her guest on either the Joey Reddlet show or the

[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.260]
No, no, no because the Joey Reddlet show they had a cardboard audience right and the

[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.940]
Rixan show sure I would have been invited when I was out of town

[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.580]
They just had no one during the month that was on here. That was really what was that week or what?

[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:43.120]
There's brother. That was pathetic even Tom jikka said that little time. He called me yesterday at about a minute

[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.260]
Pass to to find out like why isn't invited in the call? He did now how much he's gonna write or not

[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:52.180]
Well, I have to wait and see you know all depending on the Sun sent on how nervous they are these days

[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.980]
How well intimidated they've been?

[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:55.360]
Nobody Q.I.M. Hello

[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.600]
Yeah, I was looking for Neil. You're looking for me. Found him

[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:05.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a West Palm Beach boy. It would be nice to see

[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:12.700]
Got on the dolphin Keith Evans. Yeah, he's Evans. I think he played for Seattle. I know you're not a sports guy

[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.400]
Oh, no, I'm not a sports guy. What do I know about football? That's right

[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.220]
I know

[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:21.880]
Okay, I heard you mentioned he seven was another stricted pre-agent. He's from West Palm Beach

[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.760]
So they'll be a connection and the other thing

[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.900]
Two days ago maybe yesterday you were talking about ponytail

[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.680]
Right I hear the ponytail song sure no problem

[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.020]
I remember when I remember when Jeff Cohen used to be our friend

[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.480]
With

[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:13.100]
Jesus

[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:18.520]
We are fighting, we can see die at where it's right back

[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.960]
It makes you look so sweet, what is love?

[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.780]
It's death, rollin' in, it's ponytail

[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:32.540]
It's a curious ponytail, let's wave with the wiggle when he walks

[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:38.220]
Waves with the wiggle, with the wiggle when he walks

[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.720]
Waves with the wiggle when he walks

[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:45.040]
I'm not a sports guy, I've only got the NFL package

[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.200]
Every game will be Sunday on here and never miss a whole bunch of games

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.320]
But that's okay, I'm not one of those sports nerds

[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.100]
And he's right, I wouldn't know Heath Evans from Dale Evans from Heath bars

[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.040]
But these are good, Palm Beach County boy, why?

[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:56.880]
Heath Ledger

[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.480]
What are you talking about?

[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:00.720]
You just want to hear the Saudi-owned voice now,

[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.440]
We're just mumbling words and names and making guttable sounds

[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.180]
Come on, contribute something important to the show

[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:10.140]
Let's hear about the dolphins now, they're going to go 5-11 this year

[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.420]
They're going to be improvement over the last season

[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.260]
What do you say?

[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:16.020]
Sure, with a quarterback duo like that, they ought to be dangerous

[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.040]
Just for right, you think he's a quarterback but he's not

[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.380]
He is bad man, he is just

[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.080]
Remember when he first came in with redskins, he was going to be the next grade

[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.280]
He was going to be the big deal, the top banana

[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.040]
Turned out to be he ain't even the peel man, he really blows

[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:33.640]

[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:44.700]

[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:44.700]

Coney, don't mess your dick

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:56.760]
David Aronstein, LA journalist and blogger

[01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:00.460]
Clearly, some high-placed individual in the Bush administration was waving him in

[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:03.840]
Whether any sort of other waving went on has yet to be established

[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.360]
Oh, says David Brock found her the group

[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.260]
Media Matters for America, another queen

[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.800]
Which tracks right wing bias

[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:12.860]
I think that's the real number of the issue is that

[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.640]
There wasn't somebody in the White House press room

[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.140]
Who was conservative and asking questions that were loaded

[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:19.520]
It had more to do with the deceptive aspects of it

[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.880]
I don't think anyone would have been able to anticipate that

[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.640]
If Talon is a legitimate news organization

[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.420]
Why not use Guckert's real name and give them a permanent pass

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:29.500]
Complete with an FBI background check

[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.740]
Plain by the rules has worked fine for the DC-based gay press

[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:36.740]
Washington Blague reporter Luchabarro Jr. has had a permanent pass to the briefing room for years

[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:40.940]
I've never been called on by Clinton or Bush in the presidential press conference says to borrow

[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:45.360]
But I'm usually called on by White House press secretary Scott McCullough in during the daily briefings

[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.600]
To borrow ads then McCullough is also answer questions after briefings

[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.300]
Conservative frontets including Anne Colter have been over backward to exploit the gay twist of the story in order to malign Guckert's critics

[01:54:55.300 --> 01:55:00.580]
On CNN's reliable sources John Heinricher, a rep from PowerlineBlog.com

[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:05.720]
The right wing website that was one of the first to question Dan Radd is eventually discredited to report on Bush's

[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.800]
International Guard Service called the exposing of Guckert flat out gay baiting

[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.280]
Clearly any questions regarding gay baiting should be directed at Mr. Guckert himself responds

[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.240]
Erinstein as he did so regularly

[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.060]
Blogger John Erovosness who was on the CNN show with Heinricher also smells hypocrisy

[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:24.600]
The only gay people conservatives are wanting to embrace our Murray Cheney and a hooker

[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.660]
For perhaps someday they'll embrace the rest of us

[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:32.060]
Guckert may need some embracing about now at press time he was trying to suggest his suggestive web addresses

[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:35.300]
Asking 15 grand for hot military studs.com

[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:40.280]
And he takers all how about how many percent maybe 30 cents maybe 50 cents

[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:45.500]
We think okay so I was speaking a 50 cents and this is I mean this story man

[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:49.100]
They're just beating us over that and but but just keep noting we had a car on this earlier

[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:55.740]
Keep noticing I haven't seen one anything today about these seven people I got shot by the good quiet church girl

[01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.380]
And guy in the Milwaukee area in Wisconsin nothing about that but this oh my god

[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:06.560]
It's it's a revelation. It's a religious experience is right yeah Ashley Smith

[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.220]
They had her passed through on they had the altar boys they had oh brother his family

[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:14.560]
I was family right the whole look of the gods of my spa

[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:18.600]
Shackled and surrounded by 19 officers in a cinder block jail room

[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.200]
The suspect in a rampage of up to judge and three others dead appeared before a magistrate today

[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:26.420]
Was informed that authorities plan to charge him with murder excellent fry his ass

[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:29.640]
I'm shocked now his last meal of course will be pancakes with real butter

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.540]
Let's hope oh yeah ain't your mama Brian Nichols appeared before Cobb County magistrate Frank Cox on the same rape

[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:40.720]
Charged he was on trail for a Friday when he escaped from another courthouse Nichols spoke only once at the ring when Cox

[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:46.260]
Accumapant any questions not at this time he said not at this time we're gonna get some more than nice pancakes

[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.220]
Officers lined the walls of the room during today's hearing authority said Nichols had been alone with a female deputy Friday

[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.420]
Did you see that did you see the depiction of that nope he was alone with her he stole her gun

[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:01.920]
And then he shoved her into the cell and locked her up and then he just marched into the courtroom

[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:08.280]
Shot to that the judge presiding over the case and the other two people and a partridge in a paratrooper and then just kind of walked out of the courthouse

[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:14.700]
During the five minute hearing today Nichols Nichols looked straight ahead didn't make eye contact with anybody in the room including the judge when he spoke to him

[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:17.360]
This is the judge the new judge that's alive as a put them all eyes

[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:25.160]
Cox was brought into here the case after all the judges in Fulton County excused themselves because of the relationships with judge Rowland Barnes and the other victims

[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.080]
They brought him in shackles today

[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:35.000]
Maybe they hand him just jammed down jammed up and jelly tight or how about that thing goes I just can't believe that thing about those truck balls

[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:41.300]
What is it truck nuts truck nuts? Oh, I'm sorry truck nuts. Yeah, well whatever they call I remember Ron Tugnut

[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:45.600]
He's a goalie in the NHL if they were to start a play again. How was Panthers doing? Oh, yeah

[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.260]
We love the Panthers will they play again? We'll get you to a broadcast

[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.360]
Oh boy poor guilty. Let's see. Let's take a look at this old guilty. It's preempted

[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.140]
We got you. I'm South Carolina basketball and I T seven tonight

[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.140]
You were listening to me. You were watching

[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:03.440]
I'm gonna be a police commissioner on 560 15

[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.920]
At 2 a.m.

[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.280]
Who's your American either?

[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.200]
It was correct. It's democratic idols

[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:15.560]
I've known you had a set of tracks with a look of knowledge

[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.260]
I just can't believe you're not the police tonight

[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:29.600]
They also want to get off. Yes? Yes?

[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:37.520]
Get off. You ain't seen nothing yet. You ain't seen nothing yet.

[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:46.260]
Do it. Do it. Indeed I did have 200 sexual relationships. Do it. Do it.

[01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:52.970]
Democratic Idol on Fox this fall.

[01:58:56.290 --> 01:59:03.190]
See me for who I really am. Thank you my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

[01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:06.950]
Thank you. 1245. I don't think he's going to be too happy about this latest development.

[01:59:07.090 --> 01:59:10.770]
We got some stiff competition for him. Now that party radio is going off here

[01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:16.450]
and all that great techno pop, Europop, pop in your pants music has disappeared.

[01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:20.670]
Well I mean today's the day we lost a dolphin so it's from that change to my QAM.

[01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:23.670]
Sure. Let's do it.

[01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:27.330]
First time this is good on AM as FM. It's all like muscle down.

[01:59:29.190 --> 01:59:32.390]
Techno. Right? High-pops.

[01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:38.130]
As Noah said, pop goes the reason.

[01:59:54.950 --> 02:00:00.210]
What do you think? About what the original?

[02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:05.070]
Three decades after forming in a double in high school and still on top of the music world

[02:00:05.070 --> 02:00:09.090]
you too was ushered in the rock and roll hall of fame. Oh my God.

[02:00:09.210 --> 02:00:14.830]
joined by the OJ's perfect flage the pretenders and buddy guy. Who the hell is buddy guy?

[02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:20.490]
That guy over there. I know guy Mitchell. Who the hell is buddy guy? Who a big one on it?

[02:00:20.490 --> 02:00:25.370]
Miguel do something worthwhile for once. Buddy guy. When you finish looking up how you spell out 2p

[02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:29.610]
or maybe that maybe that was too pack he put on there. When I'm being embarrassing to find too pack in your house

[02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:32.950]
probably don't spell too good by now. In hours of befitting rock legends

[02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:36.430]
you too's induction came after midnight and this is so fantastic.

[02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:40.950]
Maybe we were to a gusty up crowd at the Waldof history by performing four songs

[02:00:41.490 --> 02:00:46.890]
joined by Bruce Springsteen on I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. Like a voice.

[02:00:47.670 --> 02:00:51.430]
Springsteen recall going with the whose peat towns into check out the competition when

[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:56.750]
you too is performing London Club seeing a lead singer who single-handedly pioneered the Irish Mullet.

[02:00:56.970 --> 02:01:01.950]
What does that mean? Mullet the hairstyle. That's what that means. I thought Mullet was a fish.

[02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:06.950]
Well right it's named after the fish. He pioneered the Irish Mullet. Oh God.

[02:01:07.450 --> 02:01:12.390]
He saved us from this but he described how U2's four parts equaled a much greater hole.

[02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:17.830]
That's what they W and much greater hole and said it was the only band at last 20 years where he knew all four members names.

[02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:22.430]
This was a band that wanted to lay claim to this world and the next one to Springsteen said

[02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:27.050]
Bono the Edge Adam Clayton and Larry Mullin Jr. Our Quirton and Larry Mullet Jr.

[02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:31.610]
are quickly sunday out of Venus for a fall concert tour making U2 one of those rare acts

[02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:35.310]
still to 400 of the music scene at the top of its induction to hollow flame.

[02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:40.890]
U2 hasn't lost its creative edge since forming his teenage years starting with rock anthems like Sunday Bloody Sunday

[02:01:40.890 --> 02:01:44.830]
which was one hell of a bizarre movie with Peter Finch exploring American Roots music,

[02:01:45.150 --> 02:01:48.710]
performing introspective ballads like one and reaching the top with beautiful day.

[02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:52.630]
They suck. They suck. They bite the big one. They are prophetic.

[02:01:53.090 --> 02:01:53.630]
Yeah but they're humble.

[02:01:53.630 --> 02:02:03.570]
Yeah yeah Springsteen Poe and of course Bono wants to be he wants to be like the head of the UN he wants to be of this and I like of course the guy that first put in there who hates the UN.

[02:02:04.530 --> 02:02:08.370]
Springsteen Poe funded Bono, Gene's designer, soon to be World Bank Operator just playing operator,

[02:02:08.590 --> 02:02:11.850]
Salt of the Brooklyn Bridge, soon to be the mastermind of the Bono Berger franchise.

[02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:18.350]
One of the best and most indeeringly naked Messianic complexes in rock and roll springs to the inside it takes one to no one.

[02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:24.770]
Reported retorted Bono born in the USA My Ass that man was born on the north side of Dublin. He's double in his play here.

[02:02:26.190 --> 02:02:33.310]
The OJs of course now there is a group. See the rest of these people we can other than Buddy Guy who's Buddy Guy? Blue guitarist.

[02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:34.310]
Electric Blue.

[02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:35.630]
Don't know.

[02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:43.270]
The OJs are best known for their work with Philly Soul Produces Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff but the gospel style singers are actually from Cantino Highell.

[02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:48.490]
Backstabbers was a huge hit in 1972 along with Love Train and for Love of Money, other one on Song.

[02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:51.630]
Oh it just love love the Love Train and Backstabbers too.

[02:02:52.410 --> 02:02:56.490]
Backstabbers is rated QAMS, that's our theme song. The Backstabs are absolutely.

[02:02:57.250 --> 02:03:03.290]
After Philmclam showed them in wild tusses during the 70s the quartet were simple black suits to perform on medley including each of those songs.

[02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.890]
They were in...

[02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:07.110]
I'm going to be ill.

[02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:12.630]
They were inducted by Singer and they were using the word very loosely Justin Tinkerbell.

[02:03:12.730 --> 02:03:13.810]
Oh my god.

[02:03:14.090 --> 02:03:20.110]
Anyone who's ever written, producer, performed something soulful stands in the shadow of these giants Tinkerbell said. The OJs.

[02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.490]
And he oughta know.

[02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:25.670]
Y'all, is he a music maven or what? Does he know his music or...

[02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:25.790]
No.

[02:03:26.590 --> 02:03:34.190]
How I'm convinced by... he was on something the other day like for about two seconds channel serving and if that is a one little fruit cake I mean one little Tinkerbell.

[02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:36.030]
Am I right? Come on.

[02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:37.570]
A little Tinkerbell.

[02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:42.170]
I mean he never got close enough to Britney to even see what they all look like. Can't give me a break.

[02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:47.730]
Percy Sledge's voice has been the inimitable backdrop to countless Romanic encounters.

[02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:52.490]
The Southern Soul Singer is best known for his 1966 hit when a man loves a woman.

[02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:54.010]
Don't we have a parody on that?

[02:03:54.630 --> 02:03:56.430]
When a man loves a drunken pig or something like that?

[02:03:56.690 --> 02:03:57.270]
No we got it.

[02:03:57.270 --> 02:04:04.270]
When a man is a woman, he gets his dress and women slow.

[02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:09.050]
Well that's a lipstick and put on any hold.

[02:04:09.670 --> 02:04:11.130]
Here we got that. Then we also got it.

[02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:26.090]
When a man loves a drunken pig, he takes this man to be your lawfully wedded husband.

[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:30.910]
Oh I'll be damn straight about to say your word.

[02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:31.090]
Oh Lord.

[02:04:31.190 --> 02:04:37.010]
It's the heartwarming story of a man deeply in love with a woman who can really pound him down.

[02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:38.550]
Oh right you guys.

[02:04:38.730 --> 02:04:40.110]
We're off that pool table.

[02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:41.150]
Bye.

[02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.090]
Bye.

[02:04:44.070 --> 02:04:44.070]

[02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:47.410]
Bucks up.

[02:04:47.410 --> 02:04:49.810]
See when a man loves a drunken pig.

[02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:51.430]
Oh.

[02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:52.630]
Oh honey.

[02:04:52.630 --> 02:04:55.090]
Are you having more casuals?

[02:04:55.730 --> 02:04:56.910]
Oh it's just a surprise.

[02:04:57.090 --> 02:04:57.770]
It means again.

[02:04:58.730 --> 02:05:00.590]
Start Friday at three o'clock is everywhere.

[02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:08.130]
Singer Rod Stewart called a one of the best performances I've ever heard and I'm sure you've ever heard Percy Thlege.

[02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:10.730]
The pretenders come from the same rock generation as you too.

[02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:14.710]
Ohio and native Chrissy Hind has been a tough, pretender role model for women singing,

[02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:17.490]
brass in pocket, precious and back on a chain gang.

[02:05:18.170 --> 02:05:21.150]
The band formed after high-moved, the London would be part of its fertile music scene.

[02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:27.070]
She sold her down with drummer Martin Chambers after guitarist James Honeyman's cut and Pete Farden died as drug casualties.

[02:05:27.650 --> 02:05:30.070]
Drug casualties, or at least how unusual, a drug role.

[02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:33.650]
Yeah, very, very, or a great rarity to understand that.

[02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:35.430]
Anything else in here worth a while?

[02:05:35.630 --> 02:05:35.990]
Probably not.

[02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:36.370]
Oh yeah.

[02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:43.270]
Buddy Guy dominated the Chicago Blues guitar scene and he was offered in the hall by some pretty decent guitar players themselves.

[02:05:43.670 --> 02:05:44.850]
Eric Clapton and BB King.

[02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:48.610]
BB King, he's still a second dead blood sugar man.

[02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:50.910]
He goes home today.

[02:05:51.190 --> 02:05:51.510]
Diabetes.

[02:05:52.130 --> 02:05:53.590]
With his diabetes, that's right.

[02:05:54.490 --> 02:05:58.010]
Musicians, industry professionals and yearnless vote on the inductees.

[02:05:58.290 --> 02:06:01.470]
Hall of Fame members are permanently enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.

[02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:02.670]
Oh, Ohio.

[02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:05.030]
You too, my ass.

[02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:06.450]
That is sad.

[02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:08.890]
5-6-7, what are you playing?

[02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:10.110]
Oh, it was the pretenders.

[02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:11.090]
Oh, the pretenders.

[02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:11.790]
But I was just pretending.

[02:06:12.170 --> 02:06:13.610]
How about the platters and the great pretenders?

[02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:14.310]
Just...

[02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:15.030]
Okay, I'll find it.

[02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:17.690]
What's the most entertaining I embarrassing rather?

[02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:20.010]
I'm embarrassing thing that you could have in your car home.

[02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:21.250]
Some of these could be entertaining.

[02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.990]
571 votes.

[02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:24.650]
Truck nuts, by the way, is still got to be.

[02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:26.110]
I think you just made that up.

[02:06:26.150 --> 02:06:26.530]
That caller.

[02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:31.090]
You should have heard the show because call after another saying, oh, how could you not have seen these?

[02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.950]
They're everywhere.

[02:06:32.370 --> 02:06:33.490]
You guys, you're on truck nuts?

[02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:34.190]
Well, no.

[02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:35.310]
We were just talking about...

[02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:37.930]
No wonder Joyce is all over our house.

[02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:38.330]
Yeah.

[02:06:38.530 --> 02:06:39.250]
I just think on Greg.

[02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:40.190]
Like she hasn't seen them.

[02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:41.330]
I just think on Bluff.

[02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:44.250]

[02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:45.770]

[02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:47.950]

Okay, great he was doing real well that we got to that didn't he?

[02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:34.650]
He said something about Percy was a melon head or something like that now what he said something like it

[02:08:34.650 --> 02:08:39.210]
Something like that. I was speaking a melon head former New York police commissioner Brune Karek

[02:08:39.210 --> 02:08:40.930]
Who looks like a real melon head to me?

[02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:46.330]
Accepted thousands of dollars in royalties from a book published to raise money for the families of heroes killed in 9-11

[02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:47.510]
New York Daily News has learned

[02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:53.750]
Karek contributed an 11 sentence forward to the book of the photographs titled in the line of duty in which he praised police and

[02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:57.470]
firefighters who desperately fought and struggled and bled and died in a noble effort

[02:08:57.470 --> 02:09:02.950]
There is a story beyond words a story of bravery fidelity and sacrifice a story that must ever be forgotten

[02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:12.250]
Karek's royalties on the book have so far told almost $76,000 sources told the news the deal came about when Karek was engaged in the year long affair with the book's publisher

[02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:17.970]
Judas Regan in contrast former fire commissioner Thomas Von Essen who also wrote an introduction to book

[02:09:17.970 --> 02:09:20.510]
Receptive zero is if it he knew not a cent

[02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:25.990]
Von Essen directed Regan books to include his payment in his charitable donation according to publisher's spokesman

[02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:27.210]
How do you like that?

[02:09:27.210 --> 02:09:33.070]

[02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:38.610]
You are listening to Neil Roger

[02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:49.650]
Boy it's the one to two hour good English in a reporter remembers

[02:09:49.650 --> 02:09:51.190]
I'm then rather falling

[02:09:52.530 --> 02:09:57.410]
But I will look back at my long distinguished career as a reporter for CVFU

[02:09:57.410 --> 02:10:03.630]
I can assure you that every fact and tonight's tribute has been checked and we checked by our CVS names

[02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:05.750]
Prodigies the best of the business

[02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:09.790]
My story begins in a small town in Texas

[02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:17.370]
Where I was born the son of a poor black sharecropper as captain of the football a small and ice-hucking

[02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:23.670]
I graduated Magnum signal super com laude after graduating with the top of my class at Harvard

[02:10:23.670 --> 02:10:28.950]
I joined the army and earned several purple hearts, which I later asked John Kerry to throw away for me

[02:10:30.150 --> 02:10:39.190]
After touring China as a ping pong master I returned home to run across the country twice invent the smiley face and start a large shrimp company with my army buddy

[02:10:39.190 --> 02:10:40.210]
Luke Tenet man

[02:10:41.050 --> 02:10:47.910]
I purchased CVF's in my name is sixty-two and hired myself as a reporter after the death of Walker Crunkat in

[02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:54.850]
1992 I ascended to the throne anchor of CVS even years within where I remained until I

[02:10:54.850 --> 02:11:03.910]
Alone made the decision to step down after I was Duke by my producer into airing a false report which I wrote and now as I pass along

[02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:10.290]
The torch lit by the likes of Crunkat and Merle do another battled hard and journalist probably Katie Kirk

[02:11:10.290 --> 02:11:12.350]
I lived with one word

[02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:15.130]
a rich and two words

[02:11:15.810 --> 02:11:20.230]
Bites me and that's part of our world the part that brings

[02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:23.430]
Come down brother

[02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:24.550]

102 at 560 just come down to any boy

[02:11:28.210 --> 02:11:33.010]
Here's a fact from Alex chronic Alex who says hey, no, I believe the show Jimmy several was on back in the day

[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:39.070]
It was called PM magazine no because it was not a PM show was a morning show was like 11 o'clock in the morning 10 o'clock

[02:11:39.070 --> 02:11:41.830]
Something like that nice tri Alex. How about an up dog bits?

[02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:42.530]
I hope you know

[02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:46.950]
That kind of inspired me the one I was talking about first he slides in the

[02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:54.110]
Probably had with the fruits, but that would be a good pull to take somebody who belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

[02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:55.530]
Who hasn't been in there?

[02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:59.030]
Okay, but the problem is I just did Google on it

[02:11:59.030 --> 02:12:04.090]
Mm-hmm and it's got like the inductees for this year, which I just got to tell you and the inductees for 2004

Hmm now you know it's got to be under summer. It's on their own find it. Find it. Please pretty please

[02:12:12.450 --> 02:12:15.950]
That'd be good pull that sure be better than the one that Joyce is gonna try to make his due tomorrow

[02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:21.510]
Whatever that would be right I have no doubt have to be a humongous improvement over that Joyce bitch

[02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:24.430]

[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:24.110]
joys and bluff

[02:14:24.110 --> 02:14:25.130]

like senior wednesday in the little you know like a little doll in in dust pocket

[02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:33.290]
you know

[02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:36.890]
which quite frankly like a crush it because he hates them like poison and is

[02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:39.630]
very bitter about the fact that he lost a big chunk of his salary

[02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:42.350]
because they made the clearance into the sports program to read the

[02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:43.930]
you know the pd cuz he's a sports nerd

[02:14:44.490 --> 02:14:48.910]
but nevertheless it's always the two of them on the phone in the studio side by

[02:14:48.910 --> 02:14:50.850]
side like they're joy like simeis twins

[02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:54.090]
you know that i have a lot of yeah right that's obvious

[02:14:54.090 --> 02:14:56.390]
i want you to say i want to make sure video a

[02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:58.550]
good inflatable black sheep

[02:14:58.550 --> 02:15:01.710]
and he was the black sheep make no mistake about that

[02:15:01.710 --> 02:15:02.970]
w.a.m. hello

[02:15:03.690 --> 02:15:04.950]
a meal yes sir

[02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:09.330]
you saw a little bit of my thunder and one of your previous segments about that

[02:15:10.490 --> 02:15:10.970]
uh...

[02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:11.370]
prisoner that

[02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:13.970]
got that guards gun and killed all the people in the

[02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:17.690]
vehicles yes you got to know his name and brine nicles he's a superstar now

[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:19.150]
yeah i actually smith

[02:15:19.150 --> 02:15:22.090]
don't you think that the prison system like that would have

[02:15:22.090 --> 02:15:26.030]
some sort of protocol where they're transferring a prisoner into court with

[02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.310]
all the

[02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.490]
now

[02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:30.970]
on the news last night they were interviewing a lot of people who will work in

[02:15:30.970 --> 02:15:33.470]
the land court house they were all bitching and screaming and moaning about

[02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:36.590]
they've got the worst security and citizen creation embarrassment and it's

[02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:39.810]
always been that way and so now the focus of course the spotlight is on them

[02:15:39.810 --> 02:15:42.470]
so for a while to make it look like you know but they've always been very

[02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:47.390]
like that ridiculous the walk walk a prisoner into court like that when

[02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:49.410]
everyone else that goes into court has to go through

[02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:53.810]
uh... the metal detectors and the gun screeners and it's ridiculous and that

[02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:54.250]
would have

[02:15:54.250 --> 02:15:56.770]
by putting them in shackles that would have never happened

[02:15:56.770 --> 02:15:58.990]
yeah well they did today needless to say

[02:15:58.990 --> 02:16:02.350]
all absolutely they did it today and i'm with i think that i'm not going to

[02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:06.470]
bring those dead people back with me i'd like to judge no it's not but it's

[02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:10.150]
gonna change the protocol that they that they work by and in that state and

[02:16:10.150 --> 02:16:12.810]
and probably down you know and that everyone else is still

[02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:16.250]
and by the way since they're all what's up about actually smith and what a

[02:16:16.250 --> 02:16:19.810]
hero she is yeah where was where was god when he was been shooting all these

[02:16:19.810 --> 02:16:20.470]
innocent people

[02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:24.090]
hope that our house read the bible man must have been actually the good news

[02:16:24.090 --> 02:16:27.530]
all right spread the good news i've got protected all those other people that

[02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:31.850]
didn't get that's right that's right for example five six seven oh five

[02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:34.990]
and come to find out that she's i don't know what i did with that sir i think i

[02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:39.550]
smith can't it rightfully so but she uh... had a very as a teenager she was like uh...

[02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:42.650]
i'd take me for a record press a very checkered past

[02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:47.330]
battery she was arrested for battery a speeding with nobody deal but but just a

[02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:50.710]
whole bunch of stuff she was a teenage a piece of turd is what she was

[02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:53.270]
but then she found the lord and so now let's

[02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:56.870]
meet her pastor and the author of this best-selling New York Times book

[02:16:56.870 --> 02:17:02.130]
and let's talk about god oh god give me a break man you people in a mass media

[02:17:02.130 --> 02:17:05.310]
would talk about a sellout i know what to the biggest sellout to and of course

[02:17:05.310 --> 02:17:09.070]
you see the interesting tie in there between George w and the god squad is

[02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:14.390]
they're all the same bunch totally sold out or speak of that like in here this for

[02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:19.210]
readers of the bible confused by its archaic language such as its use of the

[02:17:19.210 --> 02:17:23.650]
term stone for a former execution rather than the effects of smoking dope help

[02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:24.250]
at hand

[02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:27.650]
it's like that that we got about that you can get so twice in one night

[02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:32.730]
one of the world's most widely read by both the new international version has

[02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:36.670]
been modernized by team of fifteen american british scholars and is published today

[02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:37.430]
yeah

[02:17:38.810 --> 02:17:40.170]
your hand on the good book

[02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:44.790]
gone is the word aliens which the academic style isn't very likely associated

[02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:48.590]
the minds of the average generation with extra terrestrial's it is replaced with

[02:17:48.590 --> 02:17:49.610]
for a nurse

[02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:50.990]
you know them for a nurse

[02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:55.550]
like you guys for example both right well not me go well he's still for

[02:17:55.550 --> 02:17:59.970]
even the term saints is deemed to be too ecclesiastical and has been banished to be replaced

[02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:05.210]
with gods chosen people the virgin Mary is no longer with child she is pregnant pregnant

[02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:09.330]

[02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:37.200]
that it wasn't rock and roll that he was a folk ballad singer something like that you know there's

[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:37.740]

[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:44.600]
springfield oh 67 i'm way off what do you plan oh and it's another wreck way this one's by humber

[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:54.680]
dink that's inkelberg humber dink the composer not the modern singer

[02:25:56.100 --> 02:26:01.220]
february 1867 it was uh let's see seven weeks uh let me wait for the chart right at number seven

[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:05.420]

cousin the Abraham Solomon it's other performers Steven stills neo-deon Richard for a bruised palm

[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:36.020]

[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:40.860]
buffalo springfield therefore they were inducted in the rock and roll hall of fame in 1997

[02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:30.830]
Come baby

[02:32:31.930 --> 02:32:32.990]
Overpeend the Frozen

[02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:34.210]
Huh, type with shabby

[02:32:34.210 --> 02:32:39.190]
Now noise

[02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:46.670]
Sup

[02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:13.110]
I grab a weighty nose down on a hot summer day, cause the AC don't work no way.

[02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:19.350]
The sweaty pressure of our seats comes to smell and gets the dusty work in the whole day's time.

[02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:27.570]
I'm a back-to-be-five, the shiny graphics smell like live, and it's my coffee-genic due to the sudden Washington quit on the road.

[02:33:28.210 --> 02:33:33.750]
The whole day, we're over the Democratic Jerry Jerry.

[02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:36.010]
The AC don't work no way.

[02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:40.530]
I will shop at you, going over to people things.

[02:33:41.430 --> 02:33:44.230]
The AC don't work no way.

[02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:49.190]
First of all, it's the area we fancy to be busy to the whole day.

[02:33:52.470 --> 02:33:54.270]
26-year-old Phil Mojaro David.

[02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:57.010]
The former force of the dolphins coming along at 2 o'clock.

[02:33:57.010 --> 02:33:59.490]
Like I said before, there's official day in case you missed it.

[02:33:59.870 --> 02:34:03.550]
790, the ticket-waxy ESPN used to be where we're not in any more radio.

[02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:11.090]
They got the dolphin broadcast, which means our talk people, our sports talk people, are going to be traction-dolphin-organization like they deserve it or so.

[02:34:11.410 --> 02:34:14.170]
So I can tell you, no more restraints, take off the restraints.

[02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:17.830]
Speaking of turd and assess pool, that's dark times.

[02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:19.790]
I realize that Miguel, first of all, don't want to hear this.

[02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:23.590]
And you especially don't because it's from Cabernet Hillbob, not Blue Dot.

[02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:24.590]
Oh, yeah, I hate that site.

[02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:27.450]
The rant, Doug Thompson. He's the best. He's my new hero.

[02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:31.230]
Another turd and assess pool. That's the headline. It's on our website.

[02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:34.170]
Or at least it will be when Josh gets out of jury duty.

[02:34:34.570 --> 02:34:36.110]
Is this just going to be a one-day deal? Do we know?

[02:34:36.370 --> 02:34:36.810]
Should be.

[02:34:37.430 --> 02:34:42.870]
For people with a modicum of intelligence, the question has never been asked whether or not Tom Delay is a crook.

[02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:47.870]
How anyone with an IQ above that of an average plant knows the Texas Republican is on the take always has been.

[02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:55.730]
The only real question is how long it will take brain-dead Republicans to finally admit their scandal scarred house majority later is a political liability last to go.

[02:34:56.130 --> 02:35:05.670]
House figure Dennis Haster, dispirited in a polling campaign to protect Delay at all cost, even with mounting evidence that this typical Texas good old boy politician is for sale to the highest bidder.

[02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:14.770]
By doing so, Haster, and his politics above honesty policies, proves the GOP is just as corrupt as they look the other way political machines that have controlled Congress since the horse in buggy days.

[02:35:15.290 --> 02:35:29.670]
Delay's sorted reputation already swirled by a grand jury investigation into his influence peddling and money laundering schemes took another hit last week for the revelations that he is family and staff took a $70,000 pay off from Indian gambling interest for his help in killing legislation they didn't like.

[02:35:30.330 --> 02:35:39.150]
In typical Delay style, the lobbyist laundered the money through the right wing national center for public policy research which then used the funds to pay for a junk at the Scoutland for Delay's family and staff.

[02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:44.370]
Powerful Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff also under investigation for influence peddling arranged the trip.

[02:35:44.730 --> 02:35:54.070]
When confronted with a new allegations, Delay pulled a Michael Jackson publicity diverting stunt, checking himself into a Bethesda medical center for what is staff called minor fatigue and heart irregularity.

[02:35:54.210 --> 02:36:01.770]
That brought a lot of chuckles from Washington insiders, Tom Delay can't have a heart condition Joff won lobbyist because in order to have a heart condition more must first have a heart.

[02:36:02.270 --> 02:36:14.630]
After and his minions have tried everything to protect on Delay from the inevitable, reading the House Ethics Committee of any Republican within a ball is to question the majority of the U.S. crimes and ramming through new rules that will script the committee of any power to take action even if they find wrong doing.

[02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:24.850]
Meanwhile, back in Texas, Travis County prosecutor Ronnie Earl has delaying his sights. With indictments of three delay competence already in this pocket, Earl says he'll follow the truth wherever it leads.

[02:36:24.850 --> 02:36:33.910]
This isn't about politics, Earl said it isn't about Democrats and Republicans, it's about cops and robbers and the abuse of power. Unfortunately, it's all about politics and the abuse of power.

[02:36:34.090 --> 02:36:42.090]
The Republican leadership in the House will use all the politics it can to protect Tom Delay and the House Speaker, then the statute will continue to use the power of his office to protect his deep henchmen.

[02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:50.170]
Tom Delay ain't the only thing that stinks in the Pukrid Cesspool called the Congress of the United States. He just happens to be the most current turd to bubble up to the surface.

[02:36:50.170 --> 02:37:02.450]
You perks, you know what I mean about Doug Thompson, you'll mess with him, he's the best, he's great, but that is great. Even though it is on Capitol Hill's view like Tom, a website that you for some bizarre reason have nothing but hate and revolts high or that's it.

[02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:09.150]
Boy, can you imagine the number of names where you have like we might have to do a four part around that thing. It's supposed to be really upset about that.

[02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:16.230]
A lot of great people in groups that should be in there, but are not. I think Jan and Dean belong and everything now that I think about it, I think I was right.

[02:37:16.350 --> 02:37:22.070]
Sure, why not? I mean, it couldn't sing a lick, but they had a lot of big hits. Isn't that what it's all about? I got issues with some of these other people.

[02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:28.570]
Let's take a look at some of the ones that are in there. I don't want to like tip all, huh? Clyde McFatter.

[02:37:29.090 --> 02:37:35.750]
Hey, don't be not in Clyde McFatter, baby, that's before your time 50s, he was great. No kidding. He was. Well, she loved me.

[02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:49.390]
Labyrinth Bakers. Who? Labyrinth Bakers. Well, that's that's old old. That's also 50 stuff. Hank Ballard. Hank Ballard, the Midnighters, baby. In fact, didn't Hank Ballard? What was he? What do you do? The twist before Chubby Checker? I don't know.

[02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:57.350]
Why why are you going to be doing this today? This is tomorrow's show and now you got me just like the audience. I'm always knocking in for like doing stuff for the next days.

[02:37:57.350 --> 02:38:10.850]
He's pulled and now you're doing the same thing to me. Harold Ballard, former owner of the Maple Leafs, finger-popping time. The twist. There we are. Tonya. Okay, good. All right. Now let's see. Wait a minute. When did Chubby Checker do the twist? Let's see who had it voiced.

[02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:22.570]
I mean, when anybody if you said the twist, would anybody say, Hank Ballard, Midnighters? No. No, they say Chubby Checker. Now Chubby Checker's got to be in there, right? Chubby Checker is not in the Hall of Fame. He's not.

[02:38:22.570 --> 02:38:34.690]
Ah! And Hank Ballard in the Midnighters is R and oh my God, that's enough to make me want to puke. How about the Suhi, Ertagund? Look at all the hits Chubby Checker head.

[02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:49.190]
Now let's see, 860, just a minute. And 718, there are no wait, and 829. So he beat him by like three weeks. Chubby Checker beat Harold Ballard in a minute. And anyway, look at that. The Hucklebuck Pony time. Let's twist again. The fly.

[02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:56.530]
They released the twist again in 61 and went to number one for two more weeks. Limbo Rock. Just a whole list of stuff here.

[02:38:57.110 --> 02:39:03.830]
And Harold Ballard in the Maple Leafs and Hank Ballard in the Midnighters. They had the finger poppin time, covered the twist and had a big hit on it.

[02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:11.190]
Let's go, let's go, let's go. The Hootsie Cootsie Crew. Let's go again. The cut in a walk in a switcher room. The swisher room. Some kind of...

[02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:13.750]
Yeah. To me. Kidney. You're right.

[02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:22.150]
I think we need a lawsuit on this. Don't you? Let's have some justice, baby. Let's have Larry Justice. Let's have him drag his old ass back into it. What do you say?

[02:39:23.410 --> 02:39:26.530]
Oh, here we go. He's old enough to remember all of these things.

[02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:30.650]
You're a senior of Peter Rogers. The rest of you can run, dude.

[02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:32.630]
You're a am.

[02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:42.710]
Your butt is wrecked. You've seen his film. You'll even purchase the dayglow velvet memorial paintings at the gas station. As a true Elvis fan, you'll think you've heard it all. But wait, there's more.

[02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:49.490]
Now you can buy secret recordings of Elvis's last telephone conversation. Yes, it's the Elvis tapes.

[02:39:49.710 --> 02:39:56.450]
Hello, baby. This is Elvis. I want you to come over right now and take me a big peanut butter and then a sump.

[02:39:57.610 --> 02:40:00.730]
A big little butter and then a sump. I'm really good with the diet.

[02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:03.910]
You'll hear Elvis in his most intimate moments.

[02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:06.370]
All of these are my pieces of Elvis. The other is the Elvis.

[02:40:08.010 --> 02:40:14.950]
I want you to bring over a couple of large cars. Don't make it three. Don't make it six. Double cheers.

[02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:20.970]
Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm a little bit hungry.

[02:40:22.690 --> 02:40:26.930]
And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life.

[02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:28.790]
I want you back. I want you back in my life, baby.

[02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:33.230]
I want you to wait back. Would you pick up some donuts, please?

[02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:36.430]
Make your drink, don't.

[02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:39.870]
Crullest genius day this too.

[02:40:41.490 --> 02:40:45.890]
I love my baby honey glows, don't. Without them, I can't do.

[02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:47.730]
The Elvis tape.

[02:40:49.690 --> 02:40:51.550]
Available now. We run stores everywhere.

[02:40:52.470 --> 02:40:55.350]
I love you. I love you. I love you.

[02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:58.010]
We've got two and we've got most ended by two of Mad Dog at four.

[02:40:58.130 --> 02:41:01.010]
And then you have basketball and I see you. I'm in South Carolina at seven.

[02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:04.870]
For life of me, I just don't understand little Willie John.

[02:41:05.490 --> 02:41:10.370]
Hey, I mean, he had, you know, a hit on fever in 1956, but that was a middle of his smash.

[02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:14.190]
I mean, little Willie John is an obscure as a poopy compo.

[02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:17.210]
I say it's politics, man. You know what it is?

[02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:20.150]
Well, little Willie John, what kind of politics did he have going on?

[02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:21.910]
Who knows what he alerts?

[02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:25.050]
I mean, what is his crap? Wait till tomorrow.

[02:41:25.410 --> 02:41:27.910]
Right. Now, let me ask you, the Del Vikings on here.

[02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:31.830]
Oh, and the Del's are on here, of course, but not the Del Vikings.

[02:41:33.370 --> 02:41:35.450]
Oh, good. Golly Miss Molly.

[02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:38.530]
These people must have musical taste in their tush.

[02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:43.770]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the Verizon Singular wireless lines.

[02:41:44.190 --> 02:41:45.810]
Those phones are just smoking, aren't they?

[02:41:46.490 --> 02:41:47.650]
Don't you Q.A.M. Hello?

[02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.730]
Charm, butter.

[02:41:48.730 --> 02:41:49.750]
Yes, see what I mean?

[02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:52.190]
I don't think I want him on no more.

[02:41:52.330 --> 02:41:54.390]
You know what I'm saying? I'm just really tired. What's his name again?

[02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:57.570]
Yeah. Well, that was actually someone pretending to be here.

[02:41:57.690 --> 02:41:59.910]
No, no, that was him. Oh, no, that was trust me.

[02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.870]
Dero Dero Dero Noski.

[02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:03.190]
Who is it? Dero Dero Noski.

[02:42:03.370 --> 02:42:03.870]
Oh, Dero Noski.

[02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:04.370]
Oh, Dero Noski. We're tired of you.

[02:42:04.450 --> 02:42:05.390]
And we're not going to put it on you.

[02:42:05.490 --> 02:42:07.230]
We've got 17.85 second delays.

[02:42:07.450 --> 02:42:09.310]
Okay. So we're just really sick and tired of you.

[02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:11.270]
Just, you know, somebody other idiots we don't care.

[02:42:11.450 --> 02:42:12.770]
But in your case, get a life.

[02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:15.710]
Go back to your security guard, watch guard, house or whatever you're doing.

[02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:17.290]
Your dog, house and get lost.

[02:42:17.850 --> 02:42:19.010]
How many QAAM, hello?

[02:42:19.470 --> 02:42:20.430]
Thank you, Neil God.

[02:42:21.010 --> 02:42:21.830]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:25.470]
Hey, buddy guy, I drove him in a town car in Murdo Beach.

[02:42:25.610 --> 02:42:27.470]
Very, very cool, Oki guy.

[02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:29.430]
When he was a kid, he got himself some chili.

[02:42:29.930 --> 02:42:30.110]
Who?

[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:33.830]
Opened it house of blues for James Brown, the blues brothers.

[02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:34.230]
Who?

[02:42:34.750 --> 02:42:34.990]
Who?

[02:42:35.810 --> 02:42:36.050]
Who?

[02:42:36.350 --> 02:42:37.390]
It was very cool.

[02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:38.250]
Very cool guy.

[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:38.810]
Oh, buddy guy.

[02:42:39.370 --> 02:42:40.830]
Everybody got him.

[02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:44.070]
But it's just like BB King, another funky diabetic.

[02:42:44.470 --> 02:42:45.310]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:45.950]
There you go.

[02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:47.870]
He's, he's, he's stabbing it right now, man.

[02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:50.590]
He's stabbing it four or five times an hour.

[02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:51.770]
And his finger too.

[02:42:52.170 --> 02:42:54.090]
Five, six, seven, oh, buddy guy, he was talking about.

[02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:54.910]
That's the reason we didn't recognize it.

[02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:56.230]
Because we didn't know who he was before.

[02:42:56.330 --> 02:42:57.110]
We still don't know who he is.

[02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:58.310]
And quite frankly, we don't care.

[02:42:58.390 --> 02:43:00.790]
Not that we want to be disrespectful, but we just don't care.

[02:43:01.630 --> 02:43:02.270]
WQAM, hello?

[02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:03.090]
Hi, Neil.

[02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:03.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:05.170]
Hey, I got one for the poll.

[02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:07.530]
My smelly old mother-in-law.

[02:43:07.890 --> 02:43:08.690]
Your mother-in-law?

[02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:09.330]
That's excellent.

[02:43:09.470 --> 02:43:09.670]
Okay.

[02:43:10.750 --> 02:43:12.590]
My mother-in-law is fantastic.

[02:43:12.990 --> 02:43:15.090]
That's going to go zooming up the list, don't you think?

[02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:16.070]
Yeah.

[02:43:16.430 --> 02:43:17.390]
Get out of here.

[02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:19.070]
Absolutely, man.

[02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.910]
My mother-in-law.

[02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.270]
Absolutely.

[02:43:20.610 --> 02:43:21.170]
You watch.

[02:43:21.570 --> 02:43:23.770]
You mark, mark it down right now, right on your wrist.

[02:43:23.970 --> 02:43:24.470]
I'll mark it down.

[02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:27.390]
Put it on the list you got there with that rock and roll hall of fame craft for tomorrow.

[02:43:27.930 --> 02:43:29.110]
Now, let me see the Del Vikings.

[02:43:29.350 --> 02:43:31.230]
I want to write down some of my own on this list.

[02:43:31.650 --> 02:43:34.670]
Because that's just, it's just ridiculous on the face of it, man.

[02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:35.730]
Now, it rages.

[02:43:36.270 --> 02:43:36.810]
You don't think?

[02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:37.830]
I do.

[02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:39.710]
I mean, this is important heavy-to-be stuff.

[02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:42.290]
This is the music of our lives, man.

[02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:43.510]
This is important.

[02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:44.550]
Just ask me.

[02:43:44.610 --> 02:43:45.110]
I'll tell you.

[02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:46.590]
W.A.M. Hello.

[02:43:46.930 --> 02:43:47.690]
Hey, I'm Neil.

[02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:48.310]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:48.330 --> 02:43:50.410]
I sure enjoyed your show over the years.

[02:43:50.690 --> 02:43:54.950]
And I'd like to say a quick excerpt from a song just to hope that it cheers up your day for you.

[02:43:55.010 --> 02:43:55.430]
No thanks.

[02:43:55.930 --> 02:43:56.790]
W.A.M. Hello.

[02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.710]
Neil.

[02:43:58.210 --> 02:43:58.490]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:00.490]
Hey, George there?

[02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:02.870]
Yeah, he's here.

[02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:04.310]
I sent him an envelope last week.

[02:44:04.410 --> 02:44:04.810]
Did he get it?

[02:44:04.850 --> 02:44:06.490]
Well, my Jesus prayer rod?

[02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.630]
Yeah, I got it.

[02:44:07.650 --> 02:44:08.850]
It doesn't matter if I could plug it up on the wall.

[02:44:08.850 --> 02:44:10.130]
Okay, pretty funny, huh?

[02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:10.970]
I like it.

[02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.470]
I posted it.

[02:44:11.470 --> 02:44:12.110]
Did you see what it says?

[02:44:12.270 --> 02:44:12.790]
You stare at it.

[02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:14.950]
I'm not just thinking about the guy with Jesus.

[02:44:15.350 --> 02:44:15.830]
Yeah, okay.

[02:44:15.970 --> 02:44:17.070]
Well, I go to people with houses.

[02:44:17.290 --> 02:44:19.690]
I go to these old people with houses and I see him hanging up once in a while.

[02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:20.210]
Yeah.

[02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:22.590]
Well, it's kind of leaves something on the radio.

[02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:24.810]
It kind of leaves a little bit to be interpreted, you know?

[02:44:25.310 --> 02:44:25.930]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.590]
What do you say?

[02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:27.790]
I don't know what he's talking about.

[02:44:28.090 --> 02:44:30.270]
I'm saying that it doesn't translate well to people.

[02:44:30.470 --> 02:44:32.570]
It doesn't work real well on the radio is what I'm saying.

[02:44:32.810 --> 02:44:33.730]
Well, let me hold it up to the microphone.

[02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:34.890]
Yeah, hold it up to the mic.

[02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:37.010]
And then tell him to call you at home in a two-minute,

[02:44:38.850 --> 02:44:39.550]
and he'll be waiting for you.

[02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:39.850]
What do you say?

[02:44:39.850 --> 02:44:40.350]
How many QAMs?

[02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.550]

[02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:41.610]
Very Neil.

[02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.370]
Yes, sir.

[02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:43.530]
How are you doing, man?

[02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:44.090]
Good.

[02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:51.330]
Hey, I know you have no topic, but I know it's kind of fallen under the radar, but I

[02:44:51.330 --> 02:44:54.790]
do feel like you're going crazy about that Terry Shivell.

[02:44:55.710 --> 02:44:56.950]
I talked about that before.

[02:44:57.290 --> 02:44:57.970]
I actually want to go on.

[02:44:58.050 --> 02:44:58.370]
I'm sorry.

[02:44:58.650 --> 02:45:01.070]
I would be like, they're rushing to pass all this freaking registration.

[02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:03.970]
It's like, what about all these abused kids at home?

[02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:05.270]
I mean, it's correct for you.

[02:45:05.270 --> 02:45:05.610]
Hey, listen.

[02:45:05.810 --> 02:45:07.150]
I don't care about abused kids.

[02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.230]
I don't care about abused kids.

[02:45:07.470 --> 02:45:08.090]
Think about anybody else.

[02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:09.510]
I don't care about his Terry Shivell.

[02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:11.670]
She's the post-it-child forward to stick to tune.

[02:45:12.130 --> 02:45:16.690]
I mean, I've been sitting back, like, washing with absolute disgust.

[02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:17.390]
You just have me.

[02:45:17.810 --> 02:45:19.690]
The direction that this country has been going,

[02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:21.890]
unless the four years ago is correct.

[02:45:21.890 --> 02:45:23.070]
That's the whole of the correction.

[02:45:23.330 --> 02:45:23.510]
Yes.

[02:45:23.850 --> 02:45:31.650]
Just the overall feeling of just incolourants, you know, those disguised as, you know,

[02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:33.630]
four, thinking, people, these right-wingers.

[02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:35.550]
I still see tons of bush stickers on.

[02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:39.790]
And I've nothing but the intent for these people. I mean I know like I said I know spawn is a radar

[02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:44.510]
But every way she would go out and rerid or buy a copy of fair night 9 9 11

[02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:51.510]
Yeah, and just refresh all your memories. Yeah, maybe one of my 1984 by George Orwell to the movie and the book and take a picture of those two

[02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:53.470]
I was quite a good pair all my friends

[02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:56.650]
When you go to Amsterdam, and if it's a lot easier brother

[02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.530]
Oh

[02:46:00.910 --> 02:46:04.970]
Brother and they're really just amazing to you don't you just find it astonishing?

[02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:10.190]
Remember a rough Edwards in that TV show for 100 years ago. This is your life

[02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:14.730]
And of course that describes this show for so many of you this is your life. I have no life

[02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:20.410]
560
