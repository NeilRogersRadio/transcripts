[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.980]
So, what's getting into talk show business?

[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.240]
Well, not him, who's that?

[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.420]
Clinton?

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.300]
Really?

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.280]
Bill Clinton?

[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.600]
I didn't hear that.

[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.800]
It's a story in New York Post today.

[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.420]
Says that according to Harry Thomason, he's been talking with Clear Channel about starting a new show.

[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.260]
Great.

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.560]
And I guess it would go on after Rush.

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.380]
Hmm.

[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.220]
That'd be interesting.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.740]
Yeah.

[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.080]
I sure hope he does a better number than Bill Orrime does in this market that big.

[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.720]
Oh!

[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.380]
That he got.

[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.940]
Clinton did it.

[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.260]
That's interesting.

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.060]
He just had, he's made no impact on radio and software.

[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.320]
He doesn't even crack the, you know.

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.560]
I didn't even know he was on here.

[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.880]
Yeah.

[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.700]
Well, there you go.

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.000]
No, there's anybody else.

[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.460]
I guess.

[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.000]
But, how do you think Clinton would be as a talk master?

[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.200]
I don't know.

[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.340]
It's just, uh, who knows?

[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.420]
Every, remember, Mario Cuomo tried it.

[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.560]
Most politicians, I mean, he's, you know, he's fascinating for a little while, Clinton,

[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.800]
but I just, I don't know.

[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.460]
Personally, I don't, I don't listen to talk shows myself.

[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.760]
You know what, Clinton is a great interview.

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.520]
Yeah.

[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300]
Well, too bad we can't get somebody great to interview him.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.600]
The fact that, uh, that you're a great interview doesn't make you necessarily a great talk show guy.

[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.920]
Right.

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.060]
But every time I've heard him interview, he's brilliant.

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.700]
Yeah.

[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.980]
I like when he gets PO that's immediate.

[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.080]
That's my favorite.

[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.840]
Yeah.

[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.160]
I remember a couple of interviews he did.

[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.260]

[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.740]
I think with a British medium just, uh, went off the deep end.

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.740]
It was great.

[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.220]
Yeah.

[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.320]
And then, deservedly so.

[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.500]
Especially when you see what we got now, what's going on in the world right now.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.480]
And this guy was put through the ringer over a couple of, uh, you know what's, you know, let's get serious.

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.500]
We can't say that.

[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.660]
No, we certainly cannot.

[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.200]
We can't even say you know what's.

[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.900]
We can just say, that's it.

[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.600]
So I can't even say the name of the place where they had the US Open last year.

[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.160]
Really?

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.580]
Yeah.

[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.180]
Shinnah Joyce.

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.900]
Ooh.

[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.720]
Oh.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.000]

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.920]
I heard that place.

[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.360]
Yeah.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.040]
Both parts.

[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.300]
Well, I'm off for Louisville weekend in Louisville.

[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.700]
Yeah.

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.500]
Some Phantom race that doesn't even exist.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.180]
You're not fooling us.

[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.140]
I'm going to be tuning in.

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.320]
And I say I won't be because I'll be gambling this weekend.

[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.280]
I'll be an Niagara Falls.

[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.340]
Light in the afternoon.

[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.240]
I'll be at the Falls View Casino plunging my guts out all weekend.

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.100]
So I won't be able to.

[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.660]
I'll be at Seasers in the end.

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100]
I might have to tune in just to make sure you're on the year that's not one of these Phantom races.

[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.140]
No, I'll be there.

[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.640]
Are a poll today you might have some interest in.

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.960]
We got 200 votes out of already.

[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.320]
What's your favorite former gambling?

[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.180]
52 people don't gamble.

[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.620]
But again, that leaves 151 who do.

[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.860]
That's a great question.

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.720]
What's your answer?

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.380]
Well, somebody.

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.480]
Oh, slots.

[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.120]
Used to be horses, as you know, but not even come out.

[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.260]
And try to close.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.820]
Right.

[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.420]
Not anymore.

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.840]
See to me, the most boring, I mean, Thurberg racing to me is just coma inducing.

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.220]
I mean, you sit there for a half hour between races and you just read that form over and over

[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.840]
and you change your mind 15 times.

[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.380]
And there's nothing going on.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.580]
There's no horses warming up.

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.520]
There's nothing going on.

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.060]
Well, now you have cymo casting.

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.580]
You got to race going every second.

[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.300]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.940]
That's true.

[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.840]
So that's, that's piced it up.

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940]
In fact, I think that I told you earlier before the show.

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.020]
I said, that's the only thing that's kept racing alive is the cymo casting.

[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.320]
You know what I like about the track is some, some it used to be.

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.540]
And I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that you no longer wrote it.

[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.100]
And it's just a lot of guys you hung out with a track or no longer here.

[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.640]
They did.

[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.060]
Yep.

[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.660]
That's right.

[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.740]
Oh, well, sure going to the track, for example, not fat rich died.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.620]
So how often when I'm home to think I'm going to be going over to Pompooh Park?

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700]
I mean, I'll go once in a while.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.560]
Yeah, and then you went with Caller a lot to the right.

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.220]
That's correct.

[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.120]
So that's part of what you notice.

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.140]
That's what I thought was a truck.

[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.220]
With your buddies and it's like a day at the races.

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.760]
That's all.

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.200]
That's right.

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.060]
The gambling is like a secondary thing.

[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.640]
That's why a lot of people play golf.

[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.860]
You know, if they go out there with a few guys and they, you know,

[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.460]
and they have to.

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.060]
Yeah.

[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.460]
In fact, I know you and Moe probably.

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.100]
Oh, yeah, we play a lot of golf together.

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.480]
I'll bet.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.060]
Anyway, don't gamble 54.

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.100]
Blackjack 37 slots 22.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.500]
Now the person who sent this suggestion for this poll and said,

[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.440]
show that judge courtess of thing or two and take a poll on, you know,

[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.020]
because Josh is very negative and slots.

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.420]
He thinks it's only for like pansies and old ladies.

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.900]
Gay.

[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.160]
And I keep trying to know seriously if he would go out.

[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.600]
Well, he just, he just got a close mind.

[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.720]
When I go out to Woodbuy, it's just astonishing how many young people

[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.520]
are out there are just all kinds of people.

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.820]
Young and old and ethnic and you name it.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.020]
Gay.

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.200]
Slot's 22, poker 19, sports betting 18, cracks 11, lotto, lotto re10.

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.840]
That's a good bet.

[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.940]
Roulette 10, Russian roulette 9.

[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.260]
Russian roulette.

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.620]
I'll tell you what, I wish I could pick the nine in my audience who are playing Russian roulette.

[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.920]
Yeah.

[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.620]
Kind of like fix the gun ahead of time.

[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.840]
I would like to send that game to the sales department.

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.420]
There you go.

[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.080]
Please don't even start me with that.

[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.000]
Horses 9, cockfighting 4, a high life 3, dog racing 2, bridge 1, bingo none, and backer

[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.480]
at none.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680]
How about sports betting 18, just behind poker.

[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.580]
But you see that.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.560]
So horses and I mean, and then of course you look highlight and dog racing.

[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.420]
I mean, way down.

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.020]
I was telling George before about when I first came to town, highlight and dog racing were huge.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.580]
Remember when they used to have the mantis and the dog and both highlight and dog.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.720]
You know, Christmas night was enormous.

[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.080]
It Miami highlight is that they didn't run all year long, man.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.300]
And a biscuit and flag with it had the matinee they handle 7,800,000 in the afternoon.

[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.180]
And they handle over a million at night on a weekend.

[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.620]
And while then I weren't talking about that the other day.

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.980]

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.220]
I can't do it.

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.880]
Can it's good?

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.380]
Good.

[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.820]
Yeah.

[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.600]
But the days when he was out at the biscuit game was a great time.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.800]

[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.880]
It treated everybody great.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.860]
It was terrific to go.

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.540]
I love the biscuit.

[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.880]
It was a fun.

[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.280]
It was a fan-friendly place.

[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.720]
Yep.

[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.660]
But I would be interested on the poker part of it to see how that broke down age-wise.

[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.300]
Because I just read a story in Sports Illustrated about how many young people are into poker right now.

[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.440]
And it's...

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.980]
Well, even breaking down further like the people who played the songs of the video poker is huge now.

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.420]
Yep.

[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.320]
I mean, people are watching poker on television.

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.740]
And what about Texas Holden?

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940]
Is that like a...

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.180]
What is that?

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.760]
That's a form of poker.

[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.280]
Right.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.180]
It's a high-low game or it's...

[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.800]
And it...

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.040]
Or you can play straight poker and...

[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.620]
What channel can I watch that on?

[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.780]
You can watch it on ESPN 2.

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.820]
Oh, no thanks.

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.580]
No thanks.

[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.540]
I was watching yesterday.

[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.980]
They had a great match.

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.660]
Get out of here.

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.780]
You were watching poker?

[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.500]
You know what?

[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.080]
You turned that on by accident and you get a hooked watch in it for a few minutes.

[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.960]
Because it is someone who's asking to watch the most people play.

[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.420]
Watching other people play cards to me is like watching other people play golf.

[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.120]
No chance.

[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.380]
You know what the ratings are?

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.540]
I know it's good.

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.680]
It just shows you where we are.

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.200]
Reality programming and poker.

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.880]
For Oprah.

[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.360]
Yep.

[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.440]
Say what is that to you?

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.860]
The fact it's got ratings doesn't mean much to me.

[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.860]
But that's what the young people are doing.

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.520]
To the rating for NASCAR.

[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.220]
All the people waiting for the big crack.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.880]
See now, that's a different culture altogether.

[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.140]
I know it's out there.

[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.620]
Oh, it's out there.

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.940]
All right.

[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.400]
It's huge.

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.060]
It's something that doesn't affect me one way or another.

[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.000]
But I know it's there.

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.700]
It's there for me in the least.

[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.000]
Nope.

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.040]
But it's giant.

[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.580]
I just never took enough BC powders to be in the NASCAR.

[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.580]
That's fun sitting there.

[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.740]
You might as well, to me, it's no different from getting a high rise over looking at 95.

[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.160]
That's a good idea.

[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.760]
You're going to see one.

[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.680]
All right.

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.160]
I got a plane to catch.

[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.940]
Oh, great.

[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.320]
Well, listen.

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.440]
Have a great time in New York with this bogus race.

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.900]
What is it?

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.100]
The Peter Stuyverson.

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.120]
I'll say I'm not going to be in New York.

[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.040]
It's Louisville.

[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.020]
It's the Stephen Foster.

[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.340]
Well, the Stephen Foster.

[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.840]
Is he a Stephen Foster Hewitt?

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.240]
Yep.

[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.740]
And my old Kentucky home.

[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.880]
I'll send you my expensive, you know, I'll pay my old Kentucky.

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.380]
I know they do it before the Derby.

[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.460]
Oh, they do it before this race.

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.700]
No.

[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.000]
Well, what about Stephen Foster?

[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.160]
Well, he wrote the song.

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.360]
And I've been working on the railroad.

[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.080]
That's why he's got this for the song of the South.

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.980]
That's why he got it named after him.

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.760]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.600]
And the race too.

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.780]
Well, someday they can have the Neor Rogers and the Hank Olibur Memorial Race.

[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.960]
Hope not too soon.

[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.080]
There was a horse named Alan G. Finkelson.

[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.600]
Yes.

[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.400]
Yes.

[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.280]
Yeah, I know.

[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.100]
Okay.

[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.440]
He's still running, by the way.

[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.180]
Well, listen, enough of this race track.

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.460]
Catch your plane, have a great time in Louisville and see you Monday.

[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.500]
Don't lose too much.

[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.680]
I'll try not to also.

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.020]
You hear Monday, right?

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.200]
How big of a pardon?

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.140]
You're still here Monday?

[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.040]
Absolutely not.

[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.800]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.400]
When do you leave?

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.040]
Today is tomorrow's my, the beginning of the end.

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.540]
Tomorrow's the, I got vacation and then when I come back,

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.260]
I'll be here.

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.540]
Oh, okay.

[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.440]
See you next Tuesday.

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.340]
I'll be here.

[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:14.980]
Okay.

[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.460]
All right.

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.020]
Bye.

[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.320]
Bye.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.840]
I owe you, you.

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.300]
Let's grateful.

[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.020]
Free the old big shot.

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.480]
Oh.

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.020]
That's how we pass the time away.

[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.380]
In the gay old jail of hearts.

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.100]
Oh, go, go, go.

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:42.360]
The jury came back to the center down to the streets

[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.740]
and the ball fell down.

[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.840]
And the jury's sweet.

[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.360]
That's gonna never let him.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.660]
And the cheeks are on me.

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.600]
I'm beating.

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.240]
I'm beating.

[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.640]
My leg don't seem like the scurrying is gone.

[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.680]
All the gannado balls, so he shows.

[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.720]
I'm so happy.

[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.500]
I feel like the trophy's only time to beat him.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.940]
Now I'm free to be fair.

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.820]
I'm beating.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.420]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.000]
There we go again.

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.220]
We got Hank on here again.

[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.140]
And the bed up is there.

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.960]
We're recording a spot.

[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.680]
I beg your pardon?

[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.040]
No.

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.360]
Oh, no.

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:13.720]
I'm not.

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.720]

[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:31.340]
Oh, there we go.

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.020]
Where are you going?

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:58.040]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.060]

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.080]

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.080]

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.080]

[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.680]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.060]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.800]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.660]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.680]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.680]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.300]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.300]

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.300]

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.300]

[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.960]
I'm not going to be fair.

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:55.860]

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:55.860]

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:55.860]

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:55.860]

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.160]
I'm not going to be fair.

Get your thumb out of there.

[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.080]
Get your thumb out of there.

[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.560]
What up here?

[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.400]
Let's reunite it.

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.840]
What do you say?

[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.200]
No.

[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:24.920]
Oh, sorry.

[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.740]
You know what Geldie said about that?

[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.800]
You went too happy about the idea.

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.060]
Stop Florida real estate investing somebody says here

[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.640]
and he's got to look at a little diagram pop

[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.520]
as in the bubble bursting and there goes your money.

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.160]
Says coming to a bubble near you soon.

[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.540]
Well, just put real estate.

[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.260]
What's wrong with that?

[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.000]
Okay, real estate.

[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.500]
I think we ought to like narrow this down since we might

[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.380]
not get any calls on this today, which is fine.

[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.700]
Video poker, we should put that on there,

[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.140]
even though it like slaps over into poker and slots,

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.260]
but video poker is enormously popular.

[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:51.920]

[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.720]
Texas hold them.

[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.240]
Which that's why I just think I don't even know what the leg is.

[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.500]
It's a form of poker.

[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:57.860]
Right.

[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.380]
So we should not put that on there.

[00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.620]
No.

[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.700]
Very big now.

[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.520]
Huge.

[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.440]
Humongous.

[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.320]
We'll put it on there while you're at it.

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.900]
Well, so in other words, video poker,

[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.780]
we don't want to put on either.

[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.020]
No, video poker on there.

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.980]
I mean, I put, you're not talking about online, right?

[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.220]
You're talking about like the machines.

[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:11.620]
Okay.

[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.360]
I'll put it on.

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:12.680]
Right.

[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.380]
I mean, it slots, but then again, it's also a flop.

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.880]
But it's not.

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.580]
Pacific thing.

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.920]
Did we put online gaming?

[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.380]
No, yeah.

[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:18.620]
Yeah.

[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.600]
And that's because all those people are still busy trying to collect.

[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.240]
That was disturbing to me.

[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:23.780]
No, seriously.

[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.660]
I mean, you have no way of knowing how would you

[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.400]
play a play star?

[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.040]
It's one thing you're wondering by like, I don't know,

[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.500]
a pair of gloves or something or a hat online.

[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.420]
And I'm really hoping that this is really whatever it is,

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.360]
or a book from amazon.com.

[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.280]
By the way, how's your movie coming, George?

[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.220]
Well, see that over.

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.580]
No, north by northwest, it was backward in the game.

[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.760]
I know.

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.700]
So it's sometime before the between, it said between now and

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.040]
Stukas.

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.980]
I'm sure before I die, which I think Stukas is not a tober.

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.400]
I'm not really sure, but that's what they said.

[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.060]
Some, some day, I mean, I got his.

[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.900]
He didn't like it, unfortunately, but he got his.

[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.720]
At least he's like a micro, not the micro, but the flavor way.

[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.100]
Right.

[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.660]
Like that.

[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.900]
So one out of two ain't bad.

[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.480]
He's going to put it in the play watch.

[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.660]
It looks like he likes toss it.

[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.780]
This is something you can use forever and ever.

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.340]
I like he pointed out the thing of it is, the minute you turn it on,

[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.000]
it's at the temperature, like it's, or nearly, it's 400 degrees.

[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.920]
And it's 400 degrees right away.

[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.760]
You don't have to preheat it and sit there and wait and wait,

[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.720]
or like with the oven.

[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.840]
You know, you have to put it on preheat and then you set the timer

[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.220]
for like 10 minutes and you go with it.

[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.100]
Is it, is it doing it yet or what?

[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.700]
You know, it makes your house all hot.

[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.460]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.240]
He eats up the kitchen.

[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.900]
Anyway, it's almost like doing a spot, but it's just such a good product.

[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.160]
And now you see why I was so enthusiastic.

[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.060]
Thank you.

[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:34.440]
Again.

[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.860]
You're welcome, Josh.

[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.880]
Thank you.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.920]
Bomb near Ramadi kills five US Marines.

[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.020]
This must be a mistake.

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.140]
More dead people in here over there.

[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.740]
Five US Marines were killed by a bomb near Ramadi,

[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.160]
according to a US military source.

[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.220]
The Marines, assigned to the second Marine Division, were killed today.

[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:50.920]
Yesterday.

[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.100]
Yesterday when the roadside bomb director of vehicle during combat operation,

[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.880]
also a US sailor died of wound suffered any was hit by enemy small arms fire

[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.020]
during a combat operation in Ramadi.

[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.460]
So there is, let's see, six more.

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.540]
The number of American troops killed since the Iraq war began.

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.900]
Now it's 1700 and 13 and marching nicely on the way toward 1800.

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.440]
And of course thousands and thousands, at least 12,000 injured.

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.760]
And we don't really know the honest number.

[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.640]
And over 100,000 dead Iraqis.

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.040]
But hey, things are going very well.

[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.740]
Freedom shot in March.

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:20.520]
Fourth.

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.140]
Yeah.

[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.300]
You think we're going to get any calls today?

[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.700]
I just think, what do I have to do?

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.240]
I don't really care when we do this, especially since tomorrow is D-Day for me.

[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.860]
It's tomorrow's a major day in my life.

[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:29.960]
My day.

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.040]
Maybe, huh?

[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:31.860]
It's D-Day.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.120]
It is D-Day.

[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.220]

Hey, good morning, now.

[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.600]
When is this?

[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.580]
When is this?

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.700]

[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.360]
Hey, Neil.

[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.120]
I was trying to call you yesterday.

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.260]
You've been cast for the show on History Channel

[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.800]
Inside the Monk here.

[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.360]
No.

[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.740]
It was on Monday or Tuesday.

[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.360]
Just keep driving.

[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.400]
It might be on again.

[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:43.800]

And I have to say...

[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.720]
That's hot!

[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.040]
And I have waited for you...

[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.180]
All of my life...

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.920]
I will be your just in full White!

[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.660]
United into the White!

[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.980]
United into the White!

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.420]
United into the White!

[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.120]
United into the White!

[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.920]
I guarantee Rodger Marist was a lot hotter than Periss all over,

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.480]
you too hot anymore. It's 1032, a QAIM. Here's the facts from Adam. That's his umphrey.

[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.420]
Thanks Adam. You're okay. I told you that he would never let me down tonight. Very conscientious

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.860]
guy. That's right. He sends me a fast, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep,

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.480]
but a beep, but a beep. Well, at least he was responsive, unlike some people who are

[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.200]
going into hiding now, hiding, cowering under the desk. Man, what a woose. Anyway, here's

[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.280]
the full question today. I guess I should have mentioned that, shouldn't I? Probably be

[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.060]
a good one. Okay. Slow me down a little bit. We just got today in the morning. I think

[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.760]
they're allowed to hear for while. It's all good. What's your favorite form of gambling?

[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.420]
We asked 348 votes so far. I don't gamble 78. I've heard it before the show is

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.760]
where I say, see, they don't gamble. See, but of course what he hasn't realized is that

[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.480]
the overwhelming majority of the rest of the people have just divided up. No, I understand.

[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:15.000]
I voted for a poker. In other words, 260, 270 people do gamble and 78 are like boring.

[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.920]
Okay. I mean, you don't have to gamble your money. It's hard to earn it. A full of his

[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.960]
money are soon part of that. I've told you that many times, especially after a bad day

[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.500]
it would mind, but nevertheless, most of the people I know don't gamble. I mean, they

[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.840]
have, but they just don't. I'm trying to think. No, most of the people I know do gamble.

[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.040]
Not compulsively, but they go to Vegas. They go, you know, I'm not talking about compulsive

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.420]
gambling. Like a game we have a QAM. I'm not talking about gambling at all. I'm not talking

[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.560]
about people at gambling. Like if there's two leaves falling from the tree, which one will

[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.700]
hit the ground first? That way. The red one. My uncle, the bookie, Mugsy Solomon. Anyway,

[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.940]
what's your favorite form of gambling? I don't gamble 78. Blackjack 54, poker 34, slot

[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:58.400]
32, 20 smart ass sports betting 27, the lottery 20. That's a great bed. Not craft 18,

[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.600]
talk fighting 16, horses 16, roulette 15, Russian roulette 12, high life for dog racing

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.580]
for the stock market three, bridge two, video poker one. By the way, the Russian roulette

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.100]
people will come to your home and they'll give you some help. Stock market one, back

[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.900]
to rat one, in real estate none, spades spades. Yeah, put that on later. What the hell is

[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.160]
that? That car game? Yeah. Spades. Are we going to put like my genre on here too? And

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.560]
shuffleboard? Because spades. How about old me? That rhymes with spades. How about David

[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.000]
spades? Yeah, I'd like to get one with it. Spades, my ass, online gaming none and being

[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.040]
going on. They online gaming thing. I don't believe that. I don't know some of you. In fact,

[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.560]
they're probably that's why they're not on their website. They're busy plunging their

[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.300]
guts right now. Or maybe they're trying to get their money back. They're open to

[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.860]
browser at the same time. You know, my rooming that somebody just got a problem that

[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.160]
admits to us that sends us some facts. It says he loves the fun of gambling online. But

[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.200]
it can see that it always gives them an excuse why not to give him his money. What is that?

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.820]
He said a crazy person. As a matter of fact, I'll give you a PO box. I haven't opened it yet,

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.060]
but I'll go make one up and you can just send your money there, Frank. And I'll give you

[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.400]
an amusement you want. Wow. Now they keep banging away on this Rubo case. I mean, this

[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:14.360]
is just nauseating because this is the way the media operates as you well know. But here's

[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.360]
a story finally. It says was race a factor in the Rubo arrest. That isn't even a story that I was

[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.260]
looking for. Sorry, let me look through my pile. There was a story about why it is that they're

[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.180]
that that's not the story. You idiot. You you you simple and you you fair right. That's me.

[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.520]
Oh, here you go. Well, that ties right in with this. The last people to see Natalie Holloway

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.240]
and the night she disappeared in a rubble were the white teenage son of the local judge and two

[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.020]
middle class young men of suranami's descent according to a local police within days of when

[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.860]
Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30th. But third man. A Rubin police arrested two

[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.660]
black security guards who worked at the hotel where she was staying. One question swirling around

[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.700]
the investigation was whether police initially targeted the security guards who released with

[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:02.260]
our charges eight day ladies as suspects, at least in part because of their race or class. Now,

[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.960]
most of the missing adults tracked by the FBI are men. More than one in five of those abducted

[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.860]
or kidnapped are black, but you might not get that impression from the news media. And some

[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.300]
journalism watchdogs are not taking the industry to task for what they see as a disproportionate

[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.420]
emphasis on cases in which white girls and women overwhelmingly upper middle class and attractive

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:27.020]
disappear. Sean, do you believe anyone? Television executive run away bride and what he's like

[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.100]
low class and whatever. Television executives who receive much of the criticism defend their

[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.300]
coverage. They stress that such cases as the recent disappearance and a rubble of 18-year-old

[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.340]
Natalie Holloway of Alabama are extraordinary. It would be news whether newsworthy no matter

[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:45.180]
why why is that extraordinary what's extraordinary about it? She told you she was white hot pretty

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.460]
right? Yeah, there you go from a white red place. Oh, that's extraordinary. It says indeed no

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.980]
critic denies that the Holloway case other disappearances are wrenching for those involved,

[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:59.380]
but some insist that media attention on so few people overshadows the more than 100,000 active

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.200]
files on missing adults and children currently tracked by the FBI IIII to be blunt blonde white

[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.420]
chicks who go missing get covered and poor black Hispanic or other people of color go missing

[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.020]
do not get covered. So Tom Rosensteel directed the Washington based project for excellence in

[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.500]
journalism. You're more likely to get coverage if you're attracted than if you're not.

[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.120]
Well, who wants to go out and look for ugly people? More likely to get laid if you're attracted

[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.400]
than. Who wants to go out and look for ugly people? No, they said during Maynard,

[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.020]
President of Roberts E. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, a group that works to improve

[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.940]
diversity in newsrooms and news coverage in terms of giving citizens the information they need.

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.420]
I think we're failing because we're not giving an accurate portrayal of the world around them.

[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.000]
Absolutely correct. On its website, the National Center for Missing

[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.820]
Adults profiles more than 1,000 individuals including photos, physical descriptions,

[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.240]
short narratives of when they were last seen. Their young and old working class and professional

[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.960]
of all ethnic backgrounds, most are average looking. And most never even receive a mention in their

[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.620]
local newspapers or TV broadcasts said Aaron Bruno, a case manager at the center, who tries to

[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.280]
interest media outlets and publicizing missing adults. We want everybody to be good coverage,

[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.920]
but we don't get to make those choices said Bruno, who estimates that one of the five news

[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.180]
releases she sends out each week gets media attention. Of the nearly 47,600 academic

[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.700]
adult cases tracked by the FBI as of the beginning of May, 53% were men, 29% black,

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.540]
about 12% of the U.S. population is black since this data show, about 62% of those missing

[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:25.840]
are white, but that figure includes Hispanics. Quoting those FBI statistics is by saying 99%

[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.020]
of the nations in the world are not at war, so why are you focusing on a war? But a rack is an

[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.640]
extraordinary event involving American said Mark Efron, VP of News at MSNBC. What makes news is

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.720]
the unexpected. He said, Halloween's disappearance during a shaperone trip is unusual and will be

[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.000]
heavily covered by MSNBC regardless of gender or ethnicity. I hear a sound coming.

[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.240]
Christopher Robinson, a spokeswoman for CNN, they certainly not news network said that a wide

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.920]
range of editorial considerations, including capotism from other news events, impact the attention

[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.300]
given to the potential story. The race or ethnicity of a possible victim she said is not a factor.

[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.480]
So in other words, the fact that all these people are dying in Iraq and all the American soldiers,

[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.560]
etc. All of this stuff is going on. The fact that we ought to have an impeachment against this

[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.640]
administration right now. And so that's why we heard about Rebecca Loha, Jennifer Wilbanks.

[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:22.640]
Right. Day after day after day after day, they run away bride. God almighty. I cried over the

[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.980]
coverage of the run away bride. I gave a good shri, I was so upset. But Rosenfield said that

[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.460]
analyses of cable news and recent years shows an upward trajectory of the salacious crime story,

[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.540]
including those missing white females such as Sean Relievie, Lacey Peterson,

[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.440]
Jean-Vanay Ramsey and Elizabeth Snottso Smart. Many consider women more sympathetic potential

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.420]
victims than men and white women even more so. So Crystal Brent Zoupe, a professor at Columbia

[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.160]
University's journalism school who wrote an article published in this month's Essence magazine

[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.600]
about missing black women who are largely ignored. Who's appealing? Who's sexist? He has.

[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.780]
Who's your daddy? The original pure blonde princess is missing and has a lot to do with class

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.040]
and sexuality and ageism, not just race. If some old lady, if some old bobbitchka is missing out there,

[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.300]
is anybody here about her? Huh? No. Do we have like big, big remotes from cemetery villagers?

[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.120]
Or would you win more? I don't think so.

[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.520]
Anybody know where Dave is? The Chappelle Show Season 3 DVD also features commentary from

[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.700]
Chappelle Showcast members like Charlie Murphy. This next clip is supposed to be like a new

[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.980]
Rick James sketch, but uh Dave never showed up. Plus interviews with the show's writers.

[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:01.020]
I was working on the best comedy on TV. Now I can't say my right. Thanks a lot Dave.

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.340]
The Chappelle Show Season 3 DVD. Just like Dave Chappelle, you can't find it anywhere.

[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.780]
I've had you something else that belongs on our poll that I'm gambling and that's golf.

[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.520]
Oh yeah?

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.560]
Enormous humongous amounts of money are gambled every single day on golf. That's why a lot of guys

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.880]
play. It's just something to bet on, you know? Right. You want to bet? No.

[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.760]
The secret British member of 2002 that reported that El Presidente was determined to go to war

[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.460]
against Iraq months earlier than he publicly acknowledged will get his first official hearing today

[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.880]
sort of. In the closest version so far to a congressional hearing on the Downing Street memo,

[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.500]
representative John Connures of Michigan will head a former examining the document.

[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.940]
That'll be followed by an internet organized rally in front of the White House.

[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.800]
Connures plans to deliver these signatures of 105 congressional Democrats and more than a half

[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.760]
a million citizens on petitions demanding a detailed response from the Bush administration

[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.680]
of the memo's allegations. More than a half a million signatures they got. How do you like that?

[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.440]
You go John.

[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.620]
The memo minutes of a meeting that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had with AIDS on July 23rd,

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.680]
2002 in London said it seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action.

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.200]
Bush has long said he didn't decide to go to war until shortly before the bombing began.

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.860]
In March 2003 the memo also says that the Bush White House fixed intelligence data to justify

[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.700]
the war. Bush's pre-war emphasis on the danger of Iraq's weapons and mass destruction

[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.420]
proved to be erroneous after inspectors failed to find any. The memo came to light on May 1

[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.340]
and Sunday times of London. So far in the US it's triggered more of a national side than a gas,

[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.200]
but news of its spread quickly on internet blogs. Connures said he's holding the hearing which

[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:35.180]
will be televised on C-SPAN 3 to uncover whether there was a secret decision well ahead of the

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.640]
war. Connures said the memo suggests that even as the Bush administration is assuring

[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:45.360]
Congress they were secretly planning the war. And it's bad enough that the Bush administration

[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.460]
had so little international support for the Iraqi War that their coalition of the

[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.380]
willing meant the US Britain and the equivalent of a child's imaginary friends. It's even maybe

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.240]
Captain Howdy was in there with us you think? Captain Howdy? Oh from the Exorcism. Are you eating

[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:04.000]
again? Yes I am. And it must be Avachev's Howys again. It's even worse that as the

[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.540]
Downey Street memo confirms they had so little evidence of real threats that they knew from the

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.660]
start they were going to have to manufacture excuses to go to war. What's more damning still is

[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.700]
that they effectively began this war even before the Congressional vote. What John Howdy

[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.760]
is about to hold those hearings coverage of the Downey Street memo is finally beginning to leak

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.000]
into the media. Can we say leak? It's finally beginning to be into the media. In contrast we've

[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.380]
heard almost nothing about the degree to which this administration began actively fighting the

[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:34.720]
war in Iraq. We'll advance a March 2003 official attack before both the October 2002 US Congressional

[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.060]
authorization and the November UN resolution recording that Saddam Hussein opened the country up

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:45.440]
to inspectors. This is by Paul Rogat-Lobb, commons street or commons dreams.org. Got it? Well that's

[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.840]
what I got I was saying yesterday. We'll tell us where it's from commons streetadreams.org. He says

[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.860]
I follow Iraq pretty closely but was taken aback when Charlie Clements not headed the Unitarian Universal

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.340]
of Service Committee described driving in a bagged head neighborhood six months before the war

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:04.380]
and a building would just explode hit by a missile from 30,000 feet. What is that building Clements

[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.860]
would ask? Oh that's a telephone exchange. Later at a conference in Nevada's Nellis Air Force

[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.140]
base Clementsor to US General Boast that he began taking out assets that could help him resisting

[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.360]
an invasion at least six months before war was declared. Earlier this month Jeremy Schaehl wrote a

[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.080]
powerful piece on the nation's website describing a huge aerosolton September 2002. Approximately

[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.580]
a hundred US and British planes flew from Kuwait into a Iraqi airspace kehl rice. At least seven

[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.340]
types of aircraft were part of this massive operation including US F-15 strike eagles and royal

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.580]
air force tornado ground attack planes. They dropped precision guided munitions on Saddam Hussein's

[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:42.040]
major Western air defense facility clearing the path for special forces helicopters that lay

[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.980]
and wait in Jordan. Earlier attacks have been carried out against the Iraqi command and control

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:50.500]
centers, radar detection systems, revolutionary guard units, communication centers and mobile air

[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.400]
defense systems. The Pentagon's goal was clear, destroy your flexibility to resist. Why are we

[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.860]
talking about this? Is Kehl points out this was a month before the congressional vote and two

[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.000]
months before the UN resolution. Supposedly part of enforcing no fly zones, the bombings were actually

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.380]
systematic assaults on Iraq's capacity to defend itself. The US had never declared war,

[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.800]
Bush had no authorization, not even a fig leaf. He was simply attacking another nation because

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.680]
he decided to do so. This preemptive war preempted our own Congress as well as international law.

[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.620]
I don't think most Americans know these pre-war attacks ever happened aside from those of Red

[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:28.080]
Skahel's recent peace or heard him on democracy now. I recall no mainline media coverage at the time

[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.300]
and little in the even in the alternative press. The bombings that destroyed Iraq's air defenses were

[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.180]
under the radar for both the American media and the public. If coverage of the downing street memo

[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.640]
continues to increase, I suspect the administration will try to dismiss it as mere diplomatic talk

[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.520]
just inside baseball. But they weren't just manipulating intelligence so they could detect

[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.320]
no matter how Saddam Hussein responded. They weren't only bribing with the allies in the

[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.560]
participation. They were fighting a war they planned long before. They just didn't bother to

[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.360]
tell the American public. And again once again, right on to his got a stomach right on it. How do

[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.320]
you like that? I don't know. Who's this online too? Peyton and the S-Caller? QA and hello?

[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.280]
Hey, dude, it's going on man. I got the answer. Two from the hall. I'm going to write and black check.

[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:16.800]
Oh yeah, right. All right. I got one. I don't gamble. How's that? How about Birpakarat?

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.820]
Yeah. What's your favorite former gambling? I don't gamble, my V9. Blackjack 65. Well, that's

[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:28.280]
removing a fast after he said it. Isn't it? Poker 43. Slots 38. Josh. I know they're all gay.

[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.260]
Sports betting 33. The lottery 27. Horses 22. We didn't separate Thurbrad from harness racing because

[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:40.600]
I don't know. Crash 19. Roulette 18. Cockfighting 17. Russian Roulette 13. Hopefully,

[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.500]
Prozac Ron is one of those people. The Gargling guy too. Gilbert. Gilbert, absolutely.

[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.600]
Russian Roulette 13. Stock market eight. High life five. Video poker four. And again,

[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.300]
I realized that some of the people voted or oh, well, we really meant well, whatever. It's not

[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.980]
rocket science. This poll will not go down in the emails of the human race. Just relax. Just for fun.

[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:08.320]
Dog racing four. Real estate three. Stock market two. Bridget two. Vakarat one. Spades.

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:14.720]
Spades. What is spades? Come on. It's a great game. It's like hearts, not unlike pinnacle.

[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.600]
Yeah. And it's a card game. And we put in Tiddly Wings on here.

[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.380]
Right now. Monopoly. He's spelled out with T or D's. Spades don't have any votes. Online gaming

[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:28.760]
none and bingo none. Online gaming has none. That's good. I'm glad to see that. Yeah.

[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.000]
I'm glad to see that. Although I don't believe it because they're probably just to ashamed to admit

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.540]
they probably think we're going to be tracing the votes because that's just I mean, there's like

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.460]
87 million of these offshore online gaming deals and God only knows where the hell they are. And

[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.620]
if you're ever going to see your money, I mean, and addition to which I can't think of anything

[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.220]
possibly worse. Can you know one thing to be like addicted or just maybe not addicted, but like

[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.900]
plunge in a lot at the Vegas or at the local casino wherever it might be. It's another thing to

[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.360]
sit there right in the comfort of your own home. Right. Like I said, like those call and race track

[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.720]
good deals. And plunge in your guts out. I mean, morning noon and night. Can you rather say I'm

[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.400]
limited, huh? You imagine that that Mahoney guy had had the internet back then. Oh, yeah.

[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.340]
They would have had the internet back in the early 80s, which they didn't. He would have turned

[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.540]
into Howard Hughes. There he is right out there. How's it going there? Mahoney Toronto guy who got

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.440]
himself all straight. No, that's good. And who was that mini driver played the wife? Yeah, I believe

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.120]
so. Right. Many good. She was adequate. I wouldn't say she was great. I mean, she was very

[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.340]
a huge part. She was certainly very, what's the word I'm looking for? Yes. No, but beside that,

[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:41.620]
that's a given with her. She was very considerate, very, oh, yeah, like understanding, very

[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.160]
understanding, very flexible and very stupid, I guess. Well, maybe desperate. That's a WQAM.

[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.120]
Hello. How many drivers played the wife? QAM. Hey Neil, how you doing? Pretty good, Pally.

[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:58.540]
I know you don't like golf, but a lot of businessmen we gather up Saturday and Sunday and we bet heavily

[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.180]
on the golf course. Right. In fact, I think we put it on her yet. I told Josh that, but he's like

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.060]
Adam and he want to put yeah, golf is going to be big. Yeah, you know, you got him. How much would

[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:13.400]
you, how much would your plunge like on an average match? Well, you got, you got a bunch of matches

[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.800]
going and you can lose anywhere between three four, five hundred up to a thousand. Excellent.

[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.660]
So it's good, you know, I'm a business man. That's my only vice. Well, nothing wrong with that.

[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.720]
Torn to your gut, Pally. Have a good summer, Neil. And you too. There you go. See there's golf,

[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.780]
which I'm glad he called reminded because I thought well, we just put that on here, but Josh,

[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.580]
for some reason, he put his fades on his stud. Yeah, he puts fades on there instead of golf. Uh-huh.

[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.820]
I had listened, put on whatever you want on there. Man, do you think it really makes any difference

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.720]
to me at this stage of the game at this point in my life? By the way, we really missed you this

[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.060]
morning, Duff. Not. No. I mean, we missed a little pad on the head. How we're going to do the show

[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:54.800]
all the way till two o'clock? Attention, man. You're fairy. WNQ AM. Hello. Good morning, Neil. How are you?

[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.620]
Pretty good. Um, little tip that of information here. I was watching the news this morning,

[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.240]
scrolling across the bottom. Not a little tip. It's a news. I saw that the had bought the rights to

[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.600]
the runaway bride for a movie. Now, yeah, that's, I got that in my hand right now in the story too.

[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.080]
Unbelievable. That's anything on the screen. That must make you want to gag and tuff your guss out.

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.160]
And that actually is one of my favorite bits you have. That's coming up right back.

[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.800]
It's coming up very soon. Have a beautiful day. Now, you two, Pellet. How do you like that? Yeah,

[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.540]
runaway bride inks deal with firm preaching movie. We'll do that after the break. That is so disgusting.

[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.480]
And so she had her 15 seconds of fame, but now she can really exploit it for being a real

[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:38.080]
slump. That cost everybody all that money and had everybody crazy. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, man, oh, man.

[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:44.180]
I'm talking. I think I think America has gone nuts led by the irresponsible grave robbing media.

[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:49.420]
I think America has gone over the, they've gone off the end. They've just lost it collectively. The

[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.120]
country's gone like that. Don't you? Oh, yeah. It's like a country could speak collectively.

[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:59.240]
America would say that would be the American thing right now. The American nation anthem.

[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:06.260]
Instead of the star-spangled banner, they should just be doing. That would be good too.

[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:12.140]
And then the gargling I could like chime in 1057 at 560 WQM. We got the Mollmeister with two. We

[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.380]
got Mad Dog at Bruce Rume in Pompolywood for Geltie at seven. Geltie's in a lot of airtime

[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:21.060]
and Eddie Kay at 10 o'clock. And by now you've got an old-fashioned Anthony Kelliando. He's the

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.500]
main man in acceptance capital mortgage. So before you call any other mortgage company, let Anthony

[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.380]
tell you what you didn't know. And that is that most banks only work with three different mortgage

[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.720]
products. You don't have much of a choice. And if your credit is less than 100% absolutely

[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.640]
positively perfect, you're going to get turned down. You're going to hear the old NO.

[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.640]
And of course, if you're not working with the right lender, chances of getting approved are maybe

[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.420]
50-50 anyway. So if you really want to improve it, if you want the mortgage rate that you're looking

[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:52.100]

[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:39.680]
This is the Neal Roger show. This is your brain. You failed. Any questions?

[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:50.220]
Hello, my friends. It's you. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello.

[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.620]
You're the first. What the hell's the matter, honey?

[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:02.620]
Are you crying? You sound like you're crying. I'm thinking that by aliens.

[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:12.140]
You've been kidnapped again? By aliens. You've been kidnapped by aliens. Where they done took you?

[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.060]
Albuquerque. Albuquerque. Is that in America? Where is it? In New Mexico.

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.960]
In New Mexico. Albuquerque is. Yes. I was in Georgia. No, no, no, no, Mexico.

[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:34.040]
Okay. I don't believe you. You don't have to lie to me. No, I want to get married.

[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.180]
I really do it just that I was kidnapped by aliens. I don't believe you, honey. They got short hair.

[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:45.000]
They got short hair. Who does? The aliens. I've short hair. You say short hair. You mean like,

[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.780]
right? I'd see, crash short. A little longer than that. A little longer like Fabio.

[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.340]
I don't need to get a lesson. I believe you. Where are you? Can I pick you up? I'm at a 7-11.

[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:06.720]
7-11? Yes. Can you give me a slurpee? What? Slurpee. What? Slurpee. What? Like a blue

[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.660]
bird. I just think kidnapped. I think it's your slurpee. All right, I'll get it myself.

[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:22.480]
You really been kidnapped, honey. I spy aliens in a blue van. Aliens drop a blue van.

[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.520]
Like a Chevy van? No. Did a Ford? No. What kind of van is that?

[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:36.300]
Is it God of the Man? Is it the only thing to eat? Is it probes? No.

[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:43.420]
Focues? No. Proud? No. Like love to eat? No, you idiot. I'm not coming. I want to stay at the 7-11.

[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:50.020]
You don't want to murder me, do you? No. What? No, I told you. But I forgive you. I don't care. You can come home.

[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.980]
I'm not. Come home. I'm done with this. I'm the sheet. Bye-bye. The little girl is taking a blue.

[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.520]
The little girl is taking a blue. The little girl is taking a blue.

[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.480]
Anyway, if you're right, Killer, was there slurped out of the courtroom on a structure? Do you see that? No, I didn't.

[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.280]
I hope it helped him, Mr. Cippy. If you're right, Killer, what does he 91? Something like that?

[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.880]
Anyway, he looked okay to me. He just sat in up and slurped him out of there on a structure.

[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.940]
Looks to me like you're just postponing the inevitable.

[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.760]
Hoping that maybe he'll just cope first before they find the convicted.

[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.360]
The next year, Red Nackia, a clean ass.

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.660]
Runaway, Brian, Anx, deal with firm pitching movie. This is so disgusting.

[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.880]
And it says, officials who search for her are not amused.

[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.880]
Runaway, Brian, Jennifer Wilbanks made a deal with a company that's pitching a movie about her life to networks,

[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:38.200]
annoying the officials who spent thousands of dollars in countless hours searching for her ugly ass.

[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:44.000]
Searching for her ugly BDI ass. Reagan Media, a New York that's Reagan Media, a New York

[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.780]
multimedia company told the Atlanta Journal Constitution for a story today's newspapers.

[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.720]
It's acquired all media rights to the life stories of Wilbanks and her fiance, John Mason.

[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.880]
The company didn't say whether any money had changed hands.

[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.540]
I'm looking forward to developing the scripted project with Wilbanks and Mason,

[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.500]
company president Judith Reagan said this statement.

[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.760]
There is an unexpected and compelling story of love and forgiveness that has certainly taught

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.260]
me a thing or two. Yeah.

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.740]
Is in How to Make a Quick Buck.

[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.560]
The 32-year-old bride to be disappeared from her home and

[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.860]
had run a summer rubble in April 26th, four days before her wedding in a ceremony with 620

[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.360]
attendance for scheduled, she took a bus to Vegas, then to Albuquerque,

[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.360]
Jerky, New Mexico, and claimed she was abducted and sexually assaulted.

[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.560]
She later recanted saying she fled because of unspecified personal issues.

[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.060]
In other words, like that.

[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.440]
Wilbanks pleaded no contest earlier this month by making a false statement,

[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.560]
and was sentenced to two years of probation in 120 hours of community service,

[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.380]
she was also ordered to continue mental health treatment and pay the sheriff's

[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.180]
office $2,550. The loophs spent nearly 43 grand a search for her.

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.780]
She has repaid so far $13,249.

[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.260]
It's disturbing to me on a personal basis that she's willing to profit from this,

[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.820]
but there's nothing I can do about it legally, said Winnet County DA Danny Porter,

[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.640]
who preserves charges, pursues charges against that bitch.

[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.980]
How do you like that? I asked her not to make you lose confidence in faith in life.

[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.040]
That's enough to make you never want to read the freaking news again, right?

[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.300]
The American freaking way.

[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.600]
It's the American Joyce and Wayman. It's disgusting and nauseating.

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.200]
You go out and you do some disgusting, unacceptable, aberrant kind of crap.

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.920]
You get everybody whipped up at a war frenzy.

[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.380]
You exploit the media for fun and whatever, and then you profit from it.

[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.980]
Just like these jurors in a Michael Jackson trial, oh brother,

[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.940]
oh we want to, yeah, that note, I wish I had saved that story,

[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.060]
so I could read the wording exactly again.

[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.860]
They pass a note saying we want to be your left alone,

[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.700]
and we hope you'll respect our privacy.

[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.120]
We did the best we could, and we did our duty in the Yadda.

[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.300]
And then all of a sudden an hour later, we see this room with all these chairs in it.

[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.500]
Here they come, all of them.

[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.220]
All of them, not a single one of them said,

[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.080]
well, you know, I really mean I want to be left alone.

[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.820]
I don't want any publicity. I want to be anonymous.

[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.420]
No, I mean, what could be more anonymous than putting your face right out there on World Wide TV,

[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.380]
huh? That's pretty freaking anonymous, right?

[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.600]
And then all of a sudden we hear about, well, we already knew the 79 year old broad.

[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.380]
She's going to, she's writing the book.

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.000]
And then all of a sudden we find your number one.

[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.980]
He's on there. He's on my TV more than, uh, than, uh, I'm old.

[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.980]
He's on there more than Jerry Springer.

[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.460]
All over the place. He's like, uh, what, what did it color when something like gets burned,

[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.140]
it burned in your TV tube?

[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:18.640]
Remember that?

[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.120]
Oh, right. It's still happens.

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.340]
Like the test pattern, you used to, when the old sets back before you were born,

[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.300]
the test pattern would get burned in, if you kept your set on a long time.

[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.040]
Get burned in your TV tube and was like always there in the back.

[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.780]
And that's, that's what he was like the last two, three days.

[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.820]
You're a number one.

[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.380]
The one that says, oh, well, I'm pretty sure he wants to do the little boys,

[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.680]
but they didn't prove this one.

[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.240]
And he's another one that wanted to be anonymous.

[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.600]
And they're just all over the place.

[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.020]
And of course you know, and now they're saying, well,

[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:47.140]
you know, some of these people might write some books and maybe a mini series and maybe a movie

[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.600]
in a screenplay and et cetera and so on.

[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.820]
Just, oh, man, makes you just weak.

[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.080]
That's why I keep telling you folks.

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.500]
Just enjoy your lives, okay?

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.200]
Go to the track, go to the casino, plunge your guts up,

[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.580]
go on vacation, go to any of those cities we had on there.

[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.920]
Yesterday, go to Genevieve, New York,

[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.100]
go to a catarlogist's server, go somewhere, just have a good life.

[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.400]
That's all because if you get, you know, it's like all the Sirac stuff.

[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.140]
Nobody cares.

[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.820]
I said, who are we these days?

[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.560]
The Downing Street Mellow, well, at least a half a million people cared

[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.580]
enough to sign a John Connus petition anyway.

[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.080]
That's good.

[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:16.860]
I scroll in John.

[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.280]
There's a guy who cares.

[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.600]
Remember him in Fahrenheit 9-11 when he said,

[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.960]
yep, sit down there son.

[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.700]
They come as a surprise to you.

[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.700]
We don't read any of these bills.

[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.480]
And of course they couldn't read the bills because the bills are all in a big book.

[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.860]
It's about 7,000 pages long in a big fat book.

[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.660]
Meanwhile, Clarence Token Thomas, he's sitting there with a big fat one.

[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:36.220]
What?

[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.200]
I can't say.

[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:37.680]
Okay.

[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.020]
Speaking of disturbing stories that just never end,

[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.360]
hopefully this will be the end, but I'm sure it won't.

[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.800]
It just will never end.

[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.500]
Yesterday, we had a breathless autopsy.

[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.120]
Hopefully, we thought the last chapter of Terry and her.

[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.060]
She thought that was it, but guess what?

[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.380]
No, no, no, no.

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.720]
Nothing's ever going to pacify these people.

[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.520]
She could still, you know, get better.

[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.980]
They've got a long list of grievances, the Shimbals.

[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.700]
You know what it's called?

[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.220]
What?

[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:01.820]
They have their life?

[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:02.960]
The Shimbals.

[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:03.560]
Yeah.

[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.360]
It's called Shimbals List?

[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.460]
No, Apollo Cran.

[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:06.700]
Oh.

[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.060]
That's what I'm telling you.

[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:09.680]
That's what it's called.

[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.500]
Or to be more specific, it's called Samman's Hack of Laya.

[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.340]
That's what it's called.

[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.440]
I didn't have that cute up.

[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.640]
Anyway, an autopsy found that Terry Shavo suffered from severe and irreversible brain damage,

[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.120]
but it's done nothing this way.

[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.860]
Her parents position that she deserved to live and may have gotten better with therapy.

[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.080]
I mean, oh, let us draw you a diaphragm, folks.

[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.620]
The long awaited report yesterday found Shavo's brain had shrunk about half the normal size

[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.300]
for woman who raised when she died March 31 after her feeding.

[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.460]
Cute, with disconnected.

[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.040]
The autopsy also determined that she was blind.

[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.380]
Bob and Mary Shindra distributed the results,

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.920]
insisting their daughter interacted with them and tried to speak.

[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.820]
The attorney said the family plans to discuss the autopsy with other medical experts

[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.300]
and wait till you hear this and may take some unspecified legal action.

[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.360]
Oh my God.

[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.640]
We knew all along that Terry was profoundly brain-damaged.

[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.200]
His Shavo's brother, Bobby Shindra,

[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.400]
we simply wanted to bring her home and care for her.

[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.460]
It all goes back to this quality of life.

[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.700]
Quality of life?

[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.960]
Well, she didn't have any, but don't confuse them with that.

[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.980]
To find these vindicated Shavo's husband in his long and vitriolic battle with his in-laws

[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.900]
that engulfed the courts, Congress and the White House,

[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.880]
and then divided the country, Michael Shavo and court appointed doctors.

[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.540]
She had no hope of recovery.

[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.840]
She died at age 41.

[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.020]
The autopsy also found no evidence that Terry Shavo was strangled or otherwise abused

[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.860]
before sudden 1990 collapse, countering allegations by the Shindras

[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.140]
that she was abused by her husband.

[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.300]
He had medical examiners couldn't say for certain what caused her collapse

[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.520]
long thought to have been brought on by an evening disorder.

[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.760]
George Filo said, attorney for Michael Shavo said the findings back up

[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.440]
their contensions made for years and years that Terry Shavo had no hope of recovery.

[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.320]
He said, Michael Shavo plans to release autopsy photos of her shrunken brain.

[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.460]
Mr. Shavo has received so much criticism throughout this case.

[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.060]
I'm certain there's a part in that was pleased to hear those results

[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.120]
and the hard signs behind them, Filo said.

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.660]
The Shamblers fought their son-in-law in court over their daughters

[00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.760]
for nearly seven years battling to the end with conservative,

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.320]
lunatic right-wing maniacs at their side, including some clansmen and people like that.

[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.200]
The autopsy counters a widely seen videotape

[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.380]
the Shamblers released of Shavo in her hospice bed.

[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.720]
The video showed Shavo appearing to turn toward her mother's voice and smile.

[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.000]
She moaned and laughed.

[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.680]
Her head moved up and down and she seemed to follow the progress of a brightly colored

[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.780]
Mickey Mouse balloon.

[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.980]
Shavo's parents said that she showed she was aware of her surroundings,

[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.700]
but doctors said her reactions were automatic responses and not evident of thought or consciousness.

[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.880]
In fact, the one moment, the one time when I might have agreed was when she looked up at the

[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.720]
Mickey Mouse balloon and said, oh, I swear.

[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.260]
And that was it, so she said.

[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.220]
There is nothing in this conscious.

[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.060]
There is nothing in her autopsy report that's inconsistent with a persistent

[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.960]
vegetative state speaking of the brainstem.

[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.280]
Said Dr. Stephen J. Nelson, a medical examiner,

[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.580]
who assisted in the neurological portion of the autopsy.

[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.500]
The cause of death was dehydration from removal of the feeding.

[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.400]
You, but the underlying reason for brain damage was official.

[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.540]
This is undetermined.

[00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.280]
The autopsy included 274 external internal body images and exhaustive review.

[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.240]
A Shavo's medical records police reports and social services agency records,

[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.460]
but the family says, uh-uh.

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.000]
That's all just a pack of life.

[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:09.320]
Right.

[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.640]
She'd have been just fine.

[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.240]
We took her home and just tied her up there in a corner.

[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.160]
She'd have been fine as DIY, right?

[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:15.940]
You bet.

[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.740]
Take it for a walk.

[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.700]
Annalise 1113 at QAM.

[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.040]
What a conscious sport.

[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.680]
We need the authority to go to the lab.

[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.640]
Sport where you'll buy 16.

[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.160]
She'll be here.

[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.380]
New York.

[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:33.340]

[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:34.640]
That's it now.

[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.900]
One away bright, Jennifer Willvanks,

[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.860]
performance, guilty, and these services.

[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.640]
As the hospital, Jennifer, run and get that specimen from the lab.

[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.460]
Wow.

[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.800]
Can still drop.

[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.160]
Jennifer helps keep the highway clean.

[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.600]
Jennifer, run up and down in a state 9 to 5 and pick up all the triads.

[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:00.380]
Wow.

[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.620]
Good work.

[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.080]
Stay tuned for more.

[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.960]
Jennifer Willvanks, performance, community service.

[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.340]
Jennifer, could you run and get me a glass of water, please?

[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.700]
What a sweetheart.

[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.220]
You're going to make an excellent play.

[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.240]
Jennifer, Jennifer, 10.

[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.880]
It's 1118 at QAM.

[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.180]
We got some great news from Iraq.

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:28.880]
We'll do it.

[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.220]
We'll do it.

[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.320]
We don't have to, we got Al Zakarwi, Al.

[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.180]
We got Al Yat.

[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.500]
We got the Mule Bula Omar, Osama Yama,

[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]
any of these people.

[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.720]
But we do have Abu Taha.

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.660]
A guy.

[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.140]
The US military today reported the capture of Amanda

[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.760]
described as El-Kad is leader in the Northern Iraqi city of Mosul.

[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.080]
Air Force Brigadier General Donald Austin,

[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.100]
no relation to former Dodgers manager Walter Austin, identified him as Abu Taha,

[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.660]
whose actual name is Mohammed Kalaf-Shakar,

[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.240]
and said it was captured on Tuesday.

[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.360]
Abu Taha had?

[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.500]
Abu Taha had?

[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.580]
He's their Kinder-Ravi Shankar.

[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.560]
Taha has been one of Abu Mussab al-Zakarwi's most trusted operations agents in Iraq.

[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.640]
Austin said this is a major defeat for the El-Kad organization in Iraq.

[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.060]
No more reports indicate any where he's suicide vest 24 hours a day,

[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.680]
and stated that he would never surrender.

[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.820]
Instead, he gave up without a fight.

[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.260]
You're fair.

[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.240]
I don't like that, huh?

[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.560]
I'll talk, no action.

[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.460]
Bapapapapapapapa, then when first game to show up, you're fair.

[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.080]
Waste out.

[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.160]
Okay.

[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.040]
No problem.

[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:24.460]
No shoot.

[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.740]
We're talking gambling today.

[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.520]
Of course, now the golf thing is got none.

[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.480]
The josh is going to like bust my balls because spades.

[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.360]
Spades has got the two and golf has got none.

[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.360]
Oh, spades are flying.

[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:36.700]
You'll see.

[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.820]
You're crazy.

[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:38.480]
It's big.

[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.540]
Everybody's like this.

[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:39.960]
Yeah.

[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.500]
Uh, golf doesn't have any for two reasons.

[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:46.260]
Number one, people who would be betting on it are out there playing it and betting on it right now.

[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:50.120]
And number two, the golfing, I have alienated the golfing community over the years,

[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.920]
and I'm very glad about it.

[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:52.760]
I'm proud of it.

[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:53.180]
Aren't you?

[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:53.800]
Oh yeah.

[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.680]
I just, I mean, to me, it's just such an enormous waste of time.

[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.760]
Number one, and number two, of course, watching other people play golf.

[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.220]
That means just absolutely.

[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.000]
Oh, 515 votes on the poll.

[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.100]
What's your favorite form of gambling?

[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:05.840]
I don't gamble.

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:06.620]
I've been 21.

[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.380]
That's 23.4%.

[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.000]
You know what I mean?

[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.200]
George, that means that 76.6% do gamble.

[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.200]
Some, you know, yeah, we're not asking are you a compulsive gambler?

[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.380]
Are you betting the mortgage?

[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.700]
Are you a plunging your gut set?

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.500]
Are you up to your earlobes and debt because you're a compulsive gambler?

[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.360]
And what the phone number for GAAA?

[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:28.840]

Good luck here.

[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.940]
I'm going to write over to give you some assistance.

[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.560]
Okay, with a fully reloaded piece.

And remember that conversation we had last week?

[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.040]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.820]
And we were nothing.

[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.140]
Somebody faxed me the rules when I just,

[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.260]
yeah, then I called in and said,

[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.820]
Well, just go to a Vegas and go to a table and they'll explain the house.

[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.360]
I was, I was, please.

[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.760]

The big, oh, how do you like that?

[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.400]
I don't get it.

[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.160]
I don't know.

[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.640]
I'm, I'm, I'm ecstatic.

[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.240]
I feel a lot better about life in general for you.

[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.320]
But I'm just amazed that there is a one person

[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.600]
this audience has gotten sucked in,

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.620]
especially with all the internet's kind of people we got.

[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.180]
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.

[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:30.920]
Hey, Neil.

[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:31.520]
Hey, Jordan.

[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:32.260]
Yo, yo.

[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.720]
Hey, do you remember a, a, a plane dice in the bathroom?

[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:35.800]
Do I remember what?

[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.600]
A plane dice in the bathroom?

[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.220]
A plane dice in the bathroom.

[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.880]
Just this morning.

[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:40.360]
Yeah.

[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.440]
How about in the, a, in the family room?

[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.280]
There you go.

[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.140]
Okay, good luck to you, Palli.

[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.500]
He's, please find something in the bathroom.

[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.260]
I don't think I should do with the, uh, it's crap.

[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:49.700]
Yep.

[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.960]
Pitch the, uh, that's what he's plan.

[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.320]
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.

[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.060]
Yeah, I'm a fucking billion man.

[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.820]
That was the segway to the last crawler.

[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.940]
That is, everybody's, but I always would.

[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.660]
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.

[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.300]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.140]
Okay, sir.

[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.400]
Good, listen, the help Josh out,

[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.620]
they think I'd go to two far because mostly plays like guys in jail or in prison.

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.180]
Really?

[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.100]
We're big and poor.

[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.260]
Everyone that I've ever known.

[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.920]
That's not in jail or case audience would be a tune in.

[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.920]
And then we have, we have, have any votes already?

[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:25.080]
Yeah, but around the biggest, um, the one thing I like to gamble about,

[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.480]
I don't know if you can figure out poker now,

[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.780]
but I call the other card game.

[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.540]
You know, three cards is care being said, you know, the go for it.

[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.400]
I mean, I spent the week out there and I think it those part tables.

[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.580]
I mean, I guess there are sort of, uh, sort of kind of poker,

[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.640]
but they aren't really poker, you know, because they got their own tables too, you know?

[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.120]
Yeah.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.000]
That's what I like to do.

[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.040]
I mean, I mean, the conesters, that was it.

[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.500]
I just saw that might be something different than poker, you know.

[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.180]
Yeah, we got to lump it all in together otherwise we'll have like 75 different forms of poker.

[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.700]
Okay, we'd like to, I have no idea what he said.

[01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.320]
You'd ever put it in?

[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.200]
I didn't understand what he said.

[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.820]
I told Dr. Chipotle that Texas hold him on there.

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.220]
He did not.

[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:02.880]
Probably a good idea.

[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.520]
Don't put it on there.

[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:03.800]
I know.

[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.620]
Oh, there's a hundred to one different poker's.

[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.220]
Yeah, right.

[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.040]
Poker is poker.

[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.280]
Okay, we don't give a crap.

[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.460]
You know what that would be like?

[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.880]
That would be like saying slots that you'd like wheel of four to you.

[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.940]
Like claiming sevens like a...

[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:15.200]
Right.

[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.800]
Well, you know, which one you want to play?

[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.120]
I stay away from those flaming sevens like the flaming eights.

[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.340]
No, that isn't interesting thing and I realize it's very boring to people who don't play

[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:23.680]
the slots.

[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:29.380]
But what, you know, I mean, what is it that attracts people to different, you know, to different

[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:33.860]
things because I noticed that the same people always play the same games, including me.

[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.000]
I only play wheel of four to once in a while.

[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.560]
I'll play that mega bucks.

[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.900]
You know, where they have the multi-million dollar jackpots, which is a sucker bet, I guess.

[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.060]
A couple of times I've done pretty good on it.

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.980]
One, one, a few bucks, not mega bucks, but a few bucks.

[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.100]
But you see what I'm saying?

[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.340]
What is it that attracts people to like certain games in a casino?

[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.680]
The look of it, the colors.

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.580]
Right.

[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.820]
I mean, that's a lot of them.

[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:55.460]
Yeah, the sound.

[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:55.620]
Wheel.

[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.540]
Oh, torture, that kind of sound, that mesmerizing sound.

[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.520]
And of course, and if you're smart, as soon as that music starts, you slam the button and

[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.580]
make sure it stops right away.

[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.480]
You know the music I'm talking about?

[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:05.860]
Right.

[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.960]
The Wheel of Four to music.

[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:07.920]
You heard that.

[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:08.760]
Yeah, right.

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.000]
You just slam that button and just shut it off right away.

[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:11.700]
I don't want to hear that.

[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.120]
You maniacs.

[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.080]
Dominique, you way in.

[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:14.300]
Hello.

[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.520]
Close eye sound movie.

[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.000]
I guess that you're on the pole.

[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.400]
Okay, three times.

[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.200]
Pull out trigger.

[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.860]
Seven times just to be safe.

[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.060]
Dominique, you way in.

[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:24.960]
Not there on one.

[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.380]
That one needs some serious health.

[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.340]
Dominique, you way in.

[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:27.580]
Hello.

[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.960]
Hey, Oknail.

[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:29.860]
So I'll tell you what.

[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.580]
What about the game, Yooker?

[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.440]
You know this?

[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.160]
Yooker.

[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:33.880]
Yooker.

[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.020]
Yooker is a very cool game.

[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:35.520]
Yeah.

[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.900]
What is Yooker?

[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.620]
It's like a bobby yooker.

[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.380]
It's like space, but using all the suits.

[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.540]
How do you spell it?

[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.540]
E-U-C-R-E.

[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.600]
It's like a midwestern game.

[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.580]
A lot of other people.

[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:47.820]
A lot of other people.

[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.560]
People down here know about it.

[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.520]
Oh yeah, Yooker.

[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:50.940]
Okay.

[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.740]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.720]
My pleasure.

[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.980]
People who play it are called...

[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.140]
Let's see Yooker on there right away.

[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:55.580]
What do you say?

[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.320]
People who play it are called Yookerists.

[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.200]
Are they really?

[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:58.580]
No.

[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.600]
I thought they were called crazy volugenists.

[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.520]
Anyway, a blackjack is winning.

[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.700]
I mean, I don't gamble as winning, but that's like, you know, that's just a cop out of you.

[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.140]
Don't gamble.

[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.360]
Okay, we don't care.

[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.660]
We're not trying to like talk you into it.

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.580]
Although that online gaming stuff is really a good way to lose your ass.

[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.900]
Still has no votes.

[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.760]
Golf has none.

[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.160]
An online gaming you've gotten on.

[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.120]
You believe that.

[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.080]
In this vast audience of ours, I realize it's the dog days of the summer.

[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.820]
And most of our people with a half of brain are $10 or out of town.

[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.120]
But nevertheless, golf and online gambling have got the big none.

[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:26.480]

[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.060]
Maybe we got it like...

[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.480]
I'll give out some websites where people can lose all their money today.

[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.260]
All these golf things are like 40 billion.

[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.860]
We've got the biggest personnel in the world.

[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.300]
And there are 20 awardgers and BJS sentencing.

[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.960]
Sports radio fighters deeply.

[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.620]
Q and M...

[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:45.960]
destin,

[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.020]

[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.060]
EC elements got smashed,

[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.620]
She raised her little crown,

[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:07.620]

[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.020]
And I, school lover, I'm not found.

[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.120]
It happened when she realized

[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.580]
she raised her little crown,

[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.500]
but her voice has already found her.

[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.700]
She kissed me,

[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.380]
old and crappy,

[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.640]
and she raised her voice

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.280]
and she said that she kissed a troublemaker

[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.480]
and she said,

[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.440]
some bricks,

[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.620]
no one ever said they want no boys.

[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.160]
What's like she's carrying an unfoldable between her thighs and eyes?

[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.860]
But he tells me now

[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.600]
she's got the features for her.

[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.740]
And then she always says,

[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.340]
she's wiggling when she saw

[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:07.920]
a lover who shed money fell tonight.

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.980]
We gave a short voice

[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.000]
and shed voice

[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.460]
not a song to me

[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.320]
who's having fun

[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.080]
to be rich in fact

[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.140]
and smell just like the magic star

[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.840]
that's the thing

[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:28.960]
that's the point

[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.780]
that the sign is for

[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:34.240]
not a bad day with money

[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.500]
fell tonight.

[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.700]
Love a 32 and 560

[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.820]
look at that, they got the old

[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.180]
Q and his nose there

[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.660]
that Edgar Ray Killing

[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.500]
that Killing Guy.

[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.460]
And what's he'll put out here, Mitha Pippi?

[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.580]
So I just went online just out of curiosity

[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.860]
and I looked up Yooker.

[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.380]
Now I'm not going to give the website up

[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.440]
because I don't want to be in any way

[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.400]
shape or form, be responsible for anybody

[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.080]
out there losing their ass and blaming me.

[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.540]
Oh, did you give that website up?

[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.240]
We lost our ass or we won a lot of money

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.400]
we never could collect, whatever.

[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.080]
I am not involved.

[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.520]
But I looked at him right away.

[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.520]
Here's a free Yooker download.

[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.700]
Play Yooker by Yooker.

[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.980]

[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.120]

You'll have more fun that you can shake a frozen

[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:15.980]
canoes man.

[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.940]
Forged in the furnace of lore, hardwood Yooker

[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.100]
blends classic card game play and

[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.740]
storybook appeal together in one

[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.200]
finally polished game.

[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.420]
This is hardwood Yooker as opposed to the

[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.100]

[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:42.700]
real life.

[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.640]
I don't get it.

[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.880]
But the good news is that the only one that

[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.880]
want to encourage it. It's bad.

[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.200]
Really bad. You'll go to hell.

Online gaming's got rock saw.

[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.200]
The big bow.

[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:33.520]
Nothing.

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.960]
That's shocking.

[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.240]
Yeah, a little.

[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.280]
I saw all those websites in there.

[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:50.420]
I thought, boy, there must be a lot of people out there

[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.220]
who are not in front of you with it.

[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.860]
That business about every time I win,

[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.720]
because you know, has an excuse to run out to pay me.

[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.700]
What's that all about?

[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.500]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.760]
Yes, sir. How you doing?

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.180]
Yeah, I just heard you all talking earlier about the plot.

[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.420]
I was in Vegas every year.

[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.140]
I just got back about a week ago.

[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.440]
And I'll tell you something.

[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.820]
After that wheel, it made some big hit.

[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.960]
We went like three or four over the scene.

[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.100]
And I just can't believe they got the prices right now out there.

[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.320]
They got to make it.

[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.880]
Let's make a deal, Jeffrey.

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.480]
And now they're also getting through all the old comic TV shows.

[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.780]
I dream a genie.

[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.000]
You couldn't get on that machine.

[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.200]
I mean, I'm nickel-flot.

[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.200]
I dream a genie.

[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.560]
People don't think I'm a nickel-flot, right?

[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.220]
But they're expensive.

[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.200]
And people like...

[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.640]
You can't afford a real phone.

[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.640]
You must have lost your ass in Vegas.

[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.440]
Come back at a real phone, because I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say.

[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.720]
Well, he had a bad phone.

[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.240]
OK, he lost his ass out there.

[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.020]
You know how that goes.

[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.900]
He's probably got two tomato soup cans, two Campbell soup cans,

[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:50.980]
and a tin wire storm.

[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.920]
He doesn't like to play the floss.

[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.060]
What?

[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.080]
He doesn't like to play the floss.

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.700]
That's not what he was saying.

[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.880]
He was knocking a lot of these stupid ass games.

[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:00.660]
That's what he was saying.

[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:01.440]
How do you know?

[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.260]
See, you're just like putting words in his mouth.

[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:12.420]

[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:12.740]
You know, he was.

[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.280]
I couldn't tell what that good phone was.

[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.120]
You could hear it, but...

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.320]
Right.

[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.480]
That's true.

[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.720]
They got a slot machines now after every damn show.

[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.340]
Of course, that's their challenge.

[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.280]
They keep coming up with new and more interesting things to get people hooked on that stuff.

[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.220]
That's what it's all about.

[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.240]
And then you go in there and you pick your poison.

[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.240]
And like I said, I see the same people playing the flaming.

[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.360]
Sevens the same...

[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.600]
Play-mourning.

[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.620]
Sevens the same group of us who play Wheel of Fortune.

[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.880]
I mean, we got like a little fraternity there.

[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.300]
It's... I see this...

[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.360]
You'd be amazed.

[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.260]
And some of these people who I know lose their ass on a very regular basis.

[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.420]
And I wondered myself, how can a schlepper like that be showing up here all the time?

[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.360]
And they're probably thinking the same about me, you know?

[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.600]
Yeah. Maybe it's smart.

[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:52.800]
Maybe it's smart.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.920]
Maybe it's smart like him be coming here all the time.

[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.960]
Maybe that's why there's schleppers.

[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.480]
Oh, Mr. Pension was here the other day.

[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.060]
Oh yeah?

[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.980]
The other person's got a new horror story.

[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.700]
I said, well, good. I just don't want to hear about it.

[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.620]
Okay, the guy that shows up doesn't gamble anymore.

[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.040]
Everybody might be once in a while, you know? He pretends he doesn't.

[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.820]
But he doesn't. He just hangs around and gives people advice and sits next to him.

[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.500]
And he just holds teats for people, you know?

[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.100]
Do you want to go take a leak and he's there?

[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.660]
He's always a good... He just saved my seat. He's a sea-warmer.

[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.540]
Yeah, excellent.

[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.040]
Very, very strange.

[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:21.960]
WQI in Hello.

[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.900]
And not there on five. Okay, our calls are running low. That's good.

[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.540]
Because I like I told you I've got a very heavy pile.

[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.960]
In fact, I got off the Prepp H extra strength.

[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.940]
56670560, pound 560 and he's rising in the single-terrall's line.

[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.600]
I just hope that I would call back.

[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.160]
Because I think he might have had a point. I'm really not sure what it was.

[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.040]
Maybe he doesn't know either.

[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.140]
Everybody QA in Hello.

[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.600]
Yeah, hello.

[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:42.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.000]
Hey, Nelly. What's up? I got one for your poll, buddy.

[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:45.700]
Another one?

[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.520]
Yeah. Most of them on there.

[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.780]
For me, you rely too heavily on luck and chance.

[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.960]
But Billured is one of my favorite forms of gambling.

[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:55.640]
Okay.

[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.100]
All right.

[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.400]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.480]
Mr. Graspedz, all this time in the old pool hall.

[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.200]
Billured's.

[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:01.500]
Right.

[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.000]
You should have tried that other formation.

[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:03.620]
It makes sense to me.

[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.780]
People that I'm bigger. Some people that I'm bigger. Some people that I'm bigger.

[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.640]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.640]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:20.080]

[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:20.080]

[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:20.340]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:20.380]

[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:20.620]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.620]

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.620]

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.620]

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.620]

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.620]

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:20.740]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.220]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:22.420]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:22.420]

[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.180]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.000]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.000]

[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.840]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:29.980]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.700]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.760]
I'm bigger.

[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:54.900]
Is there anybody on the board?

[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:01.120]
Somebody talking to me?

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:01.420]
I'm just getting a new picture on the board.

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:01.540]

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.300]
ino soon.

[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.620]
I'm big.

[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:05.740]
Well, you understand that putting that into your bed is a good task

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:05.740]

[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800]
Lisa?

[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800]
Four?

[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.660]
Exactly. Wouldn't you be like nervous about collecting if you ever won anything?

[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.780]
I actually on the sports betting I did win a little bit and they did pay. It didn't pay.

[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.420]
It took them like two weeks to send me a

[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:19.060]
uh, like wire test for check, but it didn't pay. But the uh, on the poker, you lose one

[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:24.320]
equitably and and you better get out. Hey man. Good good move pal. Thanks. All right.

[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:28.600]
He removed the program right away. That was an excellent move. Okay. Don't take a chance. Okay.

[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.600]
Don't take no chance with that money. Come out of your pants. Believe you me.

[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.440]
Just uh, when in doubt, don't check that out. Stay on the... In fact, you know something I just heard

[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.180]
the business. That's the thing is online gaming. That's right. Never heard of it. There is no such thing.

[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.680]
In fact, I don't think there's any such thing as the internet. I think Al Gore just made it up.

[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.640]
The water dance? WQAM. Hello. Hit rock.

[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:54.920]
Sorry. Oh yeah. Here we go. Russian roulette expert. Gilbert.

[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.460]
Coke bottle eyes. You heard it already fell. I was going to go with Coke bottle eyes.

[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.460]
When it comes to it, the team. You're a good job, Gilbert. You're in my head, too.

[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.100]
Now another one. One or two more. You're pretty a 5-16. You ready? Yeah.

[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:14.800]
Are you among the millions suffering from tension, stress, or occasional boredom? Well, now there's

[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.740]
help with weed from 420 pharmaceuticals. Ask your doctor if weed is right for you.

[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.960]
Possible side effects of weed include coughing, wheezing cotton mouth, sudden thirst, high eyes,

[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.860]
giggling, rambling, cunquer pants, a deeper appreciation of cartoons,

[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:34.820]
Twinkies playing for speed and downloading fish comics from 1997. Relaxation that is in the bay with weed.

[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.260]
It's 145, 560 WQAM. We got Moa, 2, we got Mad Dog, it's Bruce Rume and Pompato,

[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:44.820]
with 4, Goliath 7 o'clock tonight. And Edike, 10. No, Marlins game today.

[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.140]
That's right. They're on the way to the West Coast.

[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.320]
They're on the way to the West Coast. They're on the way to the LA Angels of Anaheim of Orange County.

[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.080]
Oh, what is that all about? I mean, talk about stupid.

[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.760]
Couldn't be, you know, Anaheim Angels, that wasn't good enough. And then the LA Angels,

[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:03.380]
that wasn't good enough. So now it's the LA Angels of Anaheim. Oh, LAA. Give me a break,

[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:09.680]
as opposed to LAD, eh? Do not, whatever you do, go to online slots, do not do a search on that,

[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.100]
do not look at it, do not, you know, Eric warned me a long time ago about websites. Yeah.

[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:18.440]
And he's right. He's got an excellent point. You can look at a website and it can look like the

[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:24.140]
most really beautiful, very legitimate authentic, you know what I'm saying? And it means nothing.

[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:29.620]
Anybody can do that. Any con artist, any favorite child can put together really fancy,

[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.100]
fancy authentic looking, authoritative looking the website. It means nothing. So just because it

[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:40.060]
looks really, very, very complicated and authentic and fancy and colorful, that doesn't mean that

[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:45.180]
you're going to get paid. That isn't some shy locks sitting behind the computer somewhere, right?

[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:51.140]
So don't go look at it that because my goodness, there's just 80 zinni in the nose on there.

[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:54.780]
So thank goodness we've only got two people so far in this audience. Let's say two,

[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.140]
the same people who play spades, who gamble on spades, gamble online and backerat and the bridge,

[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:07.460]
Miss Crub, bridge and my Zhang and Kanasta and Jin, Jin Romney. Or maybe they're just like this as

[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.540]
well as maybe they're just rinking the gin. The interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo Bay

[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.760]
to 10th and centimony 2000 two triggered concerns among senior Pentagon officials that they could

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.620]
face criminal prosecution on a US anti-torture laws. ABC News has learned notes from a series of

[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:26.680]
meetings in the Pentagon early 2003 obtained by ABC News show that Albertta Moore, a general

[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.720]
council of the Navy, warned us appears that they might be breaking the law. Oh my god.

[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.860]
During a January 2003 meeting involving top Pentagon lawyer William Haines and other officials,

[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:40.520]
the memo shows that more are warned that use of coercive techniques has military, legal and

[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:46.180]
political implication has international implication and exposes us to liability and criminal prosecution.

[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.660]
Oh my god. More as deep concerns about interrogations that get more of the known but is not

[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:55.220]
his warning that top officials could go to prison. You're going down. In another meeting held

[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.280]
March 8 2003 the group of top Pentagon lawyers concluded according to the memo we need a presidential

[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.420]
letter approving the use of the controversial interrogation to cover those whom of us who may be

[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:09.300]
called upon to use them. No such letter was ever issued. Yesterday the White House insisted the

[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.220]
tactics used to get more are now and have been legal. All interrogation techniques that have

[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.540]
been approved are lawful and consistent with our obligation said White House press secretary

[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:21.260]
Scott McClellan who's famous of course for always pedaling out to the media. A pack of life.

[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:25.580]
In another internal memo obtained by ABC News a Navy psychologist observing the interrogation

[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:30.740]
warned that the tactics used against Mohammed Al-Katani dubbed the 20th hijacker reveal the tendency

[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:37.780]
to become increasingly more aggressive without having a definite boundary. Secretary

[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:42.480]
Al-Katani had produced results. Katani and other detainees have provided valuable information

[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.680]
including insights into al-Qaeda planning for 9-11 including recruiting and logistics

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.620]
he said during a phoning news conference. Human rights lawyers say Moira was right to raise

[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.220]
objections to what disappears were doing. It is clear that individuals who engage in abusive

[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:59.300]
treatment of this nature may be criminally liable for the conduct they engage in said Deborah

[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.040]
Pearlsteen direct of the U.S. law and security program at Human Rights first. So if I were one of

[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.900]
the troops who was being asked to conduct interrogations using those techniques I would certainly want

[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.800]
to ask my lawyer whether he thought this was legal. She'd be saying how do you like that?

[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.940]
So while you're attorneys out there at Gitmo all you soldiers you better get you in attorney

[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:21.680]
and all you attorneys out there all you ambulance cases there's a whole new field for you right there

[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.300]
right? Gitmo money. Gitmo right to the table. I have to count on a hop on a plane and fly to Cuba

[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:30.060]
right away get over to Gitmo or just get that guy for a lottery to crank up that DC3 again.

[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.100]
You see the people in the hood are saying that they've been complaining about that plane

[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.580]
long before it crashed that it was like overloaded all the time and read a huffin and puffin

[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.920]
and chucking and making enormous amounts of noise in the hood every time it took off and they

[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.420]
were like always already really whipped up and were frenzy before that crash. I just mentioned that

[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.760]
I mean we're glad everybody you know it's still alive but nevertheless that's not nobody got hurt.

[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:55.260]
There you go. What's your favorite form of gambling? I don't gamble 148 Blackjack 87 Pokers

[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:03.420]

Fuck third man. We're like 23 Russian we're like 21 keep going.

[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:12.520]
Yeah but I was just thinking the interesting thing about that misfit is this and that is that

[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.180]
we do the screenless on here he can get on anytime he wants and does and he really had anything to say

[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.940]
I let him say it but the bottom line is you don't have anything to say wacko.

[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.040]
So we can get all that out of shape about you're the one that doesn't want him on or I'm

[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.300]
Hitler or whatever but the fact that is that that's all you do you used to be the F-word he's

[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:36.600]
really a stepped up announcer too for me but now he's like and that's it that's even even

[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.180]
Prozac Ron has got more material than you got okay the different line every time that's right

[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.520]

prison camp Abu Gharr it made me that it's too hot to handle for Congress made me that it's too

[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.980]
complex to handle for Congress or maybe that Congress wants to sit back as we customarily do

[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:40.040]
said Arlen Magic Bullets specter Republican of Pennsylvania he said his panel for testimony on

[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:45.080]
practice and policies at get mo but in any way Congress has an act that he said the hearing came

[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.280]
against a backdrop of growing reports of US abuse Senator Patrick Leahy of Ramothi Senior

[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.360]
Democrat on the committee called a president international embarrassment to our nation to our

[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.420]
ideals and remains a festering threat to our security and of course he is absolutely correct

fundamentalist wait to do this I mean it's not surprising but it's very disturbing those groups

[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.460]
that this other caller was talking about two calls back they're all in here leaders of conservative

[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.880]

[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.140]
who unquestionably best represented their views and priorities god if we could only bring Hitler

[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:57.740]
back now Gary Vauer president of American value said in the interview that these sit-down

[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.340]
sessions likely to begin after the 2006 midterm elections would be a very effective way to nail

[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:08.580]
down where people are on cultural issues you know like bags and abortions and abortions and bags

[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.260]
he said candidates have become very and of course system cell researchers research he said

[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:17.200]
candidates have become very astute in answering written questionnaires in ways that avoid making firm

[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.780]
commitments those who plan to participate include leading figures of the Christian right James

[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:26.880]

[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:40.460]

lobbying to restrict abortion ban same sex marriage and confirm conservative right wing fundamentalist

supreme court justice's evangelical Christians who overwhelmingly backed L president in 2004

[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.660]
already had an influential constituency of the Republican Party no Schmidt coordinated action

[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:05.220]
could increase that influence especially any crowded GOP primary field it would have an impact

[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:09.560]
Republican strategist Charles I'm not black said but being seen as the candidate of a Christian

[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.920]
right would be a very very mixed blessing in the general election since Stewart Rothenberg of the

[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.240]
nonpartisan Rothenberg political report a candor water mondayl stamp is the candidate of labor in

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.320]
the 84 campaign that would really pigeonhole a candidate Rothenberg said Perkins both favorably

[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.700]
of one likely Republican presidential contender senate majority leader Bill Fist of Tennessee

[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.200]
and dismissal of another Arizona senator John McCain who certainly not far business enough for them

[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.500]
he criticized as the bipartisan committee or compromise that McCain and 13 other senators

[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:40.900]
replaced month who were very showed on judicial filibusters Perkins said those who joined were so

[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.900]

almond poor with a smart honor had because she's in Iran now they could just as easily be

[01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:56.530]
photographing her like inside the studio somewhere inside of a building i feel like yeah just like

[01:28:56.530 --> 01:29:00.270]
being regular but no she's got to be out there in the street with a schmata honor yeah you don't

[01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:04.390]

[01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:10.050]
five news you mean there's a sport what happened to the sports come on the next

[01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:14.410]

nobody's still god he is still god that's what i hear it oh god i thought kacy well them was god

[01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:23.510]

[01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:28.650]
you get a warning that's a long time ago i remember kacy well then yes you do that's good how about

[01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:33.670]
wanky yeah what's your favorite for i'm not going to read the poll result i'm tired of it we got

[01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:37.510]
those we got twenty three percent of this audience don't gamble and we salute them okay it's

[01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:40.810]
hard to make that money don't just give it away okay a fool of his money are soon farted

[01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:44.130]
don't ever forget that but i mean if you just want to go for a little bit of recreation and

[01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:48.830]
plunge a few thousand nothing wrong with that right right so jay says so you're not going to

[01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.990]
Vegas again that's good that's a good thing because if you did go out there you'd be tempted you

[01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:56.150]
be plunged in you'd be a you know because of my bad influence you'd probably take a couple

[01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:59.630]
hundred and sit down there at the wheel of fortune and put it in there and maybe hit like three thousand

[01:29:59.630 --> 01:30:02.970]
on the line say you know this is really good yeah i probably would sit at the black end that would

[01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:08.590]
be really bad unless you just quit right there i know people like that who just uh in fact weren't

[01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:13.550]
you tell me about somebody uh we're just doesn't know how to quit no no somebody got lucky once and they

[01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:17.110]
just walked away and they never made another bet maybe the cab driver was telling about that just

[01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:23.190]
walk away yeah my god friend who who hit the ten g's that was right one pull one pull that was it

[01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:32.090]
what was he pulling the lever i say are you serious one pulling one ten grand ten grand oh i can't

[01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:37.370]
stand that i mean there's one thing to be lucky that that's disgusting that is yeah keep

[01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:42.990]
inducing so maybe whatever machini hit it on the person that was playing before was still around

[01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:46.730]
you know and maybe punched their guts out there and poured all kinds of money and it is lost

[01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:50.710]
their ass and as they're walking away they see your friend come up and put in the couple of

[01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:57.050]
points uh your friends that that's a good machine for us happens to all of us two different times

[01:30:57.050 --> 01:31:01.150]
at the five dollar wheel of fortune i have moved from one machine to another and had somebody sit down

[01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:06.610]
right next to me within like 60 seconds it has been for five grand right next to me how do you

[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:13.990]
like that i don't get up five six out of five sixty if it look it just happens case a ross

[01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:19.450]
or you know you can't second guess yourself just keep y'all i'm written upward and forward and downward

[01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:24.890]
blackjack seems to be the winner and why not because it's easy to play so you don't understand i always

[01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:29.070]
always had to feed the note was fixed well i always did and he said that about that

[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:33.690]
thing i just always had to feed that it was rigged i just i don't know every time you start getting

[01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:38.210]
really hot and win in hand after hand and they change the dealer and along come somebody with like

[01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:44.250]
a mark deck or something i don't know what it is w-e-q-a-m hello hey nil this is my philosophy or

[01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:48.970]
strategy on flawed machines you play at the indians for about three weeks yeah absolutely no

[01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:54.010]
chance of winning because they take out 50 percent okay good five six seven oh five sixty

[01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:58.990]
pound five sixty and they've arrived in singular wireless lines when you i guess it's during the

[01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:02.470]
lunch hour maybe that's when these people it was the same yesterday yeah well when the people

[01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:06.330]
across the street they must have nothing else to do maybe we can get some food the food sent

[01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:10.750]
over there for them so they could eat could afford to eat as opposed to be calling us that'd be

[01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:17.790]
a good idea w-e-q-a-m hello q-a-m hello that sounds as silent that's about the nicest sound i've

[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:25.990]
heard in a very long time in it i mean completely clean line yeah w-e-q-a-m hello q-a-m

[01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:32.550]
yeah nil yes sir yeah you're absolutely right about the one-arm bandit i did the same thing on

[01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:37.350]
the yacht on the cruise ship one woman was playing she's the only one playing the one-arm bandit

[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:41.770]
she got up and left i went down sat down quarter i got four dollars i'm right nice gone

[01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:48.430]
she went she went to the zirk yeah really oh she went to the manager right you're lucky like

[01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:53.810]
a split with her you're lucky she's a boy your crab boy split it with her yeah right oh listen

[01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:59.230]
there are people around casinos by the way who will pull that crap uh oh yeah there are all

[01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.990]
kind of stuff that goes on you know you want my machine okay and then they'll like a standard

[01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:07.750]
50 minutes you hit like two or three grand okay well uh how about six seven hundred six seven

[01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:13.510]
hundred what i'll split something yeah your brain if you had one your mama that's what i have

[01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:17.890]
for you your mom and i'll get lost get out of here i didn't drag you out of the chair you loser

[01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:23.850]
you piece of crap you w-o-o-n hello hey welcome the ill uh yes sir what's in the show intervention

[01:33:23.850 --> 01:33:28.570]
people different addictions yeah came to the conclusion that gambling is the worst

[01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:33.610]
vice only because like if you're an alcoholic or a crackhead or whatever at least you're taking

[01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:38.230]
something physically into your body that you're addicted to that if they remove that you can get

[01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:43.130]
over it but gambling these degenerate gamblers will sit there and even if they win they'll stay

[01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:47.630]
till they lose all their money it's that's nice yeah so not a bit oh well it's like the guy in

[01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:51.810]
owning the honey in that movie which was a true story he won he won like nine million dollars he

[01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:56.170]
was ten million in debt he won nine million on a really hot wild night and he lost every time of

[01:33:56.170 --> 01:34:01.590]
it back oh it's the worst and then on the show intervention the gamblers were the only ones that

[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:07.010]
a didn't want help or if they did they leave treatment after five six days and go back to the

[01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:10.570]
five year understand why it's like it in the same movie he keeps saying why don't have a

[01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:15.150]
gambling problem i have a financial problem uh yeah just ridiculous so in other words he didn't have

[01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:19.550]
he just didn't have enough money to keep perpetuating his habit i just always considered it the worst

[01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:23.690]
advice i'm glad i don't gamble but you know something and you maybe inspire me to go out to

[01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:27.490]
wood buy me today thanks a lot of family take it easy now the gamble for you how's that all right

[01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:33.010]
i i don't look at it as a vice it's like anything else i mean drinking isn't a vice unless

[01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:36.950]
you overdue it the animal isn't a vice unless you overdue it that a vice looks you have to huh

[01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:41.730]
it's not a vice unless you have to do it right a little wacky gong jaint that's not a bad unless

[01:34:41.730 --> 01:34:44.750]
you overdue it unless you're obsessed with it and you said they're picking seeds out of your

[01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:50.450]
weed and out of your wherever all day it's like it's like anything else in moderation right ice cream

[01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:54.990]
isn't a uh vice unless you overdue it correct correct that's right but like when you're eating two

[01:34:54.990 --> 01:35:00.230]
three points four meters a day for quite a while diabetic at over 60 see i disagree with what he

[01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:04.730]
said too because the things that you're doing with heroin and coconut stuff it's physically debilitating

[01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.970]
you destroy your body i mean just take a look at David crossbeef he's just standing right but

[01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:13.410]
and gambling if you could afford it then you know big no nobody even if you can't afford it at least

[01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:18.130]
you're still at least still you have to help me now maybe emotionally you're a basket case

[01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:23.470]
but physically at least you still got your health right it's a trip so let's all get online and

[01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:27.670]
let's plunger guts out not don't ever do it okay don't ever point your figure of me say

[01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:32.950]
need a Rogers is the one it's not ever got in fact the internet does not exist there are no online

[01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:38.390]
gaming places and do not look up slot machines online because they all look very glitzy and fancy and

[01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:43.010]
play like 80 million games and you'll never see your money and we had one person in here that

[01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:46.430]
cross that the one guy said in a couple of weeks he got his money from that one online thing right

[01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:50.870]
in a couple of weeks maybe they got maybe they're lucky in the side that pay a few people off make it

[01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:55.510]
look good 12 13 if in fact you know something i think we just came up with a great idea let's let's

[01:35:55.510 --> 01:36:00.550]
just like Halliburton does with those offshore phony offices let's open up a place like in a

[01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:04.190]
rubah and pretend we're going down to investigate that sounds great they don't have any crime down there

[01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:09.130]
right although they do have gambling and and we can have our own offshore online gambling

[01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:13.130]

Wilma and later allegations that limbo engaged in doctor shopping for prescriptions the former

[01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:16.450]

[01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:47.010]
inquirer has to say assistance data attorney James March told Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Thomas

[01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:51.450]
Barkdall that the records could show that the conservative radio host engaged in doctor shopping

[01:40:51.450 --> 01:40:55.230]
secretly obtaining overlapping prescriptions from different doctors in one month after the

[01:40:55.230 --> 01:40:59.270]
client stopped selling to him there was a definitive start today prescription medications that

[01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:02.630]

will soon rule on which records if any prosecutors can review black saw to have the

[01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:24.970]
words ruled invalid by Barkdall the judge who approved them in the first place black

[01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:28.510]
contents and investigators misled the judge and they're validated outlining the allegations to

[01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:31.690]
support the ones Barkdall rejected the argument but black and raised it again

[01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:36.030]
March said the prosecutors want all the records regardless of the time that they cover

[01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:39.530]
in this case the investigators didn't know whether the things that were shown to you in the

[01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:43.170]
affidavit were the sum total of violations what they did know is that they showed a pattern of

[01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:49.670]

46 mr. Jackson later settled that case for a reported 20 million dollars mr. meser o now says

[01:43:50.710 --> 01:43:55.230]
the singer received bad advice and should have gone to trial why would you not end this mr.

[01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:20.110]
and the way in bicycle like right we'll even take a low end or uh you know hind end a man who won

[01:50:20.110 --> 01:50:24.290]
that jackpot Brad Dukeley 33 year old regional fitness director for a health club chain and

Brad we like you a lot you're the kind of guy we want to get to know we want to be real close

[01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:37.350]
personal friends viewers right since obviously he doesn't have any desire to like go on by a whole

[01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:42.610]
bunch of other expensive stuff right one better opportunity to have than me at my age with this

[01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:46.770]
money to build a billion dollar empire to take care of my family and give opportunities to the people

[01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:50.330]
who have given me opportunities you told the AP on Wednesday hey Brad if you'd like to invest it

[01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:54.150]
with a guy who knows how to make some serious money send it over here and like a brown paper bag

[01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:59.390]
Duke chose to take a one-time payment of 125.3 million rather than 30

[01:50:59.390 --> 01:51:04.670]
about 30 man annual installments of 7.4 million he would receive about 85 million extra taxes

[01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:07.450]
well he sure flushed away a lot of money you know but that again is part of that

[01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:11.570]
you asked thing with the allotters there big rip off in other words he went 220 million

[01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:16.870]
but after all the taxes and everything he's going to get 85 million okay or he would with the

[01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:22.770]
newities but here he's getting lump sum 125.3 so he's given away almost half you see that

[01:51:22.770 --> 01:51:28.030]
he won 220.3 million and he's given 25.3 I'd be really p.o'd

[01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:33.590]
I did just what you yeah I would protest I had a whole lot of

[01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:37.270]

what he told these guys anybody I don't know if it's true or he just said it sounds like to me

[02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:44.530]
of life but anyway moving along so the moment right yeah I called you like a week back or whatever

[02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:49.070]

He stocks I don't have no stock they probably get out of here. Don't have any stocks

[02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:50.650]
Having investments and things that are like guaranteed okay like fixed the newities

[02:15:50.650 --> 02:15:54.710]
I don't play the market no more okay, and again, that's why it's on our pool today for gambling

[02:15:54.710 --> 02:15:57.710]
I don't gamble at least not on that if I'm good a gamble

[02:15:57.710 --> 02:16:00.190]
I'm gonna go where I can have a good time and lose you know

[02:16:00.190 --> 02:16:04.430]
Have a little fun doing it. Let me ask you do they give you like free drinks while you're playing like they do in Vegas when you go

[02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:11.030]
Of course, they know what's not actually you want to know why I know why why because you get tanked and you make bad decisions

[02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:13.590]
No, no, no, no, do I drink no?

[02:16:13.930 --> 02:16:19.790]
So I get you I get diets soda one one night coke diet coke or over and over and over and of course

[02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:21.590]
They don't have caffeine free diet code

[02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:27.450]
Well, the worst things you can have for your irritable mom is their ideas experts right? I think I know and I'm yeah

[02:16:27.450 --> 02:16:30.270]
I wish the way to how they say hey at least in Montreal they had like

[02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:36.290]
Salsa where they had in fact you can get plain water even like club soda right they don't let you have a club soda

[02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:41.030]
No, I don't I've never asked but I'm pretty sure I'll have to ask because all the all the cocktail waitresses

[02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:46.070]
I mean everybody there knows me like regular right I am and they're all very friendly and I'll call come around because they know

[02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:49.330]
They're gonna get their buck every time well really but what really gets me

[02:16:50.210 --> 02:16:55.410]
Oh is the people who are sitting there and they refuse to give the cocktail waiter or waitress a tip you know

[02:16:55.410 --> 02:17:00.230]
I put it on the tray after they oh can I have a coffee a double double at triple triple

[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:05.970]
quadruple quiet. Yeah, you think you were in Canada think a bunch of cheap Canadians were hanging out there a god

[02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:10.170]
And then and of course then when you went to jackpot like 600 you know a a

[02:17:10.170 --> 02:17:12.550]
Attentive paid jackpot you know, I mean

[02:17:12.550 --> 02:17:16.810]
One that's the attention has to come and pay you right and then there are those people who are like good

[02:17:16.810 --> 02:17:17.810]
I don't want to tip them well

[02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:21.610]
I do understand that probably after you lose your ass there you get in the beginning

[02:17:21.610 --> 02:17:24.830]
I wasn't tipping anybody either because I thought well, well a lot of money they're taking for me

[02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:27.450]
Why should I tip anybody but then if you want to get good service?

[02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:30.430]
Right. I want them to pay attention and not let you sit there for an hour

[02:17:30.930 --> 02:17:34.350]

Sponencing is low is 0% or rebates them up to six grand or you can drive away in a brand new Ford and make absolutely no payments for six months

[02:18:22.690 --> 02:18:27.490]
The choice is yours, but the bottom line is when you add the Armstrong for discount of the bonus cash and cent of from Ford

Oh

[02:19:36.670 --> 02:19:40.310]
I was not very

[02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:44.450]
But I've been for the left in thousands of young boys

[02:19:44.970 --> 02:19:47.670]
But I'm rich so my time's lovely

[02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:51.610]
I don't like that

[02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:59.930]
I was marrying a dark gold grey glitter craft suit white band you said shirt with no tie

[02:19:59.930 --> 02:20:03.730]
Need doctors to hold up my clear socks and spuds

[02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:07.810]
All I have is this king a spray paint and my glove

[02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:15.390]
I have been lucky so far they could have put the bag over my head and spike to me for all a American homo erotic

[02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:18.230]
Oh, we stay sick me there

[02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.350]
Yeah

[02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:22.990]
What is that my nose fell off again

[02:20:24.450 --> 02:20:25.450]
Let me

[02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.590]
True

[02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:42.850]
You know this is interesting. I'm looking on the CNN site right now. Okay. We have a review of Batman begins and it says

[02:20:42.850 --> 02:20:48.450]
EW review while entertaining weekly Batman begins a triumph and just yesterday and the Toronto star

[02:20:48.450 --> 02:20:53.550]
I read a scaling review just ripping it in the ass. I saw it yesterday and

[02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:58.730]
It was okay. It was just fine. I don't think it was horrible ripping it in ass

[02:20:58.730 --> 02:21:01.630]
I mean, they're probably gonna hate it

[02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:06.330]
Well, you didn't like any of the other I hate everything. No, I don't like the Batman movies. There wasn't one good one

[02:21:06.330 --> 02:21:09.830]
They all suck. Yeah, they did okay. Yeah, I'm not sure if you think TV was great

[02:21:10.450 --> 02:21:13.870]
It's like watching Sherlock Holmes movies with Nigel Bruce and

[02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:19.350]
Basil Rathbone and then watching the Sherlock Holmes craft that came later Scarbridge

[02:21:19.350 --> 02:21:24.470]
So I watch in Dracula with Bella Legosi and then watch Peter Cushing trying to be Dracula, right? Right?

[02:21:24.810 --> 02:21:28.590]
Same thing to watch Batman on TV with the you know, what's his name?

[02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:30.110]
Burt Ward and

[02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:35.330]
Burr Reynolds at West. I know who the hell was him. What is wrong with you? We're just watching it the other day

[02:21:35.330 --> 02:21:39.590]
I remember Adam West best by test although I'll let Robin better

[02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:44.410]
Hey, well you watch that show and then you've to watch these movies and it isn't even related to the comic strip

[02:21:44.410 --> 02:21:49.070]
What does it have to do with reality? What does it have to do with anything and then all this retro garbage?

[02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:56.090]
Oh, Batman begins and then Batman is a baby and Batboy and bats in the belfry come on already enough with the garbage

[02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:59.290]
Or speaking of garbage here's another reason to hate your buddy or Bill Gates

[02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:05.450]
Yeah, Chinese bloggers posting their thoughts by a Microsoft net service face restrictions are what they can write

[02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:12.410]
Hear this story the thought of the news weblog entries on some parts of Microsoft's MSN site in China using words such as

[02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:16.390]
Freedom democracy and demonstration are being blocked to the

[02:22:16.390 --> 02:22:21.190]
Chinese bloggers already faced with controls the most registered the online journal with Chinese authorities

[02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:25.710]
Microsoft said the company abided by the laws regulations and norms of each company which it operates

[02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:30.130]
The censorship has thought to have been introduced as a concession to the Chinese government

[02:22:30.130 --> 02:22:33.570]
Otherwise, we don't care what you do to it. Just as long as we can make some money from you right

[02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:40.430]
Also being restricted on the three parts of the site our journal entries that mention human rights and Taiwan independence god for bid

[02:22:41.650 --> 02:22:45.670]
Reporters without borders says following Yahoo. Here's a second American internet giant

[02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:49.610]
Giving way to the Chinese authorities and agreeing to self-sensorship in that lovely lovely

[02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:54.190]
Those using the band words are writing entries that are pornographic or contain sensitive information

[02:22:54.190 --> 02:23:00.190]

Microsoft MSN spaces spaces site is run by its joint venture partner the state-backed Shanghai Alliance investment limited

[02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:10.850]
And obviously what you can put on there is very limited

[02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:15.390]
Microsoft said people who used its MSN spaces service were required to abide by its quota conduct

[02:23:15.390 --> 02:23:21.950]
The code says that users are not allowed to upload post to distribute any content which violates any local and national laws that apply to your location

[02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:27.570]
Microsoft is a multi-national business and as such needs to be on the evaporating in countries around the world and

[02:23:27.570 --> 02:23:31.210]
Microsoft spokesperson told the BBC news website

[02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:32.570]
I like that

[02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:39.250]
China recently introduced spring of regulations. I require all blog owners to register the web journal with the state by the 30th of this month

[02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:43.590]
Regulations require the writer of a blog to identify themselves to the authorities

[02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:50.650]
Okay, you will identify yourself and you will you know eat your chop sui or just give you with the old chop chop your state

[02:23:50.650 --> 02:23:54.010]
I don't but you know they got a man buck you know he started

[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:56.190]
He's making it because that's right he needs that money

[02:23:56.190 --> 02:24:00.610]
But he wants to catch up to that tarball winner. Here's some bad news Percy Aerosmith

[02:24:00.610 --> 02:24:07.330]
Although I do like Aerosmith a lot Percy Aerosmith who with this wife set a record two weeks ago for the world's longest marriage

[02:24:07.890 --> 02:24:13.650]
died yesterday at the age of 105 his wife of 80 years was by a side married for 80 long

[02:24:14.050 --> 02:24:15.390]
Scruciating years. How do you like that?

[02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:19.110]
Good for him. So he made it. He sent the record to which he wrote

[02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:23.790]
Aerosmith died at his home in Heriford, Northwest of London his bishop said

[02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:31.130]
Aerosmith and his 100-year-old wife Florence wow celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary in a place in the Guinness Book of Records in June 1

[02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:33.750]
Percy and Flow were very happy when I saw the man in the

[02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:37.730]
Anniversary said the Reverend Anthony Prittis bishop of Heriford, Heriford, whatever it is

[02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:42.250]
There was still very much in love with each other. They kept drooling a lot but nevertheless earlier this month

[02:24:42.250 --> 02:24:46.590]
The Guinness Organization recognized the Paris holding records for the longest marriage for a living couple

[02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:50.730]
And the oldest aggregate age of a married couple which would have been a hot 205

[02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:56.490]
Almost old enough to live in Surfside the Aerosmiths who have three children six grandchildren and nine great grandchildren

[02:24:56.490 --> 02:24:59.890]
Send to the key to their long marriage was not to go to sleep on an argument

[02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:05.630]
Aerosmith said there was something else. I always said yes dear. He said keep that in mind George always say yes

[02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:08.390]
Dear no matter what she says it does help it doesn't help

[02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:14.670]
Huh still what's more and then stick your head in that flavor wave the luxe oven for about three minutes on high cook and see what if that's on straight

[02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.550]
5675

[02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:24.150]
60 pond five 60 any Verizon see the great part about that is is that you can you can take that top heart off and keep it on

[02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:28.970]
Oh, that's right. Yeah, you can put where it like a hat. Yeah, like a hat or like when you see the women in the beauty

[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:30.810]
Parliament that's take on her head you know

[02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:33.150]
Yeah, the little curls just

[02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:35.670]
Oh, yeah, talk about a cooler

[02:25:36.330 --> 02:25:37.650]
No, your brains

[02:25:39.690 --> 02:25:43.930]
Curl your brains WQ I am hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir

[02:25:43.930 --> 02:25:49.210]
I was talking with my wife the other day about Tom Cruise. Yeah, and she was saying

[02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:54.910]
We're talking about how he's brainwashing Katie Holmes into the Scientology thing absolutely no question about it

[02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:59.150]
And my wife goes, well, that's not so bad. They're like those Christian scientists aren't they?

[02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:00.710]
right

[02:26:01.710 --> 02:26:06.170]
And it struck me that the average person has no idea what Scientology is

[02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:13.590]
Well, and why does the media shy away from that and not say hey Tom Cruise believes in Ali have bays right and Elron

[02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:16.650]
How about don't forget about him they sue everybody right?

[02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:20.310]
Well, how can they sue you if you tell the truth? I mean, it's the truth. They believe in Ali

[02:26:20.310 --> 02:26:22.830]
They just want to create a hassle. It's just their way of intimidating people

[02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:26.770]
You know keeping a mouth shut, but you're not sure we'll talk about him a lot when I'm on vacation sure will

[02:26:26.770 --> 02:26:31.030]
If the average person do what are they gonna get nothing if the the average person knew that Tom

[02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:37.310]
They believed in Ali and they would think the guy's a whole moon right and look everybody's got to have a place to hide

[02:26:37.310 --> 02:26:42.030]
You know, it's a very comfortable closet. John revolt is in there. Lisa Marie. I mean, what's wrong with Tom Cruise being in there?

[02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:49.550]
And if I Katie Holmes just a couple of months ago in an interview in some magazine was saying what a devout Catholic she was and how big Jesus is in her life

[02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:55.270]
Not no mole and now she's joining a church. This is right. He is a myth invented by aliens. There you go by alien

[02:26:55.990 --> 02:27:01.470]
Okay, good luck to Kelly. Good luck to all of us. You fair. There you go. That's for Tom Cruise and for Lisa Marie

[02:27:01.470 --> 02:27:05.290]
You fairy and for John revolt and all the other people involved in that cult

[02:27:05.930 --> 02:27:12.150]
Oh, they got a huge I don't know if it's still there anymore as matter of fact in Toronto they have like a whole block

[02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:16.650]
That they hold up. That's how they operate. I haven't been in an area in quite some time

[02:27:16.650 --> 02:27:22.430]
I have to check that out see if they're still around my good friends at the Scientologist. Okay, maybe I can hop in in their closet for a while

[02:27:22.430 --> 02:27:23.590]
Speaking of that

[02:27:24.130 --> 02:27:28.210]
Challenging earlier findings two studies from a conservative research group reported to us

[02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:33.710]
They that young people who take virginity pledges have lower rates of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases and engage in fewer

[02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:35.510]
sex risky sexual behaviors

[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:41.690]
However, everybody else says it's a polycrap wait to near which group this is the new findings by the Heritage Foundation

[02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:46.390]
Are based on the same national survey used in earlier studies and conducted by the federal Department of HHS

[02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:49.910]
But the authors of the new study use different methods of statistical

[02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:54.610]
Analyzation that knows in an earlier report that was widely publicized making direct comparisons

[02:27:54.610 --> 02:27:57.970]
Difficult independent experts called the new findings provocative

[02:27:57.970 --> 02:27:59.650]
But they criticized their latest foundations

[02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:06.350]
Analyzation is flawed and lacking the statistical evidence to support their conclusions the new findings have not been submitted to a journal for publication

[02:28:06.350 --> 02:28:11.630]
An author said the independent experts who review the study said the findings are unlikely to be published in their present form

[02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:16.230]
In other words basically as usual you get from the Heritage Foundation it's a pack of life right

[02:28:16.390 --> 02:28:19.410]
Because every study that we read about goes to show that this whole

[02:28:19.410 --> 02:28:23.250]
Absence thing doesn't work and all these virginity pledges and these people are

[02:28:23.250 --> 02:28:28.910]
Doing as much hanky panky if not more than anybody else and get as many diseases and of course all of these things

[02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:30.550]
They can put us it's over a thing

[02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:35.070]
You know, it's really interesting in a way that you know the in the mass media now they put these people on

[02:28:35.070 --> 02:28:40.830]
Well, so and so from the Heritage Foundation or from Hocus Pocus on a family like these are some kind of mainstream

[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:45.990]
Responsible organizations as opposed to the right-wing fundamentalist lunatics that we all know they are

[02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:48.050]
And they're and they're just all over the place now

[02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:51.670]
It's like even more than the test pattern more than infomercials on a weekend

[02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:55.850]
26 past one at five sixty we're gonna have an Elrond hubbub on tomorrow

[02:28:55.850 --> 02:28:59.010]
Are we from the great if there's a big hubbub love where your hair went

[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:00.510]
It probably went down the sink around the floor

[02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:03.590]
But if it's gone like most guys here's the answer to you car

[02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:09.330]
Good buddy check out theory because Charlie's been helping the famous and not so famous looked at a very best for over 30 years now

[02:29:09.330 --> 02:29:15.530]
You wouldn't recognize Charlie's work when you see it because unlike we saw a guy on CNN this morning George and I

[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:20.090]
One of the most outrageous looking waves I have ever seen in my life

[02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:23.410]
And all you do is just laugh and laugh and yuck it up ridiculous

[02:29:23.410 --> 02:29:26.070]
And that's what they'll do to you too if you put a muskrat on your head

[02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:29.210]
But with Charlie's new skin like hair system it's 100%

[02:29:29.890 --> 02:29:33.470]
Detectable looks like the real thing like real hair that's going out of your scalp and that's what you want

[02:29:33.470 --> 02:29:38.310]
And you have nothing loose but your shiny ugly balls spot because you try Charlie's system for 30 days

[02:29:38.310 --> 02:29:42.730]
A month and after a month if you don't love the way it looks and feels it did not get in like tons of action

[02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:45.690]
Return it for a full refund make the call today tool free

They beat me out of the house!

[02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:11.070]
The dog is a toy store!

[02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:12.830]
The dog is a dinosaur!

[02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:14.950]
They beat them all!

[02:31:15.570 --> 02:31:17.990]
The dog hits me out of the house!

[02:31:18.310 --> 02:31:19.230]
The dog is a dinosaur!

[02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:21.050]

[02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:51.490]
I never said, d-d-d-dout award.

[02:31:51.850 --> 02:31:55.230]
Animal is an object to attack rat!

[02:31:57.610 --> 02:32:02.830]
133.27 before the Doymann itself comes along. A man who played a gully to take part in

[02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:06.730]
a cross-burning severed year ago in Pratt West Virginia lost in his bid to be mayor.

[02:32:07.210 --> 02:32:13.110]
On that good news, yet is Greg Bess, no relation to Bess Truman, Greg Bess garnered 41 votes

[02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:18.010]
in Tuesday's nonpartisan election coming in a distant second to Anne Nys, a social justice

[02:32:18.010 --> 02:32:22.130]
officer at West Virginia University Institute Technology who got 104 votes to other candidates

[02:32:22.690 --> 02:32:27.490]
and got fewer votes than Bess. Bess, a cool mining contractor and chairman of the Towns utility

[02:32:27.490 --> 02:32:32.110]
board has said his rule in the 1999 cross-burning was exaggerated and was more of a joke that just

[02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:36.350]
got out of hand. Just for the record, Greg Bess is not a racist Bess said before the election.

[02:32:36.730 --> 02:32:40.590]
Bess Cleary Gilley in 2001 to a criminal conspiracy charge telling the federal judges

[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:44.690]
that he built the cross and carried it to the residents of Lucy Roberts who was at home babysitting

[02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:48.470]
for a two-year-old biracial granddaughter. Well, it sounds like just a joke to me, don't it?

[02:32:49.310 --> 02:32:55.650]
He was sentenced to 30 days, and three years probationed $5,000. I think that the citizens were

[02:32:55.650 --> 02:32:59.710]
making a statement that they didn't care for Bess's behavior. In his participation in the cross-burning,

[02:32:59.710 --> 02:33:05.530]
he said Wednesday, Pratt is a southern West Virginia town about 530 residents, 530.

[02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:09.710]
You know, it's a good thing that Josh got to watch the Loverns a couple days ago.

[02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:15.230]
Because when I get a better insight into the nature of the people who are running America these days,

[02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:18.530]
yeah, that's actually what I thought about when I was right. The people who have taken over the

[02:33:18.530 --> 02:33:21.750]
Eam tree crowd. President, thank you, boy. You better go get them out. That's this crowd.

[02:33:22.090 --> 02:33:27.090]
Hey. You better believe it. They're all kin, man. Pittsburgh and account, I got a whole bunch of

[02:33:27.090 --> 02:33:31.890]
these goofy stories. I love them. An account whose motto was live until Friday. Kind of like that

[02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:36.550]
movie, owning Mahoney. Yeah. Oh, and I got bad news for you, George. I knew I forgot something.

[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:41.770]
What? Bad news. Amazon.com says, uh-uh. Oh, it's like North by North. What do you know? They had

[02:33:41.770 --> 02:33:47.230]
sent me an email here sometime back and said, uh, in order for us to, uh, post-phone the date and

[02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:51.470]
not cancel the order, you have to click here. And so I clicked there and I thought I had it all done.

[02:33:51.610 --> 02:33:55.390]
I'm pretty sure I did, you know, I clicked it and now they're saying, well, because you didn't

[02:33:55.390 --> 02:33:59.410]
respond to yadi-adi, unfortunately, I've had a cancel. So what I'm going to do is I'll go buy it.

[02:33:59.750 --> 02:34:04.450]
All right. I think you're putting your vacation. Yeah, I got plenty of time. In fact,

[02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:11.410]
what I'll do is maybe I'll buy it there. No, I'll buy it here and I'll mail it from there. Okay. I'm

[02:34:11.410 --> 02:34:14.190]
going to buy it. No, because if I, if I brought it, I have to see all those people there. I'm not,

[02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:17.970]
in fact, I probably won't see any of you again, you know, it's been a lot of fun. Bye.

[02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:22.530]
We got your picture over here. Have I got your part? And we got your picture over here on the wall.

[02:34:22.810 --> 02:34:26.590]
Yeah, that's right. Look at the picture. I was younger than anyway. And a count as model was live

[02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:30.410]
until Friday, played the guilty, just living between a million and two and a half million from clients,

[02:34:30.570 --> 02:34:36.610]
and leveraging strippers with gifts and jobs. John J. Bowman, 52, no key to Travis Bowman of Shailer,

[02:34:36.610 --> 02:34:41.890]
or a venereal Bowman, pleaded guilty to the dated, defrauding 11 clients between 1994 and 2002.

[02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:45.450]
According to prosecutors, Bowman spent client money at a strip club,

[02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:49.930]
dropping more than $1,000 a night. He also hired young women to work at his now-defunct business,

[02:34:50.310 --> 02:34:55.010]
Bowman and associates. He hired a stripper as a secretary and gave her 20 grand for a down payment

[02:34:55.010 --> 02:34:59.330]
on a home and paid her $600 a week. The plea of giving calls for Bowman to make restitution,

[02:34:59.630 --> 02:35:04.810]
he scheduled to be sentenced September 22. Live until Friday, that was his model. All right. Now,

[02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:08.370]
we're trying to do it here. Only got like 24 minutes to go today and then of course tomorrow.

[02:35:08.970 --> 02:35:14.110]
I eat humongous shou. I think all great comedy bits tomorrow. No, it's you. Okay. That's not like a winner.

[02:35:14.390 --> 02:35:18.630]
Cut out. I mean, yeah, what are? No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that. Like I said, on Monday, I'm

[02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:24.110]
thinking all comedy. Oh, yeah. Golden Retriever summoned a court. Now, my golden retriever was never

[02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:28.050]
summoned a court. That's a good thing. Newton, Massachusetts, look at us, a penny. Murphy is awaiting

[02:35:28.050 --> 02:35:32.430]
his day and court. The question is whether court is ready for him. Murphy is a three-year-old golden

[02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:36.710]
retriever who received a summons last week to appear in Newton District Court to answer a complaint

[02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:41.750]
that he was walked without a leash at least twice and was not up to date on his dog license. Actually,

[02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:46.330]
it wasn't Murphy but his owner, Steven Dean, who was supposed to get the summons. He can't read. So,

[02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:50.850]
I sounded on his behalf requesting hearing Dean told the Metro West Daily News of Framingham. I don't

[02:35:50.850 --> 02:35:54.570]
even know if they'll let him into the courthouse, especially if he drops a number on a floor. When I

[02:35:54.570 --> 02:35:59.510]
be great, when I be a great editorial comment, what would be? Is that your plea? Have you ever seen a

[02:35:59.510 --> 02:36:04.950]
golden retriever doing the old squat belief you may have? It's a very serious piece of business.

[02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:10.030]
Newton police fined Murphy $25 for not having a leash and $25 for not being licensed when

[02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:15.050]
animal control officer John O'Connell stopped Murphy in his master, June 3rd. Court magistrate Henry

[02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:19.010]
Schultz said in his 35 years at the Newton District Court he's never heard of a dog receiving a ticket.

[02:36:19.330 --> 02:36:22.510]
He must not know about those people in California with a chip and got the J-walking ticket.

[02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:26.230]
Right. I think Murphy's the first defender we said Monday. We've had people bring their dogs

[02:36:26.250 --> 02:36:30.030]
into the courthouse but not like this. What are we going to do if Murphy appeals to a higher court?

[02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:35.590]
He said it's a cute kind of like a court. That's probably the kind of humor they tell up there in

[02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:39.970]
the woods in Aintry. That's probably kind of jokes. They really yuck it up pretty good. I would think.

[02:36:40.490 --> 02:36:45.930]
And like I said, these people are now running the country. The Hocus Pocus family, focus on the family,

[02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:50.550]
Hocus Pocus on your family, Hocus Pocus on him, Faggot, and all that stuff. And of course,

[02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:56.030]
the anti-standa flat earth crowd. They're running America. 21 till 2 at QA and I-

[02:36:59.730 --> 02:37:01.110]
Put the go-it.

[02:37:04.330 --> 02:37:05.610]
You're fair.

[02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:27.510]
And I'm a little bit rock and roll. She's a little inner-skinner. She's a little

[02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:33.370]
little down the mountain. She's a little bit bricked and well-sumbed but she's

[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:10.190]
I hope they care for them. I hope they care for me for the power of my love. Can he

[02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:15.590]
flex and keep my death playing? It's such a hole because I'm a little bit country.

[02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:19.110]
And I'm a little bit rock and roll.

[02:38:20.610 --> 02:38:27.050]
He likes to powder his knob. Like I said, they're 145 at 560 WQM. Here's some good news.

[02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:29.370]
What's that? You know, there's two drunken pilots?

[02:38:29.370 --> 02:38:33.130]
Yeah. Well, they're going to remain in jail until their sentence next month after they

[02:38:33.130 --> 02:38:34.830]
would not bail today. All right.

[02:38:35.370 --> 02:38:39.750]
Dave County Circuit Judge David Young has had an edgy tone as he addressed pilot Thomas

[02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:45.270]
Cloyd 47 and co-pilot Christopher U is 44 and order them held at least another five weeks.

[02:38:45.390 --> 02:38:48.670]
Well, they might just have flown away, you know. They went to jail right after the verdicts were

[02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:52.390]
read last week after being free on bail for nearly three years while the contest of the charges.

[02:38:52.570 --> 02:38:57.390]
And guess what? Not free no more. They're going to be held until they get sentenced. Excellent.

[02:38:57.390 --> 02:39:01.570]
Don't want no drunken pilot on the plane. I get on. I'll say that right now.

[02:39:02.670 --> 02:39:06.950]
Conversely, the charges were dismissed today against the 19-year-old Inlet Grove High School

[02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:10.350]
students charged with hacking the Palm Beach County school district's computers.

[02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:15.770]
Ryan Duncan of Palm Beach Gardens has agreed to pay $2,025 in investigative cost and

[02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:19.550]
completed a hundred hours of community service. He also has to write letter of apology to the district.

[02:39:20.250 --> 02:39:25.970]
I don't sound too bad. What is that? I'll do a say. I apologize. That's it. Right? That'll do it.

[02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:30.010]
Under the agreement overseen by Judge Lucy Chernobyl Brown, the 100 hours of community can be

[02:39:30.010 --> 02:39:33.330]
waived if Duncan agrees to work with the school district and create a program on these

[02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:37.910]
seriousness of computer crime. Investigators believe Duncan legally obtained a password that let him

[02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:43.150]
have access, let him access district servers. Duncan may have received the login information

[02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:47.150]
by looking over the shoulder of a computer technician who was working at Inlet Grove High School in

[02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:50.910]
River, or Beach, where the teams of students, districts spokesman at Harrington said in a

[02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:54.690]
interview. Duncan was arrested last month by school district police and charged with

[02:39:54.690 --> 02:39:58.750]
offenses against intellectual property of felony. He was released on his own record in the sense

[02:39:58.750 --> 02:40:03.250]
of the terms of his release. He's allowed computer access only at work. Our sheriff's official said.

[02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:07.990]
Go out of mine, your computer, Josh. Okay. They'll be hacking it. Speak out of that. Binghamton,

[02:40:08.010 --> 02:40:12.690]
New York. Have you ever been there? Don't. Okay. They'll. A sheriff's department officer is read

[02:40:12.690 --> 02:40:17.970]
faced in a hot water after leaving her gun in a Binghamton County bathroom. Binghamton court house

[02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:21.990]
bathroom. Did I say that right? Let me say it again. In a Binghamton court house bathroom,

[02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:25.770]
a broom county sheriff's department corrections officer removed her 40 caliber

[02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:30.210]
block pistol by using the facilities, but she left the weapon behind when she left the restroom.

[02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:34.390]
I mean, there was a number one and number two and then, like, number, uh, five,

[02:40:34.490 --> 02:40:38.410]
forty-five. That was a 40 caliber block. It could happen to anybody. The gun was found by

[02:40:38.410 --> 02:40:42.330]
somebody who alerted a courthouse security officer. Sheriff David Hartridge told a Binghamton radio

[02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:46.330]
station the corrections officer was without her peace for less than five minutes. Harder said in

[02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:49.490]
investigation, the incident has been conducted. In the meantime, the officers have been taken off

[02:40:49.490 --> 02:40:54.170]
the courthouse detail and assigned a jail duty. He said the officer was very upset over the gun

[02:40:54.170 --> 02:41:00.210]
blunder. Don't be doing it again, sweetheart. Ross did a Wyoming Pam Furtichurk,

[02:41:00.390 --> 02:41:04.290]
that's her name, Fettichurk. Swarshi was going to attend the Mule Day's festival,

[02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:08.990]
even if she had a ride in Mule to get there. And you know what she did? What? Fettichurk and her

[02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:14.330]
friend Tara Lewis traveled some 850 miles on the back of a Mule from Alberta, Canada to

[02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:18.090]
Recreation Day Clarks Ranch in northern Wyoming. See, there's more than Anefree crowd.

[02:41:18.370 --> 02:41:22.830]
Anefree? The women wrote Mule's name, Sadie and Goliath, and brought a pack Mule,

[02:41:22.970 --> 02:41:27.590]
Angel, to carry their supplies. Mule Days, which kicked off two, they celebrate the notoriously

[02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:32.490]
stubborn animal with Mule Centric Races, rodeo, or is that rodeo and other events. For they're

[02:41:32.490 --> 02:41:35.950]
troubled, a tool in and their Mule's will serve as grand marshals for the Mule Day parade.

[02:41:36.370 --> 02:41:39.630]
Well, I thought she was nuts to begin with said Clark, who said his grandfather,

[02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:44.590]
who said his grandfather, true Hollingsworth, made a similar trip on horseback some 80 years ago

[02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:52.830]
to find work in Mietizi. M-E-E-T-E-T-S-E-Mietizi. I had touched it. Don't touch those. He told me she

[02:41:52.830 --> 02:41:56.570]
did what N.C. did Clark said I'm pretty proud of her. Well, that's great. And of course, we know

[02:41:56.570 --> 02:42:01.270]
about John Madden, right? The Humper called in yesterday with the load on that. We didn't need

[02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:04.510]
to hear no stink in press conference, did we? Because we had the good news from the Humper.

[02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:07.310]
I think we should have carried it. Let's carry it today. Yeah, let's get the press

[02:42:07.310 --> 02:42:11.570]
conference. What's on TSN right now? But they got some ESPN crap on here right now. Maybe they

[02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:17.390]
got some spade. Oh, yeah, US Open Golf now. Once this spot is open, you want to hear that? No.

[02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:26.110]
US Open Golf? Or we could go to the Fear Factor on Extreme TV, Extreme Sports, or we could do some women's soccer.

[02:42:28.350 --> 02:42:30.310]
I'm glassful of sports. What are they look like?

[02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:36.750]
We just slightly open high that and it was sliced away. What language is he speaking, huh?

[02:42:37.430 --> 02:42:40.610]
Or we could do Clancy and Night of the Fight. They're doing a toilet payout situation.

[02:42:41.410 --> 02:42:44.290]
They're doing a challenge spot. We don't want to do that. Or...

[02:42:44.290 --> 02:42:46.230]
No, God's Gladys playing a song called Mr. Lucky.

[02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:49.430]
There's always swimming ball case having a big green cup.

[02:42:49.690 --> 02:42:53.150]
Football by playscarred. I feel really happy when you have a thousand years ago.

[02:42:53.290 --> 02:42:55.470]
They'll be the product of your duty and you're much better than anyone.

[02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:58.310]
Let's have that on. We'll take it today and play it tomorrow.

[02:42:58.790 --> 02:43:02.890]
And when you say cop out, you're forgetting something very important, Mr. Hodge. What's that?

[02:43:02.890 --> 02:43:08.310]
That tomorrow there was a mistake on the schedule, but being the honorable Boy Scout that I am,

[02:43:08.350 --> 02:43:11.170]
I said, no, I wasn't going to be a little way tomorrow. I'm going to be working tomorrow.

[02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:13.750]
I'm going to stay here. I could have lied. I saw the schedule. They sent it to me.

[02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:18.470]
And then you were on Friday, June 17. That's right. And then you would have had to work Monday, the 27th.

[02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:21.510]
What was that all about? That's what you wrote down.

[02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:23.950]
Originally. Yes. I understand that. What's...

[02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:26.830]
Maybe I was ever here. Do whatever year in your argue. That's why I say the sheet this time.

[02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:30.590]
I do that every year. Every year you make a mistake and then you argue about it.

[02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:32.250]
I make a mistake. Yeah.

[02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:40.190]
John Madden is having the NBC in 2006 and his money that football partner, Al Michaels, might join him.

[02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:43.830]
Might join him. I don't think there is. Huh? Any question? Is there?

[02:43:44.250 --> 02:43:44.250]

[02:43:45.930 --> 02:43:50.350]
15 must be for its first broadcast. NBC announced yesterday that signed Madden with six-year contract

[02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.870]
to be the English on its run and NFL package.

[02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:57.230]
An NBC sports chairman Dick Ever saw a fence to try to lure Michaels after his finish call

[02:43:57.230 --> 02:44:02.010]
on the NBA final for ABC. Michaels and Madden will work ABC's final year running at football this fall.

[02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:04.550]
Why not? Right? Make sense? Keep it together?

[02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:09.150]
Sure. I mean, let's see. Michaels will be 87 and Madden will be like 114. I'd say that like I care.

[02:44:09.570 --> 02:44:14.290]
I asked big news to use Madden. Yeah. And a comfort call. And yesterday we had the exclusive.

[02:44:14.610 --> 02:44:16.070]
It wasn't one of those phony baloney.

[02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:19.810]
The exclusive that some people are peddling on the station if he catch my breath.

[02:44:20.430 --> 02:44:23.490]
When it comes to sport, we just show you the idea of sport.

[02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:26.110]
Sports radio by 16. You can't see it.

[02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.590]
You way, yeah.

[02:44:28.810 --> 02:44:30.010]
And hold it.

[02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:42.690]
The jury came back to this nutmeg down teeth.

[02:44:42.690 --> 02:44:45.670]
It's been a long, tough, pretty, short, sweet.

[02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:49.310]
I've been so torn and never let them be tricks on me.

[02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:52.690]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:44:53.390 --> 02:44:56.490]
My little kid was just gonna miss girls.

[02:44:56.850 --> 02:44:59.590]
All the men that do best, so shows.

[02:45:00.350 --> 02:45:04.970]
I'm so happy. I feel like I'm till you old. I'm a baby just...

[02:45:04.970 --> 02:45:09.690]
Never heard the best man I've seen. I've been in the...

[02:45:10.330 --> 02:45:12.930]
Not to keep you wild, but feel it.

[02:45:13.650 --> 02:45:17.010]
Same with the impultuous fun to me, no way.

[02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:20.470]
I ain't no less. Oh, jesus, air, rubber, weight.

[02:45:20.850 --> 02:45:22.650]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:22.650 --> 02:45:25.590]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:27.550]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:31.530]
I've been in the...

[02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:40.130]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:42.690]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:42.690 --> 02:45:43.610]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.630]
I've been in the... I've been in the...

[02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:44.070]
I've been in the...

[02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:47.450]
You know, just to cover the rest, they have a bit on here in case he was convicted.

[02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:49.470]
Oh, how cute. Did you see that? No.

[02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:51.370]
Maybe we want to hear that it's called I Didn't Be The...

[02:45:51.370 --> 02:45:54.610]
I've been in the...

[02:45:55.130 --> 02:45:55.610]
What I heard.

[02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:59.410]
Yeah, well, I mean, that's only, you know...

[02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:00.770]
Cute. I like that one better.

[02:46:00.770 --> 02:46:02.730]
Yeah. That's wishful thinking on your...

[02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:04.470]
Yeah, I've been in the...

[02:46:07.850 --> 02:46:09.550]
Oh, I see it as a whole bit here on it.

[02:46:10.390 --> 02:46:10.730]
There it is.

[02:46:12.090 --> 02:46:12.610]
Oh, right.

[02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:22.650]
The German came at Jefferson, I found Jesus.

[02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:25.510]
It took me all way up in the castle, man.

[02:46:26.050 --> 02:46:28.970]
My team was finally lawyers, good and said to speak.

[02:46:29.230 --> 02:46:30.450]
We, I didn't mean it.

[02:46:30.470 --> 02:46:30.950]
Oh, right.

[02:46:31.410 --> 02:46:32.170]
Didn't mean it.

[02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:36.570]
We were convinced that there was a bunch of money.

[02:46:36.970 --> 02:46:39.430]
Gonna share a show and stuff, didn't mean it, son.

[02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:44.270]
I was the cherry gun of it, hung I didn't mean it.

[02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:47.790]
Cause I was so bad, I didn't mean it.

[02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:49.530]
I didn't mean it.

[02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:50.730]
I didn't...

[02:46:50.730 --> 02:46:52.930]
I'm such a big person, I'm doing it.

[02:46:53.650 --> 02:46:57.010]
I used to be, which was now, I am broke.

[02:46:57.290 --> 02:47:00.010]
They're gonna show me for my god's enough.

[02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:02.330]
So I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:02.370 --> 02:47:03.690]
I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:03.970 --> 02:47:05.810]
I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:08.730]
I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:08.730 --> 02:47:09.510]
I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:10.530]
I didn't mean it, didn't mean it.

[02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:11.330]
You heard it.

[02:47:11.550 --> 02:47:13.550]
King of numbers, man, don't be afraid.

[02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:17.690]
The whole thing of the graphics is for me to make.

[02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:21.110]
To walk my vision, nature, the speed, the lynching.

[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:22.810]
Can't have seen it, can't have seen it.

[02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:25.410]
So I guess that we wish, that would have been a moral plan,

[02:47:25.470 --> 02:47:26.390]
but I'm pretty sure we had aim.

[02:47:26.830 --> 02:47:28.230]
Carjacks American gestures, baby.

[02:47:28.770 --> 02:47:29.830]
909 votes on the pool.

[02:47:29.890 --> 02:47:32.570]
We could have made 1000 today, Josh, if we could have put our heads to it,

[02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:33.410]
but we didn't care.

[02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:35.630]
Yeah, he didn't have that hit or a pull, but who cares?

[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:37.230]
What's your favorite former gambling?

[02:47:37.490 --> 02:47:39.030]
I don't gamble 217.

[02:47:39.410 --> 02:47:40.250]

[02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:10.750]
Bob Euchar didn't get any online gaming for.

[02:48:10.890 --> 02:48:11.390]
Cut it out.

[02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:12.490]

Bye, bye, bye.
