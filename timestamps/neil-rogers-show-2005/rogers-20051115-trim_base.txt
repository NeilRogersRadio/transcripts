[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.880]
I'm not in love with him.

[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.600]
Absolutely.

[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.040]
Alright, I guess if he could be like in somebody else's body, if he could be somebody else, he wouldn't be a fanchoice.

[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.560]
Who?

[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.160]
Tom Brady.

[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.640]
What do you mean who?

[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.780]
I didn't know what you were talking about.

[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.160]
You were listening to the promo that played this assignment?

[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.320]
I did hear the promo, yeah.

[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.720]
Yeah.

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.520]
And who are they talking about?

[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.180]
Tom, we're adding about George W. Bush.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.320]
No, they only talk about him in these ratings on Bush.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.560]
Yeah, they're something pretty soon.

[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.120]
He's going to get in the Joel Feinberg territory.

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.200]
I was going to say, yeah, basically, he's got a one share.

[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.120]
Fewer than one in 10 adults, say they would prefer a congressional candidate who's a Republican and agrees with Bush on major issues.

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.040]
Yeah, they'll turn into a corner now.

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.820]
And now that he's gone to A.J., he's turned to the corner.

[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.840]
And hopefully he'll get lost and we'll come back.

[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.760]
That's devastating.

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.420]
Yeah.

[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.080]
And then the worst part of it is we still got three years to go.

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.460]
I guess today I said something about another year with this and then I realize that's the congressional question.

[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.320]
Next year, right?

[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.300]
We got three more years of this crap, but it's second soul in election.

[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740]
Well, he's not going to be able to accomplish anything.

[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200]
So well, you know, having three hardest damage.

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.280]
If you think he's done damage now, yeah, there's something in 2008 that Americans is bad.

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.220]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.960]
And now the Republicans are clamoring today.

[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.860]
They're coming up with this.

[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.960]
They want a resolution to the demand a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq because they're starting to get really nervous.

[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.380]
So what's going to happen next year?

[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.800]
Sure.

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.020]
Meanwhile, everybody says it was a mistake to go in there in the first place.

[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.260]
And now they're saying it's a mistake to get out.

[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.540]
Yeah, well, how do you get out?

[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.300]
That's the problem.

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.600]
Yeah.

[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.020]
I just say, let them have their election next month and say, okay, you're on your own.

[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.040]
We did a nice job for you.

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.900]
We got rid of Sodom and good luck to you and see you.

[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.360]
And then you can go into Syria.

[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.700]
You know, that thing with the Jordanians, the more I think about it, the more it really frosts my fatal pimpley ass, this business.

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.940]
Oh, they're protesting in the streets and they're outraged in an argument when other people were getting killed by these crazy ragheads,

[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.720]
then it was okay.

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.740]
Then they had nothing to say.

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.080]
But now with some of their people get blown up and it's happening right there and in front of their ugly raghead faces.

[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.340]
And right away, now they're opening it up a big mouth.

[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.460]
Where were they before?

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.740]
When all these other countries where people are getting blown away, including here, fastards.

[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.280]
Meanwhile, there's a story by a guy named Andrew Wilde in Harold today.

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.700]
Is Andrew Wilde?

[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.080]
He's, it's about how you can be sexy at 60.

[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.140]
Yeah, right.

[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.780]
Hmm.

[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.860]
Right.

[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.300]
Now we should be very sexy, you and I.

[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.740]
It says avoid high-risk sports that can lead to injury.

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.360]
Yeah, I'm doing a good job of that.

[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.140]
Yeah, the hardest sport that I participate is sitting in buttons that would buy it.

[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.960]
Reduce the rest through simple breathing exercises.

[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.100]
Yeah, well, you should work on that with your sleep apnea.

[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.020]
Whatever happened with that, do you still, uh,

[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.380]
No.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.060]
Huh?

[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.740]
I never did anything about it.

[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.660]
Well, what is it, uh, what do you do for it?

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.380]
There's nothing you can do?

[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.900]
I don't think I, you just hope you wake up every day.

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.180]
Yeah, I don't, you know what?

[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.520]
I don't wake up in a sweat or anything like that.

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.220]
I just sleep.

[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.240]
What does that mean?

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.560]
Is that part of sleep apnea?

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.860]
When you have sleep apnea, you what happens is your heart stops in the middle of the night.

[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.140]
Yeah, well, at least it gives a little rest when you get to be RAs, you can use a rest.

[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.480]
Yeah, but then when it gets cranked up, you know, it, it has to work so hard to get started

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.900]
again that you, you break out into a sweat.

[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.400]
Yeah, especially when the horses are in the last 16th, you know, at the 16th pool.

[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.100]
You know what?

[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.480]
And your horse starts gasping for oxygen, you've been in the horse.

[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.760]
There was a horse yesterday.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.820]
I went out to call the rest today.

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.460]
Probably a bad mistake.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700]
And I'm looking at the form before I went out.

[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.720]
And there was a horse that was entered called Moze Last Call.

[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.760]
Oh, here we go.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640]
I knew it was just a matter of time.

[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.000]
Moze Last Call.

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.040]
Yeah, he was the one you got.

[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.540]
He scratched him.

[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.260]
I was ready to send it all in.

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.900]
You're ready to scratch Mo?

[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.480]
Yeah.

[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.060]
Is he kin to Staxmoe?

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.980]
Scratch Moe?

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840]
Toppano Park, we opened November 17th for Simal Casting and Lava Racing Resumes December

[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.320]
2nd.

[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.620]
I knew he'd be excited to hear that.

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.680]
I thought you'd go there, but at least it's a plentiful one.

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.240]
I only went there, the only place.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.960]
I was there.

[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.860]
I'd dinner with you there.

[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.140]
Right.

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.560]
Because after you first came here to the station.

[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.300]
Yeah.

[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.660]
Yeah, we had a good time.

[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.960]
I did.

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.240]
I had a great time.

[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.100]
You know that I knew my crap as well as I did you to put all your bets at all.

[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.840]
You had a cut-law.

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.200]
Not just the toppano, but it was.

[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.120]
No, the Simal Casting Northville down is running.

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.540]
That's right.

[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.220]
You had a world-wide one race.

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.960]
Three to one shot.

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.440]
Well, I remember races from 40, let's see, 45 years ago.

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.780]
Now, that's a very scary thing.

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.500]
Yes, it is.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.940]
And I still, I desperately need a lobotomy to get all that stuff out of my head.

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.600]
I told you, I'd been in Northfield, down.

[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.920]
Northville.

[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.780]
Yeah, Northville.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.820]
Northville, one outside.

[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.280]
Northville.

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.580]
Right.

[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.340]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.900]
The first horse I ever met on was El Dorad Janko, was the number nine horse driven by Don McLean

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.240]
Marine, the first race at Hazel Park.

[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.060]
And he won the race.

[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.220]
I've had two dollars to show.

[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.360]
And he was the favorite.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.380]
He paid $2.60.

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.520]
And that was the beginning of a long, long, sad tale.

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.600]
Yeah, well, I remember my first winner, too.

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.120]
Really?

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.480]
Yep.

[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.380]
And I was like 17 at the time.

[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.320]
And it was a horse called Heavenly Girl at Mama's.

[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.500]
Yeah.

[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.400]
He paid $50.

[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.460]
And I was hooked.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.340]
I'll be damned.

[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.900]
$50 horse, like my second race I ever met.

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.640]
I've had two $50 horses in my life, as a matter of fact.

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.980]
Well, let's not talk about horse racing.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.440]
Let's talk about girls with guns.

[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.060]
Do you see this story in Miramar this morning?

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.020]
No, I didn't see that one.

[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.900]
17-year-old girl shot another teenage girl on the bus in Miramar.

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.160]
They got in her argument yesterday.

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.080]
So I guess she decided today to settle it.

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.860]
And so now we got girls bringing guns to school and blowing it.

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.760]
It won't be long before we have girls going into the classroom and like just blowing

[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.380]
everybody away.

[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.080]
That's going to be next.

[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.800]
That's part of the American part of the culture.

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.240]
Right.

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.440]
There's no question about it.

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.380]
It's a guy just as many guns here like Michael Moore showed and blowing for Crown of

[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.520]
Mind.

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.060]
Because all the people here are hunters.

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.700]
And yet it's a rare thing.

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.180]
All we do have 65 murders here this year in Toronto, which they're a little nervous

[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.740]
about that.

[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.980]
But that's like 10% of what you have in Detroit at the same time.

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.980]
Doesn't Denmark have gun control like no guns?

[00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.180]
One of those countries.

[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.360]
Well, most of those countries like Holland, you don't ever hear anybody with a gun in

[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.680]
Holland.

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.960]
I hear them shot gunning over there, but it's a different meaning.

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.100]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.240]
I've never get approached by one of the last time my name's to them.

[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.320]
Oh, it's been a while.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.580]
By those street peddlers.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.120]
Yeah.

[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.860]
Ex-tasy.

[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.480]
Viagra.

[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.060]
That's anyone.

[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.520]
Viagra.

[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.160]
Crack.

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.760]
I stayed there the first time I went there.

[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.040]
I stayed in this little hotel called the post.

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.420]
It was like a bed and breakfast like playing.

[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.640]

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.440]
And they had pipe stands in the living room area.

[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.020]
Right.

[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.520]
And they were filled at night.

[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.580]
Everybody just went down and joined in.

[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.580]
It was no big deal.

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.300]
There you go.

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.500]
No, it is no big deal.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.240]
That's another part of the whole.

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.320]
The whole juvenile attitude of America with drugs and sex and everything is just so

[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.600]
like, he, he, everything, like breast.

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.260]
You know, you go any, any European country that I've been in, you turn on the over the

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.160]
RTV, forget about cable, even in Italy, even in where the Pope gets all bent out of

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.320]
shape.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.440]
And there's like breasts, you know, and new to the all kinds of stuff on over the RTV.

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.760]
Nobody's having a nervous breakdown.

[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.140]
Nobody's writing letters to the FCC.

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.540]
Nobody's a, you know, when you stop to think about that whole business about Janet Jackson,

[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.540]
which is now going on two years that that happened, that was just an excuse to start this

[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.780]
whole fascist deal.

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.580]
I mean, what was the big deal with that?

[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.440]
It couldn't even see it.

[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.700]
No, you couldn't even see like the breast itself.

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.200]
It was like a tenth of a second episode that they made up in this gigantic, like the,

[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.720]
the sky is falling.

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.020]
So you see who the halftime show is this year?

[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.000]
Billy Graham.

[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.340]
Mariah Carey.

[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.200]
Oh, brother.

[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.120]
Well, she's got one breast in the middle of her chest.

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.620]
I sure hope that doesn't come ploppin out.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.720]
She's gross.

[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.540]
She's gruesome.

[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.620]
By the way, he's Mariah.

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.020]
I hate to break the news to you, but Luis McGell ain't interested.

[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.520]
Hey, Luis.

[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.880]
You fairly interested in the least bit.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.300]
Look at that.

[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.380]
60% is the proof of your president.

[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.100]
Oh, brother.

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.460]
The numbers are dropping like Iraq.

[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.140]
It's as we speak.

[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.960]
Yeah, he has a record, 37%.

[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.060]
It goes down every month.

[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.040]
It was 39%.

[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.540]
Yeah, one whole week down to 36 now.

[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.440]
Every few days it drops another point.

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.760]
And my question is, how could anybody be so stupid?

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.200]
It took him this long to catch on, including the media and the Democrats and all these people

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.460]
like Edwards and Carey now.

[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.880]
Oh, well, we wish we had our vote to do over again.

[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.800]
You know, talk about sticking your finger out the window to see which way to wind is blown.

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.420]
Who the hell are they?

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.160]
Especially John Edwards, man.

[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.540]
He impresses me about as much as a frog's fart.

[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.620]
He's just weak.

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.500]
No, he really is weak.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.460]
He's got like Mark Baradino, you know?

[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.200]
Only not quite as caustic.

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.660]
Come on, like Iraq, yes.

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.600]
Was Iraq on this morning?

[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.140]
No.

[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.840]
No.

[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.040]
He's on tomorrow morning.

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.760]
Oh, do you think I'm going to be sick tomorrow?

[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.800]
I guess I said it for the first day.

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.100]
He's on.

[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.160]
No, he's not tomorrow.

[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.300]
You guys are confusing me.

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.800]
Well, let's see.

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.520]
He's on tomorrow and through tomorrow.

[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.520]
And through they?

[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.280]
No, just tomorrow.

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.800]
How about when is he on?

[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.120]
And what's that promo that we're running for you where you're talking to Shack and we

[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.800]
can't understand it?

[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.220]
He's like, oh, who are you?

[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.220]
Have you heard that?

[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.320]
I heard the interview.

[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.940]
I did it.

[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.300]
No, no, but the promo that we're playing out of the interview, it's so muffled you

[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.800]
can't understand anything he's saying.

[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.980]
All right, there you go.

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.980]
It sounds like you're in a studio and he's on Uranus.

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.680]
It's like an enough for a different planet.

[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.580]
I don't know, but I like him a lot.

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.040]
I'm not knocking Shack now.

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.820]
I just think he's got a big head and he's a freak and like, I'll ask you both.

[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.420]
There is a good guy, but nevertheless, he never stole a freight train.

[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.340]
But it's just that you can't understand what he's saying.

[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.340]
I tell you, I asked him during the interview, how many people he's housing now.

[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.580]
About third, man.

[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.060]
About over 400.

[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.080]
400?

[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.840]
He's put up over 400 people who were victims of the war.

[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.100]
Oh, speaking of people, how about Jesse Jackson getting all better out of shape?

[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.360]
Oh, I talked about that earlier.

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:31.800]
You know what?

[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.400]
That's authentic.

[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.060]
What was worse was in the game last night, a rookie receiver named Reggie Brown had a chance

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.260]
to make a play at the end that could have won the game.

[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.340]
Yeah, or Philadelphia.

[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.120]
But he dropped the ball.

[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.120]
I mean, he was open.

[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.680]
He had the ball and he dropped it.

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.280]
You know what happened?

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.620]
Jesse Jackson ran out on the field and stripped him of the ball.

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.420]
It was terrible.

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.360]
Yeah.

[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.940]
Jesse Jackson doesn't have anything better to do.

[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.060]
Yeah, that's what I was saying yesterday with all the stuff going on in the world and

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.140]
he's worried about some stupid-ass football player with a big mouth.

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.260]
Everything, he could make anything into a racial thing.

[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.640]
In fact, he was probably when he closed down that chain of restaurants, Samboes, he probably

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.760]
had his finger in that too.

[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.220]
Even Terrell Owens says this is not about race.

[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:15.880]

[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.160]
How can it be?

[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.400]
The quarterback he's criticizing is also black.

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.720]
Although I wonder what Bill Bennett and Rush Limbaugh think about it.

[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:23.940]
Spongebob.

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.620]
Bigoted.

[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.640]
Oh, brother.

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.300]
I'm telling you.

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.040]
It's just, you know, it's all coming home to Roost right now.

[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:30.940]
All this crap.

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.560]
They had their party there for a few years and a lot of innocent people died because of it.

[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.260]
But all the stuff is coming home to Roost now and just slapping them right back in the face.

[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.960]
It's hard to be smug about it though.

[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.820]
It's just because it's terrible.

[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.640]
Even Jimmy Carter, who's known as a Rioi, the Sunday school teacher, he's just railing

[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.560]
against these right-wing goi-em-nowities, fundamentalists and about how crazy they-

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.260]
they're all white male bigots is what they are.

[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.500]
He's been pretty good last few days.

[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.160]
Like you have just a moment or two of sanity.

[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.740]
Pat Robertson's the worst.

[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.800]
Well, he's the top of the-

[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.360]
Why can't the media just say a crazy person said some more crazy crap today instead of presenting him like some spokesman for something?

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.040]
What is he the spokesman for besides making a quick buck?

[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.480]
He's just, he's nuts.

[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.080]
Yeah, he's a crazy person.

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.920]
Just like all these other religious nuts.

[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.860]
Just like Alan Fickleson told me, the only one problem with the world I've told you this many, many times

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.860]
and I would tend to agree, too many goi-em.

[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.540]
On that note, it's probably not a big plunging day to that, wouldn't think.

[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.440]
No, I'm not doing it.

[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.760]
Gotta let your wall heal from-

[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.780]
You better watch when that horse runs again at Mohor's.

[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.500]
I got an eye out for all that you know.

[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.460]
Remember that dog?

[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.620]
You can get it up there.

[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.120]
Remember the dog, Tom Jicca?

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.660]
Yes.

[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.640]
When Tom was doing the dog racing, which I think was perfect for him, that was-

[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.580]
He wasn't a bad dog.

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.160]
Huh?

[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.260]
He wasn't a bad grand.

[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.260]
Yeah, I would agree that Tom's not a bad dog.

[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.580]
Listen, have a great day.

[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.380]
Yeah, you too.

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.040]
Show them off the balcony off the edge of the oppressed box and when you're done, let me know about it.

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.320]
Alright.

[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:55.980]
See ya.

[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.040]
Looking for a value meal that's positively infectious?

[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.340]
Head down to KFC, Killer Blue Chicken.

[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.360]
Put a bird-blue family back.

[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.560]
Three extra crispy legs.

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.620]
Two thighs and four contaminated beaks.

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.160]
All for only $9.99.

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.140]
It's-

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.900]
Thinker's flicking good.

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.140]
It's a killer meal.

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.280]
KFC, Killer Blue Chicken.

[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.620]
Well, the reason I started with that bit is because a powerful car bomb exploded in front of a government building in central Karachi this morning,

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.100]
killing at least three people wounding throwbothers.

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.520]
It seems that the target was KFC.

[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.160]
Killer flew chicken, but we'll have to wait and see.

[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.660]
It said-

[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.500]
I should read that.

[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.340]
It seems to be the target was KFC, but we'll have to wait and see.

[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.580]
It said she-

[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.200]
Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's Information Minister.

[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.800]
He said the blast also occurred in front of a Pakistani industrial development corporation building, but it looks like the target was KFC.

[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.440]
And you like that.

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.160]
And also that story I was telling Hank about.

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.780]
This is-

[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.920]
We got a new deal now, girls.

[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.700]
Not that it hasn't happened before, but I think this is maybe part of a startling new epidemic.

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.860]
A 17-year-old girl shot another teenage girl this morning on a charter school bus in Miramar of all places.

[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:13.100]
The two girls got into an argument yesterday, according to police, and the argument continued this morning after both girls got into the school bus.

[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.440]
The bus was on its way to Parkway Academy Charter School around 7.45 this morning.

[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.140]
The bus picked up the suspect first and the victim, and the argument continued.

[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.220]
In the 3700 block of woodscarf drab near County Line Road, the suspect pulled out a small handgun and fired it in.

[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.080]
The victim and the upper torso.

[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.480]
But I'm being-

[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.820]
The victim was rushed to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood. Her injuries are not life-threatening. Thanks the Lord.

[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.280]
The suspect ran away.

[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.640]
Her home located at the-

[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.800]
Oh, it's got the address in Miramar.

[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.120]
It's now surrounded by police and a SWAT team.

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.620]
Why sure? Hope she don't have a scale in the house because that's the end of her.

[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.340]
Right.

[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.120]
Two schools in the area also run lockdown.

[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:55.360]
This is for cars near Annabelle C. Perry Elementary and Henry D. Perry Middle School at 3,400 Wild Cat Way.

[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.200]
Never do we hit a wild cat way, did you?

[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.020]
No, I do that.

[00:13:59.380 --> 00:13:59.820]
And there you go.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.120]
Okay, it's 12 minutes after 10. Let's get organized. Here it's a Tuesday tomorrow.

[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.880]
We got to see everybody taking the day off. It sounds like a really good idea to me, but probably won't be doing that.

[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.220]
We got no mode in tomorrow. We got no mad dog. We got this is tomorrow's schedule.

[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.380]
Wait till you're this courtesy to which is fine. Fill in for a mo.

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.760]
Then any K for the mad dog in the daytime, which is a little dangerous.

[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.700]
And then fill in for any K tomorrow night is Lenny Martez.

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.560]
So you see Joel, we really are trying to give you a fighting chance.

[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.820]
We want to give you every chance in the world. We will not do anything in the world that hurts you.

[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.180]
We're trying to open up the door a little bit, just a little crack, just see if you can stick your ugly ass in there.

[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.460]
Holy Makin'ah!

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.140]
This is Joel, born the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority meal, God!

[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.300]
Absolutely.

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.420]
Do do do do do do.

[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.160]
But third man!

[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.800]
How much blue must he use on his head?

[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.820]
So his two play won't fly out to sea.

[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:28.080]
How many times must he stumble and fall before he wins a news?

[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.080]
And he will never win.

[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.860]
And he will never win.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.440]
As a Miss Kamala we said and they'll be Brian as well.

[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.500]
It's 10-18.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.280]
Oh wait a minute, how did I see something about Brian Andrews the other day?

[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.860]
I was reading something about Brian who's top scotch in the world for, is it CBS?

[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.640]
I don't know, one of the networks and he's got assignments all over the world.

[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.260]
And I just can only imagine the kind of encounters he's having.

[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.340]
Where that's talking about women.

[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:03.980]
I'm sure that.

[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.860]
Anyways, 10-19 is 5-560.

[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.420]
The Channel 7 Fruit Farm.

[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.140]
You thought we didn't have to go all the way up the street to Sonny's Market to get our produce?

[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:13.660]
Right.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.440]
Because we had our fruit right next door.

[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.280]
Man, it was the paper boy and all of those, and by the way the paper boy, if you're listening Craig, Adam's still not interested.

[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.220]
It was that Brian.

[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.640]
That was probably, maybe both.

[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.060]
During Wilma, where did you get your best information we asked yesterday?

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.640]
I don't really know what to make of this all I know and I filled them up before they showed this morning.

[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:37.220]
And I think I'm right, is that we're going to get a bushwacked in October in the ratings because there's two weeks in there that we're going to get screwed.

[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.000]
Because there's a lot of people, it's just, first I don't know for a variety of reasons.

[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.580]
I could be wrong about that.

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.140]
Maybe all of our people are going to say, well we were glued to QA.

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.000]
I mean especially to your show, Neil, during a Wilma because you were so on top of all that crap, even though you were a long ways away.

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.160]
Aren't you lucky? Yes.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.040]
1534 votes.

[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.180]
During Wilma, you got your best information from TV audio on radio.

[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.580]
347.

[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.440]
That's what little Tommy Jic was all whipped up about before hanged through his ass off the balcony.

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.400]
TV344.

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.380]
WDQ Way M285.

[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.000]
That's a pretty decent theory and that's 18.5%.

[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.260]
That's not bad.

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.840]
We'll take it.

[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:09.340]
Right?

[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.400]
Yeah, we'll take it.

[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.260]
Considering our vast news resources and our newswire and our weatherwire and all these things we don't have.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.560]
The internet 182, if I wouldn't have the internet, I'd just call it insecure, we didn't say you'd do it.

[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.640]
WIVD174.

[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.480]
I got out of town 74.

[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.480]
See it's going to be put on there.

[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.460]
74 people smart enough to get the bailout.

[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.600]
When it's out bailout.

[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.040]
In fact, bailout and don't come back.

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.700]
The Sun Sentinel 37.

[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.080]
WJNO ahead.

[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.960]
Dr. Man.

[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.220]
WFTL23.

[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.260]
They finally moved up.

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.500]
They're 850 on your dial.

[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.120]
It will give you a big pile and not much of a smile but nevertheless.

[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.380]
WFTL.

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.020]
There is still right in there with that picture.

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.840]
Palm Beach Post 22 and the Miami World is in last place.

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.820]
Sucking wind in last place with only 16.

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.480]
The ACC.

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.320]
That's bad.

[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:52.960]
And it?

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.660]
Yes, that is.

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.300]
Even behind the Palm Beach Post for our stewed audience.

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.180]
I think the audience hates the world almost as much as we do.

[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.000]
Maybe not quite, but George is really fond of El Herald though.

[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.240]
And he wishes you stop throwing it.

[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.220]
Or is it the Sun Sentinel that keeps you from hitting El Sentinel?

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.840]
It's El Sentinel and I know that there wasn't El Sentinel.

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.620]
Well, I'll send you my copies.

[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.980]
Well, go to El Sentinel.

[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.500]
Please.

[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.740]
Go to Fee Hell.

[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.780]
Hate them.

[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.840]
Not the Sun Sentinel, but if you know.

[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.020]
Although we got too far to the Sun Sentinel, who do we like over there?

[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.680]
We like Mike Mayer a little bit. He's a good guy.

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.080]
Pretty boring. Right? So one or two good coms a year.

[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.280]
And who else? Dave Hyde.

[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.460]
Like Dave Hyde, he's a good guy. He's also one or two good coms a year.

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.860]
Act. Say that's about it.

[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.260]
Might be anything to anybody out?

[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.400]
Not that I know it.

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.360]
Besides Hank's friend, little Tommy.

[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.520]
Well, look at this. Get paid for your opinion.

[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.060]
I just got a facts and add facts.

[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.560]
Consumer research services.

[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.980]
Get paid for your opinion.

[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.020]
Well, that's what I do.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.380]
I get paid for my opinion a lot more than what they're offering here.

[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.160]
So up yours.

[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.660]
Broward School Board Adopt's calendar to make up for Will Medeys.

[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.760]
I want to pass along just a little information before we start taking thousands of fantastic calls today.

[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.060]
Missed some of our regular friends yesterday, but I'm sure they'll be with us today.

[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.280]
They're probably like mopping up after the Hurricanes.

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.720]
Well, the Hurricanes speeded that loss to a girl's basketball team last night.

[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.460]
Air Force. Can you believe that?

[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.640]
50. What was it?

[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.660]
57.53?

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.900]
A major upset is what I'm reading.

[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.860]
And we got more of that crap.

[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.000]
I mean, more of a great Hurricanes basketball tonight, but not on this station.

[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.340]
Because we got the Panther game, which takes presence.

[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.000]
Might as well give that lineup.

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.100]
Motu to foe.

[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.060]
Mad Dog 4 to 7.

[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.800]
We got three solid hours of the Mad Dog today.

[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.300]
Better soak it up because he's off tomorrow.

[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.640]
We want to overwork his ass.

[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.320]
Panther preview at 7.

[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:23.960]
7.30.

[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.820]
It's the Panthers at the Montreal Canadiens to play the frogs.

[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.820]
The Red Hot Frogs in Josie Theater.

[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.960]
And what kind of a name is that for a guy named Josie?

[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.340]
Now, the Hurricanes warm up his on 13.60.

[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.680]
That sounds like WKAT to me at 8.30 and on the clock.

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.040]
It's the Hurricanes against Wisconsin Green Bay in the BCA Classic from Seattle.

[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.360]
And then 8K on RR after the Panther game on QAM.

[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.100]
Got all of that?

[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.440]
You're marking it down on your sleeve? Good.

[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:45.900]
Got it.

[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.320]
On 13.60 WKAT, we got Hurricanes basketball at 9 tonight.

[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.800]
Everybody be sure and zip over there if you care about it.

[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.680]
Probably don't.

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.940]
And especially meeting yesterday at the Broward County School Board Adopted a calendar

[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.280]
to add school days to make up for the missing two weeks of classes caused by Hurricane Wilma.

[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.280]
Are you aware of this?

[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:03.780]
No.

[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.780]
We'll give you a better mark these done on your other wrist.

[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.040]
Superintendent Frank Till and Broward teaches you an in-prisonant Pat Santoramos.

[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.380]
I wonder if he's akin to Andy Santoramo.

[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.760]
Who?

[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.740]
Harness driver.

[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.320]
So, if I ever give a name that you don't know who it is, that's probably what it is.

[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.260]
Suggested to the reshuffle calendar which brings students back one day early from the winter holiday on January the 2nd.

[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.620]
Seattle, I like to give names that I know that nobody except the people at the top of the park know who it is.

[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.260]
Like Andy Santoramo.

[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.920]
He couldn't drive his finger up your nose.

[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.700]
Anyway, but some school board members and parents had argued against a short and winter break.

[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.180]
They wanted to see more days added before the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test was not beginning in March.

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.440]
Instead, in addition to trimming the winter break, the purple...

[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.420]
And why couldn't they have handed on veterans day on Friday?

[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.620]
I still wouldn't be known as respect to our veterans.

[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.900]
But it's just not one of those like religious holidays.

[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.000]
They could have run off the bat right from the get-go gotten one and couldn't they?

[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:49.660]
Okay.

[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.240]
Well, don't you think it's kind of stupid?

[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.140]
Yeah.

[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.400]
Why can't they sit down?

[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.120]
I mean, I guess they're afraid they're going to offend somebody.

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.280]
Oh, well, we don't want to offend the old crusty veterans because the VFW and the American Legion they'll come here and give us what for.

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.620]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:11.480]
Instead, in addition to trimming the winter break, the purple counter stands the fall semester of till January 13, which sounds like a really unlucky day to me, and gives everybody a day off between seminars on January 17th.

[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:17.560]
It also calls for a full day of classes in December 16th, February 17th, March 16th and 17th, April 27th.

[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.840]
What would I... I don't understand. What are they supposed to be?

[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.120]
I guess the teacher, work days or whatever it comes.

[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.940]
Whatever, yeah. Planning days, I think they...

[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.320]
No, yeah. Planning to go to Highlight, huh?

[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:34.360]
If needed, Tillhead City could extend the last day of classes on May 25th from half of the day to a full day, and even have classes on May 26th, how do you like that?

[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.220]
They'll get it in there. They'll get all those kids, those F-CAT, and they'll pass this stupid test, and they'll be dumber than dirt.

[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:46.120]
And your fat ass governor will say, see? They'll be no child behind, and the F-K-F, F-U fat ass governor, F-CAT, my ass.

[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:55.480]
Oh, two tornadoes again, and we've got this really pissed off. Wait till Pat Robertsen gives us a little rock and going through Ohio now.

[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.320]
They're getting walted again. Look at that.

[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.360]
Submoutin' Vernon, that's right here, the Kentucky border.

[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.340]
Oh, right here, Kentucky, too, man. Amiah, who's there, and a Jim Bunning, who's a crazy person?

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.180]
There's always screaming in the oven about faggot's this and faggot that Jim Bunning.

[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:13.020]
Too many pitches got hit in the head, I think, when a pitch for the Tigers, Jim Bunning. Remember him now. Crazy people.

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.880]
Crazy people, when you're... Oh, look at that tornado warning for Evansville in the end. Everybody like I told you. Do not go to Indiana.

[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.920]
Maybe Indiana wants you, but say El Paso.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.300]
All right, believe me. I'd like it better there, even with all the Mexicans.

[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.280]
Here's our pool today. I did do the pool for yesterday, did I? I'm a little bit on all over the place.

[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.640]
I did. Cross over with Hank was so heavy duty pressure today.

[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.240]
383 votes already on our pool today, and it's not even 10-30 yet. Aren't you impressed? No.

[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:38.900]
What? 392?

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.740]
392, give me a chance, hence.

[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.920]
Well, I have 400 by the time we get to the bottom of the yard. That's some real pool power, man. There's nothing like pool power.

[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:51.020]
392 votes. The biggest fakers on TV ever is. And the reason I put the faker or plural, because there's like...

[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.080]
It's a group in the beginning of a pair. Jimi Tammy, Faker 86.

[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.120]
Anybody want to buy a condo for the Lord? Dr. Phil 74, I knew he'd do well. He is so full of it, man.

[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.640]
It's just oozing out of his big fat ass. Pat Robertson 61.

[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.540]
Hey, Pat. The Lord is really peyote of Kentucky and Nile and Yahoo's Indiana.

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.760]
Think I'm a good excuse for that. Benny, Hint 53. Bill O'Rally 51. Jimmy Swagger 22. I have sinned.

[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.300]
Wherever DJ Ames could have eaten, Janet Paul Crocs 10.

[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.020]
Whatever, man. They must have paid that guy off pretty good. They've disappeared real fast.

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.240]
That's the story about how he and Paul were doing something that the old Crocs.

[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.020]
Tim Russell 66. Yeah, for technically being a journalist.

[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.720]
Heralda Riveras 6. Wait until he goes into the Musselinese grave. Kevin Chudo 5.

[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.000]
And I voted for him and he should be number one, but you don't know who that is. We talked about him a lot.

[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.960]
He's the faker when I was in for Mersel Sonny that book about what doctors don't want you to know.

[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:45.420]
And he belongs in jail again. And he's CNBC to Gammon. Channel runs his infomercials and everybody out A&E.

[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.480]
All these supposedly respectable networks and they put that faker on it who belongs in prison.

[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.300]
Ron Popeo 4, that's bad. Richard Simmons 3. You should have a lot more votes.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.400]
And Ernest Ainsley, can you say baby? Ernest Ainsley, what a really bad piece has got a pair.

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.040]
I'm sure she put them on his head. This is Neil Roder, Worst Chief in Moha.

[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.320]
Go, go, go, go. He's 5.69 AF.

[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:08.940]
Perkley.

[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:16.580]
Harriet Myers, you're in the Supreme Court pyramid winner circle for a spot on the nation's highest court start the clock.

[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.640]
Oh, the Great Wall of China. Michael Moore.

[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.220]
Things you can't say from outer spite.

[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.460]
What? You're at Ted Kennedy.

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.380]
Those are their bombs.

[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.580]
Fairy tales of the New York Times.

[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.260]
Things you read on your adjunct.

[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.180]
Things that aren't true.

[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.320]
Dippers.

[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.280]
Things that are real.

[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.440]
Things that at least.

[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.100]
Wayne Gretchen.

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.160]
A frosted face.

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.940]
A present in bush.

[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.080]
Shane, get on the grid.

[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.100]
I just had to whip out that theme.

[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.320]
I just love that show so much and the theme song too.

[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.880]
It makes me feel bad that I hate to clerk like poison now.

[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.420]
I still like Bill Colono.

[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.120]
Now, how come Bill Colom is dead and Dick Clark still alive?

[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.380]
He goes to share there's no God.

[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.800]
Well, there's no justice.

[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.660]
I also feel guilty.

[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.540]
Now, does Josh know who Bill Colom was?

[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.420]
I doubt it.

[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.240]
I don't think so.

[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.320]
I think what we're going to do the rest of this week is only Tuesday.

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:32.560]
We're going to do the rest of this week.

[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.520]
We're going to spend the rest of the week.

[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.680]
Forget about these stupid calls.

[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.780]
George and I will throw out names of people that we're pretty sure you don't know who they were.

[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.280]
One of the education you can get this week.

[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.180]
He'll be asleep before the first hour though.

[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.680]
Defense mechanism that way.

[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.520]
He's afraid he might absorb some useful knowledge.

[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.860]
I have with sports talk.

[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.060]
In 30 seconds.

[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.740]
You're a lot of junior.

[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.600]
I wish you don't know him.

[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.940]
But anyway, or Wally Mackamory.

[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.660]
But anyway, getting back to Bill Colom.

[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.280]
I feel guilty about that because I like Bill Colom a lot.

[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.000]
He was on before either one of you were born.

[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.900]
He was on the first price.

[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.440]
Is right?

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.400]
And he was on a lot of quiz shows.

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.880]
Panel shows to tell the truth.

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.580]
I got a secret.

[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.460]
And I thought his secret was he had a wooden leg.

[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.160]
No, no, no.

[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.100]
What he had told me when he was a child.

[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.080]
And he walked with a really bad limp.

[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.240]
And I thought I had read somewhere he had a wooden leg.

[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.000]
And come to find out that was absolutely not true.

[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.540]
But you'll notice on any if you watch the Game Show channel and those old shows.

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:33.420]
They never show him moving from one like behind the podium to wherever the like an impairment.

[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.020]
Where they have the thing with the chairs though.

[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.780]
You never see him moving because he walked with a really bad limp.

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.400]
I say.

[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.580]
So they never showed that.

[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.480]
So I want to apologize to Bill Colom.

[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.520]
And posthumously even though he's dead as a doormail.

[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.200]
It's just one of those things.

[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.140]
I thought he had a wooden leg.

[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.300]
Didn't mean anything bad by Bill.

[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.560]
But that's way it goes.

[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.140]
So now you know who Bill Colom was?

[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:50.440]
No.

[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.700]
Glasses, short brush cut.

[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.200]
No.

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.980]
Game show host.

[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:54.500]
No.

[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.040]
Oh yeah, that was that price is right, guy.

[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.020]
That's the guy.

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.220]
Very good.

[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.020]
Tell me about him, Jack.

[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.840]
Woulding out with a wooden leg.

[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.180]
Yeah, I woulda wouldn't leg that's right.

[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.160]
In fact, I think he was kind of pig like beats.

[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.040]
If you shake slider but nevertheless, yeah.

[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.780]
Like I said, somebody QYM, hello.

[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:10.860]
Right now.

[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.620]
Yes sir.

[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.200]
How about that kid that just began screaming with the both sides.

[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.060]
It's on MSN between I don't know his name.

[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.160]
Tucker Carlson.

[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.740]
Put that dude on, okay?

[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.580]
No chance.

[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.280]
He's just there.

[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.980]
The question is, Faker, he's not a Faker.

[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.820]
He is what you see.

[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.320]
He's just there.

[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.120]
Maybe the nerd.

[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.020]
Where's a vote?

[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.260]
In fact, it's like a sign that he wears that vote.

[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.160]
I'm a nerd.

[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.080]
I'm an idiot.

[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.520]
A little right winged pantsy nerd.

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.300]
He has a wife, you know, but nevertheless.

[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.220]
Yeah, he's there.

[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.960]
They don't get it.

[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.600]
The biggest Faker on TV ever.

[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.020]
Faker.

[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.300]
Not, they just don't get it.

[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.780]
Plus, I don't think that I think I did a pretty good job of covering most of the bases.

[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.780]
Ronald has a good choice.

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.900]
And Ronald got a few votes.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.080]
Right.

[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.440]
So Ronald has got seven.

[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.040]
I'm going to tell you Kevin Trudeau should have a lot more votes.

[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.940]
Because he's, in fact, a lot of you people.

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.780]
And I bought the book.

[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.740]
I was a sucker.

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.140]
I was in Walgreens there one day.

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.200]
And I saw the book at the counter.

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.860]
I thought, I'm going to buy this and see just how full of crap it was.

[00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.320]
You know what?

[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.020]
It was full of crap.

[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.160]
My God.

[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.920]
The stuff that he writes in it.

[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.380]
Now, you know, he does, you know, out of giving this.

[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:11.480]
He appeals to our contempt for the FDA, for the medical profession, for the pharmaceutical

[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.120]
manufacturers.

[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.460]
And he makes some good points.

[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.000]
So he throws in a few grains of truth in the middle of all his BS, his witchcraft.

[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.440]
You know, he's got miracle curious for asthma.

[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.720]
There's a cure for cancer.

[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.740]
There is a cure for like stupidity, you know?

[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.140]
But the people who are buying his book, obviously, haven't discovered that one yet.

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.760]
Don't buy that book.

[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.460]
Don't buy anything from Kevin Trudeau.

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:37.160]
This is a convicted felon who's been in the slumber twice for fraud, including for using credit card numbers that people bought his crap with the bio.

[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.040]
You know, himself stuff.

[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.720]
And he's got a multi-billion dollar scan goal and a pyramid scan speaking of...

[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.340]
That's pyramid, yeah.

[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.840]
And he's still on there.

[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.480]
WQAM, hello.

[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.060]
It's at line one again, boy.

[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.920]
I'd like to kill somebody.

[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.700]
QAM, hello.

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.660]
Hey, I think Lawrence Welk, he's still doing shows, but he's very special.

[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.680]
He's doing a two or three shows.

[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.160]
WQAM, hello.

[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:02.920]
Hello.

[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:03.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:04.360]
I knew.

[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.920]
Hey, I've got some old names for you here.

[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.840]
And by the way, thanks for telling me about that fresh-faced phony.

[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.480]
I've been curious about that fool.

[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.920]
You know, you can't trust a face a lot.

[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:14.760]
Who Kevin Trudeau?

[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.100]
Yes, sir, whatever he is.

[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.940]
Fresh face, somebody had a smack in the push.

[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.880]
What a con artist, man.

[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.600]
What a liar.

[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.840]
I can't stand the guy that looks one way and in fact, he's the opposite.

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.360]
Yeah.

[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.180]
But here's a good name for you, Neil.

[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.900]
Remember that old Nitsy Russell?

[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.080]
Yeah.

[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.680]
The black guy, he was cool and Orson Bean.

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.520]
You know, just some names to toss around.

[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.800]
I'm out of material.

[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.900]
How, what, wait a minute.

[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.220]
What about Bennett Surfer?

[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.540]
Okay, he's gone.

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.540]
He couldn't handle it.

[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.540]
What about George S. Kaufman?

[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.300]
Oh, Bulk Abrind is like, he's got his finger up his nose now, both her somewhere.

[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.960]
I guarantee he's got his finger in the orifice.

[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.580]
Oh, guess who's got a bad finger about it?

[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.260]
Wait, guess for Rod.

[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.500]
And wouldn't that be a shame if Gus for Rod can't play on Sunday?

[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.320]
Now, what girls team are they playing on Sunday?

[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.140]
Josh?

[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.280]
I don't know.

[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520]
You or Miami Dolphins?

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.820]
Or somebody's Miami Dolphins?

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.980]
Yeah, he's got the finger in.

[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.920]
He probably hurt that.

[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.020]
I know which finger it is, too.

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.320]
They said it's purple now.

[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.000]
Maybe he just voted.

[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.200]
It is election day today.

[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.480]
I guarantee his wife's got a sore finger because she keeps living in it at the media.

[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.640]
She can't hold a sunsendal because she got very, very upset about reading all those terrible things

[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.640]
they're writing about Gus, even though they're true, honey.

[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.180]
Okay?

[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.320]
I'm sure your husband's a wonderful guy and you love him very much and you never stole a freight train.

[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.080]
All of these things, but nevertheless, he blows.

[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.020]
Believe you me, he's bad.

[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:28.940]
He is weak.

[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.300]
Now, he came through for him, my pretty reasonable performance, I guess, last week, in defeat.

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.200]
But nevertheless, by the way, they're playing the prounds.

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660]
Oh, they're going to lose that game.

[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.720]
The Browns aren't all that bad.

[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.740]
They both have a three and six record, but the Brownies aren't all that bad.

[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.200]
They gave the Steelers a pretty good run on Sunday.

[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.120]
Do you see any of that game?

[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.380]
I didn't see any of that game.

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.140]
I'm telling you, they played pretty well.

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.400]
They actually had a seven-nothing lead early in that game.

[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.740]
They couldn't stop the bus.

[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.400]
In fact, we'd like to throw a Kevin Chudal under the bus in some of the other people on this list today.

[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.420]
And this is a list of evil people, by the way.

[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.120]
Everybody at Sunnest List is evil.

[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.840]
Cavity QAM, hello.

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:02.660]
Hello.

[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.840]
You're a great speaker, Neil.

[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.520]
Speaking.

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.720]
Neil, I was actually on a game show many years ago where you said your phone was ringing.

[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:11.760]
I'm watching TV, and it was a nice,事-tank, and it wasn't a big deal.

[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.020]
It was a nice day that I was at the Hamsey.

[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.320]
No, come on.

[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.780]
It was called winning streak.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:15.660]
Yeah.

[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.740]
And I had the misfortune of walking to the restroom while he was washing up.

[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.800]
And I could confirm that the men either had no record with the leg.

[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.260]
Yeah, he had no polio.

[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.900]
He had any form leg, I guess.

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.220]
But worse than that.

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.860]
Well, he was washing up where his leg was supposed to be.

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.820]
I remember that debt.

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.760]
But he had more potheads in his streets than there are in the streets of Miami.

[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.880]
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was not a pretty guy, but he was a good, uh, he was personable. Oh, he was good on the, yeah, he's just a natural

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.920]
He was a good guy and he was a good game show host and

[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.480]
You know the problem is I started playing another show

[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.020]
Chippity and in the middle of the show the producer came over to me and said that don't answer the questions

[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.360]
I'm asking questions, but I want a little bit

[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.520]
Well, that's good because it sounds kind of like sour grapes to me when you start bitching about Bill Collins a gimpy leg, you know

[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:05.660]
Oh

[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.000]
What was the show he was on was it jacked? No, not jacked by that was Jeff Clark the show with a family peer

[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.340]
Remember that I hated that show where they had like a little green building blocks. They had to connect with a family pair

[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.200]
I hated that. That was an awful show

[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.920]
But actually many years later was on a second show I was on the

[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.280]
High rollers with wink Martin Dale. Oh, yes, and I was I came back free time

[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.280]
Let me ask you did you actually have time to count Wink's teeth as you really have 172 teeth

[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.920]
He had at least 172

[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.620]
Yeah, not a pretty site. No, not at all. In fact if you see his teeth on Bill Collins leg, man

[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.260]
That's enough to phew for the rest of your life. Have a great day, pali and stay off those game shows

[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.960]
He was probably out there auditioning for a wheel of torture the other day in Hollywood

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.980]
See the thing that is people are realized you can sit at home

[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.660]
I guess those puzzle I thought you one time I guess to puzzle with no letters. It was so high

[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.780]
I'm very good on the geography one well there in the world, but

[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.280]
When you're under the lights there and you're under a lot of pressure and you're up on a stage

[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.820]
It's a whole different thing. You know a lot of pressure heavy pressure

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.680]
You think and then of course some of the people they pick are Denver than sawdust and I think that's why they do it

[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.440]
They just want to pick certain people are really stupid because they know they're gonna be stupid and they just say hey

[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.380]
Look at how much smarter you are than these stupid bastards. We got on our panel today

[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.660]
Yeah, I'm serious it makes it makes the audience feel better about themselves, right?

[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.860]
446 votes. I wouldn't be surprised if we get near 500 by the top of the hour

[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:31.840]
Which you know what that means Josh that means the race to a thousand the race to a thousand by two and all those

[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.460]
Boda's dollars. Oh God

[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:40.300]
Are we gonna be rich the biggest fake Iran TV Jimi Tammy Faye Baker 96 Dr. Phil 79 Pat Robertson 75

[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:48.260]
Vinnie Hins 61 Bill O'Rally 53 Jimmy Swagger 24 Reverend DJ's Kennedy 11 Janet Paul Crotch 11

[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.060]
Corolla River 9 Kevin, 2009. He should have 9,000

[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:58.940]
He should be in jail for like 50,000 years Tim Russell date Ron Popeel for Ernest Ainsley 3 and Richie Simmons

[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.040]
She's got three

[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.120]
Hey Richie Neil Roger this is 5162

[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.100]
David's a bitch

[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:27.360]
Don't forget to figure out the molemeister the original oyster coming along it to two some people like oysters

[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.820]
We like the doister or maybe we don't 247 a QA I'm on a great Tuesday boy. I just you can smell it

[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.720]
It's such a good day. Speaking of that new Delhi. Remember that horrible story we had about the old Deli

[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.580]
Oh, yeah, how they doused they were with kerosene and sediment fire

[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:47.480]
Should have because they wouldn't come up with a good enough deal the woman died in a calcutta hospital after ants ate one of her eyes

[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.380]
As she was recovering from a corny operation

[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.360]
He said there. Yeah one of her eye eye eye eyes

[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:58.300]
Gory Chakohurti. Yes, it would be fine had complained of terrible pain after the operation in the state run hospital

[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:04.160]
But the nurse told her it was normal left to run attended her son soon men told the press trust of Indian news agency

[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.520]
She complained of terrible pain

[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.400]
But they they're said should be your worst problem honey and she walked away

[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.440]
Nurse probably used to work at the rascal house

[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.880]
He said that when her bandages moved the next day they found big black ants nibbling at her eye. Oh, jeez

[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.320]
I'm never one for eating early in the day, but if I were I sure wouldn't be now already ate my bacon

[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.440]
She died a ghastly death. We don't even know the reason of her death said her son-in-law

[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.920]
It's probably it is the local health minister demanded a report in sin from the hospital authorities in response

[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.480]
Hospital superintendents had a five-member inquiry committee has been set up and there should be a worst problem on you

[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.860]
Well, that could never happen at Mount Sinai. Oh, everybody dies when an ant eats their eyes. Oh, and speaking of that guess who I saw

[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.960]
I meant to mention this yesterday. This is very important

[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.120]
On a biography channel give you a one guess very good

[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.200]
Well, the whole the God's image book the VG

[00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:00.240]
Not thinking I was done. I'm gonna have to play that because I don't think there's any a fart sound in it

[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.040]
Is there no? No, we can play that yes

[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.420]
And yeah, and I apologize for calling Morris give Maurice, but to me he was always Maurice

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.240]
I'm just not one of those into that Brithing but he everybody called him more sense what he called himself

[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.060]
It's still Marie. He'll always be Maurice to me like what he just would have put that burger down

[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:20.180]
Anyway, the BG thing was pretty interesting and I'd almost forgotten how good looking Andy Gibb was

[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.820]
But nevertheless he couldn't sing at all, but he looked pretty good

[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:28.140]
I sang a little bit not too much anyway. Somebody faxed his whole bill counting that'll be the end of this show

[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.220]
Uh-oh, this is that

[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:37.120]
That's um different that's the $10,000 per minute. That's what he could use to be $25,000

[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:40.660]
Oh

[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:45.860]
Ah

[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.360]
Oh

[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.640]
Well, stop that my speaker is vibrating so much I'm starting to get a little bit excited here

[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.040]
You hear the vibrations on that baby. I heard it. I go out

[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.300]
So I don't know. I don't know if I remember that or not the other one sounds more familiar

[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.180]
For that airs out to disc that you have is it? No, it's there's nothing airs out about the well

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.500]
Let's see maybe there is let's see how the match came theme sounds on this disc. Okay

[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.120]
Well, that was the original one that's correct

[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.140]
As somebody you know would say that's correct

[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.480]
And what about the prices right just to be the old one. I'm sure

[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:27.920]
Yeah

[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.680]
I don't remember that at all before my time although you know in the it's telling just stop and think about this

[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.500]
Okay, I was before I was born. This is how old I am now. I was born before there was any television

[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.040]
I mean it existed it had been embedded. Oh, I'll tell you what's the definitive

[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.460]
Oh, yeah, this was the original one but Jack Clark was the announcer remember that

[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:59.760]
And the host is that awful what that was his name that oh he's a worst game host in America in the history

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.800]
Oh, please you know who it was

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:08.780]
I think he was shopping the epic scripted Dalmatian. Don't you remember that? Yeah, thank you

[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.240]
That's a

[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.980]
That's the one checks willery all right very good excellent. Oh, and here's probably one of your favorites now

[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.980]
Do you ever see the movie the check beris movie

[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.800]
Oh

[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.880]
What is it I saw both of them and by the way but the one that you're asking about yeah wasn't bad at all

[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:44.320]
I was surprised after I was very good right and I also saw on biography channel the same story

[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.600]
But of course it's a done more like true to fact although you we don't know what true is it all because he you know

[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.520]
He's like a joker such a kidder like that Valerie plane business taught us all you just really don't know now do you yeah?

[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.400]
Yeah, you never know who might be in the CIA

[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.080]
Maybe that little girl on the bus maybe she's a CIA

[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.360]
Maybe she's kind of Valerie playing huh?

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.360]
Maybe she's claiming or maybe just

[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.700]
Baaaaming so somebody sends him this and this is not going to be a audience builder

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.580]
But I don't care because he was really good bill cullen and you look it can't hurt to learn something okay

[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:19.560]
Maybe you might be important someday maybe you'll be on jeopardy and it was important to know who walley mackle marriars

[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.740]
Okay, or hero fisher or sandy fisher bill cullen full name William Lawrence cullen

[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.700]
Was an American radio and tv personality best known for his role in game shows both as host and panelists which span

[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:35.900]
Five decades both in radio and tv he was born in Pittsburgh and survived a childhood about with polio

[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.880]
They're left him with a limp for the rest of his life

[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.540]
See and most of the later game shows this set was designed in such a way that it came out from behind a curtain or off stage

[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.020]
Riding on something or off a turntable so they never had a walking distance across the stage and advertise the fact that he was a gimp

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.980]
At polio I like the typical appearance conscious TV personality also wore very thick glasses would became kind of his trademark

[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.640]
Even Georgia members that though. You don't remember bill cullen though

[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:05.900]
Come on now crack your pleas. I don't I can understand Josh being the little whipper snapper than he is but it's solid

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.260]
You know come on bill cullen. You don't know. What about Betsy Palmer?

[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:17.400]
Betsy Palmer was in Friday the 13th or one of those Jason what which I was in was she the mom

[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.260]
She was the real butch mom. Yeah, well then it was Friday the 13th

Which is the one with very very boy the first one that's the bomber man. She's a lot butcher in seven to people

[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.740]
After moving to New York, he hosted several radio programs including games shows in the 40s and 50s his first TV game show winner

[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:38.140]
Take all markets and build time production in CBS 52 hosted the highly successful day time and prime time version of the prices right

[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:44.980]
So 56 to 65 long time panelist on two classics. I got a secret to tell the truth with the bud ciger and Gary Moore

[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.640]

[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.800]

[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.060]
Um, okay, and you're gray cullen hosted 20 different games show some of the shows in the long-risk food

[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:11.060]

[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.760]
Barry I got the jack very croak before or whatever

[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.280]
Jack Barry now there is a bad game show host for jack Barry who went to the jail or now he didn't go to jail

[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.860]
But somebody did for rich is faxing right now when he's listening

[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:27.800]
I just want to get a message out to him because rich does a cover sheet for all of his faxes

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.220]
Yeah, and there's a big old box where he can write his facts in the con the cover sheet instead of wasting two of our pages rich

[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.820]
Just write your stuff on the cover sheet and cut the crap

[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.760]
He always does this I try to fax and bad. Let's see

[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.080]
I've got a secret to tell the truth match game and date hamburgers and the pyramid the Dixlar coast

[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.160]
That he was subredigastinose shows what made Colin so beloved is that he made everything look easy

[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.800]
You could make the most complicated games seem simple easy to learn

[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.780]
He also had a disarming self-deprecating with the toti didn't take life very seriously

[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.940]
He often referred to himself as uncle bill and did his his personality had a certain

[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.760]
Avocular nature he made everyone feel welcome and wanted

[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.840]
He was very bright man a pilot during ww2 long time love of anything mechanically

[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.560]
Fanatical sports fan did color commentary and college football running his career

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.240]
He wants involved in broadcasting track and field NBC

[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.280]
One I've got a secret especially the producers learned really if they wanted to keep the game going for a while

[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.980]
They never start with bill if it was anything sports related or mechanical because you know it immediately

[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.500]
He was married three times his first marriage was a brief full-mouse still living in Pittsburgh

[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.920]
His second marriage was the singer Carol Ames from 1949 to 55

[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.120]
He was then married to former dancer model and macumber. I wonder if she was kind of richer than a cumber

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:38.080]
Why don't some little cumber's her locally from 1955 really yeah dick macumber former a fantastic driver at pomp and opar

[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.580]
How you don't dick good guy a model and the cumber from 55 to his death in 1990 from here comes the part

[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.320]
I want to get to okay all you kids out there is don cherry would say

[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:52.300]
Proud lung cancer at the ages 70 been a smoker all is a belt like it wasn't a polio decademy was able to

[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.180]

Man when it's out toss them out

[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:12.380]
Now let's see what does this say what about Marlon Perkins and Jim Fowler from each of Omaha's wild kingdom with their staged animal capture adventures and

[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.320]
Whatever y'all be picking on poor Marlon Perkins right love the I love his pancake house

[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.940]
Uh, here's another fact. This is a long lines of many hint. How about Peter pop off to I don't even know if we can say that

[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:29.020]
Not anymore never see Peter pop off not lately possibly even more evil in him some focus focus faith here

[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.420]
Are speaking in tongues loads the last okay? Let's put him on there Peter pop off P.O.P. O.F. F

[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.400]
It says I'm not sure that's not P.O.P. O.V

[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.360]
But nevertheless then it make him a hockey player Peter pop off

[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.780]
I'm positive that the joy to get real nervous about that 1057 a Q.A.M

[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.120]
This is Neil Rogers

[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.180]
This is 5.69

[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.620]
This is the Neil Rogers show

[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.340]
This is your brain

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.220]
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:13.880]
That's who they are the wheel of fortune game. I just got to win spin the wheel again

[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.620]

Big me a letter

Bankrock what do you mean bank right? I don't care how much money I got to spend

[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.520]
Can't come to look at that day jack again

[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.400]
Won't throw in the towers still like by your bowels O.V.O.V.O.V.O.V.O.

[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.700]
Big me a letter. Hey man. What do you mean there's no fn 4?

[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.760]
Vanna pick me a letter. No one does it any better. I dream about you

[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:43.700]
Hey man. Is that an all over town or what? Vanna I don't understand why you make a hundred grand up for me to say

[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.040]
Anyway, give me a ticket for an aeroplane

[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:55.100]
Gonna be on the wheel of fortune game. I just got to win spin the wheel again

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.380]
Or Vanna pick me a letter

[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.240]
No, I don't think I'm a right

[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.600]
I have my faith back to let me do it

[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.680]
Hey there now in that world is a low rider

[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.740]
All right

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.040]
No, I don't

[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.120]
Forget the letter man. I'll take that a while. You beautiful baby

[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.640]
You'll make complete a home game

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.120]
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane

[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.020]
All right

[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.500]
I'm on the wheel of fortune game

[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.000]
I just love that sound. I'm in the bonus round

[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.940]
Hey, Vanna, pick me a letter, lose a turn, hey, pass, lose it,

[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.840]
Vanna, pick me a letter, no one's out there any better, I dream about you

[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:38.320]
All right, that is all over again, Vanna, I don't need to stare, but are you wearing underwear?

[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:44.180]
I can't wait to say, anyway, I don't care how much money I got to spend

[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.820]
Can't stand to look, can't pass, say, jack again

[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.420]
Won't throw in the towel, still like by your bowels

[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:56.820]
Oh, Vanna, pick me a letter, lose a turn, pick me a letter

[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.240]
All right, I'm ready to pick, baby, ABCD, EMD, AKT, KLN, no people are asleep, we WXMID

[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.760]
That's your cover now

[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.200]
All right, I take the sofa, the blender, the microwave, the refrigerator

[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.940]
Hey, man, what do you mean, 500 dollars for a black and white five and portable TV set?

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.780]
You got ripped off, man, my brother will not forget for your old sales

[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.560]
Give me that money and I'll buy the TV set, man, all right?

[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.020]
Hey, why don't you come on, baby?

[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.700]
All the good news is there is a Peter Poff office ministry, I did a Google search on it

[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.720]
And the first thing that came up was from a website called fraudalert.com

[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.340]
So I guess Peter Poff office ministry sure qualifies for the pool to these, everybody got a vote

[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:53.180]
And then the first hour, 536, pretty overwhelming if you asked me, not pan

[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.560]
Now last night there was a chick that, big boobs by the way, the light's here

[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.060]
On wheel of fortune, did you see her?

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.520]
No, why not?

[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.620]
What do you laugh at about?

[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:01.920]
How about you Josh?

[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:02.960]
How about wheel of fortune?

[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.220]
Easy old women games

[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.520]
And anyway, so she gets to the bonus round and she wins

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.200]
She gets the puzzle, whatever

[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.940]
It was a big bash, was the puzzle, big bash

[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.820]
And it was a nice solve

[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.820]
And so Pat opens up the thing that she picked out with whatever the prize is inside

[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.320]
And he looks at it real quick, oh I'm sorry and then he holds it up, it's 100 grand

[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.820]
100 grand, which of course is only one of those on that little wheel, 100 grand

[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:33.300]
Because most of the time when he win cash it's the bare bottom, 25 grand

[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.520]
But you want to throw that back, you know, like catching a small fish

[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.800]
Just throw it back, 100 grand last night, you'd have been very proud, she was well endowed

[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.960]
And they might have even been real, but I doubted

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.160]
He said with an unpopular war in American public increasingly less trusting

[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.820]
President Bush faces the lowest approval rating of his presidency

[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.460]
He put that new poll yesterday, the cabinet is under the poll, baby

[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.240]
So many polls and so little time

[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.120]
That's what the Pope said

[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.160]
Bush also received his all-time worst marks and three other categories

[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.040]
And they see an end USAIDA Gallup poll

[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.100]
The categories were terrorism, trust within this and whether the Iraq war was worthwhile

[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.460]
His 37% overall approval rating was 2 points below his ranking in October

[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.740]
Both by, let's see

[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:14.520]
60% of the American adults interviewed by phone Friday through Sunday said they disapprove of how he's handling his job as president

[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.200]
And we got three long torturers years ago speaking of torture

[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.380]
Our book are things like that, three years

[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.260]
I warn you people, don't say I didn't tell you so

[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.960]
You can smell a fascist, you can smell a lunatic from a mile away

[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:31.960]
The stench of commoners, the mad bug, would say is emanating from a 1600 Pennsylvania avenue

[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.360]
The White House says it doesn't pay attention to poll numbers, yadi, yadi, yadi, right

[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.780]
Bush also rated poorly in the new poll for his policy on terrorism

[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:43.860]
For the first time less than half, only 48% of those surveyed said they approved how he's handling the war on terror

[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:48.620]
Let's see, 60% said it wasn't worth going to war in Iraq and 38% said it was worthwhile

[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.540]
When asked about his abilities, 49% of those surveyed said he was a strong president

[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.860]
49% said he was a weak leader

[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.580]
About 50% here comes the most important part of this poll, I love it

[00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.560]
I wish that asked me

[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.380]
50% of the people poll say they dislike Bush

[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:07.620]
While 6% claim they hate him, they don't just dislike him, they hate him like poison

[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.300]
When asked of the new poll if they trust Bush more than they had trusted Bill Clinton

[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.860]
48% of the respondents said they trusted Bush less, 36% said they trusted him more

[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.360]
And 15% said, men's men's the same

[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.120]
So I do like that, 48% said they trusted Bubba Moore, which had said it had been a lot higher than that

[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:29.680]
In the poll 56% of registered voters said they would be likely to vote against the local candidate supported by Bush

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:36.400]
Only 9% said the first choice the next year selection would be Republican and supports Bush on almost every major issue

[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.520]
How do you like that?

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:42.900]
56% said the country would be better off of Congress controlled by Democrats, 34% by the Republican

[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.720]
And the rest of them said a plague on all of them they should all rot in hell with FP&L

[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.000]
Speaking of the eroding supporting from his own people now, this is a good story

[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.860]
Well better late than ever I guess before we get to 3000

[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.760]
In a side of increasing unease among congressional Republicans over the war in Iraq

[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:06.640]
The Senate is considering today a Republican proposal that calls for Iraqi forces to take the lead in next year in securing the nation for the Bush administration

[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.600]
Lay out its strategy for ending the war when in doubt get the hell out

[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.840]
See that?

[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.200]
We're talking about that right now, that's my secretary

[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.840]
What is your Biden? He's by this time

[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.320]
People in drool believing this

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.700]
Not just because Americans are dying as tragic it is because they don't think they have a plan

[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:27.660]
What I think all Democrats and Republicans have finally decided to do is tell us the plan Stan

[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:32.020]
Tell us Mr. President what's the plan? It's the first time this is happening

[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.180]
Tell us the plan Stan, sounds like a great line for a song

[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:40.940]
The Senate's all-screwd scheduled to vote today in a compromise and I was last night there would allow terror detainees some access to federal courts

[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:46.500]
The Senate had voted last week to prohibit these being held from challenging their intentions to federal court despite a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary

[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:54.420]
But now the war must turning baby they had those elections last week in Jersey and Virginia and California with Arnold and all that stuff going on

[00:51:54.420 --> 00:52:01.200]
And now they say oh well what was us what was us we better run us far away from this guy and the Henry Hyde you know run far away

[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.600]
Okay, let's get a whole bunch of calls in there because I think Bill Cohen probably opened up a real Pandora's box

[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:13.420]
5670560 what the hell was that show with the with the little green nuggets on here what was that awful was it blockbuster?

[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:24.400]

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:30.680]

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.140]
Pretty punty

[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.180]

Oh he was just awful he was in bursting I felt bad for him

[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:07.140]
Well very few people I've ever seen in television that just wanted to crawl under the couch and just hide oh Jack you're so bad

[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:11.580]
And who's fascinist is crap okay I mean it was nice that we got to build a common one

[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.520]
Born James

Faye Nars Faye I wonder if he's into Faye Wayne or Faye Ray James Faye Nars

[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.600]
And of course he was brother of Jack Nars another game show host changes named to avoid confusion

[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.160]
Probably don't care about Tom Kennedy it was okay he was on Moceean he was on the name that tune

[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:43.180]
Right all right and then in the cemetery of Jose the sequels called name that prune and then they got that one in Liberty City called

[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.260]
Too bad the Beatles never meant Elron hubbub you know

[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.860]
We really do have a shot

[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.160]
There's an old guy that shot goes Bob Parker

[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.720]
Nice hair by the way look at that white I think he's gonna die during the taping on one of these shows

Oh, I bet you don't know Johnny Olson I would say you're more from the Rod Roddy era

[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.580]
I thought we're talking about the biggest fakers on TV which we are that's our poll question and then all of a sudden

[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:59.080]
How we got into this build column thing where did that come from I don't know from your ainus

But he was pretty good. He was no Dorothy kill gallon. He was no soupie sales

[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:13.700]
Oh, you like soupie sales and so do I yeah, what's wrong with that? I wonder how did you see soupie sales on game shows on panels and stuff

[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:19.340]

[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.520]
Somebody Q I am hello. Okay the biggest maker on TV. Yes, Kevin Frodo

[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.920]
Yeah, he's on there and he ought to have a thousand votes

[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.980]
He's got only 14 that's because they don't know who he is

[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.800]

By the way, it's Dan Kelly and he's still then

[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.980]
Just just amazing you see that's the one good thing even though you're getting close to the big box in the ground as you get older

[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.280]
There's so much more you know and of course the punks like Josh think wow who wants to know that anyway believe me

[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.260]
You want to know it you feel left out? Oh?

[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.660]
Do I know that's just a little no you don't you're right look at all the great things you got to look forward to WW3 all that good stuff

[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.440]
Like wait wait till like 40-year-old guys are gonna get drafted

[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.100]
What if this guy gets on like on the right speed?

[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.980]
We just don't have to start like this

[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.820]
No, there was a fun show I don't care what anybody says and we can go through the whole Richard Dawson thing and talk about his ego

[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:34.280]
And in fact that he got tossed off the show because he was a jackass and a drunk but never left by the way because I was thinking about

[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.660]
You know because I don't like to watch the the reruns of

[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.080]
Game shows all right. There's here somebody said us to think about Ray Cohn

[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.140]
Yeah, just before I picked this up I was talking about Richard Dawson and I played the family feud thing

[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:48.440]
Did I play family feud or not? No, I played match here. I was gonna play family

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.480]
But that thing is it it was a comedy show where they were just coming up with comedy lines and that was the idea

[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.640]
So it's funny and it's always funny and it's well wouldn't have any comedy show when you got people like nipsy Russell and Charles Nelson Riley

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.280]
You're fair in the bread summers. Why I hated her. I don't know

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.300]
I know that's why Jack Cugman sounds like they have to get no lung cancer. I think just from screaming at that bitch

[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:14.600]
That's why he sounds like that today Jack Cugman isn't it strange wouldn't you thought that he would have gone first and not Tony Randall?

[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.200]
I would have I think Tony probably he probably

[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.440]
Vittable because making all my babies, you know when you get to be 70 and you exert all your energy making a lot of babies you

[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.240]
I meet your maker

[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.440]
Ray Cohn was poor Ray. He was at that. He was pretty good

[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.060]
But he wanted to be another Johnny Carson that was the whole deal. Now what we always read I guess I didn't read

[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:35.700]
audiences initially accepted his performance on family feud despite the inevitable comparison to long time

[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:41.180]
Hoaster Richard Dawson by 93 high-ever the shows ratings were declining I see

[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.100]
Jonathan Goodson who became a chairman of markets and productive after his father's death a year earlier

[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:53.420]
Made the decision to replace com so the man he replaced Richard Dawson. Oh, I see a very unhappy visibly crying comins walked out of the CBS

[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.500]
Studios before the end of his last episode in

[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.840]
94 where they winning family got 77 points in fast money

[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.200]
Is this what they put cares about that?

[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.460]
Combs this missile from feud was money many events that ultimately there was suicide by hanging I thought he shot himself

[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:13.940]
He will learn something every day 96 he hanged himself an auto-wast didn't 94 nearly paralyzed him

[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.960]
He went through financial problems after comedy club he wouldn't sit in anyone bust

[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.480]
He also separated from his longtime wife with whom he had 14 children get out

[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.320]
14 children. I didn't know he's an orthodox you or a Muslim god or Catholic or a good Catholic or really good

[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.940]
Kelly several attempts to make it back at the TV most notably as host of the cable game show family channels all failed

[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.580]
He checked out the psychiatric ward under when the series a shock therapy. Oh my god. Just like Jack

[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:45.140]
And he went out California hospital and hanged himself in the broom closet with bedsheets on his wife's 40th birthday

[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.520]
He was discovered after a horrible smell was detected by staff members

[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.340]
He was only 40 years old and a member of the seven-say ad vet is now that Kettle-like puts a label on

[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.780]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.320]
Miss a spike needed a more featuring tray

[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.480]

[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.460]
You know you're lack of knowledge about important stuff

[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.560]
I know all that history and religion and stuff that you think is important

[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.860]
You better get with more practical crap. I know like that Raymond Burr was gay. That's important

[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.820]

G. O. P governor's race tight Harris Pales Bill Nelson in a Senate bid by about 7,000 points

[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:03.360]
Attorney General Charlie Chris to fair and chief financial officer Tom Gallagher remained deadlocked in their bid for Republican nomination for governor

[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.280]
While U.S. Representative Catherine Harris is far behind to come and Democrat Bill Nelson in the U.S.

[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.860]
And raise a new pool shows just out only moments ago

[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.260]
Bill Nelson gets 55% against the 31% for Catherine flux fixed the election Harris

[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.780]
That's not even close enough for her to fix you know it no

[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.960]
Harris high ever was favored by 46% in the primary race against U.S. Representative Mark Foley

[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.740]
There's a lot of queens running this

[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.500]
Racism Florida. How do you like that next year?

[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.480]
Mark Miss Foley and Miss Christ. How do you like that?

[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.680]
She has 46% of Mark Foley 29% so that's good news

[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.800]
Totally however would fair about to say against Bill Nelson

[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.580]
So that's really good because it looks like they'll take her to run against Bill Nelson and will be a shoe-in for old Billy boy

[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:47.280]
Who's kind of weak if you ask me? He ain't no Bobby Graham Foley briefly sought to be a public nomination

[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.100]
Presented last year before dropping out for personal reasons

[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:55.080]
Yay and hasn't said whether he'll challenge Harris in the primary who you kid in Mark come out sweet art

[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.080]
Would you be to a starlight Jesus or you can anybody or what?

[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.500]
Nelson was elected and we know that the survey raised the possibility of a close 2006 governor's race

[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.720]
Why US representative Kim Davis of Tantley, I see governor

[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:11.740]
Kim Davis of Tampa let states said under Rod Smith among Democratic voters for the party's nomination was in a statistical five

[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.540]
With the two Republican guber and editorial hopefuls Davis was supported by 25% Democrats 15% for Smith

[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.440]
However, don't know it's delayed on who they are 56% Democrats and who they

[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.620]
So that's so what's going on there? We're getting ready for next year now

[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.100]
We're gonna throw all the Nazis out when in doubt toss their ass out. Well, speaking of Nazis

If somebody take the gloves off and cut the crap already, okay

[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.420]
How is it that people were so blind maybe they were like I don't know what they were doing

[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:21.480]
They were like looking the other way. They're always looking the other way. They were worried about important stuff like survivor

[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.600]

Crap, that's American specialty is crap, and that's why we got what we got now

[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:34.880]
But even even the people obsessed with crap like the God Squad even they're starting to say well wait a second here

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.000]
We got some real problems with a scoop ball

Doug Thompson writes that his president Bush jets off to Asia

[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.380]
He flees a country bitterly divided by his policies and a Republican party an open revolt over his many failures

[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.060]
The mood in both the White House and the nation harkens back to the days of Lyndon Johnson and Richard and Nixon

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:54.420]
Says retired political science professor George Harley who served in the Nixon administration

[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.680]
Nixon was able to fly to China and for a while various problems with diplomatic triumphs

[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.520]
Nixon like Bush was a flawed president

[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.000]
Unlike Bush Nixon had diplomatic skills

[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.540]
Bush leaves behind a nation in turmoil ripped apart by an unpopular war in Iraq and increasingly this trustful of leader

[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:14.660]
Who sent Americans to die there is use of veterans data attack opponents of his war has angered and further alienated veterans groups

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.860]
Another political misstep by an administration barbed by frequent escalating screw-ups

[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:24.820]
The president resorted was old playbook of this red-rated red-wreck about the war on terror and political attacks and his own political

[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.820]
Forchins and credibility diminished that said I'm an ordinary leader the wimpy hairy read no relation to Greg

[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.480]
With pull showing 57% of the American people believing Bush lied to leave this country in the war in Iraq and now let me

[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.020]
Can I interrupt this at that point go ahead if 57% of the public believes that he lied to get us in this war

[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:46.100]
We got almost 21 hundred dead Americans. Why are there not impeachment hearings going on right now shut up

[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.060]
Why do you hate America?

[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:55.700]
Republican political strategies is not tell their candidates to abort any association with the president and to moderate their views away from the extreme right-wing position of the GOP

[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.620]
Other finally starting to catch on to that, okay?

[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.720]
The president is gone too far and the party is gone too far since Harley those who returned to the center might stand a chance in next year's midterm elections

[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.740]
Those who stick with the president the far right do not no chance not a zip-but-a-do-da

[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:16.200]
Even notorious conservatives like Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum chairman of the Senate Republican conference are avoiding appearances with Bush

[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.780]
Santorum cited scheduling conflicts that kept him from appearing with Bush during the president's veterans

[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:25.120]
Attack any Iraqi war critics, but Santorum also told radio talk show host

[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.780]
Oh, I said talk shock shock Don I miss it shock that a dead man can be on the air cold Don I miss it

[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:36.320]
He doesn't intend to appear with the president for the time being he's keeping his distance shock shock shock my ass

[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.840]
Santorum needs a reassert separation with establish independence from the president

[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.420]
So voters believe he represents their interests is Terry Madonna

[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:48.420]
The list and polls are at Franklin Marshall College in Pennsylvania Republicans like can have every reason to be concerned and they are

[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.320]
They are

[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.160]
Republicans you need to hear worth of Arizona says he won't campaign with Bush when asked if he wanted to present to come to his district

[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.920]
He said in a word no not at this time a word in a word

[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.820]
Hey, what also says that he won't use the president any campaign ads other Republicans have been bushes dragging the party down

[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.200]
Bush isn't a funk says former centimed jury leader Bob dual maybe he's one of the funk brothers

[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.820]
He's about to hit rock bottom and the party is down there with him says old Bob dual

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.200]
But others say the president's fall can continue and with the fortunes of the GOP

[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.100]
Alessment of visits to Virginia to Stump for Republican. Well, if it only built Carl it would have been there to stump for him

[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:22.400]
Right

[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.200]
The Stump for Republican governor to roll candidate Jerry Kilgore said is one of the reasons Kilgore lost the race

[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.900]
He had in the bag weeks earlier and losing GOP candidate New Jersey blames the presence on popularity for his loss

[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.760]
If Bush's numbers were where they were a year ago even six months ago

[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.140]
I think we would have won duck forces set after losing Democrat John Corzine

[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.740]
Other Republicans married in scandal face tough election battles next year said

[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:48.400]
Majority leader Bill Fist caught up in an insider stock investigation would lose if the election were held today a poll shows

[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.060]
Bush is trying to turn the tide by launching a new series of attacks on his opponents a well-worn strategy

[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:57.100]
Often used by chief political advisor Carl roped the rescue as president times the crisis

[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.960]
But backlash against the veterans day speech suggests the public isn't by that act this time around

[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.560]
The public has heard all this before and it isn't selling this time around says political scientists

[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:13.000]
Harley with apologies to Merit at the Wilson the Republicans got trouble that starts with T and Rams would be in that stands for Bush

[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.820]
And he liked that neck you starts with T. Rams would be

[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.860]
And Rams would push and smells bullshit

[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.700]
6509 votes. We're gonna have about 700 votes by the top of the new now and you know something

[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.820]
We are really rolling it. You know, I'm pretty soon. You start smoking it and then Joe can like jump right out the window

[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.340]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.340]
This is

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.560]
Only in the banana republic baby only in Miami

[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:51.220]
I was working in the White House late one time when my ears heard something that wasn't right

[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.900]
I think Jamie Carl roared and that scuda guy

[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.380]
revealed the name of a CIA spy

[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:01.620]
It was a long study

[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.360]
Now they're all up the creek

[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.760]
indictments coming as we

[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.520]
It was a long

[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.020]
General Carats are having run

[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.600]
investigation has just begun

[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:22.260]
Suspects include the entire

[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:23.880]
push

[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.380]
administration

[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.660]
It was a long study

[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.080]
George Bush is starting to think

[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.660]
Things are looking pretty pretty

[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:39.780]
Cause of the mom's

[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:46.000]
Oh the Levitamemid conquer would draw from Iraq we just defeated on a Senate floor 58 to 40

[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.720]
How do you like that? I just showed Carl live and screaming and gesticulating and just got those bifurcals down on the end of his nose

[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.120]
Yeah, I said bifurcals don't get panicky

[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.340]
Here's a little more on that girl shooting stuff

[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:03.080]
A 17-year-old girl shot another teenage girl this morning on a charter school bus in Miramar the victims injuries

[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.960]
Thanks God are not life threatening

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.700]
The two girls got into an argument yesterday according to police and the argument continued this morning after both girls got into school bus

[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:14.720]
The bus was on its way to parkway academy charter school around 745 this morning

[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.200]
The bus picked up the suspect first then the victim and the argument continued

[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:23.180]
In the 3700 block of woods gave drive near county line road the suspect pulled out a swallhand gun and

[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:28.880]
But a thing hitting the victim in the upper torso the victim was rushed to memorial regional hospital in Pemberton Pines

[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.040]
Is that where you took me that time? I think it might be yeah, I had my uh my vet

[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.200]
Had a little running with the wall there that time a little bunk on the head

[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:42.440]
The suspect ran away her home located at the substance such in Miramar is now surrounded by police and a SWAT team

[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.840]
Students who witnessed the shooting said the victim joined in with the other girls yesterday and making fun of the shooters here on the school bus

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.260]
As it took them home you don't be messing with my hair baby

[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:57.320]
Right now a physical fight broke out between the two girls continued in the hood today student witnesses said the shooter who had a black eye

[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.920]
Got out of the bus went up to do the girl, but a bang and I got off the bus

[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:06.260]
Two girls in the area are also in their lockdown as a precautionary Annabelle C. Perry elementary and

[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:13.160]
Henry D. Perry middle school at 3,400 wildcat way parkway academies to open the parents allowed to take their children home

[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.240]
How do you like that? I make fun of my hair

[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.600]
What are you doing that no more you idiot you quizzling you fed it right

[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.480]
Fies it also anyway. I got a pretty impacted fart and

[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.360]
It's interesting how different hosts have a different effect on the

[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:36.280]
Really good show if you don't like card sharks. There's something a. O. S. Game shows go. Yeah, I never saw card sharks

[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.880]
I saw it. I never played along. You know what I mean? It's not passing

[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.780]
Well, it was one of the thing here. I just saw it in passing anyway

[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.660]
The first host on card sharks was Jim Perry least I believe he was first and he was very good

[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.200]
He was excellent

[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.340]
He was the definitive host and then the second host was the umptuous with a stiff collar neck bob u-banks

[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:57.040]
When I see bob u-banks, I want to go on my hands and he's crawling into the bowl and poop my guts out

[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.580]
I just bob u-banks gives me spiel keys makes butterflies call all over my body can't stand him and

[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:07.580]
Conversely wheel of fortune which actually I think I don't know if it ever went off the urnot

[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.180]
But when Chuck swirly was on what it's they used to go shopping

[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.940]
You know and they headed a little ceramic Dalmatian and lots of the graph. Oh the show was garbage

[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.080]
And I don't think it was ever really a major hit when he was on it

[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.360]
And all of a sudden he became low-key Pat say Jack who the you know him and vana between the two of them is not

[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.900]
Nothing special there. It's you know what her flat chest and everything

[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:32.800]
But the fact that it matter is it's a hit and I like it a bander just see they're perfect for the show

[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.600]
That's not a show that requires a lot of like a dynamic personality is somebody like mess it out

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.240]
Yeah, Pat's big thing if the show is the end of the show when time runs out

[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:48.260]
He gives the wheel one last spin and more off a nod because I think he's got a breaky steps on it lands at five thousand and we'll add a thousand

[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.540]
That's six thousand dollars a letter and you're saying holy crap you know what he says? I don't know

[01:22:53.540 --> 01:23:01.900]
You don't even watch that so do you know but why not I everybody watches wheel of fortune housewives man get out of here

[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:07.140]
I'm rich and Josh has seen it. Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. I think it's fine housewives see there

[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.360]
He goes again when I get that crap

[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.940]
Nothing wrong when I true. Why didn't say that it's just not for me. Oh look

[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.080]
Jeopardy's not for me

[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.500]
I didn't say that anything wrong with you watch it just because it's a show for a suit of intellectuals

[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:34.320]
It's fine. You don't know any the question. I know nothing. I don't want to I don't want to answer a question with a question

[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.820]
Okay, I don't want to answer a question with a question. I don't want to wait. I got a minute for it man

[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:44.360]
I got the postings out me a little fortune before she even turns the first letter at the end of it. That's the point right really easy

[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.600]
It's not easy. It's not easy

[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.180]
When he answered the puzzle is ish from in Michigan how many people know that hasn't challenged me since I was a child WQ

[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.860]

[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:25.040]
Well, I don't care what it is. I read I mean if you ever heard anybody say go lufa go at the hockey game

[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.600]
Great. I don't know whoever he is. I have no idea Charlie Van Dyker somebody like her some dyke who the hell knows and who cares

[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:54.720]
Everybody watches wheel of fortune you guys out there. I'm gonna you know it. I know it's a good show

[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.780]
And a lot of guys that watch it just for a van which shows the really desperate but never less. I used to

[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:05.320]
She's okay, but she I mean if you were to tell me that she's hot no take that one hundred grand last night

[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.600]
She was hot. She she made van look like

[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.520]
He's pretty no partner come on a partner holes much to do about nothing who

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.760]
Right. That's what I'm saying. She's certainly not hot

[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.600]
Seven hundred eight votes. I must be reading that wrong. I must need some new a mag division reading glasses

[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:27.060]
708. It's not even noon yet. What the hell is going on here? Maybe the post will move the blues are over with not and of course

[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:31.800]
You know, it's disadvantaged like Tommy says a mother touch. Thank God. I don't want to be in touch with that place

[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.640]
So you know things kind of like coming back to normal and the reason I asked that is because I got a story here

[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.780]
That's as 400 out of sync signals have powered drivers fuming at lengthy red lights. Yeah, like that

[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:45.520]
They're out of sync the light thing is still a problem your body wash

[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.600]
That's okay in the sink or on the ledge, but this is out of sync

[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.680]
You know you guys that are still using soap. I'm gonna say I don't want to knock you do whatever you want

[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.320]
Like we said before watch whatever shows you like listen to whatever you like stick your finger wherever you like

[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:03.740]
But the fact that a matter is using soap is passé and especially in Florida where all the beautiful beaches

[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:07.660]
At least they used to be anyway. I don't go to the beach with a two-piece bathing suit guys

[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.500]
It's a little on you know and they they were like with the

[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:15.500]
You know what they used to look like yeah with the stripes and the stripes like a prisoner fit on

[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:19.140]
You know the you see them in the silent movies. It's ridiculous and they were made of wool

[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.120]
Were they really yeah, they were throw the documentary on it?

[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.360]
Well, I'm a shabwuli not on the suits, but just the swimming recreational swimming in general

[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.500]
They were made out of wool. Yeah, can you imagine when that's got wet? Oh, man

[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:36.640]
I'd be a little sheepish about words that like that to be got wet almost that something the traffic signals on your commute might be working

[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.140]
Well, and you stop and think about that think back to me the evil times all the nice

[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.660]
Knights in armor and now I mean how do those people?

[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:47.660]
Even keep the human race going because they by the time they got all that stuff off

[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.980]
They're probably too exhausted even do anything. That was the only kind of birth control. They had exhaustion good

[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.960]
God now the Scottish for example they at least were those people quick access you know a quick quick access

[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.200]
I letty traffic signal on course with too bad. We can't play ever again

[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.480]
That's really said can't play that bit that is really very sad. I'm desperately trying to I can't find it

[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.600]
Play a little bit. Oh, I know it's under stick. I'm looking for a spoon. It's not under

[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:20.380]
You got the stick your spoon or it's not gonna bring okay, letty they are so as silly as the brits are the Scottish are like they take it to another level

[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:24.000]
You know it's high comedy to me and of course the people in whales well well well

[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.160]
The traffic signals on your commute might be working

[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.920]
But they aren't necessarily talking to each other the result drivers are with the mercy of fickle lights that hold them hostage

[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.920]
At numerous intersections along a single street. It's your way to big wreck on on the 95 yesterday the floods

[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.300]
Side streets with drivers looking for shortcuts. It's happened Monday morning as Josh well knows

[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.720]
And the situation becomes even worse now you could almost tell how good that microwave bacon was ahead this morning by that grabs

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.780]
Couldn't you tell I can spill it a good healthy and good healthy aroma from it

[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:57.360]
I can't tell you how many times I've come to a large intersection that's factor for miles and the light is only letting five or six cars through at a time

[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.700]
Say Jonathan Maxon or Coral Springs and in addition to replacing missing your damaged signal heads and re-hanging wires

[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:08.000]
Cruise must also be set the timing of hundreds of signals knocked out by Wilma when synchronized

[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.820]
But first of all when were the lights ever synchronized anyway?

[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:16.040]
I wonder that happened. Oh, maybe I've said that I've been there then right this before your time when synchronized

[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.200]
Traffic lights worth a lot motorist had a steady stream of green lights on major roads during rush hour

[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.840]
The way I've always fun it is that when you go through the first light

[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.940]
You see the next one and just as you're getting to it started to go as yellow about you know half a block away

[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.680]
When you get through its red when they fail drivers might hit a string or red lights are way longer for turn arrows on the side streets

[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.060]
If the traffic volume jumps suddenly while the signals are out of whack the delays will even longer

[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:41.900]
That's what drivers and 95 experiences that in morning when a fatal crash crossly seven-mobbino about that

[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.180]
Teresa O'Connor for a lot of day. I'll say the old-time signals are making driving more treacherous

[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.320]
People are trying to beat the red lights. He said

[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.540]
Maxner who commutes from Coral Springs to Boka said adjusting the timing was solve a lot of problems

[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:57.260]
And would have a long time ago too after you get through the intersection it's clear sailing

[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.920]
He said I know the properties and getting all the red lights re-installed and working

[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.920]
But after that's accomplished

[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.780]
Somebody needs to address this problem relief some of the gridlock were stuck with a

[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:12.520]
Browards 1326 signals about a thousand normally are synchronized the county is set reset the timing of 600 leaving 400

[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.500]
Still to be fixed they're way into behind man. They got a lot of work. See it to do a lot of work

[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.620]
Gehadeel I'd what?

[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:24.120]
Director of Browards traffic engineering division is a guy named Gehade. Uh-oh

[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:29.700]
Said at least one of the satellites that every intersection on seven major streets in Broward was synchronized by Sunday night including Broward

[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:34.300]
Commercial Boulevard Hollywood Pines Boulevard state road seven Sanford Road Federal Highway University

[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:40.720]
Draft and a parkage and a paratrooper he said the county is re-timing lights on 11 other major streets to pass within miles of school zones

[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.760]
And it's got a list including sunrise Boulevard Andrews Avocland Park Boulevard power line road

[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.860]
Navi Hill Road rock island road lions road Pine Island road and landing Boulevard high-eatest road and Flamenco road

[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:53.960]
The timing isn't perfect, but if traffic is too heavy the bottom-line intersecting streets is the same

[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.540]
They need to be adjusted the Gehade Meister set the Gehade Meister no wonder they're all screwed up

[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:00.940]
This is Neil Rogers

[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.580]
This is 560 Gehadeel

[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:14.420]
It's Mojave de Dewe and this portion of the Neil Rogers 2012 to an hour is brought to you by the ledded 12

[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.400]
What do people buy 570 9,000 11,000

[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.700]
So lices of pizza all for me

[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:37.600]
I was standing there was a not thinking I was dying

[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:41.100]
From being able to make you do

[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.400]
I should never eat things all alone

[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.840]
I'll take back all the traffic inside my cowboys

[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.960]
I'm on the car, car, car, car

[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.780]

Now my heart stops you shrugged that sign out

For my infestant sounds

[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.400]
I'm dying all the way out

[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.840]
I guess I should have known what to expect

[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.580]
Living in Miami

[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.940]
Which the kind of service you can in this town

[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.380]
I would act in need to

[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.120]
Oh, whoa

[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.760]
If I didn't eat that grass I swallowed

[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.720]
Why can't you live me so do you can lie

Why can't you do this get it right

[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:40.840]

For every one of these famous families

She was a bad drug problem

[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.580]

[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.780]
Blame themself

No I don't know

[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.940]
I wouldn't think that guys like that

[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.760]
We have enough intelligence

[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.460]
Don't take your brother to Mount Sinai

[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.560]
Take him any place else

[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.160]
Do not take him to Mount Sinai

[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.180]
At least not that one

[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:32.580]
Why not?

[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.300]
Oh, I was there

[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.140]

[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:36.500]
I did

[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:37.600]
Last thing I said

[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.860]
By a guy on the phone

[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.020]
I'm dying all of it

[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.520]
I actually thought that was the end man

[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.180]
The job they did on me

[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.360]
I had to break my way out of that place too

[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.720]
731 votes on the poll

You know what I'm going to do tomorrow

[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.740]
I'm going to take a preliminary poll

[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:56.060]
I never

[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:58.620]
I don't usually tip our head on the polls

[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.900]
But I'm a preliminary one

[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.160]
You know

[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.560]
I'll stick it on there real early

[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.540]
And the poll too

You know

[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:11.960]
Tasted in their earlobe

[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.480]
I see

[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.400]
Kind of crap is it

[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.280]
No, wouldn't you agree with that?

[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:14.980]
Yes I would

[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.720]
But you know there's part of our crowd

[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.400]
That'll say that

[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.240]
Just because it makes them feel better about themselves

[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.640]
And then just just to prove that I'm all

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.200]
Whipped up about this after lunch today

[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.140]

Well because it's on cable a lot periodically

[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.340]
I'll catch it

[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.520]
Oh it's on cable all the time

[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.400]
But you'll never catch it

[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.580]
I think you like it

[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.300]

[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.280]
Uh I guess it's like me

[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.480]
Nobody else knows who that is

[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.080]
Do you ever hear him?

[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:36.300]
No

[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:36.980]
Josh?

[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:37.700]
No

[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.560]
We never heard no Peter Popoff

[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.100]
Like I said his ministry is honored

[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.000]
Google it

[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.640]
And you see

[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.000]
Frab.com you immediately know that

[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.160]
This guy belongs in it

[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:47.980]
We just don't know who he is

[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:48.840]
Maybe we're better off

[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.780]
WQAM hello

[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.520]
I kneel

[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.120]
Yes sir

[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.460]
I kneel I was on

[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:54.200]
Topola 2

[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.140]
In 1963

[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.400]
Oh my god

[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.100]
But Coyote with the MC

[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.520]
Right

[01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.500]
The panel was

[01:34:59.500 --> 01:34:59.980]
Superman

[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:01.340]
But Coyote was Superman

[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:01.840]
Yeah

[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.140]
Hello

[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.100]
I'm here

[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.460]
I'm playing a theme song

[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.880]
Which one do I have?

[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.100]
The panel was the one

[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.300]
The panel was the one

[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.320]
Eight boroughs

[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.480]
And eight boroughs

[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.140]
Big fat eight boroughs with a big fat head

[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.320]
Yeah, bring it man though

[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.300]
Bring it man

[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.160]
Anyway

[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.000]
And Phyllis Dumin

[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.320]
And after the second rehearsal

[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.720]
The producer called me over

[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.120]
Before they taped the final show

[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:26.800]
Yeah

[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.400]
And he said to me

[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:27.700]
Listen

[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.540]
You can't be funny on this show

[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.320]
But Coyote has to be funny

[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.280]
I said

[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.060]
But I'm not trying to be funny

[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:34.700]
Anyway

[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.260]
They taped the final episode

[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.360]
And one of the questions that was asked

[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.480]
What are you aware

[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.840]
When you do this

[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.640]
For other ways

[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.600]
The name of the person was Mary and Hathney

[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.440]
She used to jump left on the pier

[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.780]
On the back of a horse

[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.040]
Into a 50-foot

[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:50.660]
If you remember that

[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.120]
Yes

[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.240]
Anyway

[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.680]
One of the questions was

[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.700]
What are you aware

[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.960]
So the first person Mary and Hathney

[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.140]
Says I wear a crash helmet

[01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:59.040]
And a bathing suit

[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.240]
The third person I was in the middle

[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.320]
Said she wears a crash helmet in the back

[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.180]
And I said

[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.220]
Afternoon or evening

[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.920]
On the first drop

[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.060]
You know

[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.540]
Then the next question

[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.580]
Two questions later

[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.020]
They said number one

[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.940]
How big is your horse

[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:16.380]
And she said

[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.020]
She didn't answer it fairly

[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:19.020]
Number three

[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:19.440]
What is

[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.120]
You know how do you measure a horse

[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.340]
Okay well I guess he had to be there

[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:23.820]
53670560

[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.600]
Why did I wait so long

[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.560]
I try to be a nice guy

[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.060]
And I just

[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.620]
I just waited a little bit too long

[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:31.640]
I just wait a little bit too long

[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.200]
I just wait a little bit too long

[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:39.260]
I never know why you don't know how

[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:41.600]
You just wait a little bit too long

[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.300]
You just wait a little bit too long

[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.140]
Who better was before Great Reads Time

[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.580]
He could have been a great panelist down there

[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.280]
56670560

[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.140]
Pound 560

[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:50.780]
Even rise in a singular wireless line

[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:51.800]
See this kind of stuff

[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.340]
When we reminisce it brings out all the

[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.000]
Living and Breathing Younger callers

[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:56.260]
WDQAM

[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:56.620]
Hello

[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.480]
Neil

[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.320]
Yes sir

[01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:58.960]
Neil God

[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.540]
I just think I saw the funniest bumper sticker ever

[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.100]
It was a picture of W

[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:03.840]
And it said

[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.700]
Like a rock

[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.660]
Only rubber

[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.960]
Rock solid

[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.920]
Excellent I like that

[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.220]
Like a rock

[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:10.160]
Okay thanks

[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.540]
Well I tell you these are phone

[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.500]
When they go boy

[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.240]
They really go to there

[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:13.520]
Nothing

[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.420]
They let you know that they're going to go

[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:16.880]
WDQAM Hello

[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.040]
QAM

[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:19.360]
Sounds awful

[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.740]
Sounded to me don't

[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.380]
In fact I don't see anything happen there

[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.260]
Oh there it is

[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:23.700]
QAM

[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.200]
I see that

[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.960]
My phone must be catching on to him

[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.240]
It was the Ron line

[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:29.820]
WDQAM Hello

[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:30.980]
Neil

[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.780]
Yes sir

[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.100]
Were you really one of those Peter Popples

[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:34.560]
Popples?

[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.200]
Yeah

[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.600]
He's some terrible guy in the morning

[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.160]
He's always got this miracle water

[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.720]
And he's always telling me if you drink it

[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.700]
You're going to get lots of money

[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:44.440]
There's always some crazy black lady on there going

[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.760]
Oh they said he checks

[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.260]
And they come in one after another

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.300]
One after another

[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:48.500]
What's that?

[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.260]
He looks like Satan himself

[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:52.060]
So he's just kidding

[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.720]
Oh God he must look like the president

[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.760]
Yeah he's terrible

[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.800]
He's telling me

[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.600]
Okay he said they're both terrible

[01:37:58.580 --> 01:37:59.420]
567-0560

[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.420]
Peter Popples

[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.500]
He's not in the morning somewhere

[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.080]
Maybe he's on

[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.220]
I don't know where he's on

[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.400]
You can google it

[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.840]
Yeah the senate defeated the Iraq war time table

[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.780]
The 11th Amendment

[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.940]
Because it's all Republicans you know

[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.240]
Or at least most

[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.540]
That's what happens when the democrats

[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.680]
There's all those central elections

[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.300]
When we get like a Mel Martinez in there

[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.660]
You got real tourists maybe

[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.220]
For help on this we'd better go to Peter Popples

[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.300]
And start drinking that water

[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:21.820]
WDQAM Hello

[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:24.740]
Neil we're making fun of the pizza shister

[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:25.420]
He might come in

[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.320]
If you have bought a bank

[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:26.960]
Yeah

[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.100]
Oh that's it

[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:29.860]
That was the end of that

[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.360]
WDQAM Hello

[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.420]
Welcome to Buka

[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.040]
WDQAM Hello

[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.700]
Hey there how you doing

[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.340]
Pretty good

Good let me turn you down over here for a second

[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:38.360]
Please

[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.400]
Thank you

[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.380]
You were talking a lot about Bill Kell in this morning

[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:41.840]
Right

[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.420]
He was great

[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.300]
He was good

[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.240]
He really was

[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.000]
That was the quintessential TV

[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.120]
Game show host I think

[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:49.420]
Correct

[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:52.220]
And you were talking about him having polio

[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.700]
He did serve in World War II

[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.200]
And he did

[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.380]
Get his leg shot up on top of it

[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:56.720]
Wow

[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.360]
My father was on this show

[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:58.820]
I guess

[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.300]
One a whole bunch of great rappers

[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:01.480]
Yeah I'm with you

[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.340]
I guess

[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.420]
I guess

[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:04.660]
Yes I guess

[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:08.700]
It's a good show

[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:09.660]
The colors are great

[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:10.840]
They really are

[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.060]
Have a great day Pellie

[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:12.680]
And you

[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.900]
And see

[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:16.980]
Probably this past noon at 560 WDQAM

[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.660]
We're going to have like 800 more

[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.840]
Whatever we got

[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.120]
750 it already

[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.980]
I am so impressed you kiddie

[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.600]
It takes a lot to impress this old queen

[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.280]
I'll tell you that

[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.460]
But boy I am really impressed

[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:28.860]
Here's the facts I'm impressed

[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.080]
A lot is being made about me

[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.120]
But about very long

[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.680]
Same crack different year

[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.180]
Saddam Hussein

[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.560]
But a bit bit of up bit of up

[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.400]
Ah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.160]
Oh this goes on

[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.420]
Thank you very much

[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.100]
It's called Restanity Obvious

[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:46.440]
I agree with you wholeheartedly

[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.460]
And you make a very good case

[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.940]
But it's kind of like that guy

[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.460]
That club before it was on to tell the truth

[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.560]
They wanted to like recreate the whole show on here

[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.140]
It would have been okay

[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.300]
After the first little cute scene

[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:57.020]
But I think he's still talking

[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:57.980]
I could be wrong

[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.580]
But I think he's still on there

[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.120]
That enclosure of that story

[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.180]
1213 at 560 W.A.M

[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.820]
But even loves Neil Rogers

[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.560]
I'm not a fan of Neil

[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:49.720]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.760]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:51.840]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:51.840]

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:51.840]

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:51.840]

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:51.940]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:52.620]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:53.720]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:53.880]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.500]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.660]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.040]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.100]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.740]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.680]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.740]
I'm not a fan of Neil Rogers

[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:07.460]
These are family trucks all day

[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.520]
That drop some weight but who's your friend

[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.420]
The doctor has been a stage of no gain

[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.100]
A sedition keeps you busy

[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.940]
The whole scene up now

[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.920]
My head's spinning all round and round

[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.120]
Has a slip for three days now

[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.760]
Woo-woo

[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.140]
Woo-woo

[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:38.320]
Woo-woo

[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:38.660]
Woo-woo

[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.100]
Woo-woo

[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:39.280]
Woo-woo

[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:39.420]
Woo-woo

[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:39.420]

[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.060]
The ending time poppin' an oxy-z

[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.640]
I've already put a couple of thin fans

[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.460]
It's all a big favor, what do you think?

[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.920]
The end energy, what's the hurt no more

[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.640]
And how about her husband A position?

[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.880]
He's my favorite right

[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.400]
What are all the time greatest doctors

[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.780]
Those were the days man

[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.480]
I was just thinking about that studio of packs

[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.140]
And how much bigger and pusher it was than any other one we ever had

[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:57.660]
When the grade?

[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.520]
What's for lunch today from Howeys?

[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:01.920]
There's a tonys that been

[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.540]
Brad brought pizzas

[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.820]
Brad brought pizzas

[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.280]
No pizza thief in there

[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.460]
We got extra pie for him

[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:11.940]
You got extra pie for him all myster

[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:15.020]
I'd like to see you go in here and offer me a pizza offering

[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.160]
A pizza offering

[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.260]
If you turn it down like you're sitting there

[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.480]
If you refuse first time he won't ask again

[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.920]
I'm not gonna beg him to take any pizza

[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.660]
It's here for anybody who would like to have it

[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.220]
Anybody would like it? There's a whole bunch of pizza from Tony's right up the street

[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.380]
Brad brought it in special

[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.720]
The chef cooked special

[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.840]
The girls will knock your socks off

[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.160]
773 votes on the pool

[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.760]
We're gonna have 800 by the bottom of this hour

[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:40.200]
We're gonna go over a thousand a day easy without any stress

[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.560]
No mess, no stress, no undress

[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.980]
Speaking of undress, mom's expertise in in a 30 year

[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.680]
But 30, man!

[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.840]
Remember that's where we had it?

[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.580]
Golden Colorado

[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.340]
They should have given her a star, a gold star, a purple jelly bee

[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:54.540]
Right

[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.720]
Now what do you... you're making me really hungry

[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.140]
Because I had lunch on my mind already

[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.320]
What are your thoughts on dessert?

[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.040]
Skip it

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.900]
A woman who had... that wasn't what he says

[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.240]
Maybe that was what he says

[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.240]
You gotta see that movie, I'm telling you, you would like it a lot

[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.620]
It's really very freaky, you write up your alley, Sally

[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:11.600]
It's very good

[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.400]
A woman who, uh, Thoreau de Stead had sex with high school boys

[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.080]
During alcohol and drug-fueled parties

[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:16.680]
Oh right!

[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.960]
Has been sentenced to 30 years in prison, and this will say

[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.960]
This is in Golden Colorado, I do like their mustard though

[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.040]
Sylvia Johnson, 41 of our vanta color artists,

[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.160]
Trapped herself to investigators as a cool mom

[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.320]
Who was never popular with classmates in high school

[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.020]
And who was beginning to feel like one of the group

[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.200]
Was kind of a group-grope, but she's 41

[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.120]
What's wrong with that?

[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:38.220]
Keep leading Gilly and July to Mr. Meener counts as sexual assault

[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.240]
And nine felony counts, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor

[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.480]
She was also sentenced for additional charges of 30 to be assault

[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.480]
Violates of restraining order and harassment of unrelated cases of the living of your husband and children

[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.760]
Prima-secuted and prosecuted spokesman Carl Blesch

[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.100]
Blesch, authority said Johnson held parties for the boys almost weekly

[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.500]
Between October 2003 and the next October

[01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.940]
They said Johnson provided drugs and booze to eight boys

[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.040]
And that sex with five of them

[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.780]
Johnson was to be sentenced to September 26

[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:06.180]
But hearing was postponed after she was injured the day before

[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:08.560]
While writing in the SUV that heard often in her state

[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.700]
She's got some problems for a silvia right?

[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.380]
She's just having a tough go of it

[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.120]
Look at Ed, what does that say?

[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.180]
A ledge broad and run off election and weir?

[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.900]
Well, that's in Liberia, we don't care about that stuff

[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.460]
We don't care about participation

[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:23.960]
You care about Liberia?

[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:24.580]
Not really

[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:28.340]
Not that Charles Taylor is going, I wonder if he's still driving in Northville down in Charlie Taylor

[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:30.040]
How about Frank Taylor with the one thumb

[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.240]
And Ted Taylor?

[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:33.300]
Sam and flavored soda, anyone?

[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.920]
Oh, I hate to do this while you're in the middle of your nice lunch from Brad

[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.960]
Sorry, go for it

[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:42.100]
Jones soda adds a Pacific Northwest twist to its Thanksgiving flavor and it smells fishy

[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:43.820]
You know who they had on from New Orleans yesterday?

[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.360]
Now that they're trying to like, talk every way to go there

[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.720]
And it's really going to be great and just avoid the swimming tootsy rolls

[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.520]
I give up

[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.560]
Tall prudon, big fat chef that looks like Tom Deluis

[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:56.700]
That was the only name that came to mind but I thought no, that'd be too easy

[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.140]
Oh, and it's who was?

[01:44:58.300 --> 01:44:59.900]
Well, I don't know anybody else from New Orleans is that?

[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.140]
How about Amelalaggassy?

[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:01.700]
That's not right

[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.800]
He's got a couple of restaurants there, Amelalaggassy

[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.480]
He's also got those restaurants in Vegas and they're not really good

[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.400]
What is that?

[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.000]
What's the oil?

[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.320]
It's Wolfgang Schmuck

[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.620]
Every time that restaurant it's in the MGM

[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.240]
I've walked by it

[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.140]
That's kind of why I'm here

[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:14.920]
It's not bad

[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:18.600]
The food is pretty good but the portions are just enough for like six people

[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.200]
Why do right restaurants do that?

[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.000]
Well, what's the point?

[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.140]
Are they trying to impress you?

[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.900]
I mean nobody in Vegas is going to take a doggy back up to the room

[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.100]
Or a real pig

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.320]
Follow him, Sam, like as well

[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.380]
It's just not done

[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:34.580]
So what's the point of like if you order pasta they give you enough for a family of ten

[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.060]
You like fill up a bathtub with it

[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.080]
That does sound like a good idea

[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.580]
Have somebody like sprinkle a whole bunch of maybe great fresh parmesan all over you

[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.680]
For beverage connoisseurs, tired of turkey and gravy

[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.720]
Or green beans and casserole flavored sodas

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.380]
There's a new choice being offered this year by Specialty US Soda Manufacturer

[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.420]
Jones Soda Company

[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.280]
Sam and to which I say

[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.800]
I don't like salmon to begin with much less salmon soda

[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.700]
Yeah

[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.900]
Jones Soda the Seattle Company that scored a hit during last two holidays

[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:04.700]
Seasons with its turkey and gravy flavored sodas

[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:08.440]
Said it's offering the orange-yued fish flavored drink this year

[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.580]
And not for the Pacific Northwest salmon catch

[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:13.200]
I mean if it tasted like Timasan and that would be different

[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.140]
Even Josh knows who Timasan is

[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:15.740]
Yes I do

[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:20.620]
When you smell it it's got that smoked salmon aroma said Peter Van Stoke Chief Executive of Jones Soda

[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:22.620]
It's got that, oh fishy smell

[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:26.260]
Like when you go to like an open-air market you know like an outdoor flea farmer market

[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.920]
And they got all the beautiful produce and cool cuts

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.600]
And then you get to the part where you get fairly close to where they have the fish

[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.760]
Like in Boston these days they're always really neat outdoor markets, farmers markets

[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.520]
And then you get to where the seafood and the fishes

[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.140]
Oh this smell, this stench

[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.660]
Ah God you just want to pass out or like if you go into a supermarket

[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.800]
They've got some seafood center, you know what I'm saying?

[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:46.200]
I do

[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.720]
Oh takes forever to get that taste and smell out of your sources

[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:51.480]
You know I don't know Henry

[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:56.120]
The artificially-favored salmon soda will be offered as part of a $13 regional holiday pack

[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:02.060]
That also includes other unusual sodas such as turkey and gravy, corn on the cob, broccoli casserole, and pecan pie

[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.260]
Now that sounds up my alley

[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:05.600]
Ooh do I like pecan pie with some whipped cream on it

[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.400]
And maybe even like a little dollop of ice cream

[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.180]
Banana nut

[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.620]
Ooh doesn't that sound good?

[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:13.300]
Pecan pie with a big two scoops of banana nut on there

[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:15.240]
And like a whole bunch of whipped cream in a cherry on top

[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:16.280]
That does sound good actually

[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.620]
Ooh man and like put it in the microwave for about 8 seconds

[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:21.620]
And let the ice cream melt this a little bit on the pecan pie like a kind of warm and bucey

[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:22.980]
Ooh man

[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:25.600]
While those bottles are offered will be offered locally

[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.660]
Jones soda is also selling it similarly price holiday pack of turkey and gravy

[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:32.680]
While herb stuffing, rustle sprouts, cranberry, and punky pie sodas across the country

[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.340]
Oh wouldn't that be great to have punky pie soda?

[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.280]
Uh no

[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.780]
Thanksgiving typically features the dinner material

[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.140]
Oh this is what is it?

[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.780]
CNN money like we don't know this

[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:41.460]
Tradition-

[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.200]
I guess written for children

[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.520]
Oh God, bands still could build a Seattle based soda company by some traditional sodas

[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:51.280]
As well as exotic flavors such as green apple, bubble gum, and crushed melon

[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:54.420]
Says the most important thing about Jones soda as we can laugh at ourselves

[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:59.120]
Asked whether we liked his new salmon soda he said, I can't finish a bottle, I just can't do it

[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.880]
Maybe you can, maybe you're a better man than he is

[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:01.480]
I'll give it a thought

[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:01.920]
I'll give it a thought

[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.860]
Just swirl some of that crap down my chugget

[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.820]
Chugget and then just puke up all that nice lunch you're having from Tony's

[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.220]
All over

[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:10.920]
If I go into Greg's room and I just puke all over his desk all over him

[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.740]
Wouldn't that be great?

[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.620]
Say Greg, I wish think it

[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.020]
Yeah

[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:16.380]
That'd be fun

[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:17.380]
That'd be funny

[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.900]
26 past noon and 560 WQM

[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.620]
We got the pizza of myster with two

[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.460]
Mojawa David of the old pizza thief

[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.440]
Two to four, mad dog four to seven

[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.340]
I guess by the time mad dog gets in all the food is always gone everyday

[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.860]
Big bucks he's pulling down he can afford his own food

[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.080]
Pantheon people with seven

[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.180]
Panthers have to month y'all Canadians to play the frogs

[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:35.900]
The Pepsi's

[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.240]
730 tonight with Geltie and the silly red deer Randy

[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.480]
And then you got the hurricane warm up

[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.240]
I don't know, do I have to really go through that

[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.860]
The hurricane stuff is at 830 the games at 9 on the 1360 KT

[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.120]
And had camp ones after the Panther game on QAM

[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.520]
Just all these different ball games and all these different frequencies

[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.240]
And 640 over here and 1360 over there

[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.320]
And used to be 790

[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.960]
Remember what 790 was like our farm team

[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.820]
And we used to farm out all the games that we didn't want on our QAM

[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:00.160]
Yeah

[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.300]
Because Greg's sound like overlapping contracts

[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.400]
He wouldn't do that with he

[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.480]
Still think your Blackberry has you totally connected

[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.060]
Yeah

[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:08.980]
Think again

[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:13.580]
Because now the future of wireless technology is totally connected to you

[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.800]
Introducing the Dingo Berry

[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.100]
Fork get those clunky bell clips

[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:21.900]
The Dingo Berry hangs snugly from the most secure portion of your internet

[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.760]
Take a look at mine

[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.820]
Oh, whoa

[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:30.440]
Email the internet and cell phone service in a device just one can't the size of ordinary PDAs

[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.140]
In fact, you'll never even know your Dingo Berry is there

[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.180]
Sounds expensive

[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:35.540]
Who wipe out my savings?

[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.940]
No, if there was any wiping you wouldn't even have a Dingo Berry

[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:42.680]
Cool, I'm gonna pick out a Dingo Berry right now

[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.020]
Sit on the future with the Dingo Berry

[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.320]
It's everything it's cracked up to be

[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.180]
Reckon, property why you're most happy that I have crazy

[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:52.360]
Enjoy the boys and berry but it couldn't find the Dingo Berry

[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.520]
And he said no mole, no mole for me

[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.080]
He'll probably just come and steal two or three boxes of pizza

[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:02.060]
Sluggest passport lines in my international pit at Homeland Security against the Miami-Dade Aviation

[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:04.320]
Diplomatic are really serious problems here at my MIA

[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.300]
Chronic delays that periodically dog international travelers at Miami International are the product of two few passport control officers

[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:13.080]
Or outmoded facilities depending on whom you ask

[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:18.020]
The federal government insists on all these kids are huffing acts body spray now

[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:19.880]
You know that story it's all that

[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.460]
They're huffing and puffing and dying over there

[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.600]
Quit huffing kids, quit drop the faggot and quit huffing

[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.840]
The federal government insists that the problem stems from inadequate airport facilities

[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.440]
And uneven distribution of gate assignments for arriving flights

[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.100]
Airport and airline managers blamed delays on the shortage of passport control officers

[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.660]
The dispute is exposed to a long festering problem at MIA

[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.920]
The nation's busiest airport in terms of foreign travelers

[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.180]
And for several weeks this past summer through the Miami-Dade County Aviation Department

[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:46.420]
And U.S. Customs and Border Protection into a round of mutual finger pointing

[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.960]
By September, however, a Reckon Southeast in sorts began to emerge

[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.400]
And by last week County and federal officials were talking seriously about solutions

[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.360]
You know this is what cracks me up to

[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.240]
I have any theories in the Senate now

[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.180]
And they're talking about, well let's devise an exit strategy now

[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.200]
Let's have a plan

[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:05.780]
But when you think people who went in there, this is one of the things that they should have done in the first place

[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:06.640]
Why do you hate America?

[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:08.920]
As opposed to all like lining up including the Democrats

[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:12.120]
Oh yeah, whatever you want, let's get all those evil doors, okay?

[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.180]
What a crocker crap man

[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.980]
This is the leadership you got in America

[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:18.260]
And one of the public just forget the elections, okay?

[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.680]
Just let's disband the government, look at all the money we'll save

[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:21.860]
What the hell are they doing for us anyway?

[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.020]
Safety, safety, safety

[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:27.320]
Yeah, old bitch, I'd like to find her, I'll tell you that right now

[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.420]
I'd like to find that old bag

[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:32.840]
800-9 votes, I told you we'd have over 800 buy it and buy the Oblomarriar we did

[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.700]
Aren't you impressed? This is exciting

[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:39.460]
Well no, actually it's like, you know, everything is coming back in a shape after that whole will-mumash

[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.300]
You know, we're doing like, yeah

[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:43.400]
What is this?

[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.460]
I don't want that

[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.200]
No, we know that

[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.680]
The one I wanted was this

[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:54.480]
Another Czech bear I showed

[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:58.880]
And that was where embarrassed by it, but I put it in the name of it

[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.360]
Now the dating game, that was Jim Lang, right?

[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.140]
Jim Lang, I'll take your word for it

[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.240]
He was good, Jim Lang, glasses, you remember Jim Lang?

[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:10.240]
You never saw the dating game? Sure, but I don't remember him

[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.100]
Come on now

[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:11.420]
I'm not a host

[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:13.840]
Ah!

[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:16.060]
Ah!

[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:16.060]

[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:24.920]
Not a way it was that one of the worst shows in the history of TV, but the host, that's that Bob U-Banks again

[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:28.760]
With a stiff neck, the starts collar, he doesn't have a starts collar, he doesn't have a starts neck

[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.140]
Did you ever watch the way he carries his head up?

[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.940]
Like on a plate, sort of

[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:35.720]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.340]
Like it's in the top of his side

[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:42.040]
It's kind of like that picture Lee Harvey Oswald holding that man with her car counter, you know?

[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:45.960]
And his head is like facing in one direction in the rest of the body is in an impossible angle

[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:46.860]
It's kind of like that

[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:51.120]
A Republican senator wants a law to require bright pink license plates

[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:51.980]
You're fairy

[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:56.720]
On vehicles driven by people with restricted driving privileges do the convictions for DUI

[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.640]
Oh God

[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:03.640]
Senator Mike Fassano of Port Nou Richie filed a bill earlier this month that requires the first three characters on the plate to read

[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:05.560]
DUI

[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.860]
What is again? DU

[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:14.680]
Maybe they'll embarrass people and keep them from drinking and driving Fassano said maybe they'll think twice

[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:19.680]
The bill also says police may stop any vehicle that bears the DUI plate without probable cause to check the driver

[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.400]
How do you like that?

[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.140]
It's like we're in like some kind of a tattoo on your head

[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:24.420]
Scarlet letter

[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:29.480]
Ohio and Michigan have similar laws and place other states have debated the issue but fail to pass and do the privacy reasons

[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.120]
Of course in Florida there ain't no such thing

[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.600]
Pink Tates would hold out individuals for punishment as well as ridicule

[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:42.620]
We're very opposed to what's at Larry's spawning legislative council for the ACLU in Florida about 840,000 Florida's 15 million license drivers

[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:45.900]
Have an active DUI sanction on the driving records said Frank Panella

[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:51.420]
If Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles spokesman a small percentage of those have limited driving privileges

[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:53.680]
Especially permission to drive only to work in front work

[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.480]
It could take two years to get to support but I think it's worth the effort because I'll say if I can't get a house sponsor

[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:03.160]
Maybe I can get a pass in the center and attention to a larger transportation bill pink license plates

[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:06.000]
I'm saying you want to be a big improvement over those ones that say choose life

[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.500]
Oh yeah, which has absolutely no business being on a state license plate absolutely none zero zippity DUDA

[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:18.340]
But you can thank your board again here for any role a holy roler fat ass governor for that choose life my ass

[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:20.900]
Yeah, how about my drill business though?

[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:25.900]
Yeah, yeah, how about how about you go and worship your fairytales and I'll do mine and leave me to hell alone

[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:33.000]
That's the problem with these fundamentalist these phony book belonging hypocrites were the dysfunctional drunken coax nerding families

[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.380]
And lying families murdering families they just can't stop telling everybody else how to live their lives

[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:44.100]
Screw you, Jeb and your whole family they got some ish pocha including your smuggling wife

[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:49.400]
God well what a disgrace that probably had a few days ago about the you know the word the worth bush offense

[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.040]
I mean now you could have a what a laundry list that was long as your arm you read a book

[01:54:54.040 --> 01:55:00.760]
Good golly mishmolly starting with press God bush the banker to the Nazis what a classy family huh unbelievable

[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:07.380]
813 votes in that pool. Let's see how it's going haven't leaned on the pool enough because we've had a heavy duty pressure day

[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:13.100]
I thought it was going to be no pressure heavy duty biggest leak the biggest link you ever took

[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:22.080]
The biggest fakers on TV is Jim and Tammy Fe Baker 164 tat Roberts in 149 dr. Phil 143 a fantastic three way of horse race

[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:31.520]
Bill O'Reilly 107 206 and then it's way down Jimmy swagger 39 her all the river 28 her all those moving up there ever since he opened up a grand stume

[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:39.040]
And found out component cited Janet Paul crash 19 Kevin Trudeau 18 he ought to have 18 billion there is a man

[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.680]
I see him on TV I want to like spit blood at the set I wouldn't take like a rock and he but through the screen

[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:50.760]
The Reverend D. James Kennedy 17 Tim Rosard 12 airs on earnest ainsley seven Richard Simmons has got six

[01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:02.040]
So I guess we got a good warning though. It's probably a pubic service that the facts you did

[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:09.100]
Give this to put him on a poll because now if you see Peter pop off of bus your TV set later on fired at put a bunch of kerosene on your

[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:15.480]
Set and light it on a match to it 5 6 7 0 5 60 the calls have been sober that guy was right we ought to take like at least

[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.200]

[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:52.740]
Well, it's real a fortune. Actually he was watching the George Wapner's what he was watching but nevertheless you know just make it up as you go along.

[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:57.740]
Charlie Babbit. He called back because he wasn't Charlie Babbit again and he's not related to Billy the

[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:02.520]
Vibit as he from who was next nobody belongs there. Somebody Q a.m. Hello. Oh,

[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:34.920]
just like he sold out on that offshore drilling that he lives with teeth about all of a sudden he changes my well.

[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:42.100]
Maybe it's not such a bad idea after all this man. You know any. Yeah. See this is why it's just so difficult for me to

[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:48.120]
fathom even though I've been there for like 30 years. I know there's a lot of really stupid people but how is it you can have an

[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:53.360]
election like on the thing with a slots in Broward and the people say, okay, well we want it. We agree to it.

[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:59.000]
We read what it said on there. We know exactly what we're voting on and then they just just keep dragging their feet and

[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.520]
drag and our feet now here. It's going to be in December. They're going to have a special session and maybe they'll do this and

[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:19.180]
time when I had to go as boring guest and boy he was boring. He was a consumer advocate but at least he would like fight

[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:26.860]
F.P. N.L. He would like to go to bad something like this. We need somebody. Somebody like we need some assistance here is what we need.

[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:33.800]
Like Lee Harvey Oswald said. Remember that? He was I need somebody to come forward some assistance. I didn't do nothing.

[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:38.520]
20 till one at then he didn't do not need to but of course you'll ever know the truth on that. Well I'll be

[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:44.240]
dead and buried by the time. Oh guess what? He didn't do it. When disaster strikes and of course we're talking about hurricane will my

W or comfort.

[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.900]
It is for their right.

[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:26.940]
I'm not sure.

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:27.260]
I'm not sure.

[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.480]
I'm dying on the air.

[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:36.020]
I saw like two minutes of it. I saw Miguel was in there not our Miguel but the Miguel from passions. What's his name again? What's his name?

[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.740]
I have no interest. If you've seen two minutes that's two minutes more than I have. Maybe 30 seconds.

[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:55.260]
A network TV show about sex or anything like that. It's just soap opera. It's nighttime soap opera which is fine. I didn't watch not signing all those years but that's long gone.

[02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:00.500]
I don't know. I just have no interest. Don't have room in my life for any more of that crap.

[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:09.400]
Cheeseburger bill high on the GOP menu in Washington. Fears that overweight Americans will develop an appetite for litigation drove the house to pass a bill that would bar lawsuits by restaurant customers.

[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:14.560]
Claiming burgers and fries made them fat. I don't see. Why can't I sue?

[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:19.860]
Hogniz for making a banana me a banana nut. Yeah for making it so yummy that you can't resist. That's right.

[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.000]
Because you know damn well they're putting like all kinds of additives in that crap to make it really addictive.

[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:28.320]
And don't tell me that those chemicals aren't like you're addicted to them because you are. They're adding sugar.

[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:35.380]
Trial or as I've said they target restaurants the way they've targeted the tobacco industry. National restaurant association president Stephen Anderson said.

[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:43.580]
No such flood litigation is yet to develop. Lawyers who follow the issue know of only one restaurant obesity suit a 2003 claim by Tony or Teenage against McDonald's.

[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:50.500]
But there are deeper reasons behind the campaign for this who called shebird or bill legal industry observers including rising liability insurance rates.

[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:58.540]
Consider Washington about lawsuits and general also is driving the bill which clear the house days before Congress also ran a gun makers immunity for any injury lawsuits.

[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:02.560]
Both are part of a larger effort by Republicans to shield certain industries from litigation.

[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.560]
The president for example submitted a bill to Congress last week that would predict producers and distributors of emergency vaccines from injury suits except in cases of willful misconduct.

[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:20.660]
There is a growing feeling that if this trend continues every major industry would be immune from lawsuits said Jonathan Turley or we see his ugly push on the TV all the time.

[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:24.000]
George Washington University law professor you see him right if you say so.

[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.280]
Well you would know Jonathan Turley from Bob Turley.

[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:34.260]
No. A dozen other industries such as those who make airplanes and weight reduction products could make the same arguments raised by gun makers and fast food restaurants you said.

[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:43.560]
The personal responsibility and food consumption act approved last month would borrow lawsuits seeking to blame individual food and beverage producers for persons weight gain obesity or related health problems.

[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:49.500]
The Senate is considering the companion bill and President Bush already promised to sign it of course.

[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:51.900]
A thing to do to protect his buddies and big business.

[02:03:52.380 --> 02:04:04.240]
21 states had passed similar bands Sacramento Law Ray lawmakers rejected one such bill to the spring but they proposed federal bands sponsored by representative Rick Keller of Florida would apply in California other states when without bands and food.

[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:13.460]
The bill is a complete waste of time said Linda Lipson is spokesman for the association in travelers of America of all the problems there are this is really ludicrous she said.

[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:21.140]
But industry officials point to a handful of suits over artery clogging transplants and nutritionally things assigned to obesity suits are at risk for restaurants.

[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:28.700]
I am tired of the whole deal you know the same with the tobacco companies that's the only problem I agree with this thing about the restaurants and food men.

[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:39.660]
No nobody's making the choices for you okay those the ingredients are right there under the right reading weep okay if the product is legal and just like that the skull and crossbones it's on at pack a cigarette them

[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:50.900]
Faggots out there and the big warning in huge letters that even a blind man can read this is gonna kill you smoking his craft is gonna kill you right cigarette smoking kills and it's better that they're still popping and huffing and puffing.

[02:04:50.900 --> 02:05:02.740]
Oh but the nicotine is addictive and like the sugar isn't a dick in the stuff that I'm eating all the time that they're ice cream which they should really rotten hell and you sugar people by the way oh yeah better not get too excited about them they get really hard on the sugar.

[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:18.480]
Yeah the sugar crowd they start playing an archie song coming right up 800 and you never got the night time brother no one is going to get the beans baby now some people I'm not gonna play a whole lot of music tomorrow the audience gets very upset you know it's nothing to play.

[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:30.340]
Yeah see how they often relate to that they like Bob Barker or at least they like Barker's duties or maybe both I know he likes them a little bit too much and nothing wrong would be in the 90 year old guy would white here that's you know chasing

[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:41.620]
about all the Barker beauties on it right not at all if you can get away with it exactly what's wrong with a little sexual harassment that's what Clarence token Thomas said some like that and he said that I said hop on a little sugar.

[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:47.600]
I think he said it's your little arasmen arasmen arasmen a lot to me.

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:54.120]
Yeah see it's wrong with that. There you go Archie's and the sugar sugar I mean they're smashed there was no Archie's there is no what's that.

[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:06.540]
Just like Ned baby said there is no action there is no there is no work of the etc that's what we said he said there whatever he said 861 votes on the pool I'm just tall to see we're gonna get to a we're gonna get there easy today.

[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:19.260]
This is a Mahaya man this is a pleasure no push and no yelling no squeezing no right no doubt I'm sorry not too big on them although I do like them better than death in these

[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:27.720]
Thai or pink I got maybe instead of having to do why people I think lies in place how about having a forced member listen to that music all day around the clock.

[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:35.240]
It's like it's like Celine Dion music in hell yeah I can't help myself I have to I can't help it Peter Jennings what a life.

[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:21.940]
I think the answer is yes but you've asked a question that a lot of people in the country are going to ask today.

[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:31.040]
Summer said Kentucky for Peter Jennings. Hello. Hi gentlemen. Hi. Mr. Jennings is there Celine Dion music in hell.

[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.780]

[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:59.540]
W. I. M. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. You touch the subject on the board of legislature and I don't know if you heard recently but the

[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:04.860]
paramutials were having poker tournaments and for some they took them to court.

[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:16.440]
Dania Highlight and called her took them to court. We won and it was appealed and they won again so the legislature picked up their books and took the rule of the law off the books that they now can hold

[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:25.940]
tournaments. Could you believe this? That up to that they've in the last year and a half I think they gave like four million dollars to the state coffers. Right. And just be still in poker tournament.

[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:33.100]
So it's obviously a benefit of people are enjoying playing it but yet because the problem people are having a good time you don't

[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:40.280]
understand that that's against the whole Florida philosophy man people are not supposed to have a good time. It's it's unbelievable man we're in a back gate.

[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:49.520]
We're in the dark. You got it man. I'll pray for you. Okay. By the way Canada would like to apologize I want to be the spokesman here. Canada would like to apologize to the whole world for

saline beyond we do not forgive and Anne Marie. Now Anne Marie is okay for a guy. Man Marie. Nice. Hey she's married and got a whole pack load of kids man.

[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:09.520]
Got a whole bunch just like Neil Sedacca. They're not married to each other but that would be an interesting fit. That'd be something. He having a good time. He kind of reminds me of Jeff Garcia a little bit of only not quite so but you know

[02:10:09.610 --> 02:10:24.470]
he don't play sports. I like Neil Sedacca though a lot. No problem with me. Now what's wrong with Neil Sedacca? Although I bet you Josh don't even really know much from Neil Sedacca. You know that song? I know what it's throwing up is hard to do. I know what I'm saying.

[02:10:24.590 --> 02:10:32.230]
It's throwing up is hard to do unless you steal a whole bunch of somebody else's pizza and shovel it along in your crispy face. What a talk up by long distance.

[02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:46.450]
Here's a trivia about that. Yes. The only song that's the only song released twice by the same person in different incarnate number one is a hit each time. Yes. It was number one both times. Right. And he also wrote gloves will keep us together to the captain and she'll meal.

[02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:59.150]
No, no, it was the same song the first time. I'm trying to find it. I only have the one virgin here. I see. You don't have a level of gloves will keep us together with a captain and she'll meal. Yeah, but that's under their entry.

[02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:28.530]
Oh, that was a bad. What is this? Something in a rain? Laughter in a rain? That's it. Oh, there you go. You requested it. Here we go. Captain, show me, oh baby. It's a hit. It's a big big fat booby head. Is there Robert Duval with saying that what he said? That was a great scene. That was sensational. It's a big big fat. He's holding his hands like where his boobies would be. You know, Robert Duval man.

[02:11:28.530 --> 02:11:39.410]
He is so great. And I realized it's not that he's not recognized as a great actor, but I just don't think he gets the accolade to be the zero. What do you say? I mean, why do we have to always honor people after they croak?

[02:11:39.490 --> 02:11:48.210]
Why can't we like that? Just throw a big thing. Say, we love you. And we want to like sniff your armpits and just great and the godfather and network and great.

[02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:58.190]
I don't want to figure out how to edit DVDs. As you know, I know how to copy them now. But once I try to edit them, I'll just cut that one scene from Apocalypse Now for you. So you can appreciate that.

[02:11:58.510 --> 02:12:10.990]

You might be a team.

[02:13:14.490 --> 02:13:17.250]
Well, maybe.

[02:13:18.970 --> 02:13:25.450]
The Carolina Panthers cheerleaders clinic, sponsored by Stanley Stemer, your color-crating specialist, reserved your space at the clinic now.

[02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:30.630]
Call 1-0000 girl on girl. That's 1-0000 girl on girl.

[02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:39.610]
It's 1-02-560-WDQM-888. We've got 888 vote and 8888 looks pretty great to me. I mean, we're going to get to 1000 without even like Lee and Nanya.

[02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:44.570]
We don't have to be a pin in the ass. Come on, let's call you on stuff like that. I know that people are really pissed off about what?

[02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:48.230]
That's what we just did, me and Josh. 8888. And that's what I heard. All that piece.

[02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:53.790]
I hope you left a couple of boxes of pizza for the pizza thief. There's two slices left. We'll make that food.

[02:13:55.070 --> 02:14:00.510]
I thought you said there was tons of it. Well, there were and we got busy. I see.

[02:14:01.130 --> 02:14:05.690]
Sounds to me like you're eating next to just to make sure that somebody got left out. That a bad idea.

[02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:13.430]
Yeah. Well, you I'm telling you guys are brutal. I just I don't want to be associated with you guys in Hank and all these people piling on.

[02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:20.650]
Old man, defenseless old molemyster. He's gone. He's had his moments. I mean, we haven't been involved in him, but he's had his moments.

[02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:25.390]
8888. That's pretty exciting. Well, be here at 2. He can handle himself. Okay, believe me.

[02:14:25.610 --> 02:14:32.590]
Maddog 4 to 7. Panther preview at 7. Geldi and Red Deer Randy, baby. Squeaky Geldi and all he's doing a fine job. Nice going, Geldi.

[02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:37.370]
He's in Montreal. In fact, I bet you if I look at the window, I can't. Hey, how you doing, old Geldi? You squeaky monster?

[02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:42.790]
I just look kind of far away. Not really that far. It's about a 45 minute flight. You'll just love it there. Not.

[02:14:43.450 --> 02:14:44.910]
I was going to tell you where to go.

[02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:52.610]
Oh, you already have a place to go. Panthers at the Montreal Canadian Center at the Bell Center, which used to be the Moulson Center,

[02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:57.630]
which used to be the forum in Montreal, which is another building. The Montreal Canadian Damwood team this year,

[02:14:57.670 --> 02:15:02.170]
they're kicking some serious ass. Although I see coval of his heaven surgery. He ain't playing. Damn it.

[02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:07.490]
But the Panthers are playing it. Panthers will lose every day. And of course, if they have the lead in the last second and a half, they're going to blow it anyway.

[02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:15.230]
But anyway, anyway, 730, that's on the QA. I mean, I'm 1360 AM on WKAT. Catch the cat.

[02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:20.730]
Hurricane Warmop at 830 and on the clock, the Hurricanes and Wisconsin Green Bay basketball from the BCA Classic.

[02:15:21.070 --> 02:15:25.290]
That's on KAT for those who care. And then he cares after the hockey game on QA and for those who care.

[02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:31.510]
How many care about the Panthers now? That's right. Jump off the bandwagon just because they're really disappointed to me.

[02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:34.930]
I thought they're going to be really good this year. They got a really nice baller at the place.

[02:15:34.930 --> 02:15:40.270]
Joe Newman, I always injured now and Gary Roberts is a shell of his. I guess the least were smart to unload those old cuts.

[02:15:40.730 --> 02:15:45.510]
And maybe they can return in sunrise. And they're just, I don't know. They just don't score no goals to Panthers.

[02:15:45.590 --> 02:15:51.610]
Even that game Friday that I touted with Carolina, that should have been a great game. Every time Carolina and the Panthers play a Tacoma game,

[02:15:51.630 --> 02:15:59.250]
it was one nothing with the Panthers on the nothing end. And it's really sad. That anyway, Jack Martin, maybe you don't got those players from other one.

[02:15:59.250 --> 02:16:04.850]
Jack Lala, let's see what kind of coach you really are. All those choke jobs in the playoffs. Let's see what kind of coach you really are, Froggy.

[02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:10.170]
892 votes. Any minute now we're going to be the 900 minutes. The race to 1000. Race you to 1000.

[02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:13.110]
We haven't done line nine even once today. Have we?

[02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:15.190]
70 QAM playing it really bold. Hello.

[02:16:15.730 --> 02:16:20.130]
30. Well, it's a bit spicy. Give me a shot. Okay, good. Dominic QAM. Hello.

[02:16:20.630 --> 02:16:28.850]

[02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:37.290]

[02:16:37.290 --> 02:16:42.270]
Yeah. So are you? I use the world. Well, things in my memory.

[02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:43.030]
All right.

[02:16:48.710 --> 02:16:54.370]
He's a little fluffy one. Yeah. I don't want to guess where he's sticking. I have some ideas. Wow.

[02:16:54.850 --> 02:17:02.650]
Well, he's not Miguel. He's not like one of these. Oh, gee. My master washed my mask. The only kind of a person would say that is going to real hang up.

[02:17:02.650 --> 02:17:08.270]
And the only person would say there would be some Hispanic for the most part. I'm not saying that there aren't isolated pockets here.

[02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:13.690]
And there are people who are really uptight about their masculinity. But you know what it is? You grew up in it.

[02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:18.490]
Did I? Well, maybe you didn't, but you certainly know what I'm talking about. I've seen it the whole machismo thing.

[02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:26.410]
Right. That's right. I'm a macho man like macho. Come on. Like Tommy Cruz. There you go. He's about as much as most of your buddies there.

[02:17:26.410 --> 02:17:30.710]

[02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:50.250]
after reports that two teenage boys died in Japan and parents

[02:37:50.250 --> 02:37:55.370]
suicide after taking the anti flu drug so if you read about uh bird flu

[02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:59.930]
avion flu start worried about tamiflu the deaths of race safety fears about the

[02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:03.110]
only treatment against the threatened pandemic of avion flu that that's our

[02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:06.670]
not linked in a career part the Japanese health ministry issued a warning in

[02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:10.650]
June 2004 about psychological and neurological disorders linked with tamiflu

[02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:13.530]
with an instruction that doctor should be alerted but no similar warning was

[02:38:13.530 --> 02:38:16.730]
issued in Europe and the UK a tamiflu is made by Swiss space

[02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:20.270]
pharmaceutical company roch yesterday is spoken for the European medicines

[02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:24.430]
evaluation agency which licenses drugs in the EU including the UK said the

[02:38:24.430 --> 02:38:27.870]
agency had been aware the first step but not the second roch has been asked to

[02:38:27.870 --> 02:38:31.670]
closely follow reports of psychological disorders delusional states and

[02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:35.490]
abnormal behavior linked with a drug I bet you Joel must be taken at the

[02:38:35.490 --> 02:38:38.150]
moment there's no warning about this in Europe we need to establish if there's

[02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:40.930]
any link he added that the effects of the drug had to be distinguished from the

[02:38:40.930 --> 02:38:45.170]
effects of the flu influenza itself can cause confusion and can be difficult to

[02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:49.030]
tell whether the metal saved the state is effective tamiflu or the illness the

[02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:53.170]
pharmaceutical San medical devices agency Japan as we see reports of 64

[02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:58.330]
cases of psychological disorders like the drug between 2000-2004 the two

[02:38:58.330 --> 02:39:01.190]
Japanese boys were reported to have exhibited that normal behavior after

[02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:04.430]
taking the drug in the first case a 17-year-old high school student was at

[02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:07.370]
home alone ran out of the house and jumped over railing into the path of a

[02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:11.550]
truck in February 2004 shortly after taking the drug in the second case in

[02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:13.910]
junior high school student apparently fell from nine four of his apartment

[02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:18.810]
in building in February 2005 maybe he was an air collecting fan who knows two

[02:39:18.810 --> 02:39:22.110]
guy pharmaceuticals the Japanese hey what you got to think of this the

[02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:25.630]
Japanese operating company for roasty Swiss based manufacturer tamiflu said

[02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:29.190]
we reported these cases of the health ministry as a link between the deaths and

[02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:33.250]
the drug could not be ruled out there you go take it at your own risk I would

[02:39:33.250 --> 02:39:37.490]
just stay away from all of my parents and geese and birds and all kinds

[02:39:37.490 --> 02:39:42.310]
cockatooes all of them 971 on the pool when you 29 votes in 22 minutes should be a

[02:39:42.310 --> 02:39:47.510]
piece of cake even now Michael Corleone would be impressed take you're right

[02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:52.590]
that the dialogue in that movie just it's just so bad it's a shame it is a shame

[02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:55.110]
it could have been a great film and you know he wanted to cut corners that's

[02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:59.250]
way put his ugly daughter would be snows in there and then he had his just craft

[02:39:59.250 --> 02:40:04.430]
George Hamilton my ass I mean well how does he in any way shape or form that

[02:40:04.430 --> 02:40:08.490]
movie that it would a group huh it's a lot like the other star wars movies you

[02:40:08.490 --> 02:40:11.730]
know it's the same kind of reaction like just crapping on an institution

[02:40:11.730 --> 02:40:14.970]
yeah but at least they had a good story to tell here they just did it very

[02:40:14.970 --> 02:40:19.550]
poorly yeah well yeah maybe they should fear you yeah we're stealing from

[02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:23.570]
themselves and then when I'll tell you the same where she's injecting giving

[02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:28.810]
Michael his insulin injection on a patio yeah and she starts oh Alfredo maybe it

[02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:34.610]
was an accident she like I think I love illusion like like he's that crazy he

[02:40:34.610 --> 02:40:38.010]
doesn't know what how he did yeah maybe it was just an accident and somebody got

[02:40:38.010 --> 02:40:42.430]
heard crazy some way they're struck by lifeguard and trucks speaking of people

[02:40:42.430 --> 02:40:47.510]
who are like in harm's way a Miami-B's lifeguard driving a 3,400 pound pickup

[02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:50.590]
truck ran over the head and shoulder of a sunbaid or a Sunday morning but the

[02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:53.210]
young woman was able to lead to her feet is witness screened at the driver to

[02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:59.310]
stop that girl she should give thanks to God that she's a lot because that truck

[02:40:59.310 --> 02:41:03.770]
ran right over her head said high-roly bearers who witnessed the 10 a.m. incident

[02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:08.670]
how do you say that J.A.I.R.O. Hyrule okay yes a miracle she's alive because I

[02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:12.850]
was sure a haid was gonna be crushed he said Jillian Gonzalez 19 was lying on

[02:41:12.850 --> 02:41:16.410]
the sand at South Point Park next to friend Daniel Martinez everybody in

[02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:19.510]
the everybody over there is the name and the Nazee with a blue and white

[02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:23.110]
cooler next to her haid when the truck they're in by Orlando Artees came over

[02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:26.230]
the embankment I wonder if he was kind to lure Artees used to play second-based

[02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:30.450]
for the Rochester Red Wings 100 years ago Orlando Artees the left hair nearly

[02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:33.490]
miss Martinez's head then a crushed the cooler before driving over Gonzalez

[02:41:33.490 --> 02:41:37.050]
let's hold her in chic Gonzalez was standing up and talking after the incident

[02:41:37.050 --> 02:41:40.110]
Libero said it was the first time Gonzalez who lives in Miami spring and there's

[02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:43.350]
a sophomore studying to be a teacher at Miami-Dade College has been the beach in

[02:41:43.350 --> 02:41:46.850]
two months her father said I'll think she'd be going back soon but instead of a

[02:41:46.850 --> 02:41:49.650]
pleasant day at the beach she's spent it being tweeted amongst Sinai Medical

[02:41:49.650 --> 02:41:54.250]

[02:41:54.250 --> 02:41:57.550]
a skib she survived that she was released the same day when Ocean Rescue

[02:41:57.550 --> 02:42:00.870]
representatives Ernie Gonzalez Jillian's father didn't provide specific

[02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:03.630]
information on the original state she was still being examined by doctors by

[02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:08.410]
the grace of God she's at home tonight instead of a funeral home he said since

[02:42:08.410 --> 02:42:11.550]
Wilma Miami Beach's law of life guards to temporarily use trucks in place of

[02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:15.690]
the decimated lifeguard stands court of city officials Artees the

[02:42:15.690 --> 02:42:18.710]
dollars Martinez you see all the connections here huh?

[02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:21.550]
the whole disease they have this yeah

[02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:25.470]
on nine hundred and eighty two we got twenty minutes should be like a

[02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:28.770]
crawling right over there to see what I should now how's the pizza come we

[02:42:28.770 --> 02:42:33.110]

[02:42:56.710 --> 02:43:00.790]
you

[02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:03.410]
we didn't

[02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:05.110]
find in 10

[02:43:10.030 --> 02:43:11.250]
got away

[02:43:11.250 --> 02:43:16.890]
this in

[02:43:16.890 --> 02:43:46.870]
She's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting married, she's getting

[02:43:46.870 --> 02:44:10.470]
She starting to attack me

[02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:23.210]
I remember those very things that were stuck in my hand, felt see this crying and put

[02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:24.310]
it on the crazy routine.

[02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:25.250]
Remember that?

[02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.750]
No.

[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:27.190]
Jim Baker, you don't remember that?

[02:44:27.210 --> 02:44:27.930]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.470]
I've done the thing.

[02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:29.130]
Come on, give everything.

[02:44:29.550 --> 02:44:29.730]
Yeah.

[02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:33.030]
I think we might have our 1,000 votes, but I don't have it taken a pubic at it.

[02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:35.410]
9.96, like I said, we got a little more work to do.

[02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:35.890]
Not a lot.

[02:44:36.570 --> 02:44:37.470]
Don't get carried away.

[02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:40.810]
We don't want to overdo it because we can set the bar too high, then people expect

[02:44:40.810 --> 02:44:41.810]
to go back and do it again.

[02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:44.030]
And this won't happen again any time soon.

[02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:46.710]
Although tomorrow we probably will because we're going to have two polls tomorrow.

[02:44:46.990 --> 02:44:50.770]
The first one being about your favorite BG's, put out your stinking cap overnight and think

[02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:51.270]
about that.

[02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:53.450]
And a lot of you are going to say, oh, the BG is suck.

[02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:54.650]
We don't like the BG's music.

[02:44:55.050 --> 02:44:55.410]
What's this?

[02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.970]
Yeah, you do.

[02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:58.750]
These are the same people that claim that they use soap.

[02:44:59.150 --> 02:45:01.090]
And these are the same ones who are dropping it all the time.

[02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:02.370]
That's why they still use it.

[02:45:02.470 --> 02:45:04.290]
So it's kind of hard to drop the body wash.

[02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:05.470]
It's really not easy.

[02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:08.910]
I've never, not once have I ever dropped a plastic bottle of body wash.

[02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:09.850]
Not one time yet.

[02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:10.790]
Right.

[02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:13.710]
But the soap, just oops, slippery in the dercos.

[02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:16.250]
Let me reach right down and grab that baby.

[02:45:17.150 --> 02:45:21.830]
As the young lawyer in the Reagan administration, Supreme Court nominee Sam Alito Jr. fascist

[02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:25.270]
in chief wrote that the Constitution doesn't protect the right to an abortion.

[02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:29.510]
He cleared his firm opposition to a certain affirmative action programs and strongly endorsed

[02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:32.030]
a government role in protecting traditional values.

[02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:34.310]
Are you following all of those buzz terms?

[02:45:34.310 --> 02:45:38.850]
The comments came in a job application of Entertion General Edwin Meas, the third,

[02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:39.510]
maybe five.

[02:45:39.810 --> 02:45:42.730]
When leader was seeking to bolster his conservative credentials and move up at the justice

[02:45:42.730 --> 02:45:46.410]
department, he was subsequently promoted deputy assistant attorney general.

[02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:49.790]
He said he was particularly proud of his contribution to the case in which the Reagan

[02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:53.470]
administration argued before the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not

[02:45:53.470 --> 02:45:56.670]
be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortion.

[02:45:57.510 --> 02:46:00.590]
Sam Alito, another Nazi and they had what's your name?

[02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:04.210]
Or came on Diane Feinstein before she had her meeting with him today and by the beat

[02:46:04.210 --> 02:46:05.770]
by the boop, he's a very bright man.

[02:46:05.850 --> 02:46:09.490]
But all this other laughing, why not just come out and say is a Nazi okay, Diane?

[02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:10.290]
You bitch.

[02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:12.550]
What is wrong with you?

[02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:15.850]
All these Democrats all beating around a bush so to speak.

[02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:17.630]
That's the problem that I've beaten around a bush.

[02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:18.490]
Not nearly enough.

[02:46:18.850 --> 02:46:20.170]
We got a thousand in some vote.

[02:46:20.650 --> 02:46:21.250]
A thousand and three.

[02:46:21.570 --> 02:46:22.390]
Thank you so much.

[02:46:22.690 --> 02:46:24.590]
And then I said I'm going to put us over the top again.

[02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:25.410]
Mighty white of it.

[02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.890]
There was.

[02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:27.130]
I'm thinking about lunch.

[02:46:27.370 --> 02:46:28.190]
What are your thoughts on dessert?

[02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:29.810]
That pecan pie.

[02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.710]
I'm going to get that.

[02:46:30.850 --> 02:46:35.690]
Since I'm going in the end or listen to me, I'm going to go get the BG's music since I

[02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:36.390]
have none of it here.

[02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:38.570]
I'm sure that it's there where probably behind you.

[02:46:38.770 --> 02:46:39.470]
If there's a soul.

[02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:40.130]
If any.

[02:46:41.010 --> 02:46:41.370]
Yeah.

[02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:42.370]
I look for it.

[02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:42.870]
It's not there.

[02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:44.270]
So it's coming out there.

[02:46:44.370 --> 02:46:44.690]
That's right.

[02:46:45.010 --> 02:46:46.150]
It's a piece of the piece of it.

[02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:49.950]
Our pizza and why would anybody step still on my CD's or send it on a receipt again anyway.

[02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:55.490]
But since I got to go in the store anyway to get you to get my BG's, I'm going to get

[02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:55.950]
you a pin.

[02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:56.550]
All right.

[02:46:56.910 --> 02:46:59.050]
And then you then give it to Josh and we'll see.

[02:46:59.050 --> 02:47:00.030]
We'll see what he thinks of it.

[02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:01.370]
I think you might actually like it.

[02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:02.970]
I'll give it a shot and I'll give it to Josh.

[02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.930]
I know you'll like it.

[02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.190]
All right.

[02:47:04.470 --> 02:47:05.990]
I'd be shocked if you didn't like it.

[02:47:06.350 --> 02:47:08.010]
It's not one of the great movies of all time.

[02:47:08.250 --> 02:47:09.470]
And it's Canadian movie.

[02:47:09.690 --> 02:47:10.130]
All the way.

[02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:11.510]
I don't think it's I don't know where it's shot.

[02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:12.250]
It doesn't make any difference.

[02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:15.590]
Iraqi detainees claim they were put into a cage of lions.

[02:47:15.790 --> 02:47:19.730]
And if we're lion, you're dying to a Iraqi business man who were imprisoned by US forces

[02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:24.150]
in Iraq claim yesterday that American soldiers threw them into a cage of lions in a Baghdad

[02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:27.430]
palace as part of a terrifying interrogation in 2003.

[02:47:27.430 --> 02:47:30.210]
If it was good enough for Daniel and lions, then it's good enough for them.

[02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:31.890]
Remember Daniel and lions then?

[02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.490]
Yes, I do.

[02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:36.190]
And then he saw the head writing on the wall and said, uh, buru khataf, yours, something

[02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.470]
like that.

[02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:37.890]
Did you name his friends who were in there with him?

[02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.370]
No.

[02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:40.210]
Shadrach, Meshach and a bedb-

[02:47:40.210 --> 02:47:40.870]
And a bedb-go.

[02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.590]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:42.150]
Okay.

[02:47:42.750 --> 02:47:43.730]
Meshach is that what you said?

[02:47:44.670 --> 02:47:46.030]
Shadrach, Meshach and a bedb-go.

[02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:47.570]
And to bed we go.

[02:47:47.790 --> 02:47:48.610]
Jews in your names.

[02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:49.590]
Yeah, right.

[02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.510]
You know what?

[02:47:50.590 --> 02:47:51.390]
Sounds awfully gay.

[02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:52.770]
To bed we go.

[02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:53.790]
What kind of prep is that?

[02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:54.410]
Anyway.

[02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:56.450]
They took me behind the cage.

[02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:58.550]
They were screaming at me, scaring me and beating me a lot.

[02:47:58.930 --> 02:47:59.970]
I'm not going to read this guy's name.

[02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.430]
Send an interview.

[02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:01.350]
I can't read that name.

[02:48:01.410 --> 02:48:02.230]
It just makes no sense.

[02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:04.950]
One of the soldiers would open the door and two soldiers would push me in.

[02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:07.530]
The lions came running toward me and they pulled me out and shut the door.

[02:48:07.630 --> 02:48:08.650]
I completely lost consciousness.

[02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:12.250]
Army spokesman Paul Boyce said he's never heard of lions being used in any of the

[02:48:12.250 --> 02:48:12.390]
U.T.

[02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:14.730]
And it's never come up in the name of the boy.

[02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:20.230]
But the interesting part is that Saddam Hussein's eldest son Ude kept lions in his compound

[02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:23.650]
at the presidential palace, which was taken over by U.S. troops during the war.

[02:48:23.650 --> 02:48:25.030]
There you go.

[02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:29.270]
And after they killed some of the wrong people the first time, then they killed Ude and

[02:48:29.270 --> 02:48:31.050]
Hussein and all these other goyem.

[02:48:31.390 --> 02:48:32.510]
They were just fun kids.

[02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:33.290]
That's right.

[02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:37.910]
The two men described the July day in 2003 when they were arrested by American troops with

[02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:38.850]
guns and armored vehicles.

[02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:42.750]
They said they recovered plastic hoods and repeatedly struck by soldiers using the

[02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:43.610]
butt of their guns.

[02:48:44.210 --> 02:48:47.510]
They both described standing in front of a lion cage and said they could hear other

[02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:50.670]
prisoners screaming as the metal cage door crept open the shrine shut.

[02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:54.610]
They threatened if I didn't protest they put me in the cage, said Khalid, adding that

[02:48:54.610 --> 02:48:57.250]
the soldiers kept asking him where Saddam was.

[02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.950]
I laughed.

[02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.970]
I thought they were kidding me.

[02:48:59.090 --> 02:49:00.430]
They asked where are the weapons of mass destruction.

[02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:02.530]
I was very surprised and thought it was weird.

[02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:05.230]
But when he laughed, he said he was only beaten more.

[02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:08.930]
And he said they pushed him into a cage three times, pulling him out as the lions move

[02:49:08.930 --> 02:49:09.410]
toward him.

[02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:13.850]
Both men said they suffered continuing physical and psychological trauma such as pain,

[02:49:14.250 --> 02:49:15.590]
ulcers, nightmares and insomnia.

[02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:19.370]
Very similar to what John Void, the experienced after deliverance.

[02:49:19.370 --> 02:49:24.490]
After that trip up the Kahulalasi River up to entry, Sabar said he was held by US forces

[02:49:24.490 --> 02:49:26.470]
for about six months and believes about two months.

[02:49:26.470 --> 02:49:27.250]
So, let's go.

[02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.750]
And here we go.

[02:49:29.090 --> 02:49:31.350]
Daniel and lions then, John and the Awail.

[02:49:31.470 --> 02:49:32.230]
Was it John and the whale?

[02:49:32.490 --> 02:49:33.530]
It was, but it wasn't a whale.

[02:49:33.810 --> 02:49:34.610]
It was a great fish.

[02:49:34.990 --> 02:49:35.410]
Big fish?

[02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:35.870]
Yes.

[02:49:36.250 --> 02:49:37.570]
I think it was Charlie Tune of myself.

[02:49:38.170 --> 02:49:39.710]
Maybe it was the big Kahuna.

[02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:41.250]
This is the big Kahuna.

[02:49:41.250 --> 02:49:42.110]
How's Robbie Underon?

[02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.390]
He's good.

[02:49:43.170 --> 02:49:43.570]
Yes.

[02:49:44.310 --> 02:49:44.710]
Hey, Robbie.

[02:49:45.470 --> 02:49:46.490]
You're fairly handsome.

[02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:51.250]
You've been a lot of fans.

[02:49:52.010 --> 02:49:52.490]
Five.

[02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:57.510]
The Rodgers are sports-hole radio, WQ-A-L.

[02:49:57.810 --> 02:49:58.070]
Thank you.

[02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:03.870]
Oh.

[02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:06.010]
Oh, right.

[02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:10.350]
