[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.900]
Right now we go to Neil. How can you go on Friday morning when the first game of

[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.860]
Steers the Night? Well we won't be covering that one. Well why not that's the only important one.

[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.980]
I don't think it is. It's some pretty good games this week and actually. That's my opinion the

[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.220]
important one is Steers the Night. I couldn't be wrong about that. Hoping in the wing one.

[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.860]
Hey, by what time about the Patriots? How'd your horse do on Saturday? Didn't get a chance to win?

[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.760]
Not well. Really? Well actually she didn't break. She didn't get out of the gate. She rushed up and took the lead.

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.320]
Yeah. She was ahead by a couple of lanes but she ran that first border in 21 and changed.

[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.240]
How long was it? Five or six for long. Too fast. Too fast.

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.500]
And what happened was she rushed up because she was left in the gate but she showed speed.

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.940]
So the Lord of the Dutchmen used to go 21 and forward colder. She'll run again in two weeks.

[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.180]
Lord of the Dutchmen. Yeah. And Cherry Pop. Whereas Bob Savage used to say,

[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.820]
Cherry Cat. He's a guy Bob Savage. He's still dead by the way and speaking of dead

[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.280]
branded people. Jason, you're on QM. We don't have any national guards there because they're all

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.840]
fighting a war in Iraq right now. Not the National Guard. Not the National Guard in Iraq?

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.640]
No. Actually, there were 5,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard alone in Iraq.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.240]
30% of the international guard is in Iraq and this man, this moron, goes on the year and then he

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.920]
proceeded on Thursday. I was just sitting here doing my stories for the website and I kept the

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.560]
audio on and I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it. Then he went into a rant about

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.940]
the rest of the world. I just want to help us and we're always helping out everybody else.

[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.820]
Castro has 1,600 doctors and 24 tons of food that he wanted to send. It ran off her to send. I

[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.300]
think the unlikliest places in the world, 60 countries in all have offered us and of course,

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.140]
the government was assessing Condoleezza Thursday who came back from a vacation.

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.740]
Tuesday night she was busy yucking it up in New York at the Monty Python play,

[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.380]
seeing the laughing and yucking it up and in Thursday she finally makes a grand appearance and says,

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.220]
while we haven't decided yet, we're still evaluating these offers and it means

[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.160]
time while people are dying and drowning. Condoleezza, you sell out, you bitch.

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.220]
But nevertheless, in the world's time, stick to you and which is public.

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.620]
I have their editorial by the way right here. Fire or get rid of everybody at FEMA immediately.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.260]
Well, there is no more FEMA and of course, the bottom line I don't care what anybody says.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.560]
The bottom line is, George Bush doesn't care about black people.

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.620]
Yeah, that's not his base. That's not his constituency. It doesn't give a crap.

[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.680]
And these people on the media, I'm going to tell you,

[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.380]
Lou Dobbs needs to be a tard and feather. He needs to be run out of Atlanta on a rail.

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.480]
He's a Nazi. He's packed. You can't even drag is what he is.

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.220]
Do you ever watch Lou Dobbs? No. Don't. I don't like him.

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.080]
And of course, this business about, well, you know, the idea of people politicizing this,

[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.040]
I got an article here, White House and acts of plan to ease the political damage.

[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.000]
You know what really frosted me more than anything?

[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.380]
They're more concerned about their own damage control.

[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.280]
That's right. That's exactly right. What pissed me off so bad is he finally shows his ass up on

[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.260]
Airwens Dear Thursday. You know, he goes to Mississippi and he's got his fat-faced buddy,

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.380]
Haley Barber there, good old boy. And then, you know, he does his flyover. He did the flyover

[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.160]
over Louisiana. Didn't dare touch that anywhere except some small corner of the airport where they'd

[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.060]
be safe. And then he finally goes in Mississippi to talk in Baloxie. I guess that was the second trip.

[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.600]
And now it's a photo op. Exactly. He's out of the analysis. He is Mike. This is the thing.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.940]
It would be one thing if we just saw the visuals of him. They're comforting the people and putting

[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.420]
on this phony act. But he is Mike for the event. Why didn't they just hold him a big sign that says,

[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.420]
hey, if you had any doubts, it's just a photo op. Don't worry. He doesn't really mean it. You know,

[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.000]
and he's hugging these young black kids and these other people. Oh, you're so sorry.

[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.960]
With a microphone like we have to hear it, like, gee, we want to make sure everybody understands

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.460]
how compassionate this Nazi is. Man, that pissed me off. But nevertheless,

[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.420]
I tell you who was really good. Jack Cafferty was great on CNN. He was going,

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.880]
an ape's meant man. He went nuts. And even Anderson Cooper, who ordinarily sends me straight to

[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.860]
the pooper, Anderson Cooper butched up. It was pretty good. It's screaming in the out. They were great.

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:23.860]
How about Robert Pat Robertson? Yeah. With his, his whole deal about. Which of it? No. He wants to

[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.700]
have the his Christian network or whatever it is now. I think it's a good idea if they all

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.300]
drown. That's an excellent. He's got some fundraiser thing where after all the things he said earlier

[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.800]
now, they want to make a big controversy. Well, you know, the diamond mines in Liberia didn't

[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.560]
work out too well. All the other deals he had there in Africa didn't work out too well financially

[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.900]
for him. So maybe he's a little bit strapped right now. So let's send him some money. Not.

[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.200]
I thought it was just amazing. There was another. There was a few months ago. We put it on our

[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.320]
website, the power of Nightmares, the documentary of BBC documentary that aired here on a CBC.

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.680]
So last night, I'm channel surfing and I was lucky enough to discover 10 o'clock. There was a

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.100]
there was a first part to that power nightmare that goes back to the whole history of Irving

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.780]
of Crystal and Wolfowitz and Richard Pearl and Reagan and and crazy Bill Casey who was the

[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.680]
director of the CIA who was crazy and then a bed bug and how they made up all of this crap about

[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.200]
the Soviet Union and about all these weapons that they were supposedly devising which didn't

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.940]
exist at all and about how the whole Neocon movement took as foot soldiers all these religious

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.360]
thoughts and how they like joined forces together now of course they're running the country.

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.660]
It's what we're talking about you know Islamic extremist religious fanatics in the meantime what's

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.980]
wrong with America is other religious fanatics crazy people. People are used to be considered on

[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.800]
the fringes of same society and on the outer fringes now they're running the country.

[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.240]
This is this is disgraceful. I mean like far from out of time. I can like far but bush that

[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.280]
moron opening up her mouth this morning saying oh well these people in Houston at the

[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.420]
Astridome this is going to be a step up for many of the many of these poor people this is going to

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.500]
be a step up like boy aren't they lucky didn't they hit the jackpot and win the lot of this week.

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.480]
Living in a floor of the Astridome right exactly this is a step up what a shot that is admissible

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:18.040]
right here bitch Martha Washington and drag you nasty bitch you slut but nevertheless you were saying

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.900]
I wasn't. Well doesn't take much to get me worked up these days I'll tell you just I'm so pissed

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.680]
off about this crap. So disgraceful it's just and and there's still is that 43 to 46% of the

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.280]
country you know man bush could come to their house and take a dump right on their dining room

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.160]
table in the middle of dinner and they'd say man that's the best smell and crap I ever smelled in

[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.460]
my life and there's just no way to get to these people he's the dumb president for the dumb half

[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.220]
of America and boy is he got them are is he got them horn swaddled no passion in the man what's

[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.520]
a none or no passion that's why that whole phone is compassionate conservative my ass you know

[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.100]
Hitler would be proud just unbelievable meanwhile that's city I mean you read the things that

[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.560]
well the deputy police chief said we have no city we have no jobs right I mean you talk about

[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.220]
hopelessness right it's just just the worst I mean it is then Michael shirt off who as far as

[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.720]
I'm concerned he ought to be hung from the highest tree they can find he comes on the year on

[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.120]
Thursday afternoon and and he's amazed that there are all these people at the convention center

[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.880]
this is the first he heard about it and I'm thinking to myself anybody over there at home line

[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.640]
security got a TV set you jackass you in the so you lunatic first thing to about all those starving

[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.560]

is also been on vacation oh yeah he's on permanent they know he's George Bush two days before he

[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.300]
left his vacation home not I want you to think about this I was just saying to George think

[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.300]
about this carefully do you remember back when our fat ass governor was stirring up all the crap

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:02.800]
with with Terry Shibow and then her you were all of that yes of course in almost instantly Congress

[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.800]
came rushing back from recess they all convened to pass that would turn out to be illegal Terry Bill

[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.360]
what have it all that was and then Bush came rushing back from crop protection to Washington

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.460]
the sign of the very next day remember that yeah now congress says well earlier in the week last week

[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.960]
they're saying well maybe we can get back at a time by Friday which at that time was four days later

[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.380]
maybe we can get back by Friday and of course like you said Bush you know and in fact on Tuesday

[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.960]
he wasn't back yet he was busy doing a political speech in San Diego on Tuesday yeah I mean this

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.200]
is I mean if ever there was a crisis right where is everybody yeah and she's at

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.520]
Monty Python on Broadway laughing a rass off kind of leaves a Tuesday night while her people in New Orleans

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.640]
are drowning 10,000 dead well that's what they they have got a clue it could be that's what the rest of it

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.820]
that's what the rest of the meeting that would be more have any idea could be more could it's gonna

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.360]
it's gonna make the number of dead from 9-11 pale and a win significance their standards over a

[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.880]
thousand dead in Baloxia alone they got about 200 official count but they said based on you know

[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.880]
the people along the grid along the coast and and since you and I discussed this last week the

[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.280]
thing about those floating casinos the fact wasn't that brilliant that he Lee Barber now that fat

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.680]
ass the fat-faced idiot says well I guess I'll be sure to sign it now we're gonna pass the law so

[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.900]
that they don't have to put the casinos out there floating on the you know in the water that they

[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.680]
can have them on land adjacent to the hotels and those casinos that are you know picked up by the

[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.880]
wind and just reek all kinds of damage there in Baloxia that's only yeah yeah yeah no

[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.140]
jazz if it's if it made any no water yet they made any sense to have to have those on the water

[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.140]
in the first place you know see everything in America now including in Florida has to be geared

[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.400]
to the right wing religious crazy people you know let them take South Carolina and sign they can

[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.400]
take north and south Dakota and Wyoming for my part and they can form their own stink in country

all these of Jesus Christ is man all these crazy people yeah a lot of people and you know you

[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.640]
wonder how you don't forget George Bush doesn't care about black people right and you wonder how

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:11.180]
our cities are going to absorb you know the people who are basically refugees right now

[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:18.200]
ah don't say that I can't say that huh evacuees I know evacuees no no no the media has been

[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.840]

they're seeking refuge what are they evacuees oh you better get with it mister I know I

[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.340]
got a call from a friend of mine who's uh you're gonna have some more time off pretty soon who's a

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.280]
big time democrat says oh you can't call them refugees it's uh and uh what are they they're

that's another thing uh with the net worst please I know that we have a CNN bureau in Miami would

[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.960]
you please take some more distant shots if you have to show the the water being funneled out of

[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.960]
the city you know they're draining the water that's fine it's nice to see that big pipe there

[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.920]
the water is going into a lake punch a train that's great but we don't need to see it real close

[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.620]
up in personal you know I'm saying it's getting a little browner and browner by the minute I don't

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.260]
think we need to see that god are they sick the the people in the media man they're just

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.840]
they're grave robbers they're lunatics exploiters are the worst kind on the other hand thank god we're

[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:29.520]
not a part of it that's for sure we work at QAM now I'm just trying to figure out how to they're

[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.220]
gonna fix the microphone in here which has been broken now for a year well George was telling me

[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.340]
about his excitement yesterday working on labor day that the audio vault cracked out yeah couldn't

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.580]
play any spots and they went into control when I went crap that it just got a few minor technical

[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:48.220]
problems all we're missing today is a cough button that works and a microphone that keeps falling down

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.960]
and by the way who is that who is the guy that does the color on a ESPN with Booge yesterday

[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.080]
you see in the Marlon game except up Martinez is that the guy I didn't watch the Marlon game on

[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.760]
a yes man he never took up breath he never took up breath I sure hope Booge isn't getting paid by

[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.700]
the word because he couldn't have said a hundred words I only watched an ending or two but this guy

[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.200]
blah blah blah he never took up breath this this is part of the scoop of flying of America man what's

[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.280]
happened to sports casting is it used to be the color guy would interject a few words when there

[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.800]
was a pause in the action now the color guy in too many cases he just never shuts up blah blah blah

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.900]
blah blah you know like Denise Popman on the Panther games it's just pathetic book man I think

[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.020]

[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.560]
gonna say just a kid you know he's just getting his feet wet there on ESPN but I mean he didn't have

[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:52.700]
a chance to say anything I'm glad you both didn't see it Georgia but didn't see it either George

[00:12:52.700 --> 00:13:00.720]
was watching a game yesterday I got a great article here it's gonna really piss on a stupid football

[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.340]
fans off about the fact that the game on last night's game which from what I see it might as well

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.680]
have been called off about the people about how they had to evacuate the hotels from Mattel I

[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.880]
had to kick out the this storm evacuees from the hotel so they could make way for the football fans

[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.580]
that's really good I thought they said they weren't gonna do that I guess what they did wow and

[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.320]
when you went online because it was actually in your favorite newspaper the hero because they

[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.260]
went online and it said that the rooms available and then when they were calling I guess what no such

[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.700]
rooms no room at the end because like face it what's more important saving people who are desperate

[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:41.620]
and homeless and they just came from almost drowning or some stupid as college football game yeah well

[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.060]
you got to make money when you can of course yeah that's right there you go yeah if you're

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.040]
American and women I had seen a story last week that says that they were going to instruct the

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:14:00.700]
hotels not to do that yeah apparently they'll do it all right let's let's face it when you're

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.480]
when you're in evacuee you probably don't have an awful lot of cash see people don't realize I mean

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.480]
you know it's not like these people could go to an ATM and get money or they can do anything even

[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.960]
if they had a credit card there's no ATM's working there's no electricity there's no nothing

[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.540]
how long do you think it's gonna take before that city functions again at all how many how many years

[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.820]
yeah long time yeah long long time because I would say about half of those people probably won't go back

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.000]
you remember after Andrew South day how many people yeah I played they moved up to Broward or

[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.340]
Palm Beach or just left the state they did they never came back that's for sure and why couldn't

[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:47.040]
why couldn't I I they got 364 city buses in New Orleans okay Friday when they saw

[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.600]
category five coming which at that time they thought was going to go right toward downtown New

[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.220]
Orleans it finally went off to the east a little bit but their first the initial tracking looked like

[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.120]
it was going to take it directly the last place you put people would be in the super dome because

[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.120]
that would be in the direct path of the her at the eye of the storm number one and number two

[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.700]
364 city buses and they had a mandatory evacuation order okay why not take those buses into every

[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:16.020]
part of the city and take those people out and they didn't have to take them to Houston because all

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.760]
they had to do is take them to where was going to be dry land because the you know the storm surge

[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.760]
didn't go the flooding didn't go even on the other side of the downtown on the other side of the

[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.840]
lake it's dry as a bone you know even the fricking it anywhere or they could have been saved

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.540]
apparently the front the flooding in the French border wasn't as bad as it was in the rest of the city

[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:41.040]
correct but I mean what kind of evacuation planning was there huh well that's our government

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.080]
it worked yeah that's your government in action man the Congress the president's female which

[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.980]
basically doesn't exist Michael churdoff he ought to be on death row right now man and blow

[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:55.060]
but I'd be glad to play to pull the switch well your horse will be okay next time have a good day

[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:02.380]
meal and maybe at a price don't calm down you're at your best see you on the Thursday and next week

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:12.040]
it's back to five days for me oh no oh no I'm gonna go in the training see you Thursday enjoy bye

[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:18.180]
George bus doesn't care about black people no new Orleans thought it had been spared the worst

[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.560]
and then two major levees broke and slowly the city filled with water the city that's just below

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.340]
sea level is now under sea officials estimate that 80% of New Orleans is now under water the

[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.160]
governor has been asking for everybody to stay a prayer I think we could probably do that for our

[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.360]
friends and I love when I can't do it

[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:44.440]
all in America I'm dying over here it's don't you know me I'm the greatest

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:55.040]
son I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans I'll be gone by

[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:03.000]
when the day is done last night we began this broadcast saying Katrina was bad very bad last night

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.040]
we didn't know the half of it we are still learning just how bad what I saw today is

[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:16.100]
equivalent so what I saw flying over the tsunami in Indonesia there are places that are no longer

[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.720]
there

[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:23.520]
night time on the city of New Orleans I mean everything is bloody everything the whole

[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.180]
city is there right there are some people being evacuated we're hearing lots of stories of

[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.520]
folks lending aids to one another public countries and rescue teams lifting people one by one hundreds

[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.980]
and hundreds and all for rooftop so we're hearing lots of stories like that of people

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.880]
assisting one another just for them and for I just don't know all the people down there you know

[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.340]
they're picking up the pieces

[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.420]
the night I asked for your prayers

[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:20.300]
all those you breathe 13 Katrina has brought out some of the time's very best I asked

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.340]
the people to join me and saying a prayer for the victims in their families

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:34.000]
god bless I'm dying over here this is new Rogers this is 5.6 Q.A.

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:53.160]
afterwards he went to a nearby restaurant and ordered the specialty of the day the waiter brought

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:02.340]
him two balls on a huge plate which the tourist ate with relish the next day and he goes to the

[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.760]
same restaurant was again orders the specialty of the day and is brought to large balls on a huge

[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:15.540]
plate and it tastes scrumptious the third day and he goes to the same restaurant and the fourth

[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.100]
the same but on the fifth day and he goes to the restaurant and orders the specialty of the day

[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:27.960]
and they bring him two very small balls on a giant plate and he says well what gives and the

[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:35.860]
waiter says in your the bullfighter doesn't always win Paul Harvest good day 20 after 10 at 5.60

[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.540]
came to trena I would have my own choice I'd put on here and I certainly couldn't use any of the

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:08.300]
words on the air no criminally negligent that's how I voted at 25 that's the understatement of

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:19.100]
the century absolutely totally unacceptable and unbelievable embarrassingly saw 125 pitiful 93

[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:27.800]
racially complacent 41 excellent 14 now excellent 14 appropriate 14 who cares 12 as good as

[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.960]
any nation eight so there's like let's see 5.47 point about 9% right there people need to be

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.460]
rounded up and put in camp okay well sending a camp well every now let's have an ice shower

[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:43.440]

[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.400]
already had enough grief the ones that are there we don't want to put these people there with them

[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.660]
what the hell is the step up come on you forget what I try to forget but bad voice said it's a

[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:56.080]
step up for a lot of these people they ought to be pleased as puns they get put on something I'd like

[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.940]
to see her as drowning there in New Orleans with just that white hair floating above the top of the

[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:07.720]

[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:32.900]
more isn't more on I just I just got to play out one more time facing your own QM

[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.840]
you don't have any national guards then because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:44.300]

[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.760]
nobody's got fired yet and all this business about all to be plenty of time for finger pointing why

aid that european countries of all of the big that was another thing mow was raiding about is that

[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.880]
the rest of the world doesn't want to help us nobody's helping right we've only had like seven

[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.700]
thousand countries trying desperately to send help although we have a lot of red tape in bureaucracy

[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.720]
holding most of it up including all is a let's see well we get to the cash to a story

[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.080]

[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.280]
it will put a we're still evaluating and contemplating while people are dying of course

[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:50.100]
the police says we're considering what's the political the opinion there appeared to be some

[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.160]
transportation problems barbra health right a spokesman for the european unions executive

[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.640]
commission for news briefing she said a Swedish plane laden with aid was waiting to take off but hadn't

gotten us approval to enter the u.s. a high speed pumps offered by germany had arrived but

[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.320]
health are upset on specified coordination problems in the u.s. had prevented them from being

[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.420]
deployed so far a few state e-authorities had suggested the u.s. that aid could be flown in

[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:20.260]
more easily by u.s. army air bases in europe such as that and ramsh the in germany she didn't say

[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.840]
if they received a reply ramsh that's where they take all the soldiers who were dying and have

[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.360]
nobody parts that we never hear about twenty three european countries have offered to help the

[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.080]
u.s. ranging from financial assistance this is just in europe from financial assistance

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.340]
not agreed to take it all and britain which currently holds the presidency of the u uh... was

[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.060]
negotiating with the u.s. authorities on what to deliver well we're kind of planning we're thinking

[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:50.740]
about it the e-u. and nato said on sunday they received off official request from the u.s.

[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.400]
providing emergency assistance for victims of Katrina days after gravity west cities they only

[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.780]
got the request on sunday following that no almost a week after the commission said at the

[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.040]
time that the request to it came after several days of discussions and insisted that the u.s.

[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.520]
which calls itself the world's biggest aid donor could have acted sooner if asked.

[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.040]
oh emphasis mine of course could have acted sooner if asked where they asked did they ask

[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:22.600]
sooner no it is so criminal and of course we've got these uh... you know people in the media

[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.400]
let's not make this into a political thing let's not point fingers and of course they got

[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.500]
bubble who many alone when he's out of the shadow of papa bush he actually says well you know

[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.940]
we let the people down it was really and then when soon as papa bush comes in they're given

[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.440]
that evil eye and right away well now's not the time later you know everybody now's not the time

[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.540]
when will be the time huh how many thousand people how many thousand bodies do we have to find

[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:50.260]
before we find the time that something that went wrong the time is ticking you newspaper of

[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.980]
the world and printed this at a tour list something edition criticizing the federal governments

[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.780]
responsible came to trina and calling on every female official to be fired at it and they are

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.500]
absolutely absolutely correct here it is and oh now did we actually put the michael more

[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.680]
letter on her because i know i sent it to you uh... john for maybe you didn't put it on i did i did

[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.120]
oh because people are faxing it and it was on it was on our website okay we're on top of it man

[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.040]
we got our thumb on it anyway the times picky you open letter to the president dear mr president

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.080]
we heard you loud and clear friday when you visited our devastated city in the guld coast and said

[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.800]
what is not working we're gonna make it right please forgive us if we wait to see proof of your

[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.340]
promise before believing you but we have good reason for our skepticism the envirolle built new

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.100]
Orleans where he built it for one main reason it's accessible the city between the Mississippi

[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.720]
River and Lake Pontchettrain was easy to reach in seventeen eighteen how much easier it is to access

[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.180]
in two thousand five not that there are interstates and bridges airports and helipads cruise ships

[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.300]
barges buses diesel powered trucks despite the city's multiple points of entry our nations bureaucrats

[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.400]
spend days after last week siracane ringing their hands lamenting the fact that they couldn't either

[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.700]
rescue the city's stranded victims or bring them food water and medical supplies anybody over here

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.740]
of air drop you know wait by by the way just interject this two days after the tsunami we were

[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.680]
air dropping food and watered the victims over there two days did you see sixty minutes no they're

[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:20.480]
how locally within hours they had rescue crews in there they had the you know the billboards for

[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:26.080]
the missing people within hours after the tsunami and they didn't expect that at all right well

[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.140]
that's because my shirt off you know I am the Mickey Brown they didn't know what was going on

[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.200]
meanwhile the article says that we're journalists including some who work for the times picky

[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.300]
you're going in and out of the city via the crescent city connection on Thursday morning that

[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.960]
crew saw a caravan of thirteen Walmart tractor trailers headed into town to bring food water and

[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.240]
supplies to a dying city television reporters were doing live reports from downtown the

[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.480]
whirlwind streets hericonic junior broadens the made through day and his efforts were the focus

[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.600]
of a today show a story Friday morning yet the people trained to protect our nation the people

[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.420]
whose job is to quickly bring aid in were absent those who should have been deploying troops were

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:06.360]
singing a sad song about how our city was impossible to reach were angry mr. president will be angry

[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:11.720]
long after our beloved city and surrounding purses have been pumped dry our people deserve rescuing

[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.320]
many who could have been were not and that's the government chain where mayor array nigan did

[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.040]
the right thing sunday when he allowed those with no other alternative to seek shelter from the

[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.860]
storm inside the superdom we still don't know what the death toll is but one thing a certain

[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.480]
had the superdom not been open the city's death toll would have been much higher

[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.360]
until maybe even been exponentially higher it was clear to us by late monday morning that many

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.820]
people inside the superdom would not be returning home it should have been clear to our government

[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.620]
mr. president so why weren't they evacuated out of the city immediately we learned seven

[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.440]
years ago and hurricane georgia threatened that the dome isn't suitable as a long-term shelter

[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.300]
so what did state and national officials think would happen to tens of thousands of people

[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.760]
trapped inside with no air conditioning overflowing toilets and dwindling amounts of food water

[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.980]
and other essentials state representative karen karta was right Friday when she said the city didn't

[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:05.140]
didn't have but two urgent needs buses and gas every official that FEMA should be fired director

[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.480]
miki brown especially and an actually televised interview thursday united said his agency hadn't

[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.920]
known till that day the thousand disturb victims were stranded at the earnest and more real convention

[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.040]
center he gave another nationally televised interview the next morning and said we provided food

[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.380]
to the people at the convention center so that they've gotten at least one if not two meals every

[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.640]
single day lies don't get more ball faced in that mr. president yet when you met with mr. brown

[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.860]
Friday morning you told him you're doing a heck of a job miki brown that's unfilial available

[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.580]
they'll be available there were thousands of people at the convention center because the riverfront

[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.860]
is high ground the fact that so many people had reached their own food is proof that rescue vehicles

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.400]
could have gotten there too we who are from new Orleans are no less american denosio live in on

[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.980]
the great plains or along the Atlantic seaboard we're no less important than those from the

[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.140]
Pacific Northwest or Appalachia are people deserve to be rescued no expense should have been spared

[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.160]
no excuses should have been voiced especially now when it's preposterous as the claim that new

[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.680]
Orleans couldn't be reached mr. president we sincerely hope you fulfill your promise to make

[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.800]
our beloved communities work right once again when you do will be the first to applaud

[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.520]
photo ops baby photo ops he's got the microphone go on he's got the car roll there right in his

[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.800]
ass to make sure he's got all the right the talking points all the right story lines

[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.820]
give me a break okay and half of this country can't see through this crap what have you got

[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:30.800]
blinders are you like more ones are you in the cells that I would it is oh here's a fat I don't

[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.220]
want to get all whipped up to a frenzy man but I've been holding it in too late rick says I can't

[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.980]
believe this Cuba Iran Venezuela that's right he which office offered it Canada countries you

[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:46.980]
think would celebrate armist fortice offering help in the form that they can mr. Bush this is not

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.640]
the time for pride unfortunately due to your fiscal irresponsibility we need help and need now

[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.360]
take whatever precautions you need to and accept the offer being are they helping offered

[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.460]
if Venezuela can help us with oil and gasoline why not accept it if they have engineers that

[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.800]
can help bring our refineries back online or running at a hundred percent quicker what's the harm

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.160]
well then we wouldn't have to pay four dollars a gallon for gas which believe me that's coming

[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.540]
very soon to a gas station near you six bucks in Atlanta already thank you mr. president by the

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.700]
way for those great low bargain basement gas prices fixing cuts bruises and broken bones and

[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.300]
giving a shoulder to cry on doesn't take a US train doctor Iran has refineries and engineers to

[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.880]
also help bring in our rally refineries nor platforms back online by the way those engineers were

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.540]
trained at US universities mr. Bush I pleaded in begging not to let pride get in the way of that

[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.480]
have the help we desperately need it says here Rick I used to like the bishop T. Dave T.D.

[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.060]
jakes but when I saw him being used as the token black man by the Bush administration for photo

[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.960]
out purposes only it really pissed me off I am a Christian I'm not watching again how do you like that

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:52.100]
even the goyam are getting p.o.d calm down Rick what do you say about that yeah

[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.080]
Mickey Brown downtown Mickey Brown that's a good name I like that downtown that's what we

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.280]
got to send him downtown especially where the water is at the highest level there you know

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:08.580]
don't drown Mickey Brown but if you happen to no loss 19 before 11 if you got a hair loss

[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:15.300]
hair about black people good morning we must begin by recognizing an essential fact poverty is

[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.720]
one of the great moral achievements of American government if we in government take our

[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:26.140]
responsibilities seriously the shortfalls will grow larger with each passing year and we must

[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.520]
tap into the problems and pass them on to future presidents and future generations the American

[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:37.320]
people voted for reform in 2004 and now they expect us to work towards bankruptcy down the road

[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.640]
I came to Washington to slow economic growth I look forward to working with members of Congress

[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.420]
on this important issue together we will make certain that America meets its deepening long-term

[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:53.620]
problem and most Americans are bankrupt thank you for listening he's working on it okay because

[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.900]
we're not part of his base you understand that and these people who have been drowning and dying

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.960]
and running around in stents and filth they're not part of his base either so what can I tell you

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.160]
all those people are we're on the highways you know going to high ground that were on the express

[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.520]
ways waiting and waiting and waiting all the people the convention center in the super dome in the

[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.480]

[00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.390]
in October probably so far this is coming faster than the relief and now they're talking about all

[00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:39.010]
the great heroism yeah fine that's great post-card given the what they had they did a whole of a job

[00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.310]
but I still say it would have been nice to see they held a lot more boats picking people up

[00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.250]
over those houses then those guys risking their lives dropping out of the shoppers you know right

[00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:53.630]

[00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:26.730]
funny don't you understand he's he's a typical soft water man he's a simpleton so you're

[00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:35.730]
right I am crazy that's why I took that call you're right w mu QAM hello you're right w mu QAM hello this

[00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:42.510]
is not correct this is what we got this is what we got after all these days and I'm thinking

[00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.350]
since Thursday moment I get back on here these people are going to let out a flood of anger and

[00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:51.750]
hostility and being p.o.d and whipped up to a frenzy and it's the same just exactly what you get

[00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:58.930]
actually now I'm inclined to take more of these now now I'm kind of like I'm used 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:03.170]
pound the land of indifference in fact look at that nobody ought to be fired they all did fine we

[00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:09.310]
got 11 votes on that that is the best they are they're just great WQAM hello

[00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:19.430]
hey nino hey you you're just saying that that that phrase was a this part of the world he

[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:24.130]
didn't say was a marker he was saying people are heading a this part of the world how dumb can

[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.870]
you be man well and they'll take a look at him and then you figure out the answer

[00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.990]
WQAM hello good morning are you okay I'm sorry I was a little while let me turn that now

[00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:40.610]
I was so amazed last week to hear churn off the home of security director telling people that

[00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.710]
he had no ideas there were people in the super dome until Thursday no no in the convention center

[00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.450]
the convention center I'm sorry they commit so and meanwhile that was what they announced on

[00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.890]
Sunday so in other words what you're saying is that no one in FEMA or the government you

[00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:59.870]
know the television said no pay any attention no attention they couldn't care less Neil they just

[00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:05.670]
are a false lie just like the times picky and said a bald face freaking lie it's once it's one

[00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.130]
thing to not but the fact of the matter is they don't care and unfortunately you and I both know

[00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.950]
that there was people dancing a jagan set on last Friday keep it to the jagan it wasn't the people

[00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:20.510]
getting rescued keep in mind that all this Homeland Security bullcraft was supposedly to protect

[00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:26.490]
us from a terrorist attack this shows as clearly as could be that if we ever really had a major

[00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:31.090]
chemical or biological or heaven forbid nuclear attack then this shows you what your government's

[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:38.250]
capable of doing which is basically nothing how about the wonderful new revelation that now we're

[00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:43.810]
going to make our new Supreme Court nominee the chief yeah there's no experience at all but let's

[00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:48.710]
make him chief yeah our BDI the born again chief man who makes Scalia look like a liberal it's so

[00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.330]
this is what the public wanted man looks at the great guy I told him I listen I know you don't like

[00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:58.930]
to turn the show into political but right now we all need to spend as much time as we can on

[00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:05.910]
fighting Roberts getting put in his chief sir listen to me you got two chances at happening none

[00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:13.390]
and less than none of us stop them or get in of stopping him none no no tell me he's in it's a done

[00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:22.030]
deal 70 votes Neil my heart that sound is my heart breaking see at the border failing take care

[00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:26.750]
oh there's Arlen the chief inspector said of the first round live no it's him at a center for

[00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:31.070]
there's another one for you man had built fist doctor fist you see him a couple of times with

[00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:37.510]
a stephoscope around his neck while I was sure impressed no wda qa m hello hello yes sir

[00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:44.670]
there's one person that knows more about relief and and help him awards it's the jeffster and he

[00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:50.590]
sitting three hours away from New Orleans sitting on his fat ass with his high-cohe daughter and his

[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:56.650]
jewelry's plug in my body in a white okay but he's still trying to stick that you back into

[00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:04.030]
Terry don't you get it he's the one that should be shot well let's see let's see if this thing

[00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:14.970]
what I'm gonna understand oh god it was good see I told you to take enough of them and take

[00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.270]
about 40,000 you get one it's really a it'll tickle your fancy speaking of passing but

[00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:24.890]
fancy what the New York Times Bob Herbert writes a figure of leadership pushed in a warlings

[00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:29.690]
drop dead neither the death of the chief justice nor the frantic efforts of panic to white

[00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.750]
hospital medical advisors can can conceal the magnitude of the president's failure of leadership

[00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.750]
last week the catastrophe in New Orleans billed up like howling winds of hell and was carried

[00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:43.410]
live and in color on television screens around the US and around the world the big easy

[00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.450]
attorney to the big hurt and the colossal failure of George W. Bush to intervene powerfully

[00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:51.410]
and immediately to rescue tens of thousands of American citizens who were suffering horribly

[00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:56.510]
and dying in agony was therefore all the world to see hospitals with definitely old patients

[00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.610]
were left without power with ventilators that didn't work with flood waters rising on the lower

[00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:06.390]
floors and with corpses rotting in the corridors and stairwells people unable to breathe on their

[00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.530]
own or with cancer or heart disease or kidney failure slipped into coma's and sank into their

[00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.810]
final sleep and front of helpless doctors and relatives these were Americans in desperate

[00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:19.850]
trouble the president didn't seem to notice death and the stink of decay were all over the city

[00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:24.370]
corpses were propped up in wheelchairs and on law inferniture or left of decompose on sun-baked

[00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:29.610]
sidewalks some floated by in water filed by human feces these generates room the city shooting

[00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.810]
in rescue workers beating and robbing distraught residents and tourists raping women and girls

[00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.770]
the president of the richest most powerful country in the history of the world didn't seem to notice

[00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:44.270]
viewers could watch diabetics going to insulin shock on national television and you could see babies

[00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:48.350]
with a pale vacant look of hunger that were more used to singing dispatched us from the third world

[00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:53.470]
you could see their mother's dirty and hungry themselves weeping old critically old people

[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.790]
were left to soil themselves and in some cases die like stray animals on the floor of an airport

[00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:02.670]
tree ice center for days the president of the United States didn't seem to notice he would have

[00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.410]
noticed if the majority of these three can folks had been white and prosperous but they weren't

[00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:12.190]
most were black and poor and thus to George W. Bush administration still invisible after days

[00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.170]
of withering criticism from white and black Americans from conservatives as well as liberals

[00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:21.250]
from republicans and democrats the president finally felt compelled to act however feebly the

[00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.550]
chorus of criticism from nearly all quarters demanding that the president do something tells me

[00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:30.910]
that the nation as a whole is so much better than this administration mr. Bush finally flew south

[00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:35.790]
on friday and proved as if more proof were needed that he didn't get it instead of urgently focusing

[00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:40.510]
on the people who were stranded hungry sick and dying he engaged in small talk reminiscing at one

[00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:44.270]
point about the days when he used to party in new Orleans and mentioning that Trent Laud at

[00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.570]
lost one of his houses but that would be replaced with a fantastic house and i'm looking forward to

[00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:54.610]
sitting on the porch mr. Bush's performance last week or rank is one of the worst ever by a

[00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:58.610]
president during a dire national emergency what we witnessed as clearly as the overwhelming agony

[00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:02.990]
of the city of new Orleans was the dangerous incompetence and the staggering indifference to human

[00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:08.070]
suffering of the president and his administration and it is this incompetence and indifference to

[00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.990]
suffering yes the carnage continues to mount in a rack that makes it so hard to be optimistic

[00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:16.650]
about the prospects for the u.s over the next few years at a time when effective innovative

[00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.610]
leadership is desperately needed to cope with matters of war and peace terrorism and domestic

[00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.390]
security the economic imperatives of globalization and the rising competition for oil the u.s.

[00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.950]
is being led by a man who seems oblivious to the reality of his awesome responsibilities

[00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:34.130]
like a boy being prepped for a second crack at a failed exam mr. Bush has been meeting with

[00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.670]
his handlers to see what steps can be taken to minimize the political fallout from this

[00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:42.610]
latest demonstration of his ineptitude but this isn't about politics it's about competence

[00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.310]
and when the president is so obviously clueless about matters so obviously important it means

[00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:52.470]
that the rest of us like the people have shredded new Orleans are in deep deep trouble and Bob Herbert

[00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:58.470]
you are absolutely correct sir we're in deep crap baby just like those people in the water

[00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:04.930]
there in New Orleans man we're up to crap up to our armpits they stole out one but two elections

[00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.850]
and the public and the media sit back but it moved but about what times the long game on

[00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:16.310]
this is Neil Rogers this is 5.62.8

[00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:23.410]
this is the Neil Rogers show this is your brain

[00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:31.550]
any question New Orleans thought it had been spared the worst and then two major levees

[00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:37.210]
broken slowly the city filled with water the city that sits below sea level is now under sea

[00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.750]
officials estimate that 80% of New Orleans is now underwater the governor has been asking

[00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.830]
for everybody to stay a prayer i think we could probably do that for our friends and I love

[00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.510]
ones out there

[00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:16.270]
we begin this broadcast saying Katrina was bad very bad last night we didn't know the half of it

[00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:23.670]
we are still learning just how bad what i saw today is equivalent to what i saw flying over

[00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:28.630]
the tsunami in Indonesia there are places that are no longer there

[00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:35.030]
night time on the city of New Orleans i mean everything is just flooded everything

[00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.050]
the whole city there right there are some people being evacuated we're hearing lots of stories of

[00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:44.390]
folks learning aid to one another telecomsures and rescue teams lifting people one by one hundreds

[00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:47.870]
and hundreds and all from rooftops and we're hearing lots of stories like that of people

[00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:52.550]
assisting one another just pray for them and uh and for not just saying all the people down there

[00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:54.210]
you know we're they're picking up the pieces

[00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.890]

[00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:31.610]
hurricane Katrina has brought out some of mankind's very best

[00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.350]
I ask the American people to join the UN saying a prayer for the victims in their families

[00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:37.390]
God bless

[00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.730]
George Bush doesn't care about black people and came on NBC in a peacock by the way

[00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.890]
peacock is molding that they edited that line out of the show the other night on the

want to interrupt your vacation i know you don't like to get bad news plus you had fundraisers

[00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:31.610]
to go to and mothers of dead soldiers to ignore and smear you sure showed her i like especially

[00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:35.630]
how that after the hurricane instead of flying Louisiana you flew the sandy able to party with all

[00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:40.610]
your business peeps don't let people criticize you for this after all the hurricane was over and

[00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:46.170]
what that could you do put your finger in the bike through that january no i'm still the attorney

[00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:49.830]
generally you know i know but somebody else and don't listen to those who in the coming days will

[00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:53.570]
reveal how you spend although i think i think probably i kind of lazy could have filled the breach

[00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.710]
and don't listen to those who in the coming days will reveal how you specifically reduce the

[00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:01.350]
army corps of engineers budget for new Orleans this summer for the third year in a row you just

[00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.170]
tell them that even if you hadn't cut the money to fix those levies they weren't going to be any

[00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:09.250]
army engineers there to fix them anyway because you had much more important construction jobs for them

[00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:15.030]
building democracy in a rack on day three when you finally left your vacation home i have to say i

[00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:19.150]
was moved by how you had air force one pilot descent from the clouds as you flew over New Orleans

[00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.810]
so you can catch a quick look at the disaster hey i know you couldn't stop and grab a bullhorn

[00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:27.750]
stand on some rubble and act like a commander in chief been there done that there'll be those

[00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:31.610]
who will try to politicize this tragedy and try to use it against you just have your people

[00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:35.750]
keep pointing that out respond to nothing even those pesky sciences to predict that this would

[00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:39.590]
happen because the water in the Gulf of Mexico is getting hotter and hotter making a storm like

[00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:43.610]
this inevitable ignore them in all their global warming chicken lights little chicken littles

[00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.990]
there is nothing unusual about a hurricane that was so wide it would be like having one f-four

[00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:53.510]
tornado that stretched from New York to Cleveland no mr. Bush you just stayed the course it's not

[00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:58.550]
your fault that thirty percent of New Orleans lives in poverty or that tens of thousands had no

[00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.630]
transportation to get out of town come on they're black i mean it's not like this happened in

disaster dismissing critics who charged that he would have been more speedy in prodding rescue

[00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:10.430]

plan this weekend to contain the political damage from the administration's response to Hurricane

[01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.710]
Katrina not that they're concerned about politics you understand only the Democrats do that

[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.730]

return visit by mr. Bush yesterday directed administration officials not to respond to attacks

[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:18.230]
from Democrats on the relief efforts and sought to move the blame for the slow response to

[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:23.190]
Louisiana state officials according to Republicans familiar with the White House plan see nothing

[01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:27.950]
that they do is by accident it's all orchestrated that's about Carl rove who's one of the first

[01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:33.730]
ones to get off that plane and kind of like catch the lay of the land the effort is being

[01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:38.550]
directed by mr. Bush's chief political advisor Carl rove and his communications director Dan

[01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:43.370]
Bartlett it began late last week after congressional Republicans called White House officials to register

[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:47.790]
a alarm about what they saw as a feeble response by mr. Bush to the hurricane according to

[01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:54.250]
Republican congressional a a feeble response as a result Americans watching television coverage of

[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:58.550]

all right on the floor Jimmy Brezzlin writes in news day while bush fiddles New Orleans dies

[01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:15.230]
this is a review of the performance of George W. Bush in tight times in this nation

[01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:20.230]
it might explain the single solitary most catastrophic collapse of American government all of our

[01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:25.810]
times mark E. well this was the week when we turned a major American city into Haiti and

[01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:31.110]
racism put its hand out and started a choconation and may not let go with the water coming from

[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:35.310]
the sky and the bottom of the sea driving with such ferocity that a major American city New Orleans

[01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:40.430]
followed its face into the water George W. Bush was at North Island in Coronado, California

[01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:46.430]
speaking to a blindingly white audience of nine thousand sailors in uniform at the hour blacks

[01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:49.790]
were drowning in New Orleans blacks pushed the water that was up to their chest and was

[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:54.890]
stick with the rust sewage of a major city blacks were on the rooftops begging to live wherever

[01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:59.310]
camera swept the only thing that was white was a towel being weighed by a black woman begging for help

[01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:05.130]
while the tiny legs of a baby dangle from her shoulder she was in white color but bush was in

[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:10.230]
white Coronado to speak to a military audience on the anniversary of BJ Day get those sailors

[01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:15.070]
in their whites clapping he barely seemed to understand there was a hurricane for the first three

[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:20.150]
days he was in Coronado outside San Diego and in a speech he managed to mention New Orleans by saying

[01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:25.270]
that people should not return to their homes until rescue crews do their work nobody had to be

[01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.890]
told not to return to their homes because they don't have any homes to return to and no bus

[01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:33.850]
fair to go anywhere he then told Americans to send donations to the Red Cross and the Salvation Army

[01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:38.730]
how marvelous his administration sends billions and billions of tax dollars to his personal war

[01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:42.330]
and a rack to shoot up for Lugia for the third or fourth time since he started the war with his

[01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:45.830]
lies and now he wants everybody to go out on the street and get forty dollars to hurricane

[01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:50.890]
security Bush's style is to be nowhere for things that carry a bit of fear happen

[01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:55.870]
during Vietnam he kept all dental appointments for the World Trade Center attack he first

[01:05:55.870 --> 01:06:00.430]
frozen a classroom in Florida then he flew off in his plane for long hours three days later he got

[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:04.710]
to the earth where a flunky place to be tired firefighter bob Beckwith from Long Island longside

[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:08.850]
him a top of truck then pushed called out a football dressing room speech over a bullhorn

[01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:13.490]
last week he spoke in Coronado with the carrier Ronald Reagan parked in the background

[01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:19.150]
this was his sixth visit to San Diego as president in May 2003 Bush landed on a carrier

[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:23.170]
Abraham Lincoln in the waters off San Diego he wore a green flights to with a helmet under

[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:28.090]
his arm why shouldn't he look like this he was an American warrior he changed into a business suit

[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:33.610]
and spoke in front of a banner proclaiming mission accomplished there have been over 1800 bodies

[01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:38.590]
in boxes returned from Iraq since then Friday showing up on the fifth day of a national tragedy

[01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:43.330]
Bush made a little a few more society about the times he was in New Orleans celebrating a bit too

[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:47.710]
much beautiful if he tried to walk 50 yards he could have tripped over somebody's dead black

[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:52.670]
grandmother under a blanket how do you like it how do you like having a president who at a time

[01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:57.270]
like this reminisces about getting truck into Orleans white boy with that his money roaring in

[01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:02.130]
marty groin a town black for the rest of the year if whites were in trouble in New Orleans trust

[01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:07.550]
that his government would have been there early and aid would have been massive this racism which

[01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:11.810]
is the bottom of everything in America makes it only natural for Bush and his people to talk about

[01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:16.350]
returning to Rudy Giuliani to save New Orleans as he supposedly saved New York after the World

[01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:21.670]
Great Center attack in New York Giuliani did nothing but go on television that's all he did

[01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:26.350]
and all he ever can do beautiful there are television cameras in New Orleans and just like Bush

[01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:59.610]
with a stunning lack of efficiency that could make this administration implode when the president

[01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:03.770]
vice president ratchley shook off our allies and our respect for international law to pursue a

[01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:07.630]

[01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:50.830]

[01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:09.130]
at the end of the world they didn't vote for this regime which is why they don't care about them

[01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:25.870]
federal emergency management there was a theme of back then right but then of course after

[01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:30.730]
9.11 and we had the bushmeister come in here and invent this so-called Department of Homeland

[01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:37.050]
Security to fight the global war on terror which there is no global war on terror there's only

[01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:41.910]

This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16.2 a.m.

[01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:20.630]
This doesn't care about black people.

[01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:23.210]
Absolutely.

[01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:33.210]
Don't talk like all the hard-furned.

[01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:38.130]
Don't talk like every time I see.

[01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:40.970]
Don't talk like every time I see.

[01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:43.770]
That's retarded in which.

[01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:49.130]
Don't talk like every time I see.

[01:26:50.090 --> 01:27:00.610]
These President-Fuckers, Republicans, Muslims, and in our table, and India, I don't know why they

[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:09.710]
would want to stop, but now he's here to serve them in four years with President-Fuckers.

[01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:12.750]
I'm not a f***ing person.

[01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:23.970]
All what I can do, don't go too small, and get to win the voted vote.

[01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:34.570]
If you want this, don't talk like the strong and stupid people.

[01:27:34.570 --> 01:27:36.910]
Don't talk like that.

[01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.290]
Don't talk like this.

[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.810]
Don't talk like this.

[01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:51.670]
Please, President-Fuckers, don't talk like that.

[01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:55.110]
You got a man by a front door to the Christian.

[01:27:55.530 --> 01:28:00.050]
I don't want that you and I have a hands on fear.

[01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:05.710]
We've got a great leader with President Trump's f***ing friend.

[01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:08.850]
Personal logic can help.

[01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:10.490]
You're not sick, you're good, me all.

[01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:11.730]
Okay, God is coming in today.

[01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:15.690]
Not yesterday, today, the 6th of September at any rate.

[01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:19.790]
It kind of sad, you know, to come back to town and find nobody there waiting for it to be report.

[01:28:19.930 --> 01:28:21.010]
But nevertheless, you can walk.

[01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:28.150]
12 minutes still, noon at 5.60 W.A.M., human president at El Castro told more than 1500 doctors on the

[01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:28.510]
United States.

[01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:34.830]
The American officials had made absolutely no response to his offer to send them to the U.S.

[01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:36.550]
Gulf Coastal victims of Hurricane Katrina.

[01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:39.830]
Well, we don't want to piss out those old green suits in Miami, you know.

[01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:40.250]
Right.

[01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:46.610]
Castro, a long-time adversary of the U.S.A., initially offered to send 1100 doctors, at least 26 times

[01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:47.510]
of supplies and equipment.

[01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:53.270]
But the commonest leader ran out on Sunday during a televised speech that he had increased the number of physicians to 1586.

[01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:55.750]
Each doctor would carry about 27 pounds of medicine.

[01:28:56.850 --> 01:29:03.370]
You can all be there right now lending your services, but 48 hours of pass-sence we made this offer, we've received absolutely no response

[01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:05.570]
Castro sent a vast palace of the revolution.

[01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.250]
And of course, they sure didn't need doctors and medicine there, did they?

[01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:09.430]
No, what for?

[01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:15.510]
We continue to wait patiently for a response, and the meantime, all of you will be taking intensive courses in immunology

[01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:20.790]
and also something that I should be doing, and intensive brush-up course in English, Fidel said, the bearded bastard.

[01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:29.410]
Besides Cuba, several other countries and international agencies offered money and supplies to Hurricane Victims, and the past Cuba's refused U.S. offers of aid, the most recent following Hurricane Dennis,

[01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:32.710]
that's term killed more than 10 people in the Caribbean, our elimination, July.

[01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:38.630]
At that time, Castro said he wouldn't accept help from Washington because of the U.S. trade embargo against his country.

[01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:50.770]
Castro had named the Cuban Rescue Team the Henry Reveye Brigade, in honor of an American who followed Cuba's rebel forces during the

[01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:59.570]
December tsunami and had worked with other disasters, but not going up for George Washington, Tom Belize, a baby, and certainly not going to offer downtown Mickey Brown over there at FEMA.

[01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:02.110]
You know, we're hangs out Mickey Brown?

[01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.930]
I give up.

[01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:03.770]
Downtown?

[01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.350]
Oh, you just said that.

[01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:08.930]
Oh, man.

[01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.430]
Absolutely.

[01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:11.890]
Unbelievable.

[01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.350]
Okay, let's take some calls there.

[01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:14.490]
Should be good for a few last.

[01:30:14.690 --> 01:30:14.930]
Oh, yeah.

[01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:19.850]
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon and Singular wireless lines.

[01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:21.450]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:23.230]
Uncle Neil.

[01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:24.030]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:25.610]
How you doing?

[01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:26.470]
I'm okay.

[01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:29.310]
Yeah, I was listening to Ma.

[01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:33.050]
I was just starting to like Ma, you know, kind of listening to a little bit of an afternoon.

[01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:38.350]
And I heard that call, you know, up the road.

[01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:38.770]
Yeah.

[01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:44.690]
Okay, how could anybody who's got like an IQ larger than their thumbnail be so unaware of what's going on around him in the world?

[01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:49.890]
It's a perfect example of what's wrong with the whole country.

[01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:52.170]
Yeah, Mo.

[01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:54.190]
A nail.

[01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:55.050]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:55.430 --> 01:31:03.830]
You still have, sorry, my phone started to clap, but yeah, I mean, like I was trying to get through to, you know, I know a lot of people were trying to call in to tell him he was wrong.

[01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:07.150]
Okay, well, that's ancient history WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.690]
Hey, Neil.

[01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:08.110]
How you doing?

[01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.750]
Okay.

[01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:09.550]
And you're too, George.

[01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:11.210]
You're too, George.

[01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.670]
How you doing?

[01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:14.530]
I'm, you know, I'm talking about Lou, everything.

[01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:19.010]
These guys don't want any finger pointing because they know exactly where the finger is going to point.

[01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.730]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:23.190]
And if this was the Gore administration, they'd be forming it in the mouth right now.

[01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:30.090]
And Lou does keep talking about, even though he doesn't want any finger pointing, he's talking about the local and state officials and this plenty of blame to go around.

[01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:35.810]
He has no problem pointing his middle finger with those people, but God forbid anybody should point the finger in the direction of Washington.

[01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:37.310]
You see in downtown Mickey Brown.

[01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:42.490]
You know who else has been writing some good stuff as your friend William Rivers Pitt, who I just heard on the internet.

[01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.150]
He had a couple great pieces lately.

[01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.310]
But I want to know where is the opposition? Where are the Democrats?

[01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:51.910]
You know something, I was thinking during his last break besides the worry about Kim Helper and in that limo.

[01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:53.830]
I was worried about Barack Obama.

[01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:58.290]
And I wouldn't have been the perfect spokesman for the Democrats in this type of disaster.

[01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:00.050]
Where has he been?

[01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:00.290]
Where has he been?

[01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.830]
Where is he hiding?

[01:32:01.190 --> 01:32:02.590]
I guess they don't want to rock the boat.

[01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:04.310]
Well, that's a bad mistake.

[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.890]
As usual, sit back.

[01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:13.690]
I see that June Lieberman and Susan Collins are calling for a congressional committee to investigate.

[01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:15.290]
All the crap that went on.

[01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.790]
But where is the outrage?

[01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:19.010]
Let's not hold our breath.

[01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:26.910]
And also, before I go, when he was speaking in South San Diego, he's comparing himself to FDR and the Iraq War to World War II.

[01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:27.630]
Right.

[01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:32.410]
And the country just sits there and the country of sick of fans sits there and says, oh what a great man we have.

[01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:40.010]
And the media, did you see any of the bits of last couple of days where they're talking about, oh he does this so well relating with people when he was doing those photo ops there in Voloxy?

[01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:42.670]
He does this so well and he comforts people.

[01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:46.830]
Yeah, I'm just so tired of you people in the media, you suck up, so you make me want to barf.

[01:32:46.850 --> 01:33:00.350]
I hate to say yes, I was listening to Air America, but someone called me to report that the German news that was reporting that he was appearing at a phony aid station that was set up for a photo op and then dismantled as soon as he left.

[01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:03.390]
Yeah, maybe he brought him a plastic turkey like he brought to Iraq.

[01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:05.030]
I don't know, Neil, haven't helped us.

[01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:05.970]
We're lucky today.

[01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:11.690]
5670560, pound 5660 in the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:14.090]
Just a bunch of suck ups, man, it's pathetic.

[01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:19.330]
And this morning, what the hell I told you her name before the one that sounded real early on CNN?

[01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:20.350]
Yeah, forget it.

[01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:24.190]
Oh, geez, I can't think of her name now. She's unlike before 7 o'clock.

[01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:30.970]
And she's I forget who she was talking to or interviewing and there are no longer newsreaders.

[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:32.990]
Okay, these are reporters we're talking about.

[01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.870]
Who?

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:36.210]
I can't think of her name.

[01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.710]
I don't know.

[01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:44.150]
But anyway, she's going out about, well, you know the president cares about black people and you know, she's not anymore at newsreader now.

[01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:48.830]
She's getting her opinions and now she's defending and now she's just stick to reading a script.

[01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:54.390]
Okay, you're nothing more than a glorified newsreader with a lot of makeup to cover up those wrinkles, honey.

[01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.310]
Carol, I castellar, that's her name.

[01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:00.950]
Oh, I ordinarily, I like her. She's okay. She's a bubblehead. She's, you know, she looks good.

[01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:05.090]
But starting to, well, who the hell is she to be starting to give editorial opinion?

[01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:07.770]
Now everybody's an editorial commentator on there.

[01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:14.130]
Everybody's gotten an opinion because opinions are just like, yeah, yeah, but everybody's got one.

[01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:16.590]
How many QAAM? Hello?

[01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.510]
Neil.

[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:18.590]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:21.170]
I'm going to make you blow your brains out and I hate to do it.

[01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:27.070]
Barack Obama is running around with Oprah at the shelter.

[01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:28.330]
Oh, no.

[01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:29.570]
I swear to God.

[01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:35.550]
And they got Dr. Philip the astridome now to like give some phony counseling to all those poor people in the astridome.

[01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:36.170]
Yeah.

[01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:37.650]
They're probably blow their brains out.

[01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.650]
Yeah, I'm so disappointed in him because I love him.

[01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:43.170]
But he's running around with Oprah doing what?

[01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:48.590]
You know, glad handing, you know, ass lap in smile and taking pictures.

[01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:49.190]
Oprah.

[01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:50.970]
Oh, I know.

[01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.110]

[01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:51.830]
Sorry, Neil.

[01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:52.910]
Well, there it goes.

[01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:53.250]
You're right.

[01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:55.030]
After the show, I'm going to put a gun right in my mouth.

[01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:56.330]
Thank you a lot.

[01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:56.970]
Bye-bye.

[01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:57.610]
See you.

[01:34:58.090 --> 01:34:59.630]
I'm putting a big one right in my eyes.

[01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:03.250]
567-0560.

[01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:05.450]
I wonder if I got an email from Ken.

[01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:09.810]
I mean, that's a little off the subject, but you know, it's one of those.

[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:11.830]
All this is an important stuff.

[01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:12.450]
What?

[01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:13.510]
That's important.

[01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:14.910]
It is important stuff.

[01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.330]
Okay.

[01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:17.630]
It just can't believe it.

[01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:19.430]
There's no email message on air.

[01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.670]
Okay.

[01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:21.410]
But he's just going to shine me, I guess.

[01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:22.510]
We'll find out.

[01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:23.790]
That's all I needed today.

[01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:25.010]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:25.210]
Hello.

[01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:26.210]
Hey, then.

[01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.670]
How are you?

[01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.270]
Okay.

[01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:28.330]
Great to have you back.

[01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.690]
Listen.

[01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:35.050]
One thing that people just, I don't know why he doesn't criticize the more after I even laughed at it.

[01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:39.190]
That man was here in less than 24 hours with his father's brother.

[01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.530]
Right.

[01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:40.070]
That's correct.

[01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:41.270]
Doing everything.

[01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:42.750]
And it's just ridiculous.

[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:46.270]
I don't understand why no one says nothing.

[01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:48.750]
And they say people want to be this great leader.

[01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:52.210]
And that last one called it just took my son right away.

[01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:55.270]
That he's not only forgotten.

[01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:57.990]
He's going to get away.

[01:35:58.650 --> 01:35:58.950]
Yeah.

[01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:00.030]
But then the crash.

[01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:02.530]
We know what the public can stand for.

[01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.070]
What are the Democrats?

[01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:10.050]
Why are the only ones representing and carrying the water for the rest of the world?

[01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:14.810]
How about this country, how do comedians like John Stewart, Bill Maher, Al Franken,

[01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:16.870]
most people don't even like.

[01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:21.550]
You know, I don't know a lot, but you know, they'll represent everybody on the left.

[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.410]
I just don't understand.

[01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.990]
Yeah.

[01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:24.130]
Who now knows?

[01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.610]
I don't know.

[01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:25.730]
Maybe the cats got their tongue.

[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:27.270]
Maybe they're analyzing it.

[01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:28.210]
Maybe they're playing it.

[01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:29.210]
Who now knows?

[01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:30.790]
There are a bunch of spineless cowards.

[01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:32.610]
And there is much to blame as anybody else.

[01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:37.670]
The fact that Al Gore sat back and allowed them to steal the election in the first place in 2000.

[01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:40.850]
The fact that they were so spineless then, that should tell you a lot.

[01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:44.310]
And then of course, Kerry comes up and does the same thing in Ohio four years later.

[01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:45.170]
Spineless.

[01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:52.870]
If they are a lot of those guys from Cuba to come here, everyone or they would be a micro-thousand

[01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:54.010]
or what's going to happen here.

[01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:56.190]
Maybe that means there's all here.

[01:36:58.230 --> 01:36:58.630]
Okay.

[01:36:58.930 --> 01:36:59.410]
Whatever he said.

[01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:00.190]
You know what he just said?

[01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:02.270]
Maybe they're all tired.

[01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.590]
They allowed those doctors to come.

[01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:05.330]
I think he said hello.

[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.710]
Doctor?

[01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:06.510]
Something like that.

[01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:07.970]
What have we got on that pool now?

[01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:09.370]
Are we going to make our thousands of there or what?

[01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:10.110]
I doubt it.

[01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:11.910]
5.67.

[01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:13.330]
Yeah, it's starting to slow down.

[01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:17.050]
I see they get whipped up a little bit for a minute or two and it's like, ah, you know,

[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:17.590]
it's raining.

[01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:19.390]
We don't care about this stuff.

[01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:24.410]
Although George W. Bush has moved to the top 171 because of the pathetic hurricane response,

[01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:30.830]
who needs most urgently to resign or be fired as an impeached, that word impeach sounds peachy to me.

[01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:33.430]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:36.630]
This is 5.69.

[01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:43.990]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:46.970]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8L.

[01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:49.070]
Okay, so you wanted me to pray this proceeding clean.

[01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:49.890]
Please.

[01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.750]
You ready?

[01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:51.530]
Ready.

[01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:59.190]
New Orleans thought it had been spared the worst and then two major levees broken slowly the city filled with water.

[01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:02.490]
The city that sits below sea level is now under sea.

[01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:05.990]
Officials estimate that 80% of New Orleans is now underwater.

[01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:08.570]
The governor has been asking for everybody to stay a prayer.

[01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:11.810]
I think we could probably do that for our friends and I love when it's out there.

[01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:15.790]
Look up in the prayer of the audience.

[01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:19.730]
This don't you know me.

[01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:21.970]
I'm the man in the sun.

[01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:28.630]
I'm the train that calls the city of New Orleans.

[01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:34.910]
I'll be gone by morning hours when the day is done.

[01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:39.070]
Last night we began this broadcasting. Katrina was bad. Very bad.

[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:43.750]
Last night we didn't know the half of it. We are still learning just how bad.

[01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:50.810]
What I saw today is equivalent to what I saw flying over the tsunami in Indonesia.

[01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:53.810]
There are places that are no longer there.

[01:38:57.570 --> 01:39:01.030]
I mean everything is just flooded. Everything. The whole city.

[01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:03.250]
There right there are some people being evacuated.

[01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:06.130]
We're hearing lots of stories of folks lending aid to one another.

[01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:11.330]
Hello countries and rescue teams lifting people one by one hundreds and hundreds and all from rooftop.

[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:14.190]
We're hearing lots of stories like that of people assisting one another.

[01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:17.970]
Dispare for them and for all the people down there.

[01:39:17.970 --> 01:39:19.610]
They're picking up the pieces.

[01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:53.170]
Tonight I ask for your prayers for all those who agree.

[01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:56.830]
Hurricane Katrina has brought out some of mankind's very best.

[01:39:57.170 --> 01:40:01.610]
I ask the American people to join me in sending a prayer for the victims and their families.

[01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:02.630]
God bless.

[01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:09.850]
There you go said, Pristine and I. That's wonderful.

[01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:11.830]
Wow that's a little dead air at the end there folks.

[01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:13.290]
Our George Wanda Day. A clean cut.

[01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:15.030]
Oh, don't cut.

[01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:16.470]
I don't know you're going to get cut.

[01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:21.630]
Bravo to at five sixty WQM the mo-myster man the guy who don't know.

[01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:24.110]
Mo he'll be on it too.

[01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:26.390]
Here's the fact that says give me a break.

[01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:30.030]
You think County rice has any idea who money Python is or what spam a lot is all about.

[01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:34.450]
Or did she have somebody explain it to her? Maybe she had somebody explain it but she was laughing her ass off as the report.

[01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:36.670]
She was yuckin it up while people were drowning.

[01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:41.890]
Says the body isn't even cooled and the bush-myster was nominated in replacement for the old man.

[01:40:45.430 --> 01:41:11.870]
And when the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and the man

[01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:39.330]
went to the dentist and the man went to the dentist and listening to me and listening reverently or listen through to you everyone where there was unlucky enough to catch Kathleen B. and she was back crying and rappingешь

[01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:43.710]
Yeah, well she was, but I mean, come on, Larry, would you get with it?

[01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:47.050]
Start somebody snap those suspenders and wake that maniac up already.

[01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:47.650]
Would you please?

[01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.590]
Jesus.

[01:41:49.530 --> 01:41:52.730]
No email from Ken Halper, and yet from National Limers, I'm sure that you're right on a

[01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:54.930]
way to where you send me an email, Ken, take care of that business.

[01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:56.010]
I hope.

[01:41:57.950 --> 01:42:01.710]
While federal and state emergency planners scrambled to get more military relief to golf course

[01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:05.910]
community, sticking by Hurricane Katrina, a massive naval goodwill state has been cruising

[01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:09.110]
off shore underused and waiting for a larger role in the effort.

[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:15.430]
The USS Batan, an 844-foot ship designed to dispatch Marines in amphibious assaults,

[01:42:15.450 --> 01:42:20.670]
has helicopters, doctors, hospital beds, food, water, all of these things.

[01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:21.590]
All of these things.

[01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:26.850]
It can also make its own water up to 100,000 gallons a day, and it just happened to be in

[01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:29.370]
the Gulf of Mexico when Katrina came roaring a shore.

[01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:34.630]
The Batan wrote out the sermon and followed it towards shore, waiting relief orders, helicopter

[01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:38.170]
pilots flying from its deck were some of the first to begin plucking stradded New Orleans

[01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:38.710]
residents.

[01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:44.170]
But now the Batan's hospital facilities, including six operating rooms and beds for 600 patients

[01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:46.130]
are empty.

[01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:51.710]
A good share of its 1200 sailors could also go ashore to help with relief effort, but they

[01:42:51.710 --> 01:42:52.510]
haven't been asked.

[01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:56.730]
The Batan has been in the stricken region, the longest of any military unit, but federal

[01:42:56.730 --> 01:42:58.730]
authorities have yet to fully utilize the ship.

[01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:00.050]
Captain Ready and Waiting.

[01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:02.630]
Could we do more?

[01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:04.770]
Sir Captain Noratai's and Commander of the Batan.

[01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.110]
Sure, I've got sailors who would be on the beach plucking through garbage or distributing

[01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:10.850]
water and food and stuff, but I can't force myself on people.

[01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:14.470]
We're doing everything we can to contribute right now, she says, and we're ready.

[01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:17.050]
If someone says you need to take on people, we're ready.

[01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:18.890]
If they say hospitals on the beach can't handle it.

[01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:20.850]
If they need to send the overflow out here, we're ready.

[01:43:21.090 --> 01:43:22.590]
We've got lots of room.

[01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:37.490]
I want to apologize to all the chimpanzees and just all the pansies for calling him smirking

[01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.810]
chimpanzees.

[01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:38.670]
That's a great website.

[01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:41.790]
We use a lot of their stories, but that's an insult to the...

[01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:44.290]
Sean, I picture we get on our website too with all the chimps on there.

[01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:46.070]
We apologize profusely to them.

[01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:49.010]
I can put them in a clasp with his bowzo.

[01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:50.630]
Well, chimps are bastards anyway.

[01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:54.310]
56670560, they're LeBasterids.

[01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:57.210]
Tom 560, they've arrived in a singular wireless line.

[01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:59.330]
Come in to QA and hello.

[01:43:59.790 --> 01:44:00.130]
Not there.

[01:44:00.490 --> 01:44:01.090]
QA and hello.

[01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:04.090]
QA and?

[01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:05.070]
Hello?

[01:44:05.610 --> 01:44:05.970]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:08.450]
Yeah, I've got two questions for Neil.

[01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.450]
Yeah.

[01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:16.850]
The batans can drop down its front end and go straight into the shore, and the other was

[01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:19.070]
rather all the burden put in their bid yet.

[01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:22.190]
Yes, they, and as a matter of fact, we head out to their own website.

[01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:26.870]
Haliburton got a no bid contract to start to clean up.

[01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:27.530]
Did you see that?

[01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:28.450]
No, I did not.

[01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:29.250]
Of course.

[01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:31.030]
Absolutely, man.

[01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:31.530]
There's no...

[01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:31.830]
Absolutely.

[01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.750]
...whoa question about it.

[01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:34.690]
Maybe that's where the vice president is.

[01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:35.470]
He's not really on vacation.

[01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:37.950]
Maybe he's sitting up there at the Haliburton headquarters in the area.

[01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:39.970]
Boardroom.

[01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:43.090]
Pull on a few strings and arrange it a few things.

[01:44:43.090 --> 01:44:43.570]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.430]
Eat in a couple of wings.

[01:44:44.610 --> 01:44:45.090]
I know what you're saying.

[01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:46.850]
And of course that bulldyed daughter here.

[01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:47.310]
You're fair.

[01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:52.430]
56670560, pound 566 in the Verizon and Singular Wireless Line.

[01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:54.350]
WCWAM, hello.

[01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:55.890]
Hey Neil.

[01:44:56.650 --> 01:44:59.010]
I know Ron Jeremy could plug that lead.

[01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:00.310]
Yeah, okay, good.

[01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:01.550]
WCWAM, hello.

[01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:03.270]
Hey Neil, what's up?

[01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:04.070]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:06.090]
Hey, they just took my thunder, man.

[01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:08.150]
I was going to tell you that the Bush administration company...

[01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:08.770]
Oh, Ron Jeremy?

[01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.850]
Huh?

[01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:10.850]
Go ahead.

[01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:13.870]
The Bush administration was on it from the beginning.

[01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:15.310]
Everybody says they weren't working on it.

[01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:16.590]
They're working from back to front.

[01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:19.830]
They were really plotting no bid contracts from California.

[01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:21.230]
Well, that's already a done deal, man.

[01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:22.210]
It's all that's done.

[01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.190]
Sonito.

[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:29.490]
Let me check my email here and see if Ken Halperen is responded to my E-55 email so far

[01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.390]
about this mini crisis that's developed here.

[01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:35.350]
Would have been nice if you emailed me yesterday Ken and said, what happened?

[01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:36.890]
Oh, here's one.

[01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:38.370]
You think this is it George?

[01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:39.250]
No, no.

[01:45:39.670 --> 01:45:40.350]
It's not it.

[01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:44.630]
It's from TomPain.com.

[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:45.450]
Well, that's great.

[01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:46.550]
What a pain that is.

[01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:49.730]
A pain about that plane.

[01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:50.790]
Oh, geez.

[01:45:51.190 --> 01:45:52.210]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:55.970]
Hey, you just wanted to make an analogy.

[01:45:56.950 --> 01:46:01.010]
I want to compare Bush to...

[01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:02.710]
I want to compare Bush to LBJ.

[01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:05.330]
At least LBJ realized he made a mistake with Vietnam.

[01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:09.490]
He decided not to run for the presidency in his second term.

[01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:10.870]
Well, what do you mean he's here?

[01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:13.550]
I mean, what kind of a comment is that?

[01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:17.970]
After they brought him 30,000, 40,000 kids in body bags, he realized he made a mistake.

[01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.050]
He didn't realize he made a mistake.

[01:46:20.050 --> 01:46:22.550]
He didn't run again because he didn't have a China-Mins chance in hell.

[01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:23.650]
That's why I didn't run again.

[01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:25.730]
God.

[01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:28.970]
That guy sounds old enough to remember it.

[01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:30.090]
So he ought to know what he's talking about.

[01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.370]
The only problem is he doesn't.

[01:46:31.530 --> 01:46:33.350]
He reminds me of somebody else.

[01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:38.470]
1968, he didn't have any chance of winning the nomination.

[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:43.530]
The country had turned because the media finally, finally, thanks to Walter Cronk,

[01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:45.830]
kind of a few others, finally the media got out of it.

[01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:48.830]
And all these generals like Westmore, they ran their own Irvity line through their teeth.

[01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:50.390]
Just like the lies that we get now.

[01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:54.610]
They started calling them on it.

[01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:56.030]
The American public started getting the truth.

[01:46:56.050 --> 01:46:58.770]
And when we got the body bags, started mounting and mounting and mounting.

[01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:02.110]
We realized that we were there for absolutely no legitimate purpose whatsoever.

[01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:03.310]
That's when the public...

[01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:04.870]
And of course, then Nixon gets in.

[01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:05.570]
And what do we get?

[01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:08.730]
We get another six years of it with Nixon and Ford before they finally got it all over.

[01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:11.270]
And a total of 50,000 body bags.

[01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:12.250]
I don't see that email.

[01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.690]
You know what?

[01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:15.850]
I'm just going to say, I think maybe I'm just going to take a half hour off here.

[01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:17.390]
All right.

[01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:18.510]
So that's the music left over.

[01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:19.010]
No, I'm serious.

[01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:20.430]
I'm going to have to make a few phone calls.

[01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:21.470]
Now maybe it was my mistake.

[01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:23.350]
Maybe I gave Kindergarten later something like that.

[01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:25.850]
Because he's always been really great with the right date.

[01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:26.670]
I can call it.

[01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:28.290]
Kenya?

[01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.470]
Yeah.

[01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:30.670]
That's a good idea.

[01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:33.750]
I'll fax you his number, his cell number.

[01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:34.290]
I.

[01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:36.030]
And then you can like coordinate.

[01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:38.070]
There was a plane that's coming in at 105.

[01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:42.550]
And like they said in the Godfather, I don't want somebody coming out of the attorney who just

[01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:43.790]
is thinking his hand.

[01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.970]
You know?

[01:47:44.170 --> 01:47:45.030]
105 today.

[01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:45.870]
Yes.

[01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:46.370]
The Saturday.

[01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:50.710]
That's why I'm getting a little bit antsy now because they haven't only showed up yesterday to pick somebody up.

[01:47:50.890 --> 01:47:51.810]
Who wasn't coming in yesterday?

[01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:57.550]
So you would have thought that would at the counter times there a little miss after somebody would have emailed me yesterday and said,

[01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:58.270]
Hey, what happened?

[01:47:58.330 --> 01:47:59.110]
Did somebody make a mistake?

[01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:00.530]
Maybe I screwed it up, Ken.

[01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:03.870]
But it would have been nice to get an email yesterday saying, Hey, what's it?

[01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:04.730]
What what up?

[01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:05.370]
Right?

[01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:08.430]
But it didn't happen.

[01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:11.130]
But nevertheless, that many Q a.m.

[01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.870]

[01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.450]
Hello.

[01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:13.430]
Yes sir.

[01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:18.670]
How about half time your your fat ass governor was only talking about?

[01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:21.950]
He gave $10 out of his pocket at the point.

[01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:23.130]
It's reducing every man.

[01:48:23.150 --> 01:48:24.870]
They said 20 before an outside of the 10 bucks.

[01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:27.090]
I think we're like, you know what I really think he gave?

[01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:28.310]
I could be wrong.

[01:48:28.530 --> 01:48:28.970]
Eight bucks.

[01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:29.350]
Yeah.

[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:32.890]
We don't have one.

[01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:33.710]
It's his five.

[01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:34.750]
I heard it was nine.

[01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:36.350]
Yeah, that could have been it.

[01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:38.590]
It sure as hell wasn't about third man.

[01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.950]
No way.

[01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.530]
He gave that much.

[01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:42.430]
He donated 10 or 20 bucks.

[01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:43.230]
Whatever it was.

[01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.790]
Now what was it?

[01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:44.210]
Was it 20?

[01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:45.570]
Yes, I think it was 20.

[01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.870]
20 bucks.

[01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:48.130]
No man.

[01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:50.530]
What a generous piece of third man.

[01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:51.630]
Your fat ass governor.

[01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:55.190]
See, I was thinking about that this morning when I was kind of playing.

[01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:55.990]
He's slitting my wrists.

[01:48:55.990 --> 01:49:01.470]
And that is, how is it that there are certain people who retain a high degree of popularity,

[01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:05.870]
like let Colin Powell, for example, who sold the whole world out by going to the U.N.

[01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:09.290]
and lying through his teeth or condolese, huh?

[01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:10.870]
Who retains popularity?

[01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:12.650]
Oh, that's Dr. Rice.

[01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:16.110]
For a reason, still unfigured by yours truly.

[01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:22.050]
And of course, your fat ass governor, oh, he's just tremendously popular because he lies

[01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:27.330]
a lie because he's a religious nut because he was obsessed with Terry and her.

[01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:28.850]
You, but I don't get it, man.

[01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:31.570]
Must be you're not getting the really good stuff done.

[01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:34.050]
This is Neil Rodgers.

[01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:35.550]
Sure, with George, he can use it.

[01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:38.670]
He's 5'16", Q-A-A-L.

[01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:43.990]
Because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now.

[01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.910]
Not the National Guard.

[01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:46.290]
Pardon?

[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:47.430]
Not the National Guard.

[01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:48.650]
No National Guard in Iraq?

[01:49:48.650 --> 01:49:50.910]
No National Guard at no.

[01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.770]
Ugh.

[01:49:55.230 --> 01:49:58.470]
And here's to you, Mr. Sarponko.

[01:49:59.150 --> 01:50:02.130]
Troopers found some spot in your limo.

[01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:05.750]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:07.250]
God bless you, please.

[01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:12.470]
Mr. Sarponko, there's a hefty fine ass you will say.

[01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:13.890]
No, 100 spots.

[01:50:14.210 --> 01:50:15.290]
Hey, hey, hey.

[01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:17.910]
Hey, hey, hey.

[01:50:21.710 --> 01:50:27.610]
There you have it, criminal record in our police files.

[01:50:29.370 --> 01:50:32.350]
And we have you going to help yourself.

[01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:39.230]
Look around you all you see are dilated eyes.

[01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:44.910]
If you're getting stone to it in your own home.

[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:48.770]
And here's to you, Mr. Sarponko.

[01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:52.290]
Smoke in your chest, keep this door your home.

[01:50:53.690 --> 01:50:54.970]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:57.670]
God bless you, please.

[01:50:57.870 --> 01:51:03.110]
Mr. Sarponko, the spot I know sure does not go away.

[01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:05.490]
Hey, hey, hey.

[01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:09.350]
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

[01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.950]
Exactly.

[01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:12.290]
Well, 17 and 560 W.

[01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:13.290]
Did you get those numbers?

[01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:14.090]
I didn't affect you.

[01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.430]
Yes.

[01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:16.010]
And I called.

[01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:18.990]
And it was a good thing that I called.

[01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:20.490]
And why is that?

[01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:23.810]
Because otherwise somebody would have been a hoof of it.

[01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.890]
Or a cabinet.

[01:51:27.610 --> 01:51:28.010]
And?

[01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:30.110]
And it's all it's taken care of.

[01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.890]
Or that.

[01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:32.950]
Let me just ask you this.

[01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:36.130]
I don't want to start ripping anybody on here because Ken's been very, very nice to me.

[01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.750]
He's a good friend.

[01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.130]
But.

[01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:37.970]
But.

[01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.670]
Yeah.

[01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:43.450]
And I really don't know whether I screwed up and gave him the wrong day to pick somebody up.

[01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:44.570]
That's what he said.

[01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:45.510]
That's what he said.

[01:51:46.290 --> 01:51:47.210]
I doubt it.

[01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:49.090]
But nevertheless, I'll take the blame for that.

[01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:52.530]
But if that be the case, wouldn't it have been the day yesterday?

[01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:54.890]
The send me an email and say, hey, where was so and so?

[01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.450]
And what happened?

[01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:58.670]
And we have like a miscommunication that you screw up and give me the wrong date.

[01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:00.310]
Did you know, did chickens be?

[01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.790]
Whatever.

[01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:02.810]
Because then I get the email.

[01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:04.410]
And what if I wouldn't have checked the emails?

[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.190]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:06.550]
See what I'm saying?

[01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:07.170]
But nevertheless.

[01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:08.330]
Thanks, Ken.

[01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:09.630]
Don't do it again.

[01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:14.630]
Good thing I had to, and see, send me an email.

[01:52:14.630 --> 01:52:18.030]
And then not to give a response an hour later, which is what I got it.

[01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:20.110]
And I have four five responses on it.

[01:52:20.210 --> 01:52:20.770]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:22.510]
If you're not going to check the emails, what's the point?

[01:52:22.730 --> 01:52:23.450]
Are you nitpicking again?

[01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:24.090]
Yes.

[01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:25.350]
Thanks, Ken.

[01:52:26.630 --> 01:52:27.270]
You bowzo.

[01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:28.910]
You're fairly good guy.

[01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:31.910]
Jane faxes and says, and thanks for calling, George.

[01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:34.250]
In fact, John will take you out to dinner.

[01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:37.210]
Next time, remember, comes to the town of Leicol, and he'll be a party.

[01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:37.930]
It's a big deal.

[01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.310]

[01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:41.290]
Jiren-Eel God, Jane says, I get 50 bucks to the red cross, and I'm unemployed.

[01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:46.570]
Well, that's a really nice, Jane, because your fat ass governor gave a $20 bill that turned that piece of garbage.

[01:52:46.570 --> 01:52:48.670]
Well, I mean, stop and think about it.

[01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:51.670]
This is the president's little brother, okay?

[01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:55.110]
This is the governor in the state of Florida.

[01:52:55.230 --> 01:52:59.950]
This is a man from this rich, rich wealthy bunch of crook family, the Bush family, or her...

[01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:01.530]
What ever in hell is his name?

[01:53:01.590 --> 01:53:04.390]
It was Press God Bush, the banker for the Nazis.

[01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:07.930]
They got more money than Carter's got pills.

[01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:12.530]
And he goes on television instead of just saying, I gave an ice donation.

[01:53:12.810 --> 01:53:15.010]
He says, I put a $20 bill in the pot.

[01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:17.290]
All right, bought some pot with 20, but whatever.

[01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:20.190]
He can't buy too much pot with 20 bucks, but nevertheless, it'll do.

[01:53:20.650 --> 01:53:22.470]
Yeah, for a whole year over.

[01:53:23.590 --> 01:53:28.310]
As much as I normally hate TV reporters, I think the New Orleans convention center would be in Mocelyn,

[01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:35.890]
and with 15 to 20,000 dead, if we're for certain reporters, I want to mention in particular, Jane says, Tony Zimbato and Carl Kintnia of MSNBC,

[01:53:36.150 --> 01:53:37.250]
Carl Kintnia was very good.

[01:53:37.590 --> 01:53:38.770]
I don't know about how to know who the other one is.

[01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:41.810]
And Kira Phillips and Chris Lawrence at CNN.

[01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:44.250]
Yeah, Chris Lawrence was outstanding.

[01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:53.430]
His reporters revealed a horror is going on their Thursday, and Kira Phillips really re-med administration officials and ass who came on her show live forum between 1 on 330 of that awful day.

[01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:54.190]
Nice going, Kira.

[01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:56.870]
You're no Lou Dobbs, thank God.

[01:53:57.190 --> 01:53:58.610]
And Jack Caffity, man.

[01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:00.250]
He was sensational.

[01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:01.070]
You go, Jack.

[01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:04.830]
Yeah, I thought Wolf Litzkrieg was going to have a nervous breakdown, trying to calm him down.

[01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:07.670]
Of course, Wolf the establishment's shill Nazi bastard that he is.

[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.750]
Jack Caffity was fantastic.

[01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.470]
Jane says, I just hope they haven't been fired for showing the truth.

[01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:16.870]
I think this is going to turn into a big land grab now that they got rid of the dark folks.

[01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:19.990]
And after all, their fewer are setting one of his first speeches.

[01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:24.950]
The good news is, and it's hard for some to see now, that all of this chaos is going to come a fantastic Gulf Coast.

[01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:29.070]
Jane also says, the city of New Orleans song just made me break down and cry.

[01:54:29.490 --> 01:54:31.010]
Love you and don't ever retire, Jane says.

[01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:31.730]
And guess what, Jane?

[01:54:32.370 --> 01:54:34.030]
I'm going to be right about now, be a good time.

[01:54:35.170 --> 01:54:35.770]
Look at that.

[01:54:36.150 --> 01:54:37.510]
Oh, God.

[01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:38.910]
Sawyer is George.

[01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:41.170]
I got some music you don't know.

[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.730]
Nothing.

[01:54:41.890 --> 01:54:43.450]
What is with this music stuff?

[01:54:43.930 --> 01:54:45.070]
What is that all about?

[01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:46.730]
It's called thinking your way through the holiday.

[01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:48.710]
It's not a holiday anymore.

[01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.490]
No, not today.

[01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:53.410]
Oh, well, today is today, and yesterday was yesterday, okay?

[01:54:53.610 --> 01:54:55.710]
So, don't, uh, 645 votes.

[01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:56.710]
We got a shot at 700.

[01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:59.210]
We're not going to make no thousand, I don't think.

[01:54:59.290 --> 01:55:01.150]
It doesn't make any difference to me.

[01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:04.710]
Okay, here's a lady on there, dark, conflicted lady looking for a 70-year-old son.

[01:55:04.710 --> 01:55:05.050]
First.

[01:55:05.530 --> 01:55:08.410]
See, this is, I'm not even going to say it.

[01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:15.050]
The lack of organization, the lack of coordination, and it's not just the federal government, it's not just the downtown Mickey Brown.

[01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:16.670]
The city hadn't got a clue.

[01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:19.670]
The, uh, uh, so he asked, uh, sour governor, uh,

[01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:23.130]
none of these people had a clue, including that Haley, uh, give me a barber.

[01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:25.390]
That fat ass, uh, turd, they're Mississippi.

[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:30.150]
Well, the people like him, he's the poster child for what I hate.

[01:55:30.610 --> 01:55:31.150]
Haley, barber.

[01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:35.690]
And another one is that Bill Fisk.

[01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:40.170]
They are the poster children, and I'll say another one is John Roberts.

[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:41.190]
Yeah.

[01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:46.930]
Speaking of BDI evil, do we, you can just see the look of that, you know, those board again, these real, uh,

[01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:52.570]
far-bison board again Christians, they have kind of that like, hollow, hide, BD, uh, yeah, brainwashed.

[01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:54.770]
Thanks Ken, by the way, don't do it again.

[01:55:55.150 --> 01:55:55.710]
A rip-y ass.

[01:55:56.110 --> 01:55:57.510]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:55:58.210 --> 01:56:01.690]
Oh, seriously, even if I did make the mistake, wouldn't you think if you went to pick somebody up,

[01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:06.070]
if that was your job, and there was nobody there, wouldn't you say, well, maybe somebody screwed up probably him,

[01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:08.850]
and maybe me, who knows, but I'd better email and find out.

[01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:10.870]
I don't think he's got my number here, maybe he does.

[01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.070]
I don't know, he didn't, uh, nothing.

[01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:14.010]
All right, say, hey, look, I made my trip.

[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:15.010]
Best I could do it too bad.

[01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:18.890]
Yeah, thank God it's Ken and not you, but you would do that.

[01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:19.510]
Of course.

[01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:20.630]
It's all due to my best shot.

[01:56:20.630 --> 01:56:22.210]
Well, there's a rank wasted in a box.

[01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:27.950]
See, at least for the Pope, they carried him around on its slab, you know, they let everybody take a look through, uh,

[01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:29.430]
mosa balls and whatever.

[01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:31.870]
That was morbid, that was brutal.

[01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:33.430]
Yeah, what was that allowed?

[01:56:33.730 --> 01:56:34.650]
Why, why did they do that?

[01:56:35.230 --> 01:56:39.870]
And this new Pope, man, you talk about Nazis, man, oh, man, I guarantee he's got a card.

[01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:42.590]
He is a card-carrying Nazi.

[01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:46.250]
If he wasn't a member of the organization, he sure as hell qualifies.

[01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:48.750]
BDI'd their fewer.

[01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:51.730]
But I tell you, Nazis are making a comeback.

[01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:55.550]
They always say that, you know, the world goes in cycles and, uh, well, we're in a cycle, all right.

[01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:59.530]
Why FEMA was missing an action? This is from the LA Times.

[01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:02.130]
I haven't taken too many stupid, no, the calls have been okay.

[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:05.070]
Since the beginning when we got some of your people, I think.

[01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:08.630]
Not my people, your people.

[01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:09.010]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:15.170]
Why FEMA was missing an action by LA Times staff writers, Alan Miller and Peter Gosselin.

[01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:18.030]
Well, I wonder if he's a kind of goose sausage.

[01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:21.270]
I wonder if Josh knows who goose sausage was.

[01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:22.310]
Yeah, of course I do the picture.

[01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:23.730]
Very good.

[01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:25.390]
Mark the bird, Fidrich.

[01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.710]
I don't.

[01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:35.530]
You know, I'm not going to say it.

[01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:38.670]
Oh, no, because you do a fine job of these stories.

[01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:41.010]
And some days lately, I've been sending you way too many stories.

[01:57:41.010 --> 01:57:43.530]
And you're probably cussing me out and saying, oh, it's a 30 story.

[01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:45.970]
Okay, so you know, today I cut down a little bit.

[01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:46.510]
Yeah, that was nice.

[01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:46.850]
Give it up.

[01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:47.550]
I was a holiday.

[01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:48.410]
Don't overdo it.

[01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:50.170]
Let me just say, okay, you're not going to talk.

[01:57:50.290 --> 01:57:53.890]
Because I do, if you do give me somebody who I don't know, I happen to Google them.

[01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:56.490]
And I will tell you one time you made a guy up completely.

[01:57:57.110 --> 01:57:57.790]
But who is that?

[01:57:58.210 --> 01:57:58.810]
I don't know.

[01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:00.010]
A some ridiculous name.

[01:58:00.190 --> 01:58:00.770]
No, I did not.

[01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:02.090]
You played for the Yankees.

[01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:03.690]
If you would be this row, that out there.

[01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.690]
Is Camille?

[01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:06.230]
A.B.

[01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:07.410]
Morsche Pupik?

[01:58:08.650 --> 01:58:09.150]
You're wrong.

[01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:10.250]
I never make up nothing.

[01:58:10.330 --> 01:58:10.690]
Trust me.

[01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:11.490]
You made it.

[01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:12.270]
I'll look at the name.

[01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:13.150]
I looked it up.

[01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:14.070]
Jaime Schmendrick.

[01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:15.270]
He was a third baseman, I think.

[01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:17.470]
He was kind of Jim Brideweiser.

[01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:23.050]
Well, Mark the Bird Fidritch was a very charismatic picture for the Tigers.

[01:58:23.770 --> 01:58:24.630]
I'm not saying him.

[01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:25.230]
I'm just saying.

[01:58:25.330 --> 01:58:26.290]
No, no, but I'm just saying.

[01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:29.910]
I would think that, I mean, if you know who Guss Gossett was, was also before your time.

[01:58:30.230 --> 01:58:30.570]
Yes.

[01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:34.050]
Who was a great fireballing relief picture for the Yankees.

[01:58:34.450 --> 01:58:38.230]
Mark the Bird Fidritch was, who was the picture for the Red Sox?

[01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:44.250]
Also before your time, but you've got to know who real goofball famous for Bill G's.

[01:58:44.850 --> 01:58:48.670]
He actually discussed these things when I'm doing the crossover with Hank, because he knows all of this stuff.

[01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:51.810]
As Mo, that's all he knows is a bunch of stupid sports stuff.

[01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:53.450]
He knows nothing about what's happening in the world.

[01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:54.030]
That's for the angel.

[01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:55.370]
Hey Mo, you're a...

[01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:56.590]
Doron.

[01:59:00.210 --> 01:59:01.170]
Yeah, oh, Guss Gossett.

[01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.630]
I don't know.

[01:59:01.670 --> 01:59:02.630]
Well, that's one you knew.

[01:59:03.150 --> 01:59:04.090]
How about Guss Gosselin?

[01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:06.910]
How about Jocelyn Gosselin?

[01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:08.250]
What about Lothar Guss?

[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:10.990]
While the Federal guy, he can't pass up a good goose.

[01:59:11.690 --> 01:59:14.730]
While the Federal government has spent much of the last quarter century trimming it,

[01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:20.850]
the safety nets it provides Americans, and has dramatically expanded its promise of protection in one area,

[01:59:20.850 --> 01:59:21.450]
disaster.

[01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:23.430]
Oh, we had a disaster all right.

[01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:24.490]
They didn't let us down on that.

[01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:29.850]
Since the 1970s, Washington's emerged as the insurer of last resort against floods,

[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:32.870]
fired earthquakes, and after 2001, terrorist attacks.

[01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:36.630]
You know, it's that war on terror, that mysterious war on terror.

[01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:41.030]
But the government's stumbling response to the storm that devastated the nation's Gulf Coast

[01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:45.170]
reveals that the Federal agency, singularly most responsible for making good on Washington's

[01:59:45.170 --> 01:59:49.450]
expanded promise, has been hobbled by cutbacks and a bureaucratic downgrading.

[01:59:49.650 --> 01:59:51.310]
Don't tell that to downtown Mickey Brown.

[01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:58.210]
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, once speedily delivered food, water,

[01:59:58.210 --> 02:00:01.990]
shelter, and medical care to disaster areas, and paid to quickly rebuild damaged roads and schools,

[02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:04.150]
and get businesses and people back on their feet.

[02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:07.790]
Like your commercial insurance firm, setting safety standards to prevent future problems,

[02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:11.310]
it also underwrote efforts to get cities and states to reduce risk ahead of time,

[02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:13.450]
and plan for what they would do if calamity struck.

[02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:17.670]
But in the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks, FEMA lost its cabinet-level status,

[02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:22.290]
as it was folded into the giant new, anxious department of home land security.

[02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:23.410]
Oh, my God.

[02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:24.070]
That's right.

[02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:29.510]
In recent years, it suffered massive budget cuts, the elimination of reduction of key programs,

[02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:31.810]
and an exodus of experienced staffers.

[02:00:32.690 --> 02:00:35.970]
The agency's core budget, which includes disaster preparedness and mitigation,

[02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:40.010]
has been cut each year since it was observed by the Homeland Security Department in 2003,

[02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:42.750]
depending on what the final numbers end up being for next fiscal year,

[02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:45.530]
the cuts will have been between about 2 and 18%.

[02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:50.570]
The agency's staff has been reduced by 500 positions.

[02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:54.850]
Among the results, FEMA's had to cut one of its three emergency management teams,

[02:00:55.110 --> 02:00:57.470]
which are charged with overseeing relief efforts into disaster,

[02:00:57.790 --> 02:01:00.990]
where it once had red, white, and blue teams, and now has only red and white.

[02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:02.450]
And they didn't want no blue...

[02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:06.870]
They didn't want no blue team.

[02:01:07.170 --> 02:01:07.390]
Yeah.

[02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:09.790]
Sounds too much like those blue states,

[02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:13.330]
which is why the people in the world were famous for the blues in New Orleans, right?

[02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.770]
If he's actually.

[02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:15.490]
That's what?

[02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.290]
What?

[02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:17.290]
No, I don't.

[02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:19.790]
That's why they're feeling mighty blue right now.

[02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:22.970]
It's rated that three out of every $4 the agency provides a local preparedness

[02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:25.370]
and first responder grants go to terrorism related activities,

[02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:29.230]
even though a recent government accountability office, the GAO, report quotes local officials,

[02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:33.570]
saying what they really need, is money to prepare for natural disasters and accidents.

[02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:37.030]
They've taken emergency management away from the emergency managers,

[02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:40.490]
complaint more a goodman, who was FEMA's chief spokesman during the Clinton administration.

[02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:44.610]
These operations have been run by people who are amateurs and what they are doing.

[02:01:44.610 --> 02:01:46.150]
That's the only correction.

[02:01:47.070 --> 02:01:48.870]
This is Neil Rogers.

[02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:53.490]
This is 5.16.18X.

[02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.630]
What was this stop me joined?

[02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:00.090]
Didn't you hear it?

[02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:00.710]
I heard it.

[02:02:01.090 --> 02:02:01.870]
Like in the middle of it.

[02:02:01.930 --> 02:02:04.730]
Like I'm supposed to be psychically and they're like, I know which time he says,

[02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:06.570]
that is just crap.

[02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.770]
Psychically.

[02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:09.510]
Oh my God.

[02:02:09.630 --> 02:02:11.250]
And where the hell was the thing I was just playing?

[02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:22.950]
I was just playing.

[02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.970]
I was just playing.

[02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.990]
I was just playing.

[02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.010]
I was just playing.

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:23.010]

[02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.190]
I was just playing.

[02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:24.970]
I was just playing.

[02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.130]
I was just playing.

[02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:26.130]

[02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:26.130]

[02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:27.170]
I was just playing.

[02:02:27.630 --> 02:02:30.910]
I was just playing.

[02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:41.230]
I was just playing.

[02:02:59.570 --> 02:03:04.230]
I was sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:04.230]

[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:04.230]

[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:04.230]

[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:05.530]
Yuck, you just played tough.

[02:03:05.530 --> 02:03:05.970]
Yuck, you just played hard because you had to do that on the back to your face.

[02:03:05.970 --> 02:03:06.870]
Have to look it up, you just predominately want to put your Understood.

[02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:07.170]
Yeah, you do your AerDBT.

[02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:10.530]
Yeah, that sounds like violence in the economy.

[02:03:10.530 --> 02:03:10.970]
Yeah, you just played hard because most

[02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:11.030]
everyone here isening.

[02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.210]
There's nothing kids like that like go ahead and他們 aremed on your eyes.

[02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:11.210]

[02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:11.210]

[02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:16.490]
next question. Yo mate! Yes sir. Yeah well you go to the

[02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:22.410]
round water. Good question. Important substantive. Marijuana

[02:03:22.410 --> 02:03:29.110]
legalization. No. Absolutely not. Cocaine. Yes.

[02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:34.410]
DCP. heroin. Probably. Mobituas. Andphetamines.

[02:03:34.410 --> 02:03:40.830]
Without a doubt. Without a doubt. Not us. Now you. What are you gonna do to the black man?

[02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:46.870]
Thanks for asking. First thing I'd like to do. See me one up close. Not too close.

[02:03:47.130 --> 02:03:51.230]
No touching. Perhaps maybe get a walk. What? Can I get a walk?

[02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:54.490]
I told you we would. Thank you very much. We gotta go. We gotta go.

[02:03:54.710 --> 02:03:59.610]
I'm with Jim Fane Troyale with George W. Bush. Which is a great fit. You only promise

[02:03:59.610 --> 02:04:03.290]
the worst of doing is pop a bush. But nevertheless you say that. Yeah you have to

[02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:07.330]
suspend disbelief or whatever that is. There's Trent Lott. How's we?

[02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:10.790]
Port Trent Lott who lost his house man. We can't we can't we can't

[02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:15.130]
put it on a porch drinking a peanut colada's with a Trent Lott. What is it? What is it?

[02:04:15.130 --> 02:04:19.430]
What if it's not? Yeah one of his 18 houses. I wonder if they saved the pom

[02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:25.090]
poms. I sure hope they didn't wash away. Oh man that would be tragic. Man. Anyway

[02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:28.310]
say nice things about Ken Halper. He's a great guy. He does a good job and

[02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:32.330]
you scoot him up. Let's play with it. I'm sure. Blame it on dry. Yeah. He

[02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:35.030]
don't even know who marked the bird. Fidriches and I did not make up any

[02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:38.690]
name. I really definitely did. Well see if he gave me the name then we could like

[02:04:39.130 --> 02:04:43.810]
examine his temperate. You said this guy played for the Yankees. If I said he

[02:04:43.810 --> 02:04:47.390]
played he played like like oh I know probably like a Norm Seabron or Jerry

[02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:53.070]
Lumpy. Is that who it was? No. Jerry Lumpy. Do you think I made up that name?

[02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:57.030]
L-U-M-P-E. It wasn't that. It was a ridiculous name that you just played. Like what?

[02:04:57.530 --> 02:05:01.370]
I can't remember. I am Shmendrick. I've been trying to look it up and there was no

[02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:06.610]
such player. Okay. Whatever. Okay. Whatever you say. I doubted. Last. Oh this is

[02:05:06.610 --> 02:05:12.150]
great. But before I read this let me just say it again. That photo opportunity

[02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:15.770]
that he pulled off with Carl Rowe. And I don't think he fooled too many

[02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:18.330]
people except the chorus for the gullible reporters which they were just

[02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:21.430]
aww flaunting about how wonderfully he is in dealing with the people in

[02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:28.290]
human. Yeah right. When they had him miked not only out there with the public

[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:32.010]
you know very safely far away from any where the flooding was and this was in

[02:05:32.010 --> 02:05:36.150]
Balexie not in the world. And they had a miked in a hangar there at the airport.

[02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:39.710]
Did you see that part? Yeah. That was the part where he was with downtown Mickey

[02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:43.630]
Brown and he was and he was and he was just talking casually but as if he

[02:05:43.630 --> 02:05:46.110]
didn't realize we were here and of course he knew we were here and because he

[02:05:46.110 --> 02:05:51.010]
had a microphone on dummy and talking about what a fine job everybody was

[02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:54.950]
doing and Mickey Brown and all this other crap. Then they take him out there in

[02:05:54.950 --> 02:06:00.010]
an hour later we see he's safely stand around or under a big old tree next to

[02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:03.750]
some trailer park and he's got a couple of dark and collected young girls

[02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:08.550]
there and he's emoting and kissing him on the head and holding him. And to my

[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:14.090]
amazement then we hear the audio. You see I know boys and girls that may come

[02:06:14.090 --> 02:06:18.350]
as a shock to you but on television when they take pictures of people unless you

[02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:22.250]
have microphones there that are planned ahead of time unless you have unless you

[02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:25.290]
open those microphones to the public in here you don't hear what they're saying.

[02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:33.750]
What are you saying? Photo up how can you have the nerve the gall

[02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:38.170]
El President they to turn other people's tragedy into your own personal photo

[02:06:38.170 --> 02:06:43.550]
up to try to show us about your compassionate conservatism my ass you hate

[02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:49.850]
mongering lunatic you murderer you butcher up watching the new and so was it

[02:06:49.850 --> 02:06:53.050]
any was there any wonder that he didn't show his little white ass there in

[02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:56.930]
New Orleans except at the airport on the edge of the airport they can be

[02:06:56.930 --> 02:07:04.790]
damn sure they had secured real real well. Ed Naha well remember we had the

[02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:07.810]
other article he's good right I forget who the hell he is though but he's

[02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:12.570]
very good we like it from smirking chimps where the story comes from but at

[02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:16.590]
any rate is a long story and you know what I'm gonna read it anyway I'm

[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:18.830]
I mean this might be one of those I have to interrupt which I usually don't do

[02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:23.010]
that no more because this business of reading you know gets Miguel very upset how

[02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:25.890]
is Miguel doing by the way don't hear from him no more he's still there yeah he

[02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:29.150]
wasn't here this morning is Josh Curtis's mother still chasing him around the

[02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:29.370]
hallway

[02:07:38.110 --> 02:07:38.910]
haha haha

[02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:39.090]
haha

[02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:45.150]
Ed Naha writes the worst president ever and and as usual is absolutely

[02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:49.830]
correction I think I'm gonna look at that none stayed as long as they could

[02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:54.250]
have the content well thank God for that never happened and then they flew away

[02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:57.790]
okay now can penguins fly I don't think so they thought there's wood like

[02:07:57.790 --> 02:08:02.130]
sons of bitches and I still can't get over that seal that we saw on I do

[02:08:02.130 --> 02:08:06.750]
remember that yeah what was that all about I still all the way I saw that the

[02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:10.330]
zoo came out okay which is good and then I saw some poor little doggies there

[02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:13.910]
that just broke my heart you see dogs floating on the river it was there's a guy

[02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:16.350]
that refused to get on the bus because they didn't want to abandon his dogs

[02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:20.730]
right I pull it out and in fact I think I think they should have just taken a dog

[02:08:20.730 --> 02:08:25.090]
and left him behind and no that was that white guy that bearded the old the

[02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:27.950]
cool yeah responsible for my yeah haha

[02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:34.250]
well he and then it was the other guy who had the a mirror nurse outfit on

[02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:41.650]
and it is beyond belief what has gone on there for over a week now and the

[02:08:41.650 --> 02:08:45.210]
worst part of is there still are people stranded there's still people

[02:08:45.210 --> 02:08:48.490]
stranded yeah just like the article that I you know you ever think about boats

[02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:52.490]
you're about all these other ways don't don't give us and what the thing about

[02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:56.010]
not feeding the people in the super dome the convention center and on the

[02:08:56.010 --> 02:09:01.290]
expressway there thousands and thousands of people you know assuming that you're

[02:09:01.290 --> 02:09:04.050]
right which the wishes a lie about the fact they couldn't give to them but

[02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:08.750]
assuming that it was airdrop yeah and all these different companies donating

[02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:14.710]
millions of bottles of bottled water and food and all this other stuff and couldn't

[02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:19.990]
get it to you I'm surprised that Bush didn't want to start a ride there

[02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:22.210]
probably would have made a deal with the Colonel you know what I'm saying

[02:09:22.210 --> 02:09:26.510]
uh-huh can you imagine can you imagine the scene brutal I don't want to think

[02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:29.330]
about it I guess we'll do the break then I'll read about why he's the worst

[02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:32.730]
president ever and of course like I said Ed Naha has got his thumb right on it

[02:09:33.570 --> 02:09:38.130]
22 to 1 at 560 and don't forget there are no national guard troops in Iraq

[02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:43.610]
this is Neil Roger this is 560

[02:09:46.730 --> 02:09:49.950]
yeah you'd like to take the break but the ball go what happened the other

[02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:52.050]
crash oh

[02:09:53.570 --> 02:10:00.710]
shocking oh my god oh my god well Jordan was tell me before the show today we were

[02:10:00.710 --> 02:10:03.750]
commiserating about his disaster yesterday that had to come in on the labor

[02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:04.290]
program

[02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:06.590]
they've been a

[02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:07.070]
system

[02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:08.470]
for

[02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:10.290]
the

[02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:14.190]
case in your own qm

[02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:18.270]
you don't have any national guards there because they're all fighting a war in

[02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:20.090]
Iraq right now that's a national guard

[02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:25.310]
not the national guard no national guard in Iraq that there's no national

[02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:29.810]
guard no no that's a single dumbest thing George Bush doesn't care about black

[02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:30.170]
people

[02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:35.950]
oh if anybody has a

[02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:36.770]
opinion

[02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:40.210]
dissenting from our way

[02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:44.950]
we'll pay your name into the system

[02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:47.610]
and tell me how to stay

[02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:50.850]
don't even start to

[02:10:50.850 --> 02:10:51.150]
go

[02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:51.830]
and

[02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:54.730]
everybody

[02:10:56.710 --> 02:10:56.730]
everybody

[02:10:57.630 --> 02:10:58.310]
everybody

[02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.610]
finding

[02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:01.010]
ashes

[02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:02.590]
USA

[02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:06.090]
in the act of history

[02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:08.110]
in them

[02:11:08.110 --> 02:11:10.110]
it was in all of you

[02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:13.750]
everyone does a

[02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:14.150]
speak

[02:11:14.730 --> 02:11:16.390]
so what

[02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:18.810]
you do

[02:11:18.810 --> 02:11:20.190]
this

[02:11:20.190 --> 02:11:20.870]
is

[02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:22.530]
and

[02:11:22.530 --> 02:11:24.430]
all you might

[02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:25.070]
lose

[02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:27.470]
in

[02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.910]
this

[02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:29.950]
USA

[02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:36.210]
they're gonna hate those

[02:11:36.210 --> 02:11:36.650]
you

[02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:38.770]
and

[02:11:38.770 --> 02:11:39.030]
you

[02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:44.030]
believe everything we

[02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.350]
say

[02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:47.090]
and the state

[02:11:47.090 --> 02:11:47.930]
run you

[02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.890]
blood war

[02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:18.950]
gold

[02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:31.910]
All the water is pristine, the past is arisen with everybody turning five years, like

[02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:33.270]
SQS say.

[02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:36.110]
It was about 45, man.

[02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:37.730]
We got all kinds of technical stuff going on.

[02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:38.250]
You want to know why?

[02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:39.830]
Because it's the aftermath of the holidays.

[02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:44.950]
We've finally, I mean, this isn't like, is this not not on the calendar, but I'm talking

[02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:47.030]
about the end of summer kind of like, this is it, right?

[02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:47.570]
This is it.

[02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.950]
It's done.

[02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:48.370]
It's over.

[02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:53.470]
No more holidays, no more Fourth of July, no more Labor Day, no more these silly ass holidays,

[02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:56.950]
no more, I think we got SQS here, but after that, and Halloween.

[02:12:58.710 --> 02:13:00.290]
After those, it's all over.

[02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:03.750]
And we get to put our nose to the grind, so we get down to Sirius Binis, right?

[02:13:04.190 --> 02:13:05.030]
Yeah, there's something.

[02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:06.050]
Something like that.

[02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:09.050]
But in the meantime, we're just like trying to get our equipment all greased up.

[02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:11.290]
And ready to go again.

[02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.670]
Grease.

[02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:13.050]
Oh.

[02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:17.990]
Ed Naha, the worst president ever, last Sunday a category five hurricane named Katrina

[02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:20.310]
was ending for New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.

[02:13:20.710 --> 02:13:24.470]
George Bush, on vacation, mentioned it in passing many talk about Iraq while still hiding

[02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:25.310]
from Sidi Shien.

[02:13:26.050 --> 02:13:29.550]
Last Monday, Katrina, now a category four hurricane, slammed into the Gulf Coast, destroying

[02:13:29.550 --> 02:13:33.510]
90,000 square miles, causing hundreds of thousands of Americans to become homeless and

[02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:34.650]
probably killing thousands.

[02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:39.170]
George was in Arizona in California talking up his adult Medicaid prescription program

[02:13:39.170 --> 02:13:40.750]
before invite only crowds.

[02:13:41.410 --> 02:13:45.630]
Tuesday, thousands were stranded down south, 80% of the big easy was underwater.

[02:13:46.050 --> 02:13:47.210]
Bodies were floating everywhere.

[02:13:47.590 --> 02:13:50.730]
George was in California comparing Iraq to WW2, the big one.

[02:13:51.110 --> 02:13:52.230]
You go there, G.I.

[02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:54.350]
George, the human definition of the word, disconnect.

[02:13:55.410 --> 02:14:00.490]
As the catastrophe simmered in the Gulf like bad gumbo, Bush woke up eventually to reality,

[02:14:00.710 --> 02:14:04.290]
as much as he can ever wake up and recognize his own unique take on reality, headline,

[02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.910]
President cut vacation short to return to Washington.

[02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:11.950]
Bush cut his vacation short by two days as thousands of citizens down south water to

[02:14:11.950 --> 02:14:15.950]
slam around in the swattering heat with no food, no water, no homes, no way to get out,

[02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:16.630]
what a guy.

[02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:21.110]
This man has to be the biggest mistake everybody had elected questioned Mark in the history

[02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:21.610]
of America.

[02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:26.770]
By Wednesday and Thursday, Bush was acting very presidential, which by his grievances resembled

[02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:28.150]
a bad bout a constipation.

[02:14:28.610 --> 02:14:32.670]
He flew over the disaster area to accompany 5,000 feet being photographed, frowning and

[02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:35.550]
concerned, gazing at the windows he saw, not a lot.

[02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:39.090]
And was going to actually show up by weekend at the scene, sort of.

[02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:43.330]
New Orleans was considered too dangerous still so we opted for mobile and galaxy with a

[02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:44.470]
New Orleans aerial tour.

[02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:49.250]
Aside from the fact that unlike a terrorist attack, the surveillance predicts four days

[02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:50.090]
before it struck.

[02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:54.170]
Aside from the fact that the surveillance is proven that Homeland Security is a totally

[02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:58.770]
ineffective monolith of an agency's staff through cronism, aside from the fact that most

[02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:03.710]
of this was seen coming for a long time, W explained that the Libby-Breakton New Orleans

[02:15:03.710 --> 02:15:05.150]
took everyone by surprise.

[02:15:05.690 --> 02:15:08.070]
And he expressed us to buy that, want to buy some WMD?

[02:15:08.710 --> 02:15:12.410]
The saddest part of all this, New Orleans didn't have to go out like that in sorrow and

[02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:13.110]
horror and energy.

[02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:16.150]
The reason it did Bush's hard on for Iraq.

[02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:17.310]
It's a news story.

[02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:21.470]
Under Bush, under Bush, it is.

[02:15:21.850 --> 02:15:25.870]
Under Bush's leadership, federal flood control spending for southeastern Louisiana has

[02:15:25.870 --> 02:15:31.390]
been cut from $69, $69 million in 2001 to $36,500 in 2005.

[02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:35.650]
Federal Hurricane protection for the Lake Pogs-Itrain-Vacentity Army Corps of Engineer

[02:15:35.650 --> 02:15:41.370]
Budget sank from 14.25 million in 2002 to 5.7 million this year.

[02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:45.010]
Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrup pleaded for 27 million.

[02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:46.830]
No deal, Iraq was more important.

[02:15:47.570 --> 02:15:52.730]
According to Louisiana's Times Picky, and from 2004 to 2005, Iraq was specifically

[02:15:52.730 --> 02:15:55.570]
cited as the reason for lack of hurricane and plug control dollars.

[02:15:55.930 --> 02:16:00.010]
In early 2004, the cost of the complex in Iraq soared, Bush proposed spending less than

[02:16:00.010 --> 02:16:03.650]
20% of what the Army Corps of Engineers said was needed from Lake Pogs-Itrain-Vacentity

[02:16:03.650 --> 02:16:07.230]
Corps to weigh February 16th, 2000 for Article in New Orleans City Business.

[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:13.070]
Bush then cut 71.2 million from the budget of the New Orleans Corps of Engineers of 44%

[02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:13.490]
reduction.

[02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:17.550]
As was reported in New Orleans City Business at the time that met a major hurricane

[02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:21.590]
and flood projects will not be awarded local engineering firms, also a study to determine

[02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:24.670]
ways to protect the region from a category 5 hurricane has been shelved for now.

[02:16:25.130 --> 02:16:25.290]
Oops!

[02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:30.190]
On June 8th, here we go again, Walter Mays, the emergency management chief for Jefferson

[02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:33.990]
Paris, Louisiana, until the Times Picky, it appears that the money has been moved in

[02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:37.370]
the President's budget to handle Homeland Security and the war in Iraq, and I suppose

[02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:38.450]
that's the price we pay.

[02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:42.390]
Nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished and that we're doing everything

[02:16:42.390 --> 02:16:44.990]
we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us.

[02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:49.190]
A news house news service article published last Tuesday night observed the Louisiana

[02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:53.450]
Congressional delegation urged Congress earlier this year to dedicate a stream of federal

[02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:56.270]
money to Louisiana's coast only to be opposed by the White House.

[02:16:56.790 --> 02:17:01.010]
In its budget, the Bush administration proposed a significant reduction in funding for Southeast

[02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:06.270]
Louisiana's Keep Hurricane Protection Project, which proposed 10.4 million, a sixth of what

[02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:07.410]
local officials say they need.

[02:17:08.470 --> 02:17:11.870]
Local officials are now saying the article reported that had Washington heated their warnings

[02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:15.730]
about the dire need for hurricane protection, including building up levees and repairing

[02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:19.350]
barrier islands, the damage might not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be.

[02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:24.190]
Hard-hit Mississippi Governor Haley Barber, who's been tearful understandably so on the

[02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:27.970]
airwaves, hasn't really mentioned his anti-global warming stance where it's supported Bush in

[02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:31.550]
slashing a theme of funds or the fact that he backed Bush in sending an endless supply

[02:17:31.550 --> 02:17:33.910]
of national guard troops in important equipment to Iraq.

[02:17:34.550 --> 02:17:39.510]
Over a third of Louisiana's troops are in Iraq, over 40% of Mississippi's troops are in Iraq.

[02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.370]
Mo.

[02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:45.270]
Bush for his part has been appropriately slow, wouldn't even more flat foot in his reaction

[02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.890]
to this tragedy.

[02:17:46.350 --> 02:17:49.770]
Sunday, as Katrina was about to savage the Gulf Coast, here's our breakfast leader.

[02:17:51.090 --> 02:17:53.970]
Hurricane Katrina has now designated the Category 5 Hurricane.

[02:17:54.090 --> 02:17:57.370]
We cannot stress it up in danger of the hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities.

[02:17:57.550 --> 02:18:00.030]
Our citizens are all citizens to put their own safety in the safety of their families

[02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:01.570]
first by moving to safe ground.

[02:18:01.770 --> 02:18:04.750]
Please listen carefully to instructions provided by state and local officials.

[02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:09.150]
On another matter, today Iraqi political leaders completed a process for drafting a permanent

[02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.870]
constitution.

[02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:13.350]
There were examples of an inspiration to all who shared the universal values of freedom,

[02:18:13.350 --> 02:18:14.570]
democracy and the rule of law.

[02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:18.490]
The negotiators and directors of this document braved the intimidation of terrorists and

[02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.850]
they mourned the cowardly assassination of friends and colleagues involved in the process

[02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:23.130]
of drafting the constitution.

[02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:26.130]
Thank you for your heartfelt concern, George.

[02:18:26.910 --> 02:18:31.250]
Tuesday, as the war lines in the Gulf Coast was deemed destroyed, as we deliver relief

[02:18:31.250 --> 02:18:34.570]
for our citizens to the south, our troops are defending all our citizens from threats

[02:18:34.570 --> 02:18:37.810]
abroad, and the war on terror all of you gathered here today are playing a critical

[02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:38.130]
role.

[02:18:38.770 --> 02:18:41.110]
Let's get aboard that WWII train full speed.

[02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:46.310]
60 years ago this Friday, General Douglas MacArthur accepted the Japanese surrender aboard

[02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:50.790]
the USS Missouri and Tokyo Bay, which Japan surrendered the last of our enemies in WWII

[02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:54.990]
as defeated and a world war began, that began for America and the Pacific came to an end

[02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.530]
in the Pacific.

[02:18:56.010 --> 02:19:00.270]
As we mark this anniversary again for our nation and war, once again war came to our shores

[02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:02.770]
where they surprised the tech, they killed thousands in cold blood.

[02:19:03.170 --> 02:19:07.310]
Once again we face determined enemies who follow a ruthless ideology that despises everything

[02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:08.330]
America stands for.

[02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:12.570]
Once again America and our allies are wedging a global campaign with floors as deployed

[02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:16.170]
on virtually every continent, and once again we won't rest until victory is America's

[02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:16.910]
and our freedom is secure.

[02:19:18.390 --> 02:19:21.910]
Our goal is clear as well, will defeat the terrorists, will build a free Iraq that will

[02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:23.790]
fight terrorists instead of giving them aid in sanctuary.

[02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:27.390]
A free Iraq will offer people throughout the Middle East, a hopeful alternative to the

[02:19:27.390 --> 02:19:29.190]
hateful ideology being peddled by the terrorists.

[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:32.770]
A free Iraq will show that when America gives its word, America keeps its word.

[02:19:33.810 --> 02:19:36.690]
And bear in mind people in America were actually drowning during this speech.

[02:19:36.690 --> 02:19:40.650]
People were dying of dehydration in lack of medical care, no one knew what to do, phone

[02:19:40.650 --> 02:19:44.370]
lines were down, no one's stress was given, buildings were crumbling, hundreds of thousands

[02:19:44.370 --> 02:19:47.610]
of people were being forced out of their homes forever, countless homes were being obliterated

[02:19:47.610 --> 02:19:48.890]
as a hit by an atomic bomb.

[02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:53.450]
These facts didn't register with him until probably one of his advisors put them out

[02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:55.850]
via a well placed two by four to the back of his thick skull.

[02:19:57.910 --> 02:20:00.870]
Hurricane Katrina may prove to be the biggest disaster in American history.

[02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:04.510]
It took place on Bush's watch, eventually by Wednesday George Snack 2.

[02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:09.630]
He forgot WW2, he forgot Iraq for a minute, he considered the dead Americans present tense,

[02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:13.630]
human flots and floating in the murky flood waters of Katrina, he played present and declared,

[02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:15.570]
America will be strong or for it.

[02:20:16.170 --> 02:20:16.570]
Yuck!

[02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:20.250]
At this point some heavy criticism started heading his way.

[02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:22.390]
Why was there such a lack of rapid response?

[02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:26.710]
Why was the coast start almost single handedly tackling the situation along with brave underfunded

[02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:28.170]
local first responders?

[02:20:28.570 --> 02:20:31.190]
Why was FEMA folded into Homeland Security in Hamstrung?

[02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:33.110]
Where exactly was Homeland Security?

[02:20:33.550 --> 02:20:37.290]
Why was our rapid emergency response resembling a Ringling Brothers Crown Card Skip?

[02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:39.030]
His response?

[02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:42.790]
He paraded out of his father and Bill Clinton in toning, in the days they had the former

[02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:46.150]
President of the African Americans to open their hearts and their wallets to help those in need,

[02:20:46.430 --> 02:20:50.030]
because this country is bankrupt thanks to the Iraq plus tax cut combo.

[02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:54.110]
Later, after talking with this cabinet lots of pasty faced Republicans,

[02:20:54.490 --> 02:20:56.550]
he touched on the humanity of the situation stating,

[02:20:56.550 --> 02:21:00.310]
we particularly spent a lot of time talking about the damage done to our infrastructure,

[02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:04.090]
our energy infrastructure, and its effect on the availability and price of gasoline.

[02:21:05.370 --> 02:21:09.350]
In our judgment, we view this storm as a temporary disruption that's being addressed by the

[02:21:09.350 --> 02:21:10.690]
government and by the private sector.

[02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:13.050]
Still later, we again touched upon the human loss.

[02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:18.090]
A lot of crude production has been shut down because of this storm,

[02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:21.310]
and it's structured secretary of parliament to work with the definers, people who need crude oil,

[02:21:21.310 --> 02:21:22.810]
who will leave you in any shortage through loans.

[02:21:22.810 --> 02:21:27.250]
The EPA has granted nationwide waiver for fuel funds to make more gasoline and diesel fuel

[02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:28.350]
available throughout the country.

[02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:32.930]
This will help take some pressure off of gas prices, but our citizens must understand this storm

[02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:36.090]
is disrupted the capacity to make gasoline and distribute gasoline.

[02:21:36.470 --> 02:21:41.010]
All the humanity, the humanity, and of course the oil companies have jacked up their prices of

[02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:42.370]
gas merely to make a bigger profit.

[02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:46.030]
And of course, we'll all have to pay at the pump, and of course the EPA's relaxation of

[02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:52.550]
emission standards will heat up the atmosphere, and hence the oceans even further talk about a

[02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:55.450]
storm before the cameras and how to state a course in terms of rebuilding.

[02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:59.810]
He could roll back his tax cuts to give the economy a boost and not to have to request low

[02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:02.890]
wage earners to reach in their pockets across the country to pay for the hurricane mess,

[02:22:03.210 --> 02:22:04.570]
but that would be unthinkable.

[02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:08.930]
So as hundreds of thousands of people are stranded and are being shutled out to different states to

[02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:13.190]
live in the equivalent of Newville Hoover Reels, as the bodies pile up as America's are all told

[02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:17.270]
they give all they can give, the president appears on the tube and tells us, just hang in there.

[02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:20.330]
Woohoo! Go team in a photo-op in Mobile on Friday,

[02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:25.230]
Bush basically folded in, confronted by chaos, he returned to his Bible of brain bromides,

[02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.070]
saying that everything was going to be just fine.

[02:22:27.490 --> 02:22:30.790]
We should love our neighbors the way we want to be loved ourselves, and he talked about compassion.

[02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:35.190]
By speeches and he seemed to be on the verge of breaking out into the song come out tomorrow

[02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:40.670]
from the Broadway musical Annie. He later hit Mrs. Sippy, hugging a lot, and flew over New Orleans,

[02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:43.230]
finally taking to the podium at the We Arms Throw Airport in declaring,

[02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:45.310]
and may God continue to bless this country.

[02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:48.670]
If this is a blessing, what exactly would you consider a curse?

[02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:52.950]
At a certain point he was asked by a reporter, one of the things you hear is people saying a

[02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:56.750]
lot of resources are being devoted to Iraq. Now this country needs them, and they're frustrated

[02:22:56.750 --> 02:23:00.350]
about that. What do you say to the people who say there's too much money being spent on a

[02:23:00.350 --> 02:23:04.410]
wreck and it's time to bring them home? The president responded, I just completely disagree.

[02:23:04.930 --> 02:23:07.910]
We've got a job to defend this country and the war on terror, and we've got a job to bring

[02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:11.570]
even comfort to the people of the Gulf Coast, and we'll do both. We've got plenty of resources to do

[02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:17.470]
both. Tell that to the dead people, George, to the dying. When asked how we plan to rebuild

[02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:21.070]
New Orleans, the president ventured, my thoughts are we're going to get somebody who knows what

[02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:26.210]
they're talking about when it comes to rebuilding cities. I'm going to delegate, and as he's done for

[02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:31.870]
four and a half years and that's panned out so well. And our president came up with the perfect way

[02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:35.690]
to stop the violence in New Orleans. We have to get the people food, he declared, ironically,

[02:23:35.890 --> 02:23:39.770]
if RNA exists anymore, the food magically showed up when George is a dainty visit the disaster

[02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:44.670]
or four or five days after the hurricane hit by comparison after the massive tsunami last year

[02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:48.730]
there were food drops within 48 hours. Oh, if you want to see violence, George, wait until these

[02:23:48.730 --> 02:23:52.870]
storms victims try to file for bankruptcy after October 17th and find that thanks to you new

[02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:57.070]
bankruptcy law, they're pretty much screwed. Some other politicians have started weighing in,

[02:23:57.150 --> 02:24:01.250]
their jaws hanging at ankle level. It's impossible to defend something like this happening in

[02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:05.370]
America, said former Husky, her new gngww, no one could be happy with this kind of response that we

[02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:09.230]
seen in New Orleans, the Republican governor Mitt Romney, Massachusetts, and two key U.S.

[02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:13.550]
senators said on Friday they'll open bipartisan investigation into what they described as an immense

[02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:18.230]
failure with the government response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. I think I'll take the

[02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:22.710]
break and then I'll finish this. It's a little bit long, but you know what, too bad, that 1257, a QAM.

[02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:31.390]
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62 AF. I love baseball season.

[02:24:31.390 --> 02:24:34.470]
Ours are the marlins. Come on. I'm talking to big leagues.

[02:24:42.330 --> 02:24:54.970]
Hi, this is Governor Donald Trotson. There'll be another California report. This week I want to

[02:24:54.970 --> 02:25:00.230]
talk to you about sex crimes. I may be governor, but I am a convicted sex offender.

[02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:07.010]
Really this week I joined with sexual predators, teaching them how to victimize innocent Californians

[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:13.050]
and the use of the internet to lure children into sex crimes. I'm sparring this legislation

[02:25:13.050 --> 02:25:18.370]
to give Californians some of the worst criminals and he will provide greater crimes.

[02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:24.170]
This legislation would expand and strengthen predators out there. I'm tipping the scale of

[02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:30.190]
justice in favor of the violators, not the victims, period. Thank you very much for listening.

[02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:36.150]
New Orleans thought it had been spared the worst and then two major levees broke and slowly the city

[02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:42.070]
filled with water. The city that fits below sea level is now under sea. Officials estimated 80%

[02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:46.390]
of New Orleans is now under water. The governor has been asking for everybody to say a prayer.

[02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:49.630]
I think we can probably do that for our friends and I love one that's it.

[02:25:55.410 --> 02:26:06.450]
This don't you know me. I'm the mid-and-side. I'm a train in the city of New Orleans.

[02:26:08.310 --> 02:26:15.110]
I'll be gone by morning clouds when the beans come. Last night we began this broadcast saying

[02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:21.570]
Katrina was bad. Very bad. Last night we didn't know the half of it. We are still learning just how bad.

[02:26:22.130 --> 02:26:28.630]
What I saw today is equivalent to what I saw flying over the tsunami in Indonesia.

[02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:31.590]
There are places that are no longer there.

[02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:40.410]
I mean everything is just flooded. Everything. The whole city there right there is people being

[02:26:40.410 --> 02:26:43.970]
evacuated. We're hearing lots of stories of folks lending aid to one another.

[02:26:44.050 --> 02:26:49.150]
Public countries and rescue teams lifting people one by one hundreds and hundreds in all from Ruta.

[02:26:49.150 --> 02:26:52.010]
So we're hearing lots of stories like that of people assisting one another.

[02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:55.770]
Dispray for them and for not just seeing all the people down there.

[02:26:55.890 --> 02:26:57.430]
You know they're picking out the pieces.

[02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:21.350]
The city of New Orleans.

[02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:30.930]
Tonight I ask for your prayers for all those who agreed.

[02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:34.550]
Hurricane Katrina has brought out some of mankind's very best.

[02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:39.330]
I ask the American people to join me in standing a prayer for the victims and their families.

[02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.430]
God bless.

[02:27:41.390 --> 02:27:45.730]
Yeah God bless my ass okay. I won't hurt for you while Bushmaster as this sweet say

[02:27:45.730 --> 02:27:46.450]
Casa Royce.

[02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:50.490]
Anyway getting back to this column here the worst president ever by Ed Naha.

[02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:56.830]
Senator Susan Collins, a main Republican who heads the Senate Government of First Committee

[02:27:56.830 --> 02:28:00.250]
and Senator Julie Burman of Connecticut, the panel stopped Democrats. They plan to begin

[02:28:00.250 --> 02:28:02.030]
oversight investigation this week.

[02:28:02.730 --> 02:28:06.990]
We intended to demand answers as to how this immense failure occurred but our immediate focus

[02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:10.610]
must and will be on what Congress can do to help rescue and emergency operations that are

[02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:14.310]
ongoing. The Senator said in a joint statement they were smoking one.

[02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:18.430]
It is also our responsibility to investigate the lack of preparedness and an adequate response

[02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:22.650]
to this terrible storm they said. Ed in that it was increasingly clear that serious shortcomings

[02:28:22.650 --> 02:28:28.250]
in preparedness and responsive hampered relief efforts at a critical time. No kidding no shmit.

[02:28:28.650 --> 02:28:31.270]
Does that profound or what? Deeply.

[02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:35.330]
By the time of their announcement George was in the air waving bye bye to the dead to dying in

[02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:40.090]
the displaced and the city of New Orleans. So what can we say about this president the golden boy?

[02:28:40.890 --> 02:28:45.890]
He's crippled the economy. He's decimated our education system. He's given billions to the

[02:28:45.890 --> 02:28:50.650]
rich in terms of tax cuts. He's given billions to Halibut and via nobid contracts in both Iraq

[02:28:50.650 --> 02:28:55.690]
and Afghanistan and now of course in the Gulf, our Gulf. He's a resurrected environmental laws.

[02:28:56.070 --> 02:29:00.170]
He's allowed the biggest terrorist attack on US soil and history. He's lost any legal,

[02:29:00.350 --> 02:29:04.710]
illogical invasion of the country that wasn't a threat to America using bogus intelligence claims

[02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:09.230]
costing the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people. He's received a billion dollar

[02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:13.610]
boondoggle of a Star Wars missile defense system that doesn't work. He's racked up record

[02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:17.970]
deficits while preaching financial conservatism. He's created the biggest government bureaucracy

[02:29:17.970 --> 02:29:23.350]
in history. He stifled the Senate pre-speech. He's isolated himself from real people as what a

[02:29:23.350 --> 02:29:28.490]
monarch. His minions have castrated FEMA a once effective agency not only folding it in a

[02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:32.870]
homeland security but appointing leaders who have no experience in disaster relief but were big

[02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:37.630]
bush campaign contributors. And while he's ignored and denied the science that points to intense

[02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:41.890]
climate change because of global warming we've been hit by record hurricane seasons.

[02:29:42.250 --> 02:29:46.490]
God doesn't even seem to like bushes America anymore so maybe God is one of us after all.

[02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:50.850]
I hope God gets into saving lives in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast pronto because apparently

[02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:58.370]
the Bush administration can. I think that was worth reading the whole thing. Yeah, it was. I

[02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:03.670]
liked it. Well good. Because that's the reason I released the RISID just to please you and if

[02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:07.070]
you like him then what's not to like? Well, there you go. What's that? He's got to like him.

[02:30:07.810 --> 02:30:11.310]
I know what's his name Miguel. He sure see what's his name. He don't like him. No.

[02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:16.390]
He's too busy dodging what's your name in the hallway? That's right. Whatever happened to

[02:30:16.390 --> 02:30:20.390]
her. Now see one thing about QA. Nobody ever gets canned. They just disappear or they get

[02:30:20.390 --> 02:30:25.350]
suspended and then they don't come back. What was her name? Doreen. Oh yeah. How could I forget

[02:30:25.350 --> 02:30:32.170]
Doreen the Chubby Queen? Huh? She got canned. Yeah, but did they announce it? I don't know.

[02:30:32.170 --> 02:30:37.250]
No, they never announced it. It's like a memo comes out. And then they just come back again.

[02:30:37.390 --> 02:30:41.830]
You know more like what I am saying. So there was a memo saying that she was poisoned not

[02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:46.350]
allowed in the building if you see her on the grounds called the cops. Really? Yeah. Get out of here.

[02:30:47.430 --> 02:30:52.910]
Joyce, you not. I thought that was about fat boy. It didn't help. If you see him near the

[02:30:52.910 --> 02:31:02.150]
a candy closet called a cop called a candy cops, the sugar cops, 724 votes. We're not going to

[02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:06.570]
do that. Because of the pathetic hurricanes that make any difference to me. It couldn't

[02:31:06.570 --> 02:31:11.170]
care less. A number of votes on a poll is a silly bunch of stuff. We got all this crap going on

[02:31:11.170 --> 02:31:15.490]
and the people ought to be mad as you know that poll that you took and there was one choice on

[02:31:15.490 --> 02:31:21.090]
there. I've already schmiddcanted a long time ago, but about who cares? Yeah. And it had like

[02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:24.890]
11 votes or something like that. Maybe they're just being smart, Alex, but I don't think so.

[02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:29.790]
No, I put that on there knowing that there were people. Yeah, I know we got a bunch of idiots

[02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:33.550]
and no matter what's going on, they just don't give a crap. You know, that's the Florida F and

[02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:40.570]
Way. Just indifferent to humans, suffering, just idiotic. It's just, you know, George Bush's America.

[02:31:42.010 --> 02:31:46.750]
Because the pathetic hurricane response, who most urgently needs to resign or be fired into

[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:54.050]
did it? George W. Bush 216. He's leading. He's got almost 30% of the votes. Top third man. 724.

[02:31:54.690 --> 02:32:00.010]
We got a shot of 750, 730. All of the above now, Pronto, Subaru, immediately have now

[02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:07.870]
sooner 210. The head of FEMA downtown Mickey Brown 158, an idiot, an imbecile. The head of

[02:32:07.870 --> 02:32:13.110]
Homeland Security, Michael Chardau, Churdov 46, who evidently don't get near a TV set.

[02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:20.710]
Governor Luziana, that's Kathleen Blanco, 41. Mayor of New Orleans, Ray, I'm screaming and

[02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:26.510]
swearing in the Nagan 34. Nobody, they all did fine. 17. Oh yeah, let's just play that

[02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:29.370]
the whole night for the hour. Okay, let's just lift it up a little bit.

[02:32:34.530 --> 02:32:39.890]
They all did just fine. Everything's great. Wolf, let's read God two votes and Lou Dobbs didn't get any.

[02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:44.350]
It's gonna have wasted my vote on Bush. I shouldn't have wondered for Lou Dobbs.

[02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:49.630]
Up until, I mean, not that I ever liked him, but up until now, I mean, you know, he was just there,

[02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:54.370]
which were nearly I watched the local news on CTV at six o'clock every day like clockwork.

[02:32:54.470 --> 02:32:58.190]
But once in a while, I'll zip over there for a minute and see what kind of screaming about

[02:32:58.190 --> 02:33:02.630]
illegal aliens again, what kind of history he's with him. He is a fascist man. He is a,

[02:33:02.770 --> 02:33:05.910]
and in all this business about how could anybody bring race into this, you know?

[02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:11.930]
Who are you, kiddin', huh? I could never stand him. I think I think a bunch of Mexicans and really

[02:33:11.930 --> 02:33:16.070]
dark-skinned African Americans ought to take over wherever he's living, okay? I thought I'm moving

[02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:22.190]
right next door and take over his compound. Not a good idea? Sure, compound W. Yeah,

[02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:28.050]
giving him a compound fracture of his anus. Here's a fact from a will who says, very chronically,

[02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:31.050]
I have a lot of chronic factions out there, and that's because I'm not taking too many calls today,

[02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:35.690]
so they have to fax it in, right? Right. We had a couple of calls that were worthwhile, I'm under two,

[02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:41.630]
not. It says, hello, sirs, the socks pitcher, oh, Bill Lee, that's right, thank you very much.

[02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:49.650]
Space man, remember Bill Lee? No. The red socks, Bill Lee, the Space Man. Anyway,

[02:33:50.370 --> 02:33:54.170]
sometimes Josh makes even Miguel look like a PhD, and that's a little shot there, okay?

[02:33:55.250 --> 02:34:00.830]
It says, the board ops, like Frito, Carlos the sleeper seemed pretty smart, at least computer savvy,

[02:34:01.050 --> 02:34:07.030]
but I guess he couldn't stick on his feet. No, he was usually going head over ass. Yeah,

[02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:13.610]
head, head, head. Some personal problems, let's put it that way, okay? I don't want to get too

[02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:20.550]
deeply into it, but he had some issues. Oh, and then it's got a bunch of powerful pictures,

[02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:25.070]
I don't care about that. Get out of here. Well, he's usually pretty good. He sent me a stuff

[02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:30.150]
about pictures. That's your fault, Josh. You started that crap. Maybe I did it with

[02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:34.970]
goose hostage, I guess. Sorry. Cliff says, thanks for your truthful ranting. Well, you're welcome,

[02:34:34.970 --> 02:34:37.710]
Cliff, no extra charge. I'll be getting a sore throat. It's good thing I don't work

[02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:41.950]
until Thursday. Hope I don't hit any big jackpots that would buy tomorrow. I won't be able to scream

[02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:47.070]
and shout. If only those poor people of New Orleans would have put down the water and food,

[02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:52.470]
and taken tubes, tube, and attached them to their stomachs, they got rid of a souped right

[02:34:52.470 --> 02:34:58.550]
end. Good point. It says, Bush would have parachuted right in the middle, outfitted all. Yeah,

[02:34:58.550 --> 02:35:01.890]
but I think you got the wrong bush. Our fat ass governor, it's pretty close by. He'd gone over

[02:35:01.890 --> 02:35:06.870]
there from Tallahassee over there. He could zip right on over by chopper. And Gunner, he could

[02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:11.530]
personally attach to everybody's personal tube. He has those looters weren't all black. There were

[02:35:11.530 --> 02:35:16.310]
white people. They were just muddy. I see. Convelees is waiting for the drug test results before

[02:35:16.310 --> 02:35:21.350]
accepting applications. Bitch, bitch. He called her a bitch. How do you like that? Convelees,

[02:35:21.350 --> 02:35:26.830]
a nice going there, Cliff. Well, I think you're her, I think. You bitch. You splat you more.

[02:35:26.970 --> 02:35:30.230]
Right. That's the kindest thing I can say about her. She's sitting there yuckin' enough to

[02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:35.190]
get out of the money python and then shopping for shoes in New York. Watch, she's on vacation.

[02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:42.310]
Well, people, her people are drowning, you know? God, do I hate that bitch? I've got a story that

[02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:46.650]
you're going to like about Israeli soldiers killing innocent Palestinians. How would I like that?

[02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:51.410]
Because you like the truth about what's going on over there. You think I'm going to say that

[02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:56.090]
you're anti-Semitic? That's what I thought. From the Guardian, Israeli soldiers tell of

[02:35:56.090 --> 02:36:00.170]
indiscriminate killings by army and a culture of impunity. Whistleblower's testimony shows

[02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:03.530]
this high-fever revenge on the Palestinians. I'm not going to rename it more. It's long,

[02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:07.790]
but it's not our website for tomorrow. Because I don't want to give in to all these long things.

[02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:11.330]
I want to take at least two, three hundred calls before we get done here. Are we going to make

[02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:17.290]
800 votes or what on a pool? That's 749. It's a challenge. It's something to do, you know? We could

[02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:21.190]
have made 1,500 to people really cared. No, we got no more nude pictures on there. No mo.

[02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:25.590]
So we don't get the kind of spastic response we used to get. Oh, gee, take a look at that.

[02:36:25.890 --> 02:36:32.050]
You know, like that. You know? So who now cares about this crap that we're talking about?

[02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:36.010]
What is that state in the show in the air? With the spikes and certain problems that you're seeing.

[02:36:36.010 --> 02:36:40.970]
In addition to what you're concerned about, and you've talked about typhoid, cholera, asthma,

[02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:45.430]
attacks, fever, rashes, even the concern of the society. Are you looking to see an end?

[02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:50.690]
All of those issues are very real. After large scale disaster. What the hell was that state?

[02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:54.510]
And they were shown. Sure, it's how it wasn't the super dome. It's the New Orleans, because there's

[02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:59.690]
how do I know what it was? It was standard. Well, we're going to be a lot of disease, a lot of

[02:36:59.690 --> 02:37:07.750]
E. coli and a lot of dysentery. All of these things. Listen to that. But I think that the network

[02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:12.030]
should continue showing us those real close-ups of those water that the water that they're pumping out

[02:37:12.030 --> 02:37:16.970]
of the city. All that brown water kind of makes you feel like you're back in Amsterdam again.

[02:37:16.970 --> 02:37:22.310]
Some of us, you know, maybe it's cocoa. When you look in the canals, that really, really dark brown

[02:37:22.770 --> 02:37:27.570]
water. What a matter of time. Dirty water by the sandals. Yeah, what a hear. Let's play it.

[02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:32.810]
Let's play a little dirty water by nothing. Bad taste, man. God, you ever taste that stuff?

[02:37:34.450 --> 02:37:39.050]
113 is fine. What kind of do the spot? Please. I feel like today there's just, I don't know,

[02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:46.030]
there's just something in the air. And don't play that. Don't play that. Here's your last chance to

[02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:22.930]
the

[02:39:22.930 --> 02:39:22.930]

[02:39:22.930 --> 02:39:27.490]
welcome back to the

[02:39:31.050 --> 02:39:34.770]
I'll, Frank, show, of course.

[02:39:35.490 --> 02:39:41.030]
A joining me in the studio today is a very, very special guest.

[02:39:42.170 --> 02:39:50.410]
The Diabolical and infamous pill-popper run through the hall, just for this occasion,

[02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:57.470]
we had a bound again, a win for the more effective young adults.

[02:39:57.490 --> 02:40:02.210]
This way, I won't get any neoconcuties on my hand.

[02:40:02.410 --> 02:40:03.390]
That is not right, Ross.

[02:40:03.810 --> 02:40:08.050]
You are like that, Mr. High Moral Prounder.

[02:40:08.930 --> 02:40:11.590]
This is for wife number one.

[02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:15.450]
Wife number two.

[02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.730]
Wife number two.

[02:40:18.730 --> 02:40:20.270]
Wife number two.

[02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:27.450]
Oh, look, ladies and gentlemen, who's here, and dressed in pumps and rubbers.

[02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:29.950]
I impact the wind lanterns.

[02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.990]
Wee!

[02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:39.930]
When we come back, I will magic, like it right before you are.

[02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:45.150]
Pull a cigarette, a pie, right here.

[02:40:45.730 --> 02:40:46.310]
Turn it around.

[02:40:47.970 --> 02:40:48.630]
It's 180.

[02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:50.950]
It will be smoking too.

[02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:55.430]
Let's see, we got the Mollmys here, the Moraun coming up into a clock,

[02:40:55.430 --> 02:40:57.690]
mad dog at four, Marlon's on decades' history.

[02:40:58.050 --> 02:41:01.410]
Marlon's at the Washington Nats at 705, followed by the indicate show.

[02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:02.950]
Pretty exciting lineup.

[02:41:04.610 --> 02:41:05.550]
774 float on the pole.

[02:41:05.610 --> 02:41:06.810]
We're going to make 800, you know that?

[02:41:07.390 --> 02:41:07.830]
800 or what?

[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:08.670]
You know that?

[02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:09.410]
I know what.

[02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:11.150]
Where you at?

[02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:11.730]
Right now.

[02:41:11.730 --> 02:41:14.490]
Active Brazeman says Bush has a lot to answer for.

[02:41:14.610 --> 02:41:15.710]
Even what's his name?

[02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:18.770]
Even James Bond is not too happy with your president.

[02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.670]
Your president.

[02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:21.170]
Oh, wrong, bro.

[02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.950]
James Bond.

[02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:25.890]
Pierce Brazeman was the only big star on hand as the doble-yle festival American cinema

[02:41:25.890 --> 02:41:27.930]
got off to a quiet start in France over the weekend.

[02:41:28.330 --> 02:41:31.550]
He took advantage of the spotlight to blast Bush administration's handling of the car.

[02:41:31.650 --> 02:41:32.730]
It's caused by Hurricane Katrina.

[02:41:33.390 --> 02:41:38.050]
This man called President Bush has a lot to answer for the former James Bond actor told reporters Saturday.

[02:41:38.530 --> 02:41:40.410]
I don't know if this man is really taking care of America.

[02:41:40.410 --> 02:41:42.850]
This government has been shameful, he said.

[02:41:43.210 --> 02:41:45.970]
And Pierce Brazeman, you are absolutely correct.

[02:41:46.290 --> 02:41:49.410]
He was in the Northern Coastal Resort promoting the Black Comedy, the Manador,

[02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:51.890]
which opened the festival on Friday, the Manador.

[02:41:52.390 --> 02:41:53.150]
Look at that.

[02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.930]
I'll see you then right now.

[02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:54.870]
Oh, there.

[02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:56.350]
Oh, see, they listen to me.

[02:41:56.470 --> 02:41:57.310]
They're showing some real...

[02:41:57.310 --> 02:41:58.250]
Oh, no, look at that.

[02:42:00.130 --> 02:42:00.570]
That's that.

[02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:00.570]

[02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:00.570]

[02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:01.810]
There's that dirty water.

[02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:02.690]
That's the way.

[02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:04.790]
Yeah, that's a pretty ugly story too, man.

[02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:05.290]
Little Lucky.

[02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:07.450]
And I just talked about Terry Lumpy before.

[02:42:08.410 --> 02:42:09.890]
That's the Lumpy's water advocacy.

[02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:14.450]
Maniacs, area view of the 17th Street Canal, levee in the world,

[02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:16.270]
and they're showing that big old...

[02:42:16.270 --> 02:42:18.070]
They're drinking all that water out there.

[02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:19.190]
What about pumping it out?

[02:42:20.370 --> 02:42:22.650]
And they're showing real close-up as close as they can.

[02:42:22.970 --> 02:42:25.450]
You know, you people that can see it in Bearo, you may end in Miami.

[02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:26.670]
I know you're listening to this show.

[02:42:28.030 --> 02:42:29.890]
And you all need to be on death row.

[02:42:30.670 --> 02:42:32.930]
Whether or not you're listening to this show, because you don't get diaries anyway.

[02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:34.710]
And even if you didn't, you lie about it and put down Rush.

[02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:38.470]
You know, they put down Rush just for what's your name there?

[02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:39.350]
His wife, his Mrs.

[02:42:40.310 --> 02:42:41.350]
They're in Kagan.

[02:42:41.350 --> 02:42:41.550]
Oh, wow.

[02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:44.450]
Seriously, that broadness morning.

[02:42:44.610 --> 02:42:46.790]
I always like to read until this morning, until she starts opening up.

[02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:48.310]
I'm just reading the script, okay?

[02:42:48.390 --> 02:42:49.430]
Honey, Carol Costello.

[02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.670]
Bubblehead.

[02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:53.490]
Well, but we know President cares about these people.

[02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:54.830]
He cares about black people.

[02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:55.350]
Oh, it's right.

[02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:57.150]
No question about it.

[02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:59.090]
Especially if they sell out.

[02:42:59.530 --> 02:43:04.050]
The only black people he cares about are people like Alan Keys and Condoleezza and Roland Colin.

[02:43:04.050 --> 02:43:07.130]
People who went and doubt they sell out don't forget Clarez.

[02:43:07.770 --> 02:43:10.390]
Clarence token town is not no poor black people.

[02:43:10.490 --> 02:43:11.810]
He'll give a flying crap about them.

[02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:14.310]
In fact, that's the irony of this whole thing.

[02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:18.790]
The reason that he got in both times, the only reason he got in there were able to fix the elections,

[02:43:19.050 --> 02:43:21.930]
is because they were able to suppress the black vote in so many states.

[02:43:24.450 --> 02:43:25.370]
That's the irony.

[02:43:25.770 --> 02:43:28.870]
That's called adding salt to your womb is what it's called.

[02:43:29.390 --> 02:43:30.070]
It's just unbelievable.

[02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:30.990]
Uh-oh.

[02:43:30.990 --> 02:43:36.850]
Well, city officials found out if confirmed that E. Colin, that's really quite a bulletin in it.

[02:43:36.910 --> 02:43:38.210]
E. Colin, I was found in the flood waters.

[02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:40.490]
I'm thinking that maybe don't drink it's a good idea.

[02:43:42.010 --> 02:43:42.230]
Yeah.

[02:43:43.530 --> 02:43:45.150]
Don't be a hitter stop for that.

[02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:50.710]
Well, I mean, it's just so stupid that they put that a city officials confirm E. Colin, you know.

[02:43:51.810 --> 02:43:53.830]
Idiots, you morons and the immediate there.

[02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:55.110]
Man, you're just crazy people.

[02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:56.190]
That's all your budget rate, robbers.

[02:43:56.330 --> 02:43:58.470]
I hope you can't sleep all night long.

[02:43:59.410 --> 02:44:00.510]
Alone or with somebody.

[02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:01.610]
I just hope you can't sleep.

[02:44:01.810 --> 02:44:04.970]
I hope you're tossing and turning and just have a guilty conscience.

[02:44:04.990 --> 02:44:11.610]
You're working up into a sweat from guilt over sucking up to a bunch of fascists

[02:44:11.610 --> 02:44:15.390]
while your country has been taken over while the elections are being stolen in broad daylight.

[02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:18.510]
And the Democrats, of course, don't even waste your time talking about that.

[02:44:19.770 --> 02:44:24.550]
When that woman called before and told me that our night in shining armor,

[02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:26.870]
Barack Obama was hanging around with Oprah.

[02:44:27.150 --> 02:44:27.310]
Oh.

[02:44:28.930 --> 02:44:30.230]
I'm still gagging on it.

[02:44:30.930 --> 02:44:31.510]
Can you believe that?

[02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:33.430]
Yeah, I believe it.

[02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.650]
Yeah.

[02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:38.870]
They're going around to landhanding and then she must be the one that sent Dr. Phil off there to the Astridome

[02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:41.550]
because asked his middle name.

[02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:43.590]
Return to ultra catastrophe.

[02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:45.350]
Yeah, there he is.

[02:44:45.490 --> 02:44:49.570]
He's got Hermann Gehring, Rumsfeld on one side and Cheney just made a cameo appearance.

[02:44:49.570 --> 02:44:49.990]
Look at that.

[02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:52.310]
What went right and what went wrong?

[02:44:52.450 --> 02:44:53.150]
Yeah, what went right?

[02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:53.670]
What went wrong?

[02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:54.910]
And then we'll tell all those dead people.

[02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.730]
Oh, they can't hear me?

[02:44:56.350 --> 02:44:57.350]
Yeah, let's tell them.

[02:44:57.370 --> 02:45:00.650]
Anyway, from a distance of 70 meters and through the site of his machine gun,

[02:45:01.290 --> 02:45:04.630]
Asaf could tell that the Palestinian man was aged between 20 and 30.

[02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:05.590]
Dr. Dement.

[02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:07.690]
Unarmed and tried to get away from an Israeli tank.

[02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:12.730]
But the details didn't matter much because Asaf's orders were to fire at anything that moved to the dead.

[02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:18.330]
Asaf, a soldier in the Israeli army pressed the trigger firing scores of bullets as the body fell to the ground.

[02:45:19.130 --> 02:45:21.230]
He ran and I started shooting for a few seconds.

[02:45:21.390 --> 02:45:21.710]
He fell.

[02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:22.410]
I was a machine.

[02:45:22.650 --> 02:45:23.050]
I fired.

[02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:23.990]
I leave and that's that.

[02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:25.290]
We never spoke about it afterward.

[02:45:26.250 --> 02:45:34.370]
It was the summer of 2002 and Asaf and his armored unit had been ordered to enter the Gaza town of Dira al-Bala following the firing of mortars in the nearby Jewish settlements.

[02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:35.830]
His orders were he told the Guardian.

[02:45:36.310 --> 02:45:38.970]
Every person you see on the street killed him.

[02:45:39.470 --> 02:45:40.250]
And we would just do it.

[02:45:40.390 --> 02:45:42.550]
Well, isn't that what God said in the Old Testament about your enemies?

[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.830]

[02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:43.510]
Kill them all.

[02:45:44.270 --> 02:45:45.610]
Don't miss a single one.

[02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:45.930]

[02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:45.930]

[02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:51.450]
It wasn't the first time that Asaf had killed an innocent person in Gaza while following orders.

[02:45:51.450 --> 02:45:54.050]
But after his discharge he began to think about things he did.

[02:45:54.490 --> 02:45:57.110]
Oh, he had a discharge, and I remember that was God punishing him with that VD.

[02:45:57.530 --> 02:45:57.930]
Was it oily?

[02:45:58.410 --> 02:45:59.750]
It was an oily bird discharge.

[02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:05.210]
The reason why I'm telling you this is that I want the army to think about what they're asking us to do, shooting unarmed people.

[02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:06.110]
I don't think it's legal.

[02:46:06.250 --> 02:46:07.910]
He said, oh, what a rocket scientist.

[02:46:08.770 --> 02:46:20.450]
Asaf is not alone in recent months, dozens of soldiers, including the son of an Israeli general, all recently discharged, have come forward to share their stories of how they were ordered in briefings to shoot to kill unarmed people without fear of reprimand.

[02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:29.310]
The soldiers were brought into contact with the Guardian and with the assistance of breaking the silence, a pressure group of former soldiers who want the Israeli public to confront the reality of army activities.

[02:46:29.710 --> 02:46:36.710]
The group insisted on anonymity if its witnesses to protect the soldiers from persecution, prosecution, because they basically want to stay alive.

[02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:38.250]
And now what it is?

[02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:40.530]
The rest of the story will be on our website.

[02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:41.130]
I guess tomorrow.

[02:46:42.010 --> 02:46:42.510]
One of these days.

[02:46:43.430 --> 02:46:43.990]
Yeah, late tonight.

[02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:46.390]
Late tonight?

[02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:47.870]
I got the internet. I told you about it.

[02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:49.210]
That's right. You're doing it home now.

[02:46:49.350 --> 02:46:51.210]
How do you like that, folks?

[02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:53.410]
That is outstanding.

[02:46:54.310 --> 02:46:58.350]
I think that when considering everything, all the obstacles we've had, it's been just fine.

[02:46:59.370 --> 02:47:00.210]
Yeah, that's fine.

[02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:06.610]
And I don't know if you ever checked those stats on there, but amazingly enough, even over the holiday weekend, there are a lot of people reading some of them stories.

[02:47:06.910 --> 02:47:07.290]
That's right.

[02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:10.030]
That's right.

[02:47:10.310 --> 02:47:13.570]
I forget I don't have to sell you on the stories. I forgot about that.

[02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:15.530]
That's why they go to the site, those stories.

[02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:18.970]
And on the end of this, let me tip my cat to somebody at the Harold.

[02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:21.590]
I know this comes with a great shock to just about everybody in the universe.

[02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:24.270]
Let me tip my cat to Annie, even though the rest of you guys are like,

[02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:26.210]
oh, you party, poor for you, idiot.

[02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:27.870]
Poop on you, man.

[02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:29.630]
You know what it's about?

[02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:31.290]
I mean, the story was on Saturday.

[02:47:31.930 --> 02:47:35.870]
But of course, since I'm not on, you know, starting next week, by the way, I'll be on every day Monday through Friday.

[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:36.810]
It's bad news for me.

[02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:37.490]
What about Saturday?

[02:47:38.370 --> 02:47:38.690]
No.

[02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:43.630]
She says, this is no time to displace the displaced.

[02:47:44.570 --> 02:47:46.030]
Cancel the stupid game.

[02:47:46.610 --> 02:47:49.750]
Let the hurricanes, the seminals, and their hollow mascots play another day.

[02:47:49.970 --> 02:47:52.570]
And after the cane fans right now say, oh, that would have been a great idea.

[02:47:53.250 --> 02:47:58.770]
After their dismal performance in their lost last night, 10 to 7 on other girls team game.

[02:47:59.290 --> 02:47:59.690]
Pathetic.

[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:03.970]
Oh, and speaking of bad teams, that Ron Zookman, he almost lost to a girls team.

[02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:05.430]
Did you see that on the Saturday, Josh?

[02:48:05.650 --> 02:48:06.650]
Yeah, didn't he win in overtime?

[02:48:06.650 --> 02:48:10.030]
Yeah, Rutgers was kicking Illinois's ass when they had to come from behind.

[02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:11.550]
Ron Zook, don't give him a look.

[02:48:11.730 --> 02:48:12.710]
He is pathetic.

[02:48:13.570 --> 02:48:16.270]
He got run out of fort on a rail.

[02:48:17.410 --> 02:48:20.490]
Anyway, Anne says, I don't care how long the fans have been waiting for the FSU,

[02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:22.010]
might be showing out on Teller Hassy Monday, right?

[02:48:22.290 --> 02:48:24.150]
I don't care about Devon Hester's kick return.

[02:48:24.450 --> 02:48:27.950]
What kind of a country muses itself of choreographed violence while the world burns?

[02:48:28.730 --> 02:48:34.150]
How low-hit will he sunk on the moral scale when hotels in Teller Hassy are kicking out victims from the real hurricane

[02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:36.510]
to make way for a bunch of stupid football fans.

[02:48:36.510 --> 02:48:37.750]
I put the word stupid in there, Anna.

[02:48:38.530 --> 02:48:39.330]
She didn't have to.

[02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:43.210]
New Orleans is burning as people are waiting in lines that stretch for half a mile.

[02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:46.750]
Tens of thousands have lost their, not just their homes, but an entire way of life.

[02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:47.810]
A city is gone.

[02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:50.170]
We're facing one of the biggest displacements in the country's history.

[02:48:50.530 --> 02:48:55.930]
And a few evacuees who managed to find shelter in hotels around Teller Hassy have to pick up and go because of football?

[02:48:57.310 --> 02:49:01.270]
We have to let them know what's going on in town and they're going to have to leave a hotel manager told the hero's

[02:49:01.270 --> 02:49:05.390]
Murray Ellen class, the manager added, many of them are trying to get closer to home anyway.

[02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:08.450]
I guess that would be those who still have a home.

[02:49:09.210 --> 02:49:12.510]
Don't talk to me about the need for escapeous entertainment during a tragedy.

[02:49:12.690 --> 02:49:14.170]
Football is fun to watch, so are movies.

[02:49:14.530 --> 02:49:18.030]
It's also fun to go out to dinner by cool clothes and catch up on Paris open swear about.

[02:49:18.310 --> 02:49:20.410]
But fun is no substitute for moral clarity.

[02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:27.950]
When exactly that our sense of intent on a relentless pursuit of personal amusement trump our basic sense of human decency as Anna?

[02:49:28.450 --> 02:49:35.290]
We become a country neck deep is that red neck deep and entertainment and shadow on ourselves a bullying nation that can't take care of its own people.

[02:49:35.650 --> 02:49:42.770]
This week the Census Bureau announced that 800,000 more workers are without health insurance and additional 1.1 million Americans have fallen below the poverty line.

[02:49:42.990 --> 02:49:43.990]
Where is the outrage?

[02:49:44.530 --> 02:49:49.890]
How much can the rest of the world expect from a country that is full of plans for everybody else's betterment but can't take care of its own?

[02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:52.990]
Don't bother looking for solace from our leadership.

[02:49:52.990 --> 02:49:59.650]
Now when the president is now touring the devastated coast almost a week later he gave a post hurricane speech that had all the profundity of a halftime show.

[02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:04.730]
If America is becoming more and more like football then football should take the first steps to save itself.

[02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:07.290]
Of course no one is going to cancel the game and of course they did not.

[02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:10.390]
All that advertisement is at stake. All that ad money.

[02:50:11.350 --> 02:50:18.830]
So football she do the next best thing and take a principal stand and sure that no evacuees were kicked out hotels period and donate to all the proceeds everything.

[02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:22.730]
Take a sale add salaries to relief efforts. Well the governor gave $20.

[02:50:24.330 --> 02:50:30.070]
I didn't expect into a special when I floated the IDDU and athletic spokesman Mark Prey and I didn't get it.

[02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:32.490]
Are you going to give up your own salary he shot that angrily?

[02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:35.550]
You know Mark Prey?

[02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:35.870]
No.

[02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:37.030]
No.

[02:50:37.710 --> 02:50:42.970]
Facing an onslaught of bad publicity Prey said Friday that both teams have encouraging fans to give up their rooms and stay with friends.

[02:50:42.970 --> 02:50:46.550]
Then he suggested the ID of hotel room shortage and tell ask he was overblown.

[02:50:46.890 --> 02:50:49.370]
Go to testetalasky.com he said plenty of rooms available.

[02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:58.470]
True on the website but when I called Friday afternoon both the Hampton Inn and Sweet Stella has said 50 rooms available and tell ask he kept a courier that said 20 rooms were sold out for the game day.

[02:50:59.170 --> 02:51:03.230]
Ross Wager is the manager of the Hampton Inn and Sweet said they might not be completely sold out of the game.

[02:51:03.270 --> 02:51:06.630]
I promise that either way no evacuees would be kicked out to make room for fans.

[02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.670]
Thank the Lord.

[02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:10.730]
At least FSU coach Bobby Baughner lost family during a hurricane.

[02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:14.210]
Grasps the magnitude of the suffering playing on tell ask he's back yard.

[02:51:14.470 --> 02:51:18.330]
It makes the game seem mighty insignificant when you start thinking about what's going on down there.

[02:51:18.390 --> 02:51:21.830]
He said earlier this week, Honest says sure is held up brother.

[02:51:22.270 --> 02:51:23.570]
Sure is held up.

[02:51:24.730 --> 02:51:25.870]
Let's play some football.

[02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:29.010]
We got the Patriots game through tonight.

[02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:30.030]
That's the important stuff.

[02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:35.990]
When the Patriots play when anybody else plays it's kind of like, you know, and of course we got hockey coming up man.

[02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:41.270]
Now that the hurricanes have already lost one game which means everybody's off their bandwagon.

[02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:46.230]
They lose one game at set and we know that the dolphins are going to be like maybe one in 15.

[02:51:46.450 --> 02:51:48.210]
They're going to back in the next one and call.

[02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:50.030]
There you go.

[02:51:50.170 --> 02:51:53.550]
Let's get hockey intensive because the Panthers look like they're going to make the playoffs this year.

[02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:54.690]
They might actually be pretty good.

[02:51:55.850 --> 02:52:00.230]
So let's everybody, all the phone, he's just like we had that one year jump on the Panther bandwagon.

[02:52:00.450 --> 02:52:01.490]
We love the Panther.

[02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:02.390]
Let's cue that up.

[02:52:02.470 --> 02:52:02.930]
You got it now.

[02:52:03.770 --> 02:52:04.170]
Somewhere.

[02:52:04.650 --> 02:52:05.050]
Jolene.

[02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:06.570]
He's still a Nashville.

[02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.930]
I'll write to him.

[02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:12.850]
Well one good thing at least they didn't say that I'm I hope they didn't say those people to attend a scene.

[02:52:12.970 --> 02:52:13.450]
They probably did.

[02:52:14.170 --> 02:52:15.050]
Have they suffered enough?

[02:52:16.050 --> 02:52:22.370]
130 already a QAM when disaster strikes and this event we're talking of course about Hurricane Katrina and your home of business has suffered water damage.

[02:52:22.590 --> 02:52:24.990]
There's only one place to call and we're talking about dry concepts.

[02:52:56.330 --> 02:53:06.110]
This is column toll free 1 800 248 5071 that's 1 800 248 5071 around the wicked web it's dry concepts dot com.

[02:53:06.110 --> 02:53:08.530]
This is me Rogers.

[02:53:08.970 --> 02:53:12.970]
This is 560 QAM.

[02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:16.730]
Florida Marlins the Washington National.

[02:53:16.730 --> 02:53:22.590]
This is a health plan to Marlins on deck start our coverage tonight at 630 present by fell stop.

[02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:27.050]
This only one place can't fall down Florida Marlins these four.

[02:53:27.610 --> 02:53:31.230]
Sport for you 560 QAM.

[02:53:31.430 --> 02:53:39.130]
George Bush doesn't care about black people coming up tonight on inside and behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story.

[02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:45.310]
It's time to place 6 degrees of Scientology and we start it all off with Oingo Boingo.

[02:53:53.850 --> 02:53:57.690]
Okay Oingo Boingo was co-founded by Danny Ellsman.

[02:53:57.890 --> 02:54:01.150]
John Lax initiative is a reporter for the magazine entertainment.

[02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:11.670]
Danny Ellsman went on to a big career writing soundtracks like Batman and Dolores Clayborn Dolores Clayborn star Jennifer Jason Lay who co-starred with Bridget Fonda in single white female.

[02:54:11.850 --> 02:54:19.230]
Bridget Fonda is now married to Danny Ellsman who is related by marriage to Jenna Ellsman star of the Sucky TV show Dharma and Greg.

[02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:24.850]
Jenna married Danny Ellsman's nephew Bodey Ellsman and converted to Scientology for him.

[02:54:24.850 --> 02:54:31.050]
Voila the really amazing thing is that even Scientology couldn't stop Dharma and Greg from sucking.

[02:54:31.250 --> 02:54:33.710]
That's true but I'm the Ells Bodey Ellsman.

[02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:34.610]
Good question.

[02:54:34.990 --> 02:54:39.890]
He said a lot of bit parts and movies but so far Scientology really hasn't done crap for his career.

[02:54:40.210 --> 02:54:48.550]
In fact I'll bet a lot of people think that if they become a Scientologist they'll become as famous as John Travolta as Fat as Cursey Alliora as Closet as Tom Cruise.

[02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:54.330]
The reality is most Scientologists are anonymous losers just like the rest of us.

[02:54:55.070 --> 02:55:00.490]
Onigobuango they were not Scientologists yet they were famous. Go figure.

[02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:05.610]
It's a big juicy shopping let-look at your business tonight on Inside the Behind.

[02:55:06.090 --> 02:55:08.230]
Did they say his positive is Tom Cruise? Hey Tommy!

[02:55:08.410 --> 02:55:08.790]
You're fair!

[02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:11.330]
136.204.02 a.k.a.m.

[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:19.590]
a visibly angry mayor Richard Daly of Chicago said the city offered emergency medical and technical health to the federal government as early as last Sunday.

[02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:23.690]
Not this past Sunday but a week ago Sunday following.

[02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.430]
I'm following.

[02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:34.510]
To assist people in this area stricken by Hurricane Katrina but as a Friday meaning this past Friday the only things the feds that they wanted was a single tank truck.

[02:55:35.450 --> 02:55:40.930]
The truck which the FEMA requested the support in Illinois based medical team was on route on Friday.

[02:55:41.350 --> 02:55:43.690]
We're ready to provide more help than they have requested.

[02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:48.370]
We're just waiting for their call said Daly adding that he was shocked that nobody seemed to want the help.

[02:55:48.370 --> 02:55:51.130]
Just like the help from those 60 countries or whatever it is now.

[02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:53.770]
Well we're thinking about it we're going to let's do a study.

[02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.870]
We got our pride.

[02:55:55.270 --> 02:55:55.450]
Right.

[02:55:56.610 --> 02:56:00.970]
Meanwhile and I knew we'd hear from him sooner or later I knew it would be decided to hang it out hanging out with Oprah.

[02:56:01.610 --> 02:56:06.810]
US Senator Barack Obama said he would call for congressional hearings into the federal government's preparations and response.

[02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:14.450]
The response was achingly slow and that I think is a view shared by Democrats, Republicans, wealthy and poor black and white-difficument senators said.

[02:56:14.450 --> 02:56:21.270]
I haven't met anybody who's watched this crisis evolve over the last several days who isn't just furious and how poorly prepared we appear to be.

[02:56:22.690 --> 02:56:25.970]
The Southside Democrat called FEMA slow response baffling.

[02:56:26.590 --> 02:56:31.650]
I don't understand how you could have a situation where you've got several days notice of an enormous hurricane building in the Gulf Coast.

[02:56:31.950 --> 02:56:34.110]
You know that New Orleans is six feet below sea level.

[02:56:34.510 --> 02:56:37.530]
The notion that you don't have good plans in place just doesn't make sense.

[02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:38.490]
Obama said.

[02:56:39.310 --> 02:56:45.730]
Obama says he expects his counterparts and Louisiana must be a rally of bamboo call for congressional hearings, but he's ready if they don't.

[02:56:46.030 --> 02:56:50.950]
It's heartbreaking and infuriating and I think is embarrassing to the American people and Barack happens to be.

[02:56:51.010 --> 02:56:52.410]
Absolutely correct.

[02:56:52.990 --> 02:57:08.030]
Daily said the city offered 36 members of the firefighters technical rescue teams, 80 emergency medical technicians, searching rescue equipment for the 100 police officers as well as police vehicles and two boats, 29 clinical 117 non-clinical health workers, a mobile clinic, a trained personnel,

[02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:13.470]
140 street and sanitation workers and 29 trucks plus other supplies and a partridge and a pair of three.

[02:57:13.730 --> 02:57:16.170]
City personnel also were willing to operate self sufficiently.

[02:57:16.230 --> 02:57:19.670]
It wouldn't depend on local authorities for food, water, shelter, and other supplies he said.

[02:57:20.170 --> 02:57:21.170]
And they said, uh-uh.

[02:57:22.290 --> 02:57:24.010]
Just one truck will do. Thank you.

[02:57:25.350 --> 02:57:27.430]
Well, see I didn't want to make him look good because he's an Democrat.

[02:57:27.430 --> 02:57:28.170]
You know that Chicago.

[02:57:28.830 --> 02:57:30.050]
Oh, that's a lot of people.

[02:57:30.330 --> 02:57:33.730]
Blue country man. Blue countries. I don't want to do anything to make him look good like he's a decent guy.

[02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:36.430]
Really pathetic.

[02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:40.550]
You know what this is? This is like the Iraq attack all over again.

[02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:43.510]
I mean, it's just people dying.

[02:57:43.650 --> 02:57:47.310]
It isn't people dying. Total incompetence lies through their teeth.

[02:57:48.690 --> 02:57:53.930]
I mean, Michael shirt off for him to go on here on Thursday and give us some evidence about he didn't know those people were at the convention center.

[02:57:54.270 --> 02:57:57.910]
I got news for you, man. You're going to rotten hell for a long time, Mr. shirt off.

[02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.610]
You sell out.

[02:57:58.650 --> 02:58:00.350]
Oh, God.

[02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:05.910]
You see, one thing you'll find out about it in the blacks or Jews who are involved in this Bush administration,

[02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:07.770]
they're all sellouts. They're all self-hating.

[02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:10.430]
And he's one of them.

[02:58:11.270 --> 02:58:12.230]
Ture off my ass.

[02:58:14.130 --> 02:58:15.130]
820 votes, by the way.

[02:58:15.170 --> 02:58:17.270]
Made your 800. Is that what you were calling for?

[02:58:17.550 --> 02:58:18.350]
Yep. I'll do that.

[02:58:19.310 --> 02:58:21.390]
Those who deal with disaster on the local level,

[02:58:21.530 --> 02:58:23.630]
Warren Congress and the Bush administration earlier this year,

[02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:28.290]
that training and equipment for first responders were titled too much tor- tilted too much.

[02:58:28.290 --> 02:58:29.350]
I'm sorry, it's their mistake.

[02:58:29.790 --> 02:58:34.170]
Tilted too much to her combating terrorism and away from dealing with natural disasters like hurricanes.

[02:58:36.210 --> 02:58:37.390]
And of course, people are thinking,

[02:58:37.390 --> 02:58:41.470]
well, we saw something that came last night and hurricane disaster would be the right word, wouldn't it?

[02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:42.770]
Because they're obsessed with football.

[02:58:43.290 --> 02:58:44.110]
You know, you need a ball.

[02:58:45.770 --> 02:58:46.610]
Congratulant investigators,

[02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:49.610]
Urge administration to correct the tilt, but no changes were made.

[02:58:50.130 --> 02:58:52.570]
In emergency for some, again, raising them in flags,

[02:58:52.570 --> 02:58:57.670]
when FEMA lost its independence and joined the 22-agency homeland security department March 2003,

[02:58:57.670 --> 02:59:01.230]
that's one of the main reasons that this disaster went down as it did.

[02:59:02.290 --> 02:59:07.190]
The Manifest Department was created in 2002 as a response to the lack of coordination part in 9-11 terrorist attacks.

[02:59:07.610 --> 02:59:09.490]
And its emphasis clearly is terrorism.

[02:59:10.450 --> 02:59:15.990]
Officials developed in all hazards policy that used the same training exercises and equipment to prepare for two distinct types of disasters,

[02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:18.710]
a terrorist attack and an event of nature.

[02:59:20.590 --> 02:59:25.810]
Congress's GAO reported in July that a 39-first Respawned Department surveyed 31 disagreed

[02:59:25.810 --> 02:59:28.610]
that the training and grant funds worked for all types of hazards.

[02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:37.610]
In addition, officials from four first Respawned Department went on to say that DHS required too much emphasis on terrorism-related activities and requests for equipment and training.

[02:59:37.770 --> 02:59:39.950]
Otherwise, basically, they don't care anymore about natural disasters.

[02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:41.510]
Well, there are already.

[02:59:41.850 --> 02:59:46.150]
And I'm going to tell you one thing, even though we don't have no levees, we got a few levees.

[02:59:47.010 --> 02:59:51.190]
But if we should ever get hit again by a cat-five in Florida,

[02:59:51.450 --> 02:59:54.690]
and the one that doesn't have to go way, way down south where most of the population is not,

[02:59:55.310 --> 02:59:58.970]
you can't even begin to imagine what the hell would be.

[02:59:59.110 --> 02:59:59.730]
Can you begin?

[02:59:59.850 --> 03:00:00.870]
No, I don't want to begin.

[03:00:01.290 --> 03:00:02.350]
Don't even think about it.

[03:00:02.530 --> 03:00:04.530]
And I think the eye probably would be right over your house again.

[03:00:05.230 --> 03:00:06.990]
This is Neil Rogers.

[03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:11.190]
This is 5.69 AF.

[03:00:13.250 --> 03:00:13.850]
Do it again.

[03:00:14.430 --> 03:00:15.450]
Yeah, hit it.

[03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:17.090]
Thank you.

[03:00:17.110 --> 03:00:18.290]
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

[03:00:18.470 --> 03:00:20.010]
Hi, it's the MySodland.

[03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.770]
Hey, Goldberg.

[03:00:21.430 --> 03:00:22.870]
We're doing morning 7-10.

[03:00:23.250 --> 03:00:25.030]
Spins had to make some cuts yet today.

[03:00:25.250 --> 03:00:27.710]
Among them, Brock were then done at Perry.

[03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.230]
John.

[03:00:29.350 --> 03:00:30.510]
Yeah, excuse me.

[03:00:30.650 --> 03:00:31.710]
I know you went for the U-ray.

[03:00:31.730 --> 03:00:31.990]
He did.

[03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:33.590]
Is that a big shock? Is that what?

[03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:34.750]
We should name him first.

[03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:37.190]
I think Perry was a more significant cut to Brock.

[03:00:37.330 --> 03:00:39.750]
I think the fans down here are more concerned about Brock.

[03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:40.390]
Oh, yeah.

[03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:42.510]
They were sitting up nice frame for Brock.

[03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:44.550]
They were, man, they wanted him to be the third stringer.

[03:00:44.590 --> 03:00:46.430]
The fact that Brock got an NFL Europe.

[03:00:46.730 --> 03:00:47.330]
It's up to them now.

[03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:49.450]
They wanted him to replace Sage.

[03:00:50.050 --> 03:00:50.650]
You're right.

[03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:51.310]
You're wrong.

[03:00:51.310 --> 03:00:52.190]
Goodbye. No.

[03:00:52.350 --> 03:00:53.410]
Now, your updates over.

[03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:55.970]
The hammer, Hinkleberg 7-10.

[03:00:56.370 --> 03:00:58.910]
Spins had to make a move.

[03:00:59.230 --> 03:01:00.770]
Alright, I'm getting blown.

[03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:04.570]
That's a good move.

[03:01:08.170 --> 03:01:08.810]
Boy.

[03:01:13.430 --> 03:01:14.070]
Boy.

[03:01:15.010 --> 03:01:15.650]
Boy.

[03:01:15.870 --> 03:01:15.870]

[03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:19.470]
There's a soldier in Israel.

[03:01:20.650 --> 03:01:24.310]
He's got something and it's pointed at me.

[03:01:24.690 --> 03:01:25.370]
It's a loser.

[03:01:25.850 --> 03:01:26.430]
It's a loser.

[03:01:26.890 --> 03:01:27.030]
It's a loser.

[03:01:27.170 --> 03:01:28.110]
Oh, no.

[03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:29.330]
It's a loser.

[03:01:30.270 --> 03:01:31.230]
It's a loser.

[03:01:31.230 --> 03:01:32.190]
Oh, no.

[03:01:32.770 --> 03:01:33.610]
It's a loser.

[03:01:33.810 --> 03:01:34.350]
It's a loser.

[03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.550]

[03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:36.110]
Oh, no.

[03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:39.590]
It should step on my life.

[03:01:40.530 --> 03:01:40.810]
It's a loser.

[03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:42.450]
It's a loser.

[03:01:42.450 --> 03:01:45.470]
That soldier's got it.

[03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:46.510]
It's a loser.

[03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:48.310]
And I might get shot.

[03:02:06.610 --> 03:02:07.790]
Hello.

[03:02:09.510 --> 03:02:10.690]
Hello.

[03:02:11.050 --> 03:02:11.870]
Hello.

[03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:18.290]
Is this a Japanese TV?

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.290]

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.290]

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.290]

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.290]

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.290]

[03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.350]
for

[03:02:21.310 --> 03:02:22.030]
it's

[03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.350]
and

[03:02:22.350 --> 03:02:23.690]
it's

[03:02:23.690 --> 03:02:24.650]
and

[03:02:25.470 --> 03:02:26.190]
it's

[03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.510]
and

[03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.510]

[03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.510]

[03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.530]
it's

[03:02:26.530 --> 03:02:26.530]

[03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.830]
it's and

[03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:30.270]
it's and

[03:02:30.270 --> 03:02:30.470]
it's and

[03:02:46.970 --> 03:02:47.830]
it's and

[03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:49.830]
the

[03:02:53.310 --> 03:02:53.390]
the

[03:02:53.390 --> 03:02:55.830]
they

[03:02:59.570 --> 03:02:59.750]
they

[03:02:59.750 --> 03:03:00.470]
somebody

[03:03:00.470 --> 03:03:01.310]
and

[03:03:01.310 --> 03:03:04.630]
it's

[03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:11.890]
you

[03:03:19.930 --> 03:03:24.590]
For the second time, the Panthers are changing the name of their Sunrise of Winnie Browder,

[03:03:24.730 --> 03:03:25.710]
official confirmed on Friday.

[03:03:25.930 --> 03:03:27.450]
You're missing the important stuff.

[03:03:27.650 --> 03:03:30.410]
You're concentrating on stuff like dead people in hurricanes.

[03:03:31.730 --> 03:03:35.770]
The name of the Irwinus expected to change from office depot center to name featuring Bank

[03:03:35.770 --> 03:03:38.230]
Atlantic, probably Bank Atlantic Center.

[03:03:39.290 --> 03:03:42.390]
Acquited two officials who were briefed on the agreement were requested anonymity,

[03:03:42.430 --> 03:03:43.370]
because they don't want to get shot.

[03:03:44.210 --> 03:03:46.710]
Roger Dejarlay, the Barbarate County Administrative City of Winnie Browder,

[03:03:46.750 --> 03:03:49.970]
did that office depot's name being replaced in the building, but wasn't told over the new name.

[03:03:50.310 --> 03:03:54.550]
But two sources said the Panthers have been working to finalize the deal with four-larter-dale-based Bank Atlantic.

[03:03:55.970 --> 03:03:59.490]
One source said the deal with Bank Atlantic likely would be more lucrative than office depots,

[03:03:59.490 --> 03:04:00.690]
which paid about a million a year.

[03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:03.530]
Office depot replaced National Car rental as the Intercenter,

[03:04:04.390 --> 03:04:08.010]
September 2002, National Car rental had paid about 2.2 million a year.

[03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:11.510]
The naming rights money goes through a general revenue pot.

[03:04:12.270 --> 03:04:16.810]
In other words, pot for all the players, which the Panthers keep to first $14 million annually,

[03:04:17.230 --> 03:04:19.250]
above that figure, 20% of the profits go into the county.

[03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:21.530]
Anybody here any more about the Slats or the Home Survey?

[03:04:21.850 --> 03:04:23.990]
Maybe they can take all those ones from Baluxi.

[03:04:25.210 --> 03:04:26.590]
There you go. They're just floating around.

[03:04:27.070 --> 03:04:27.990]
They're a little wet.

[03:04:28.230 --> 03:04:30.110]
And of course, maybe that's good for the gamblers out there,

[03:04:30.210 --> 03:04:32.910]
because maybe being waterlogged, it might defeat the computers.

[03:04:32.910 --> 03:04:33.490]
See what I'm saying?

[03:04:34.810 --> 03:04:37.510]
Yeah, maybe we might have a shot, because otherwise you've got no shot.

[03:04:38.270 --> 03:04:41.350]
So they're renaming it, of course, if they name it, see that center thing,

[03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:43.810]
like the Roger Center that they, everybody that comes here to the wrong,

[03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:46.650]
I mean, what was wrong with the Skydome? That's a good name, right?

[03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:47.030]
Yeah.

[03:04:47.970 --> 03:04:50.970]
Skydome is a great name, but then Rogers Cavell, which is by the way great.

[03:04:51.070 --> 03:04:54.530]
But nevertheless, they've bought it out. They've changed the name of the state into the Roger Center.

[03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:57.430]
I appreciate that. I take it as a personal compliment,

[03:04:57.430 --> 03:05:00.630]
but everybody makes fun of that name and rightfully so, because the name sucks.

[03:05:02.050 --> 03:05:03.570]
Roger Center My Ass.

[03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:07.870]
Speaking of ass, here's somebody with a big one.

[03:05:08.250 --> 03:05:10.850]
Dana Stevens writes, what is this in, oeslate.com.

[03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:14.990]
One of the most puzzling recent hires in Cavell news has been MSNBC's poaching of the anchor,

[03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:16.910]
Rita Cosby, from Fox News.

[03:05:17.690 --> 03:05:21.750]
This month, Cosby began hosting a nightly news show, which airs at 9 p.m. with nets.

[03:05:22.090 --> 03:05:25.730]
It's premiere August 8th, bumped situation with Tucker Carlson in the 11 p.m. slot,

[03:05:26.050 --> 03:05:27.790]
formerly occupied by a hardball rerun.

[03:05:27.790 --> 03:05:30.790]
Basically, what that means is MSNBC should just shut down.

[03:05:32.350 --> 03:05:35.910]
MSNBC's anchor netting of Cosby from Fox represents the third place cavell news

[03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:40.010]
whenever was intent at landing what variety recently called the news ratings grabber.

[03:05:40.330 --> 03:05:42.430]
The crusading blonde on the crime and justice beat.

[03:05:43.230 --> 03:05:47.630]
Back in 2001, CNN stole Paul Azon from Fox Resorting an a breach of employment contract

[03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:51.970]
so it was later dismissed, and years long vendetta between Zon and Fox Chief Roger Ailes

[03:05:51.970 --> 03:05:54.810]
who told the New York Times he could have put a dead rat coolnans on,

[03:05:54.810 --> 03:05:56.690]
so I'm slotting got equally good ratings.

[03:05:57.790 --> 03:06:02.130]
In 2002, all of a sudden we might not like it, I think it did raccoon on there.

[03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:05.850]
Oh, and this is a general, by the way, this general honorate? Oh boy.

[03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:09.030]
What a show he is, huh? Well, what do you do?

[03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:10.990]
Yeah, in a show.

[03:06:11.770 --> 03:06:15.410]
In 2002, Grand Event Suspyeon defected in reverse direction from CNN to Fox.

[03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:17.990]
Fancestors ratings have soared during her three or ten years Fox,

[03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:22.170]
especially this summer with her obsessive fixation on the search for Natalie Holloway,

[03:06:22.170 --> 03:06:25.150]
the missing teenager in Aruba has made her one of the highest rated

[03:06:25.150 --> 03:06:27.550]
and most ridiculed personalities on cable news.

[03:06:28.530 --> 03:06:31.990]
Another much-hyped instance of Internet work blonde poaching occurred this spring

[03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:36.570]
when CNN hitline news, landed court TV's wild eye Cassandra of the Justice System,

[03:06:36.690 --> 03:06:39.290]
Nancy Grace, for its prime time APM slot.

[03:06:39.630 --> 03:06:41.770]
Thank you, Frane. Thank you, Frane.

[03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:48.130]
Oh, God, what I would like to, I'd like to take her and Lou Dobbs and put them in a space capsule.

[03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:50.470]
And just...

[03:06:51.130 --> 03:06:56.250]
But the traffic and blonde seems to be exceeding almost abstract plane with the acquisition of Rita Cosby by MSNBC.

[03:06:56.730 --> 03:07:00.450]
It's as if the new rules of the people network publicity machine demanded flexion-haired anchor women

[03:07:00.450 --> 03:07:05.270]
must be routinely seduced away from their networks and the resulting deflections hyped in the press defections,

[03:07:05.390 --> 03:07:07.850]
regardless of their virtual indistinguishability from one another,

[03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:11.010]
or their highly dubious contributions to the field of journalism at large.

[03:07:11.390 --> 03:07:14.370]
How many people actually watch Rita Cosby and her weekend get a one-fog?

[03:07:14.970 --> 03:07:19.430]
And if she does have a following as the existence of a Rita Cosby fan club would seem to indicate,

[03:07:19.790 --> 03:07:22.110]
can those viewers be dependent on the migrate to a prime time,

[03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:24.050]
at least, show on the Least Watch cable news network?

[03:07:24.190 --> 03:07:24.330]
No.

[03:07:24.850 --> 03:07:28.970]
This question brings up a corollary that's too sad to ponder for very long.

[03:07:29.330 --> 03:07:34.590]
What kind of person voluntarily spends their precious weeknight hours watching cable news chat shows?

[03:07:36.510 --> 03:07:39.150]
Well, the people who can't get on chat rooms, I guess.

[03:07:39.490 --> 03:07:44.370]
I guess watching live in direct is we could spend hard to get a sense of what Rita was hard to bring to MSNBC.

[03:07:44.890 --> 03:07:48.690]
The aftermath of a devastating hurricane isn't really a Rita Cosby kind of story for one thing,

[03:07:48.690 --> 03:07:49.950]
there's nobody to blame for it.

[03:07:51.270 --> 03:07:56.190]
Cosby seems much more at home with stories like the disappearance of Olivia Newton-John's boyfriend Patrick McDermott.

[03:07:56.570 --> 03:08:01.610]
I'd love to retempt last week to pump some juice about this case out of a visibly nonchalant private investigator

[03:08:01.610 --> 03:08:03.950]
who suggested I would say two words, Las Vegas?

[03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:06.430]
Okay, looking Vegas, he's probably hanging out there.

[03:08:07.150 --> 03:08:10.990]
And of course, Natalie Holloway's story, this week Cosby was supposed to be poured in live from Aruba,

[03:08:11.350 --> 03:08:15.530]
and she actually did broadcast this show from there, but God had thrown her wrench into MSNBC's plans

[03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:19.350]
to steal away some of Natalie Holloway's fire from Fox, Hurricane Katrina.

[03:08:19.810 --> 03:08:23.290]
There was something bitterly amusing in watching Cosby try to justify her presence at Aruba,

[03:08:23.730 --> 03:08:26.450]
as you know, I just, as you know, I just arrived here in Aruba,

[03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:30.070]
which was not hit by the storm, but is dealing with a fury of the Natalie Holloway investigation

[03:08:30.070 --> 03:08:34.650]
before devoting the rest of her the hour to long distance coverage of the mega-disaster happening.

[03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:39.610]
To make a long story short, she blows, man, to hurricane Blue Pretty Hard, a reed of Cosby Blue.

[03:08:40.370 --> 03:08:43.130]
This is a needle-rod with a gold authority.

[03:08:43.510 --> 03:08:46.490]
This is 516 QAA.

[03:08:46.750 --> 03:08:48.910]
I'm from this year's fantasy draft, dial her up.

[03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:50.030]
We don't have dial up.

[03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:53.630]
Thing, anybody's stepsens up to doing this show in four years.

[03:08:54.370 --> 03:08:56.050]
How we needed evidence to the fore.

[03:08:59.250 --> 03:09:00.650]
Yes, and you're on QAA.

[03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:05.670]
We don't have any national guards there because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now.

[03:09:05.950 --> 03:09:06.650]
Nothing national guard.

[03:09:07.750 --> 03:09:09.110]
Not the national guard.

[03:09:09.210 --> 03:09:10.350]
No national guard in Iraq?

[03:09:10.890 --> 03:09:12.150]
No national guard.

[03:09:12.970 --> 03:09:19.610]
New Orleans thought it had been spared the worst, and then two major levees broken slowly the city filled with water.

[03:09:19.810 --> 03:09:22.910]
The city that fits below sea level is now under sea.

[03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:26.410]
Officials estimate that 80% of New Orleans is now underwater.

[03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:28.990]
The governor has been asking for everybody to stay a prayer.

[03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:32.170]
I think we could probably do that for our friends and loved ones upstairs.

[03:09:32.310 --> 03:09:34.670]
Good morning America.

[03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:42.290]
This don't you know me, I'm an airsoft.

[03:09:44.470 --> 03:09:49.030]
I'm a trained in all the city of New Orleans.

[03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:55.290]
I'll be gone by Monday, I'll be going to be in town.

[03:09:55.490 --> 03:09:58.610]
Last night we began this broadcasting Katrina was bad.

[03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:59.510]
Very bad.

[03:09:59.830 --> 03:10:02.010]
