[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.000]
And now the Neil Rogers Show on W.I.N.Z.

[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.360]
You're invited to join the King of South Florida's talk hosts to probe the day's news,

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.680]
inform the community's contents, and to expand your horizons.

[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.580]
To join Neil Rogers and his guests, call 624-191-1-E.D. and 7640-707-1-1.

[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.420]
Use an opinion expressed on this program, a nose of the moderator, his guests and coars.

[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.680]
And do not necessarily represent those of W.I.N.Z. its staff or management.

[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.620]
Here is your host, Neil Rogers.

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.840]
Well, I'll tell you what folks, I would have been here a lot sooner, but I took the Metro Rail,

[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.960]
which was a big mistake. It's taken me two months to get here on the Metro Rail.

[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.620]
Good evening to you, it's 807 here on W.I.N.Z. My name is Neil Rogers, in case you are wondering.

[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.040]
And I hope that I'm no stranger to most of you out there. It's exciting to be here.

[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.800]
It really is, and it's exciting to be back on the year.

[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.780]
After two months in limbo, even Chubby Checker, never was in limbo as long as I was.

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.800]
And I have to tell you something that I have discovered, and that is that those of us,

[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.600]
and of course there aren't all that many, but those of us who are in this business are very fortunate,

[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.460]
because we really have an outlet. We have an opportunity. Every time something happens,

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.060]
we pick up the newspaper and there's a story that gets us angry.

[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.780]
There's something that happens that we want to blow off steam about.

[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.780]
And we have the opportunity to go on the year with a matter of hours, that same day,

[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.100]
and give our opinions, and blow off that steam. The average person obviously doesn't have that same kind of an opportunity.

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.160]
And when the opportunity is taken away from you for whatever reason for a prolonged period of time,

[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.900]
it becomes kind of frustrating. There have been a lot of really important things that have happened locally,

[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.960]
and nationally and around the world these last couple of months,

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.120]
and I haven't had the opportunity to talk about them. So a little bit later on during the evening,

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.300]
since this is our first night here on WINZ, I'm going to take the opportunity to just briefly touch in some of those,

[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.600]
and then share some of your thoughts and opinions also.

[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.840]
But obviously this is kind of reunion time. I want to thank my good friend Bill Coder, by the way.

[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.620]
It's great to be working with Bill again, and last night we had two and a half hours together here.

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.860]
I hope a lot of you had a chance to hear it, and that was unbelievable at best.

[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.700]
It was beyond description.

[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.120]
And it was going to be with Bill because I had a chance to get the lay of the land, so to speak here,

[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.100]
and to look at the equipment and to get the feel of some of the lunatic colors out there.

[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.940]
Just kind of feel my way around. So even though this is my first night here at WINZ,

[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.300]
it's kind of like old hat at this point after being here for a couple of a wild hours last night.

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.840]
I don't want to get too lodged, but I do want to say this at the very outset,

[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.880]
and then I want to thank a lot of people. I'm not going to... this isn't the Grammy Awards,

[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.100]
so I'm not going to do a Michael Jackson and I'll stand here and thank all of my relatives and so on.

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.700]
But I do want to thank the people here at WINZ, and particularly at the management level for their tremendous support,

[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.400]
and their cooperation during these very hectic last few months.

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.360]
And it's always great to win.

[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.560]
And I'm just delighted that we were vindicated, and that I've had the opportunity to continue pursuing my livelihood,

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.640]
which is kind of nice. It's important to most of us.

[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.400]
And as I said, I'm very grateful for their enthusiastic support.

[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.220]
And one of the things that really impresses me, and again, it's going to sound a little bit corny,

[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.420]
but it's true, is the fact that the people here at WINZ are really nice folks.

[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.980]
I mean, everybody here has been tremendously supportive and very warm,

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.460]
and the kind of welcome that I've had has really been very rewarding.

[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.340]
But as I said, but I was on with Bill Last night,

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.540]
one of the things that I've learned out of this difficult experience during the last couple of months

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.260]
is to appreciate you.

[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.500]
A lot more than perhaps I have during the past eight years that I've been in the market here in Miami,

[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.500]
when I say you, I mean the audience.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.620]
Generally, the cliche in broadcasting is that the audience is fickle, that they forget you in a minute,

[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.340]
and that they'll go over next door any opportunity they have,

[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.300]
and you hear people who will say to a new person who comes on the air,

[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.960]
you're a breath of fresh air. They could put a monkey on the air,

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.000]
and within the first two minutes somebody'd call it and say,

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800]
what a breath of fresh air.

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.300]
But the fact is that there have been an enormous number of loyal people who have either written to me

[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.920]
or called the various newspapers, or called this radio station to try to track me down.

[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.600]
And there were a lot of those people who called in last night when I was on with Bill,

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.420]
and I'm sure that the same thing probably will happen here during the reunion part of our show

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.700]
these first couple of hours tonight.

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.300]
And I'm very grateful for that. It's a very rewarding kind of experience to know that there are people out there

[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.520]
to whom you have some significance, people who are really interested in what you think and what you've got to say.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.920]
Speaking of Bill Carter, by the way, Bill will be here about 11 o'clock tonight.

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.180]
He's going to come in early tonight, and Bill will be with me for the last hour from 11 o'clock till midnight.

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.220]
So we're not going to get too serious or too modelled or too heavy tonight,

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.300]
because as I said, it's reunion night here on WINZ,

[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.600]
and I'd like to get an opportunity to talk to a lot of my old friends and say hello again.

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.280]
And hopefully make a lot of new friends too. I guess when you've been on the air in a market for eight years,

[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.360]
you assume that everybody out there knows who you are and or has listened to you.

[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.840]
And obviously that is an incorrect assumption. I'm sure that there are a lot of people out there who say,

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.900]
who the heck is this guy? Where did he come from? Well, as time goes on,

[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.760]
obviously you'll have the opportunity to learn some of you will like me, some of you will hate me,

[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900]
and some will be somewhere in between, but hopefully you'll listen,

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.980]
because that's the important thing. That's what it's all about.

[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.920]
I do want to mention also before we go to your calls and before we get started here on our opening night,

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.000]
that during these first few weeks,

[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.800]
I'm going to have back a lot of the regular guests who have been with me for the past several years,

[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.080]
along with a lot of new people too.

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.040]
Tomorrow night, a very good and dear friend of mine and of many of yours, Ed Cohen,

[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.480]
who is a political activist and analyst.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.480]
Ed has been doing shows with me for the past eight years going back to the old KAT days back in 76 and 77.

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.940]
And also among several other things that are coming up during the first couple of weeks,

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.620]
a week from tomorrow next Friday, one of your favorite guests, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.020]
spiritualist Reverend Emma is going to be with me.

[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.480]
And I have an envelope. I guess it's one of the few things that I've held on to.

[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.580]
I've thrown out just about everything else from the past,

[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.440]
but I have an envelope here that says,

[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.180]
PRD, ICTIOS, predictions for 1984.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.540]
I guess it was Emma's typewriter.

[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.160]
I'm sure you're listening, Emma, so we're looking forward to hearing you up.

[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.100]
We're going to open the envelope a week from tomorrow night,

[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.980]
and Reverend Emma will be with us on that night.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.440]
So we've got a lot of your old friends coming back,

[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.560]
along with a lot of new things,

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.860]
and we hope that you'll make it a habit.

[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.920]
I'm going to be here every night, Monday through Friday, from 8 o'clock till midnight.

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.060]
And then of course, a short pause for everybody to recover from what we do here,

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.260]
and then Bill Coder comes along from 12.35 till 5 in the morning.

[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.060]
So hopefully there are a lot of you out there going to make the night time hours

[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.820]
a regular spot here on 94 news, W-I-N-Z.

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.580]
Okay, let me give you the numbers now.

[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.560]
And as I said during these first couple of hours between now and 10 o'clock,

[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.860]
it's going to be reunion time.

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.640]
It's been a long two months.

[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.100]
It seems like much longer than that.

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.220]
In date county, the number 624-0191.

[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.440]
That's 624-0191 in date, and in Broward County, our number is 764-07-07.

[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.520]
Write those numbers down, because hopefully you're going to be using them a lot in the weeks

[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.620]
and months to come again in Broward 764-07-07.

[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.760]
I can't believe it.

[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.000]
I cannot believe it.

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.080]
It's 20 minutes after 8 o'clock at W-I-N-Z.

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.960]
My name is Neil Rogers.

[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.560]
We are with you till midnight, and there is a message on my computer screen that says we have a handful of dancers

[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.640]
from South Dade who have driven up to our studios.

[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.440]
They're doing the Kazzatski in our parking lot.

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.540]
I've got one of my many Kazzuz by the way.

[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.360]
They're going to have to get used to the Kazzuz.

[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.400]
I'm sure the people here at W-I-N-Z have never seen anything quite like this.

[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.420]
And we can blame Reverend Emma.

[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.120]
I'm supposed to do a serious show most of the time for those who are not familiar, but occasionally we do things a little bit on the wacko side,

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.640]
like we did with Carter last night.

[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.980]
And I have...

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.780]
Well, I'm not even going to say what it looks like.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.980]
Okay, anyway, we put it off long enough.

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.460]
I think it's time to check out the natives out there, see if they're friendly, see if these are my pals, my buddies,

[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.900]
or exactly what it's going to be on the telephone, and we'll start.

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.420]
This is kind of a...

[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.480]
Well, it's kind of a traumatic moment, I guess you might say.

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.380]
We're going to start in Dade County in line one.

[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.760]
Hello.

[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.100]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:35.620]
Hi.

[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.360]
Welcome back, my dear.

[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.060]
Thank you.

[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.220]
I know this has been terrible for you, but never even on one of your phone nights.

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.100]
Would you ever doubt how much you need to add up us?

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.480]
Well, I tell you one thing. I wish I had a Polaroid camera because all the lines are lit right now, and you know how hysterical I am about the phone line.

[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.200]
I know, and I'm surprised that I got in first, but I decided this time I was going to.

[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.400]
I couldn't get in last night, but I laid in bed, and I laughed until I cried, listened to you and built.

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.540]
I got to tell you something.

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.820]
We just said we didn't have any idea what we were going to do, and that turned into one of the funniest shows that I've ever been involved with.

[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.180]
There was that one period of time, about 130, when Eddie the poet called in.

[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.480]
Right, right, and he was trying to cheer me up, and he was doing this depressing, morbid poem about it.
