[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.580]
You, dude! Dinner time!

[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.360]
Oh, no, another night at Cheap Italian Food and a Can.

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.300]
Yo, yo, yo, man, check it out.

[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.400]
Who are you?

[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.260]
It's me, homeboy ID.

[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.580]
What?

[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.020]
Yo, man, toss-out to the skidios and get down with some homeboy ID, Sketti Ho.

[00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.160]
You got a can opener?

[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.520]
Yeah.

[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.520]
Wow.

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.000]
Yo, man, and homeboy ID got all kinds of stuff.

[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.840]
And it's all made homesties.

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.520]
Oh, boy.

[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.440]
It's homeboy ID and ain't no little service needed.

[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.040]
You could feed the whole crew with an all-new gang size can.

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660]
What's g-that's large.

[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.440]
Come on, man.

[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.520]
Eat with the plan.

[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.020]
And get the food in the can.

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.040]
That tastes like the food in the can.

[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.060]
Homeboy ID.

[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.980]
Drive by and pick some off.

[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.400]
The sale.

[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.020]
So anyway, you ought to see this.

[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.120]
Jennifer is in, and I'm talking about Fagin.

[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.280]
If I'm talking about our own lovely Jennifer Remis in the other room,

[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.540]
checking out some of that beautiful stuff that we got in the, uh, in the mail.

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.020]
And she said,

[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.780]
It just keeps getting bigger.

[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.540]
And wait till she sees the other one.

[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.520]
She'll look at that and say,

[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.560]
Yeah, kid, baby.

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.240]
Anyway, we're doing screenless here.

[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.200]
We'll be talking to Don Cherry about the bottom of the yard.

[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.800]
So we'll like really tighten up this hour and do like a lot of commercials back to back.

[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.500]
And stuff like that.

[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.140]
What is it?

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480]
You just can't beat this celebrity meat.

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.380]
Oh, man.

[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.600]
Can't beat that gator meat.

[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.180]
This, uh, I'm telling you, she was on that passion phones.

[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.540]
We'd have 110 share.

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.260]
Even people who don't own a radio would put it down at their listening.

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.340]
I'm telling you right now,

[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160]
that Aaron Summers couldn't like Jennifer's, uh, Asperatus.

[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.440]
W-I-O-D.

[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.080]
Dale.

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.260]
Hey, we're probably going to get rid of these uh, 90 year old heavyweight champs, huh?

[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.400]
Like, well, Tyson's getting down next month.

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.120]
Oh, is he?

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.420]
Yeah, March 25th.

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.280]
Well, isn't that exciting?

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.120]
Can't wait.

[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.380]
How come you're so anti-basketball?

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.320]
Because it's boring.

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.200]
Oh.

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.440]
Because it's a bunch of seven foot freaks that jammed a ball down a basket.

[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.260]
It's not exciting.

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.920]
It's not interesting.

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900]
There's very little skill involved that just did nothing for me.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.680]
All right.

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.160]
You can only spread yourself around so thin.

[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.220]
All right.

[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.260]
Thank you.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.260]

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.260]

[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.760]
Thank you.

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.360]
See ya.

[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.220]
Now, what did you do with that?

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.160]
Did you run away with that?

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.180]
I don't think we'll ever see it again.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.280]
I think Jennifer eloped with that brochure.

[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.160]
She can do better than that.

[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.040]
She can get the real thing.

[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.960]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.220]
What did she say to that one picture of Rick Schroeder?

[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.780]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.880]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.700]
Paul Lyle.

[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.320]
Paul Lyle.

[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.180]
Now we're talking.

[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.380]
Paul Lyle.

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.680]
These guys that got the old tapes out there.

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.260]
Can you hear that?

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.440]
That was with the bird on the thing.

[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.500]
And George, by the way, was over the weekend, had a real exciting weekend listening to old tapes

[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.660]
when the bird was on the show?

[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.300]
Yeah.

[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.380]
Said he has never heard anything worse in his life.

[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.460]
And I still say the bird was fine on Zeta.

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.620]
We had a great show in a morning on Zeta with Caprita and me, and we kept the bird in its place.

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.240]
And it's a cage.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.460]
But when he came over here, it was a disaster just waiting to happen, and it did.

[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.420]
And then I remember after we dumped him off the show, after I dumped him off the show,

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.040]
I remember going through like the Spanish Inquisition literally.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.560]
I had all these Julios called...

[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.000]
Did you say to the bird?

[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.900]
Did you tell the bird that he was doing this wrong?

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.260]
Did you say to the bird?

[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.180]
I'll never forget that.

[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.020]
All these little dick tutorial assholes out there telling me what I should do, how I should

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.140]
run the show, run my life, stick it pal.

[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.080]
They go get a life, okay, would be a good start.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.180]
Did I say to the bird?

[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.960]
I'll give you a bird.

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.240]
Oh, and speaking of Jennifer, almost biting off my finger.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.600]
What is the name of that bit that Skyler does?

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.820]
Best of meals.

[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.820]
Best of meals.

[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.600]
We better play that.

[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.340]
Not the best of meals, but the best of meals.

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.300]
It fits in for Jennifer perfect, okay?

[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.040]
You bird brain.

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.460]
W-I-O-D.

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.840]
A meal.

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.200]
Yes.

[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.480]
First time caller.

[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.980]
All right.

[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.340]
Just calling in response to that Burger King person at Burger King.

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.960]
Is it alive?

[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.800]
Well, I guess so.

[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.900]
It is a guy who called.

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.920]
I can't believe he couldn't tell, but it is a guy.

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.140]
I've been there a few times.

[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.120]
I guess wishing it was a woman.

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.580]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.400]
And it's kind of frightening.

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.360]
What do you mean by that?

[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.140]
In other words, it's a guy who's so pretty that he looks like a woman?

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.880]
No, it is frightening.

[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.460]
Oh.

[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.620]
It is really frightening.

[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.420]
It's a-

[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420]
I don't understand.

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.340]
Well, you said you wished that it was a woman.

[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.580]
No, I don't wish.

[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.400]
I think he wishes.

[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.120]
He wishes it was a woman.

[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.340]
Dress is like a woman.

[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.340]
Make up everything.

[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.040]
Oh, I see.

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.380]
And it's a guy in drag?

[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.700]
No.

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.040]
Burger King is hiring drag-

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.980]
drag-kings?

[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.100]
I guess so.

[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.040]
Oh, I thought he would have gone to work at Dairy Queen instead.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.860]
Thanks for the good news, Pally.

[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.400]
It's okay.

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.120]
Bottomed up.

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.060]
Okay.

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.320]
Well, I guess you can't have your meat.

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.060]
And it's 10 past noon at WIOD.

[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.640]
My head goes very deep.

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.520]
I need to put down.

[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.860]
Hmm.

[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.340]
So anyway, where expect and fill sauce might call any second now?

[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.660]
Well, in the food is here.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.100]
We want to think, boon again, profusely.

[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.560]
There's enough food here to feed the Chinese army.

[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.300]
Fine.

[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.700]
Fine.

[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.740]
We're not open to lying in date and we're not in power.

[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.980]
Hmm.

[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.040]
Hmm.

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.620]
Boy, this is good.

[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.160]
What?

[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.320]
Why are you laughing yet?

[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.200]
Nothing.

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.660]
Everything's fine.

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.160]
I'm just sitting here and you're over there can't quite.

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.360]
I didn't call it what's right about you.

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.020]
Just relax.

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.100]
What, bird?

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.900]
Here, give me your finger.

[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.480]
Now stick your finger in this piece of pita bread, okay?

[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.080]
Okay.

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.460]
Ow!

[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.920]
Hmm.

[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.620]
Man, I just bit your finger off and you're still laughing.

[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.220]
Hmm.

[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.760]
You know what?

[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.660]
It's not bad.

[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.700]
You got nine more of these, right?

[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.180]
Yes.

[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.620]
I'm put a little mouth of mozzarella on this and you really got something.

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.800]
Yes.

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.260]
That was the best part.

[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.080]
Nice going to Skyler.

[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.440]
Whatever happened to Jim Skyler.

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.880]
Do you run away and make his fortune or you get smart and get out of this business?

[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.480]
Let's do date county, W-I-O-D.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.300]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.900]
Speaking.

[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.740]
New?

[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.200]
Yes.

[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.720]
Last week I gave you a car and it was like the wasn't a screenless car but it was one of those cars you said to talk about anything?

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.260]
Yeah.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.280]
I want to plug my business and it got really good.

[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.940]
Come on.

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.000]
I wanted to plug it again.

[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.800]
You plugged it?

[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.420]
Yeah, well, you plugged it for me.

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.200]
I bet you did.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.440]
Yeah.

[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.060]
Well, what happened?

[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.980]
You got a call or something?

[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.300]
Yeah, I got three cars.

[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.680]
I did three cars from that plug.

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.380]
No.

[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.500]
Really?

[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.460]
Really a window-tilling car?

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.040]
Yeah, right.

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.340]
Of course.

[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.040]
This is the guy who comes and teens your windows.

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.760]
Yeah, and you come right to them, right?

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.220]
Exactly.

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.740]
Yeah.

[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.840]
By the way, you never told me if you had tenth on your car.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.940]
No, I don't want no ten.

[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.980]
I like smiling back at everybody, waving my cigar and saying you're number one.

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.460]
I like that.

[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.480]
Yeah, that's not bad.

[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.440]
I got nothing to hide.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.500]
Well, I got you couldn't hide anyway.

[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.180]
Forget it.

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.360]
Go ahead.

[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.340]
Give yourself a thing, man.

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.500]
All right, here we go again.

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.880]
Rick's mobile tilling.

[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.980]
734-725-0.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.680]
734-725-0.

[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.340]
724-725-0.

[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.220]
Rick's mobile titting.

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.900]
Yeah, we're coming.

[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.060]

[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.100]

[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.220]
We're coming.

[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.220]

[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.600]
You and he'll titted for you in your windows too.

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.980]
All right.

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.640]
Where our motto is, we come to you.

[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.300]
Okay.

[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.860]
All right.

[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.540]
Keep coming, Rick.

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.880]
Last time I called him, I asked you if you could play a red bar.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.640]
I forgot about that.

[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.580]
Yeah, can you play this time?

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.660]
I'll try to forget about it again.

[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.040]
I'll see you.

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.220]
All right.

[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.420]
Bye.

[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.200]
I hate those things.

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.160]
That's a random thing anyway, though.

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.900]
Stupid red bar.

[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.560]
What are they under?

[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.900]
Is it under red?

[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.500]
Oh, it is under red.

[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.940]
Maybe we can play like a real short one.

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.900]
Oh, we can't play this one.

[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.700]
That's bad.

[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.740]
That one's really bad.

[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.760]
Here's a short one.

[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.820]
Hello.

[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.540]
Oh, guys, excuse me.

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.640]
Sit.

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.540]
Sit.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.820]
What's the name?

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.160]
Sit down, now.

[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.960]
Stio WN.

[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.580]
Stio WN.

[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.600]
Down.

[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:19.980]
Down.

[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.160]
Stio WN.

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:21.840]
Down.

[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.640]
SID.

[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]
Sit down.

[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.280]
Sit down.

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.380]
Sit down.

[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:28.640]
Sit down here.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.940]
No, not here.

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.500]
Or sit down over here would be good.

[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.640]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.220]
Yeah.

[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.800]
How you doing, Nell?

[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.060]
Okay.

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.560]
This is your resident Brian Benning Ball Laws Joe Serella-Basher.

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:40.940]
Yes.

[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.700]
And I just wanted to ask you.

[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.980]
Did you notice that Bobby Clark grew some balls about a year late and pulls off a huge trade

[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.160]
that makes the flyers look like a halfway decent team?

[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.380]
I think he stuck it to us.

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.920]
I think he knew he was leaving it all along.

[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.040]
He lied through his teeth.

[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.820]
He gave away how good.

[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.540]
And then of course he pulled up a bonehead thing with that draft pick and instead of like

[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:04.780]
a trading it and getting a top-line player like Ray Sherp or to Stevie Eizerman, he goes and gets this kid Jovenoski who's not ready for prime time.

[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.540]
It may never be.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.660]
And he knew he was getting out of here.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.020]
I think we ought to file a lawsuit against Bobby Clark.

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.380]
But do you think it was Bobby Clark?

[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.160]
You think there might have been greater forces in the adult?

[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.240]
It was Bobby Clark.

[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.420]
Trust me, the man's in itty.

[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:15.980]
I think he said.

[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.240]
And of course we just happen to be in the same division you notice.

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.580]
You notice that?

[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.460]
Maybe Wayne took a look at Eizerman salary and said screw this.

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.960]
Oh, there is no question about that.

[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.280]
I've been talking to that all along.

[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.680]
This guy is not going to pay the kind of salaries to bring a superstar to this team.

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.500]
We got two outstanding goalies.

[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.080]
You named me one guy we got on that team who's a superstar outside of the barn.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.940]
He's a good player.

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.140]
But he's not a superstar.

[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.920]
He's a budding superstar.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.300]
But I'm talking about a full fledged like an Eizerman, a Fedoroff, like even his kid Paul Carrea that's a duckstrafted.

[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.020]
I'm talking about a guy who is beyond a question going to be a big superstar.

[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.200]
We ain't got one.

[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.740]
Well, I keep your eyes open.

[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.860]
Still he burns is going to emerge.

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.780]
Well, I love Stu Barnes.

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.260]
He's great.

[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.300]
That's the one.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:58.780]
Stu Barnes is God.

[00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.580]
But you're right.

[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.860]
Everybody else does kind of suck.

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.420]
No, I'm not saying the whole team sucks.

[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.880]
I'm just saying you got to have, you got to start building.

[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.840]
If you're going to build, you got to go out there and get some real big name somebody.

[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.340]
Not some guy from the Vipers for crying out loud.

[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.420]
The Vipers.

[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.280]
Well, that's a slap in the push, man.

[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.640]
And they're dying to get rid of Steve Irons, too.

[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.280]
They're begging and pleading to get rid of him.

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.300]
I'll take him.

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.740]
Me too.

[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.080]
Okay.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.900]
See him.

[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.080]
1218 at WIOD.

[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.520]
George.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.560]
Sir.

[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.640]
Hi.

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.780]
This is Erin Summers.

[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.400]
Tonight, you need to pick up your cash and phone.

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.620]
Because it's all about your favorite adult films.

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.300]
Plus, we have a special in-studio guest.

[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.780]
Adult film star Randy West.

[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.840]
Passion phones.

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.260]
With Erin Summers, we dite eight till midnight.

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.440]
A news talk and entertainment radio.

[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.560]
610 WIOD.

[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:48.960]
And WIOD.

[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.980]
Talk radio for the 90s.

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.140]
The decade.

[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.360]
Not the age.

[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.020]
It's big deal.

[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.900]
It's big in a boat.

[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.420]
Yeah, I know.

[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.940]
1221 at WIOD.

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.760]
So anyway, what am I going to do with this other pair?

[00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.960]
I got a spare pair here.

[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.540]
And the kids, Sean, you know, Sean, you're a nice kid and all of that other stuff.

[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.300]
I think maybe you better elope with Iron Mic or something over there at the track.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.940]
Because he never called.

[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.740]
And I got, you know, I was saving that one ticket.

[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.060]
I'll call you on my lunch break and noon.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.840]
He's playing hard to get.

[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.680]
I don't know if I can come there.

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.780]
Who cares, you know, I can't deal with that.

[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.540]
I mean, I hear I'm doing something nice for people and they still, well, we don't know.

[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.740]
See, there's no, I mean, if it was me, if I was living somewhere and it was a hockey game,

[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.880]
I don't care who was playing.

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.960]
And I had a chance to get a good seat for free and go there and sit in like, in peace and watch a great game.

[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.580]
I would grab it, baby.

[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.820]
I would grab it immediately.

[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.540]
So now I got this pair and I don't know what the hell to do with them.

[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.200]
We got a spare pair.

[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.820]
We'll figure it out.

[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.840]
WIOD.

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.560]
Welcome, Neil.

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.300]
I'd like to have your pair.

[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:43.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.860]
To the game.

[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.640]
What about the tickets?

[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.320]
And the tickets too.

[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.840]
Who are you bringing?

[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.520]
Uh, don't know. Probably my girlfriend.

[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.240]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.080]
Please.

[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.900]
And you'll show up?

[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.440]
I will be there. Promise.

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.720]
Section 125. I know where you sit.

[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.840]
Yeah. I will take them. I will be there happily.

[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.020]
Okay, now, you're going to have to pick them up here at the front orifice.

[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.140]
At the front orifice?

[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.520]
Right.

[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.600]
You give me directions.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.260]
I have 30.

[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.220]
Before 530.

[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.120]
Before 530.

[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.460]
George will give you all the dope, okay?

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.200]
Thanks a lot, buddy.

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.120]
I want your end directions, too.

[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.120]
Hang on.

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.680]
You're the great.

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.960]
Okay. There are guys on three.

[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.480]
No, I just don't want those seats empty.

[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.140]
You know, all this crap.

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.040]
But while he's trying to recruit young boys up there again, you know something.

[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.260]
If Alex Bennett was here and he had hockey tickets, whichever.

[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.460]
He's too much of a pussy to go to a hockey game.

[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.280]
But if Alex Bennett was here and he was trying to go like to some sporting event of some kind

[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.220]
or do a concert and he had a bunch of tickets that was trying to pass him out to a bunch of 18-year-old

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.200]
uh, large, breasted young ladies.

[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.380]
All these same guys just, all right, Alex.

[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.320]
And I'm like, baby.

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.260]
But because we'd have a lot, like to have a nice bunch of young guys in that row, all of legal

[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.300]
age, of course, because we don't want to offend any of these right-wing born again.

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.580]
So we're so concerned that everybody is molesting children, which is what they're probably doing,

[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.680]
including their parish priest.

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.360]
But then that's a bad deal, okay?

[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.120]
I'd like to have some like living and breathing some vibrant people in that row for a change.

[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.060]
Instead of seeing next to Woody Graber in his 800 pound gun.

[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.120]
Oh, and speaking of Woody Graber, by the way, where's our tickets, baby?

[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.940]
And speaking of Jeff Moss, you know, this is now starting to get me aggravated.

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.920]
Today is the 15th of February.

[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.100]
We got, what is it?

[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.740]
Nine games on a schedule that we don't have any tickets yet for, that they're printing new tickets,

[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.880]
because the dates don't correspond to the old schedule.

[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.020]
And the first one of those just happens to be a week from yesterday, six days from today,

[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.260]
the 21st, and of course it'll be harder and harder to get a ticket for that game.

[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.920]
The Rangers, the dreaded, the very mediocre this year, thank God, after they shot their wild last year,

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.020]
the mediocre Rangers.

[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.200]
The Ranger Game on Tuesday, which requires a replacement ticket.

[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.940]
Where's Woody Graber with those tickets, George?

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.300]
Inquiring minds 1 and 0, and the other rate games as well.

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.700]
That really stinks the joint out.

[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.900]
W-I-O-D.

[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.080]
Is this the line that you're on? W-I-O-D?

[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.020]
Yeah, I'd like to speak the needle.

[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:48.700]
Speaking.

[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.120]
This is needle?

[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:50.920]
This is needle.

[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.920]
No, man, I'd like to speak the needle.

[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.580]
This is he.

[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.360]
No, I'd listen to him.

[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.040]
Let me say it again. This is I, yes?

[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.300]
Neal, I want to speak about the legalization of marijuana.

[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.460]
A meta-terwanna?

[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.940]
Yes.

[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.440]
How long you been working on his voice?

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.880]
Me, nah, enough, I just like a little rip there, Neal.

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.560]
D-Raceously different marijuana.

[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.480]
D-Raceously different marijuana.

[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:15.800]
Yeah.

[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.540]
Yeah.

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.500]
And I'm just killing it right here.

[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.740]
I'm just a homie here from higher league here, chilling.

[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.380]
And I just like to call somebody a douchebag.

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:24.780]
Yeah.

[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.340]
D-Raceously different marijuana.

[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.440]
D-Raceously different marijuana.

[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.140]
These are the best, man.

[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.040]
This I'll tell you this show today, they should put this in a space capsule.

[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.480]
They should send it all away as far as Neptune, maybe even to Uranus.

[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.100]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:41.820]
Hello?

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.940]
Too late.

[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.740]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.060]
Neal, God.

[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.600]
Yes.

[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.840]
How you doing, Neal?

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.240]
Okay.

[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.040]
Hi, the rumors about Hilar, I guess they're true.

[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.120]
The rumors about what?

[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.200]
J-Hylar?

[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.600]
What rumors?

[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.060]
Uh, that he's bald.

[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.180]
Uh, that he's bald.

[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.560]
What rumors?

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.460]
That he's bald?

[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.120]
Okay, he's bald and he's ugly.

[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.900]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.920]
Drive in Hongda**** Ready for 찍.

[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.700]
Drive in Hongda**** U.

[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.900]

[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.200]

[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.120]

[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.580]
You know everything, you know.

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.040]
We'll help you through the traffic.

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.240]
Drive in Hongda**** Music.

[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.480]
Drive in Hongda, see,

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.800]
we don't want mushy quality on performance.

[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.560]
We mighta risk my handle ஌ for it.

[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:22.800]
Move a little bit.

[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:22.800]

[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.200]
He's a fork too.

[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.060]
to help you through the traffic.

[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.940]
Share a smile or two.

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.180]
Oh!

[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.320]
F帝 Carlos driving home with you every day.

[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:33.880]
What the?

[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.920]
F帝 Carlos driving home on some place

[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.640]
special W. I. O. D.

[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.960]
That's a beautiful thing.

[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.900]
Thank you so much for inspiring me to play that

[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.940]
so we could actually hear it.

[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.400]
I like the guys that play.

[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.060]
Hold me.

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.520]
You know, the muddy stuff,

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.160]
like an Argyles sock over their thing and on the phone too.

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.480]
W. I. O. D.

[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.320]
Neil, did you give away your pair?

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.400]
Yes I did.

[00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.020]
Oh.

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.640]
Sorry. W. I. O. D.

[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:01.840]
Where's Neil?

[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.560]
Right here.

[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.380]
Oh, Neil.

[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.040]
This is me.

[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.680]
Hey, this is as good as it gets.

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.300]
I'm apocalyptic because I don't have my tickets for the 21st either yet.

[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.040]
I have not received.

[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.940]
So in other words, I'm glad you're just a kind of guy

[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.560]
I want to speak to.

[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.580]
You're a seasoned ticket holder.

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:13.900]
Yes sir.

[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.260]
And they haven't set him out yet.

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.460]
And Jeff Moss, I'm going to tell you something right now.

[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.800]
You are the biggest derelict.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.620]
He keeps trying to make up by, you know,

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.800]
once in a blue moon, they'll send me a thing saying we got 85,000 empty seats

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.020]
for tonight's game when they're desperate.

[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.460]
But generally speaking, we are in the dark.

[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.380]
And I want before we leave here today, I wanted to definitive word.

[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.280]
He told Woody Graber they were going to be mailed out last week.

[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.680]
Then what he saw, I'm like before the game Saturday or Sunday, one of the weekend games.

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.740]
They're going to be definitely mailed out this week.

[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.940]
Well, either the pony got very sick or Jeff as usual is full of crap.

[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.480]
If I don't have those tickets to my end by Friday, there's going to be big problems.

[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.560]
Oh, exactly.

[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.720]
Now listen, Yammy Yager's God.

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:54.780]
He is.

[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.060]
Yeah.

[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.140]
They are playing Quebec on either Sunday or Tuesday.

[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.600]
They got a big game with Quebec coming up.

[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.880]
Now is that on any type of TV?

[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.260]
I mean, I went to the bar and watch this.

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.820]
But you go to the bar and watch it there too.

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.600]
No matter if they got, let's see, Hartford,

[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.340]
which you know, they're going to tie this record of unbeaten because they got Hartford tomorrow night in Pittsburgh

[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.760]
and then Saturday night or afternoon Hartford.

[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.740]
And then I think the game after that I believe is Quebec.

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.200]
Wow.

[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.400]
That's the, that's going to be a ballbuster.

[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.620]
But this Yager and this Martin Strachah, one, two, tandem is just unbelievable.

[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.680]
I don't think Strachah even played last night.

[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.240]
No.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.320]
I don't think so.

[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.240]
No, it's funny.

[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:28.800]
You mentioned that.

[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.580]
I think Marty Strachah did not play last night.

[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.620]
I could be wrong.

[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.620]
He had the same line with him, isn't he?

[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.920]
He's your normally on the same line.

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.460]
Would Yager?

[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:34.880]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.460]
No, Ron Francis and Luke Robotire in line.

[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.600]
That's the best line in the league.

[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.220]
Ron Francis is the center and you got Robotire and Yager on the wings.

[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:42.820]
Okay.

[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.260]
Now tonight we got rated on coming in.

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:45.940]
What's the story?

[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.880]
Has he done anything yet?

[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.660]
Not a thing.

[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.060]
Nothing.

[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.300]
If you want to see a good player, of course they got day and they got yashing.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.640]
But you want to see a good young player that the Panthers could have had.

[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.180]
Watch that Rob Goodrow, man.

[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.080]
This kid is a real player.

[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.220]
He's got four points already, which for them is pretty good.

[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:58.800]
He's got three goals.

[00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.980]
He's a real player.

[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.420]
He wears number 10.

[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:01.860]
Okay.

[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.300]
Rob Goodrow, the kid is a player.

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.020]
They got him from the sharks and we could have had him and we didn't want him.

[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.820]
Sharks, another team.

[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.820]
And you're going to be very upset when you see that there's some good young talent out there.

[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.660]
We didn't want it probably because they wanted some money.

[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.040]
Exactly.

[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.160]
Now that we have done sure he waiting on the line or not.

[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.320]
He'll be here any second.

[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.740]
We're waiting by it holding it.

[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:16.960]
Okay.

[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.980]
Squeeze it tight.

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.040]
Get out a couple of moles and then he'll be right with us.

[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.880]
1229 at WIOD, you know.

[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.700]
16 WIOD bigger than Madonna's ever imagined.

[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.560]
Moles and hockey night in Canada on CBC.

[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.160]
Brought to you by Moles and exports.

[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.980]
Excess it all.

[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.900]
By board of Canada where quality is job one.

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.800]
It's working by Imperial oil and deso associates.

[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.820]
Brought to be one of the leading sponsors of Utah key in Canada.

[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.720]
And by Pepsi.

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.160]
Got a habit.

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.460]
So listen Don, Sherry.

[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.740]
We don't know what I know about hockey.

[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.620]
We want to know about rich construction in Rochester, New York.

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.340]
Hey, I tell you that I was put one of the happiest times of my life with my buddy.

[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.300]
Wait, Smith, we used to have a Jackhammer.

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.660]
We worked eight hours a day and we had a few pipes after it was a lot of fun.

[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.500]
Yeah, few pipes after it sounds like things haven't changed then.

[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.360]
Not one bit.

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.400]
Hey, I love that opening.

[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.000]
I'll tell you.

[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.480]
We don't mess around.

[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:33.780]
We don't do any guest on issue, but in your case, we made an exception because it's great to have a guy who knows a little bit about hockey here, but I got some good stuff.

[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.540]
See, this isn't going to be no cream puffs with Ron McLean.

[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.120]
I'm ready.

[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.520]
This is going to be a little bit different.

[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.420]
We don't toss the marshmallows that you guys like.

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.620]
They do on hockey night in Canada.

[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.900]
Now, the first thing, you know, I've been a maple leaf fan thirty seven years through the good times, the punch him like they is in the bad times.

[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.120]
And you know, the season we have to wait through the lockout crap, which I don't even want to talk about.

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.320]
It's too disgusting to even mention.

[00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:02.560]
We have to wait for that and you come on right out of the box and you with this vitriolic attack against my good buddies Cliff Fletcher and Pat Burns for the trade with Quebec.

[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.640]
What's that?

[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.900]
What's that?

[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.040]

[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.060]
What's that mean?

[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:06.960]
Rotesque.

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:07.940]
Unacceptable.

[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.220]
Geez.

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:08.560]
I know.

[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.120]
That's the word.

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.920]
Listen to me.

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.700]
Are you going to cut a little slack from that Sunday?

[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.000]
You guys get not at all.

[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.060]
You know what?

[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.940]
It was right 12 feet from them.

[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.660]
I was a captain.

[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.220]
Your spots.

[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:19.560]
Neil.

[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.180]
I really hated that trade.

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.540]
Yeah, I got to admit Sundays putting the puck in the net nine goals.

[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.140]
Nine goals.

[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.100]
Same as when the same as when the

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.760]
Yes, but what place are they in?

[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.720]
And yeah, but you one guy let me tell you something and you're probably a disagree, but Sylvain Lafay was the thing that bothers me about that trade.

[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.660]
Wendell's great, huh?

[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.820]
You better believe it.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.800]
Sylvain Lafay plus this Garth butcher couldn't carry Sylvain Lafay's jockstrat.

[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.620]
Well, Lafay is not a good fighter.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.620]
There's either night with Kelly Chase.

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.700]
He's not a good fighter, but he's a great defenseman.

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.460]
He's a plus guy.

[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.980]
He was up there all last year plus 30 plus 34.

[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.440]
When you look at a guy's plus and minus, that'll tell you what kind of a player he is.

[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.380]
Well, plus the you remember Bobby or when he was he was plus 33.

[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.680]
Let's say Bobby or do I remember Bobby or you know, I'm glad you mentioned that right now because we got a guy down here

[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.920]
It is a real irritant to all of us his name is Denise.

[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.560]
He likes to pretend it's Dennis.

[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.140]
He's one of those frogs up there.

[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.020]
You know, Denise pot fan.

[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.760]
Denise pot fan.

[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.720]
Okay, now let me tell you something this Denise pot fan and for our mutual friend Jeff Rimmer

[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.420]
This guy does a good job with the Panthers.

[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.580]
He's got to be settled with this guy and all he talks about is Hall of Famer Denise.

[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.360]
Hall of Famer.

[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.300]
I don't give a crap.

[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.440]
He's a Hall of Famer and then he got all upset of it.

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.700]
And then he said, because somebody made the comment to him that, well, you know, Bobby or was the greatest defenseman of all time.

[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.220]
He took exception to that like he could play on the same ice.

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.720]
Bobby or wasn't the greatest defenseman of all time.

[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.480]
He was the greatest player of all time.

[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.720]
Well, Neil, you know, I knew I was right.

[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.200]
The reason I come on this station listened to last year.

[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.420]
74 or 75, he really played.

[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.340]
He had 46 goals.

[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.740]
89 assists.

[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.700]
He was plus 128.

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.780]
James, is that crap?

[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:52.620]
Unbelievable.

[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.240]
He was and you're absolutely greatest player.

[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.780]
I picked search of art.

[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.380]
He said, he said there was players.

[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:04.000]
There was stars, superstars and then there was Bobby or and Bobby Clark who used to be down.

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.280]
No, now he was so good.

[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.540]
They should have had another league for him.

[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.840]
You drove a spirit through our hearts now with Bobby Clark.

[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.540]
This man, you know, he must have known he was leaving here last year and he did everything to just destroy.

[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.860]
First of all, last year he trades away this little kid Greg Hogood.

[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.340]
Now all he's doing is playing for the best team in league for Pittsburgh.

[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.780]
He's great on the power play.

[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.520]
He's a great little point guy's a small guy.

[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.980]
You saw I know you saw last night.

[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.000]
I never came back.

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.980]
You noticed after that either.

[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.280]
I don't think we'll see him for about a week.

[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.220]
He won't be doing that again.

[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.580]
But this kid is a player.

[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.440]
And who do we get?

[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.740]
We get Jeff Daniels.

[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:34.960]
Okay.

[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.260]
Well, guess what happened this morning?

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.300]
Jeff Daniels is gone long overdue.

[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.540]
Never scored a point with us.

[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.760]
And who do we get for him?

[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.920]
We get Jason Wolley from the Detroit Vipers from the Vincile Vipers.

[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.560]
What kind of a deal is that?

[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.980]
Well, you can't play Bobby Clark for that one.

[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.900]
No, not for that one.

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.300]
But how about the number one draft pick?

[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.520]
When you got the number one draft pick,

[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.380]
you're in a expansion team.

[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.860]
We missed by one point last year making a playoffs.

[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.900]
We had a hell of a good year.

[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.140]
We got the best goalie.

[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.380]
I mean that we could possibly have the visa and Fitzpatrick ain't bad either.

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.100]
And instead of training away the number one draft pick for like

[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.360]
we had a chance to get Stevie I's or meant not too bad.

[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.760]
We had a chance to get Ray Shepard.

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.200]
He's been leading the league and scoring up until a Yaguar went nuts.

[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.060]
And what do we do?

[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.800]
We keep him and his kid is down in the minor.

[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.920]
He's not ready for prime time.

[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.620]
Mr. Ovenoski.

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.840]
It may never be all that good.

[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.340]
Oh, no.

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840]
You got Jovenoski.

[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.760]
I love this kid.

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.560]
You're going to love him for a few years.

[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:20.800]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.700]
Go lead me.

[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.680]
That's exactly the story.

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.620]
He's going to be a force on defense.

[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.960]
Mark my words on that.

[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.660]
I hope you're right.

[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.200]
Because boy, we've been playing these stiffs like Joe Serella and Brian

[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.880]
vetting these guys.

[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.580]
They're just that.

[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.180]
That's not that.

[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:31.900]
Huh?

[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.180]
Joe Serella's not a star.

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.820]
He's not even playing now.

[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.920]
No, but he's pretty good.

[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.660]
He must have the pictures, man.

[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.620]
He must have those pictures.

[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.660]
The darn jury right.

[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.100]

[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.000]
You're tough guy.

[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.680]
I am a tough guy.

[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.120]
We don't seem to be out of the room.

[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.200]
They won't let a fact like me in addressing him.

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.740]
I'll tell you that.

[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.340]
And speaking of that, let me tell you about that.

[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.260]
By the way, you know, let you see,

[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.780]
you think you're going to get off easy on this show.

[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.620]
Last year, I watched hockey night in Canada.

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.040]
My satellite dish here.

[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.560]
Can that Pavel Burrey stuff?

[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:55.880]
Okay.

[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.020]
You got that letter I saw you read it on here that week on coach's corner

[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.640]
about Pavel Burrey and how beautiful he is.

[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.680]
He's androgynous and all this other crap.

[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.580]
Now, you Canadian guys, you're always pandering this real homophobic stuff.

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.340]
Now, I know there's a lot of facts in the NHL.

[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.200]
I don't want to tell you they are.

[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:10.900]
It'll break your heart.

[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.280]
But, but I do want.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.620]
I know who they are.

[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.660]
I've seen them.

[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.020]
Believe me.

[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.860]
I'm in the locker room.

[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.520]
I will.

[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.820]
Rimmer told me the names.

[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.440]
He knows them all.

[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.460]
But listen to me.

[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.020]
You know, I love Bob Cole, Harry Neal, or greater watch hockey night in Canada.

[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.960]
But Harry Neal, now here's a guy, the best color man in hockey.

[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.280]
Every time there's a beautiful play, a great passing play,

[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.780]
Harry Neal says where they're showing a replay.

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.940]
Here's a lovely little pass from Gilmour to Androcia.

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.340]
A lovely little pass.

[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.160]
What kind of a macho expression is that?

[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.860]
On you, macho, damn Canadians talking about.

[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.240]
Here's a lovely little pass.

[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.640]
Even I wouldn't say that.

[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.940]
Well, yes, I know.

[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.260]
And I don't understand.

[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.420]
I can't take all the blame for Harry.

[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.420]
You know, give me, I get enough trouble myself.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.320]
Well, he's got a problem.

[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.960]
He lives in Buffalo.

[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.260]
That probably is his problem.

[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:55.560]
Well, I do.

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.800]
Listen, imagine living in Buffalo for 12 months.

[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.200]
All right.

[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:58.820]
That's anybody.

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.300]
Now, somebody I told him that that was going to have you on the show.

[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.080]
They said you got to play a little Fred Kusik for, for grapes.

[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.220]
Holds over the line.

[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.800]
Hold in.

[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.160]
Dropping.

[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.000]
For Casatana.

[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.360]
In.

[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.860]
For a backhand at block number.

[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.460]
Reves the net.

[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.520]
He's in deep.

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.360]
Holds.

[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:11.980]
Able to get it.

[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.580]
Looking for Neal in front.

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.260]
But that jamming on him and for now moves in.

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.920]
In the screen saying rebound.

[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.380]
Fade for the shot.

[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.940]
For Dealee.

[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.540]
Nealee on the third rebound.

[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.540]
Makes it one to one.

[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.220]
But Austin, how do you like that?

[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.420]
I love Nealee.

[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:28.800]
He's right.

[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.100]
He'll tell you something boy.

[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.860]
There's no better part of ever been in the league than Cam.

[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.160]
Nealee.

[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.140]
How'd you like him last night?

[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.960]
Right there in front of the net makes it four to three.

[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.080]
They outchewed Pittsburgh 23 to two and a half.

[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.340]
And you know, there's another thing that bothers me last night.

[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:40.660]
I'm watching.

[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.920]
He's penguins all season long.

[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.940]
I watch him on the dish.

[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.380]
And here they got this, you know,

[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.800]
Barasso gets her, which may be the best thing that ever happened to him.

[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.960]
Cause I'm not that crazy about him.

[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.680]
He's hot and cold.

[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.340]
And Ken Reggett.

[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.580]
Here's a maple leaf reject.

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.180]
He's stunked the join out with the Leafs.

[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.480]
He's playing.

[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.080]
And don't tell me he's getting a better team because he's got defense.

[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.940]
Cause you know, Pittsburgh doesn't play any defense.

[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.160]
All they got is those two big Swedish goons out there.

[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.760]
And he's a big goon.

[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.160]
And he's setting the world on fire.

[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.480]
Well, you get a chance.

[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.440]
And a lot of guys said I've never I've heard of many times before.

[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.660]
And they never ever reached their peak till around 23 24 25 26.

[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.520]
He's paid his dues and I couldn't.

[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.380]
He's a real good guy.

[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.500]
I'm happy glad I have to.

[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.740]
But he's got to look at that.

[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.400]
All he sounds.

[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.680]
And he's got a look at the area.

[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.700]
Hey, I got admitted.

[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.360]
The air is good.

[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.000]
I keep her.

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.080]
But I mean, tell me does he look stupid in that Joe.

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.720]
I all meant see now you're worried about how you're worried about how the guys look.

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.740]
They can't all look good.

[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.680]
They can't all look as good as Luke Robotin.

[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.600]
Now what are you talking about?

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.040]
They can't all look like Stevie I said.

[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.080]
Many want guys who are pretty.

[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.040]
You want guys who can play.

[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.100]
I like guys look like nearly talking.

[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.620]
What?

[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.060]
You want like that rugged guy?

[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.980]
You want pretty guys.

[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.260]
The Leafs have got to get Drake Burrowski back out there again.

[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.200]
What the hell happened to him?

[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.540]
You don't want to burn him, ain't he?

[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.180]
You're pretty sure.

[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.060]
Hey, you won't slip one by me.

[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.160]
I'll tell you that right now boy.

[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.480]
38 years living and dying with that blue and white.

[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.720]
Well, they're up there.

[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.760]
They got one right call.

[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.540]
One right call had about five ships.

[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.900]
He knocked a few guys around.

[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.340]
That's right.

[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.000]
That's what they need is a little muscle out there.

[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:00.740]
They got marked.

[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.900]
They're talking about getting Brian Marksman back again.

[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.460]
So he wanted to hurt guys like Gartner.

[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.180]
So they're going to get some more muscle.

[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.300]
I was early problem.

[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.980]
They get rid of Grounds.

[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.180]
They get rid of Pierce.

[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.040]
They get rid of Clark.

[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.080]
They get rid of LaFave who wasn't a muscle guy,

[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.000]
but a great defenseman.

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.600]
They bring this kid.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.240]
And I haven't heard you talk too much about him.

[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.320]
The kid with a bad complexion.

[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.040]
He ought to get borrow some of the clear seal

[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.320]
from Felix for a crime out there.

[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.180]
This Johnson kid.

[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.520]
He's got a Facebook aziz, which he, I guess he.

[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.480]
I get what you're talking about.

[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.820]
How guys look for a crime outlaw.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.520]
This guy looks like a walk in clear seal.

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.160]
He's got more zits than I've ever seen.

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.260]
And the Boy Scots for a crime outlaw.

[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.940]
And this kid, the first game of the year,

[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.940]
he gives away two goals.

[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.180]
The first or second game of the year.

[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.700]
He gave away two falls on his ass.

[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.320]
This guy better learn you got to go out there

[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.140]
and hit some guys.

[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.780]
Never hit.

[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.200]
Never hit.

[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.720]
He's a sweet.

[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.940]
He's not playing badly.

[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:45.900]
Lee again.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.840]
Another guy with a Joe.

[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.660]
I haven't masked.

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.620]
I eat too easy to pick on.

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.960]
I haven't picked on him at all.

[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.000]
But he's he's weak.

[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.140]
Well, he is weak.

[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:53.940]
He plays like that.

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.980]
From in Detroit.

[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.540]
He's the same style handle the puck.

[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.760]
But when the crutch comes,

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.860]
he's got the flu right now.

[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.540]
So bear house key will be playing tonight.

[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.420]
Well, thank God.

[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.780]
At least we got somebody looks good out there.

[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.460]
I need a good look.

[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.500]
Get that bear house key.

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.120]
You got a better.

[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.540]
You better believe it.

[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.960]
He's got a better complexion anyway.

[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.040]
I bet you want to.

[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.040]
You know, you're always talking about the Swedes and all of that.

[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.500]
I bet you you'd take Borea Salming on a Leafs right now.

[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.880]
He may be 50 years old.

[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.900]
He could probably skate up a suit up and play tonight.

[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.580]
You know, you're that's the one guy.

[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.720]
The one sweet that always showed up to play every night.

[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.040]
He blocked shots.

[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.860]
I remember one time he got an awful cut.

[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.520]
Remember that cut.

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.200]
He got 52 stitches in the face.

[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.300]
Come back to the next game.

[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.700]
You know, I have to admit Borgie Salming always turned up to play.

[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.700]
I want to try to get you on a campaign on something.

[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.440]
Okay, this has got.

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.400]
I just got to do personal because I became a hockey fan.

[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.420]
I never saw a hockey game when I was a hockey fan.

[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:41.880]
How do you like that?

[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.000]
I was a kid growing up in Rochester right across the lake.

[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.180]
You grew up in Rochester?

[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:46.940]
Damn right.

[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.220]
I know Jerry Chivers from long before you ever knew him.

[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.120]
I was in the Amherst.

[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.380]
The first game they ever played there.

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:51.900]
Sure I did.

[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.100]
Holy Diana.

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.580]
I don't know.

[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.520]
I spent 10 years in Rochester.

[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.220]
Best time.

[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.360]
Over on Round Brown, Cothdavin.

[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.700]
You have one 81 L.

[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.080]
I'm Drive.

[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.080]
Do you remember that one?

[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.700]
I sure do.

[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.880]
Great, beautiful spot.

[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.540]
I remember that.

[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.980]
In the world, Cothdavin Rochester, waiting spet.

[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.960]
He was my construction supervisor.

[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.080]
That's one of the best cities I've ever lived in.

[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.040]
One of the greatest places.

[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.220]
The 10 or 12 days out of the year when they got great weather.

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.280]
The rest of the year forget it.

[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.720]
But those 10 or 12 days are paradise.

[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.580]
So anyway, I'm a kid.

[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.080]
I'm growing up.

[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.460]
And I'm listening to the radio.

[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.500]
I was a big sports fan.

[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.760]
I used to be a baseball fan.

[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.580]
I listened to Bob Prince on K because up north, you know, you can get the stations from

[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.280]
all over the country.

[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.080]
And once Saturday night, I'm listening.

[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.200]
I'm here on CBL740 in Toronto.

[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.100]
I want to hear this voice.

[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.380]
And this is what really I'm going to crusade on this.

[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.940]
OK, I'm going to see you're the guy who can do it.

[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.780]
And I hear this voice and it sounds awful exciting.

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.880]
And I thought, what is this?

[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.420]
It's not a baseball game.

[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.660]
It's not the right time of the year for that.

[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.840]
What the hell kind of a game is this?

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.800]
And it's a hockey game.

[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.380]
It's the Maple Leafs and whoever the hell they're playing.

[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.620]
And it's Bill Hewitt.

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.040]
Bill Hewitt, you better believe it.

[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.220]
It's just like, oh, you need.

[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.680]
Boy, the salmig move's in.

[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.180]
He's got it in the corner.

[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.660]
Lightning McGurne will try to get him out.

[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.780]
Here you go with Bill Hewitt.

[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.620]
And boy, you're selling me.

[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.120]
How do you like that?

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.740]
Right on the one.

[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.060]
You got some library down there.

[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.700]
I got a library.

[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.900]
But anyway, so I'm listening to that.

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.460]
I became a big Leafs fan because you insulted me right there.

[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.680]
You said he sounded like Foster.

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.780]
Now listen to me.

[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.160]
Foster was a pioneer.

[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.100]
OK, so everybody says, well, Foster Hewitt, Danny Gallivan.

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.560]
Now Danny Restonfeece was great.

[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.660]
We just lost him a while ago.

[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.780]
He was terrific with the Canadians because I was a Leaf fan.

[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.640]
So I hated those guys.

[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.920]
But he was a great announcer.

[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.620]
But Foster was the pioneer.

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.620]
He sounded like my grandmother in Heaton.

[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.820]
She's been dead for 20 years.

[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.500]
He sounded like his sterical old lady.

[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.280]
He was a shriall.

[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.540]
But Bill Hewitt to me was the most exciting guy that ever

[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.460]
announced the hockey game.

[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.200]
He doesn't get any credit.

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.720]
You guys are always playing these highlights.

[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.060]
And there's Bill's voice in the back.

[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.460]
I know he had some problems.

[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:41.920]
And I know.

[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.360]
But he was an announcer for more than 20 years for the Leafs.

[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.800]
He's still alive last time we checked.

[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.420]
Yeah, he is.

[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.140]
And we never hear nothing about him.

[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.100]
No, you're right, too.

[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.840]
But we tried to get him out a few times.

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.020]
But he lives on a farm now.

[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.920]
And he wouldn't come on.

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.000]
He's got some kind of sickness or something.

[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.260]
Yeah.

[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.760]
He's here to like his dad.

[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.580]
And in fact, I'll tell you, I knew Bill Hewitt before you.

[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.380]
He traveled when I played Junior back in 52, 53.

[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.860]
He traveled all the way out west to Winnipeg when we won

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.620]
the Memorial Cup.

[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.820]
And he was our announcer back Eastern Ontario.

[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.600]
So I knew him a long time before you.

[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.300]
He was terrific.

[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.340]
The only thing I've tried to do, I look at the roster

[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.560]
in the hockey hall of fame.

[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.580]
And it breaks my heart.

[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.420]
I see all these guys are in there,

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.440]
fosters in there, which of course he belongs in there.

[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.260]
And all these other guys are in the hockey hall of fame.

[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.400]
And I look where his bill he would's name in there.

[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.400]
You got to be the one guy that's got the influence while

[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.440]
a man is still alive.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.260]
I don't like this business.

[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.540]
He's on a guy after he's dead.

[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.140]
What the hell good is that going to do while a man is still alive

[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:36.580]
out there.

[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.580]
Let's get his name in at hockey hall of fame.

[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.200]
You don't know if nobody ever mentions that.

[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.100]
I did color for him my first year hockey night.

[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.580]
Canada.

[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.480]
He was great.

[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.300]
He made that game.

[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.420]
Yeah, he made the game.

[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.340]
But when I play that, those tapes, I get here on the back of my

[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:50.940]
neck stand up.

[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.500]
I get goosebumps.

[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.440]
That's how good he was.

[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.080]
He built up the excitement in those games.

[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:54.720]
He was terrific.

[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.920]
Well, I don't know what I can do.

[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.000]
But you're you'd be sad to know that nobody even knows he's alive up here.

[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.980]
And it's kind of sad.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.500]
Well, I want you.

[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.280]
I'm going to put you on it.

[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:03.560]
Assignment.

[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.300]
OK, forget about so many assignments.

[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.000]
Well, there's a there's a new one for you.

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.340]
OK.

[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.640]
OK, now listen and closing.

[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.640]
I said, appreciate you're taking the time to talk to us.

[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.240]
But I want to know.

[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:11.680]
It's been fun.

[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.540]
Listen to you.

[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.940]
Well, because I'm the only guy down here and know something about hockey.

[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.980]
Remember, thinks you know something.

[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.260]
He's he's brainwashed.

[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.000]
He's talking to Brian.

[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.000]
They bring him.

[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.040]
Remember is a company guy.

[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.520]
Is that all he's busy talking to Brian Marie knows guys all day in a

[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.900]
ketone?

[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.060]
Well, we're going to make a big deal.

[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.560]
I open a paper here and here's we got Jason Wolley.

[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.580]
Jason Wolley.

[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.020]
Well, I ever know a sheba.

[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.660]
Remember that record, the purple people here.

[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.420]
Purple people here.

[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.180]
That's really Wolley.

[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:33.440]
I know.

[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.580]
I think that's the guy that we got.

[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.600]
He's going to be shooting up tonight.

[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.680]
Are you down there?

[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.060]
You got to like Scott Melony.

[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.520]
Come on.

[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.000]
We like Stewie Barnes.

[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.320]
We like Melony.

[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.920]
Although this year he hasn't done much yet.

[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.640]
We got a few guys.

[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.480]
We got this fighting.

[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.940]
We got Jodie Hall out there.

[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.460]
He's a good kid.

[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.200]
We got a few guys.

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.140]
But we got to go out and get some scores out there.

[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.980]
We got to get some good ass kick and defense out there as well.

[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.920]
We need just one or two.

[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.880]
You talk to get him.

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.280]
He's nice to say let's get him.

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.340]
Where you going to get him?

[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.700]
You got to give up guys to get him.

[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.560]
I mean, and you don't have guys.

[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.240]
So you got to plug along and have the beasers stop the proxies.

[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.180]
Well, he can do that.

[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:04.940]
You guys, and that's it.

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.620]
You can do that.

[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.180]
I want to ask you about the Leafs, OK?

[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.180]
Because the Panthers, I go to every game.

[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.120]
They're my number two team, but the Leafs don't ever

[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.460]
give them up because 38 years is too long to change your allegiance.

[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.020]
That's true.

[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.280]
I want to know we got one.

[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.700]
They made all these changes, which I think too many to be

[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.300]
honest with you.

[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.020]
Huh?

[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.340]
At least six.

[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.120]
We got 10 different guys on the squad.

[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.360]
Now that we got the Rikle, which I like him, he's a good,

[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.160]
tough, knows player.

[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.680]
But what the hell is wrong?

[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.720]
We got one line intact.

[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.980]
We got Andrew Chuck and Gilmour and Borgeski.

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.660]
Borgeski hasn't scored a goal yet.

[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.720]
Dougi Gilmour, who I know is your favorite player.

[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.560]
He's a great guy.

[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:35.820]
What's the problem?

[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.280]
What's the problem?

[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.860]
He must be not 100%.

[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.000]
Well, what happens is he's not getting the quality ice time.

[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.040]
And it's nobody's fault.

[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.740]
What are you going to do?

[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.500]
There's Ridley Kid.

[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.680]
I love Ridley.

[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.420]
I add, and he can play the game.

[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.040]
But Dougi's not the number one guy on the ice taking all the draws

[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.940]
and everything right now.

[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:51.960]
They've got a few.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.060]
They've got, let me tell you about the Toronto team.

[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.720]
They've got it to one of the best goal tenders,

[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.000]
maybe the best goal tender in the game.

[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.500]
They're defenses a little weak.

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.860]
That's the thing that bothers me.

[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.360]
But they've got lots of explosive up front.

[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.600]
But you just don't give away guys like Buffave, Rouse,

[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.160]
Wendell Clark, Pearson, tough guys like that.

[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.100]
And expect they were an awful nasty, nasty team to play last year.

[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.040]
They're not an nasty team to play now.

[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.960]
And you got to be nasty.

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.280]
So, Jerry says too many pushy's on a team this year.

[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.800]
That's what he said.

[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.240]
You got it.

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:21.660]
You got it.

[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.300]
He had some hard-knosed fighters out there.

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.060]
Well, that's what I said.

[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.400]
You let me do all the dirty stuff.

[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.020]
No, no.

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.880]
I didn't write in hockey, not get it.

[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.020]
I said it the very first show you thought.

[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.580]
And I said, if they, you know, you realize your team, Toronto,

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.180]
were the only team that made the final four two years in a row.

[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.700]
They were the only team.

[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.160]
And you think I don't know that?

[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.760]
And they will not make it this year.

[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.420]
I've already said.

[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.180]
No, he's still saying this stuff.

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.100]
I still say they were not in the final four.

[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.300]
You're tearing my guts out.

[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.400]
You're tearing my guts out.

[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.800]
Well, I got to think it tried to stop my favorite.

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.580]
I grew up in Kingston 100 miles away.

[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.500]
They were my favorite team last year.

[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.620]
I love a tough team.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.340]
And they're not a tough team now.

[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.080]
And I had to say it.

[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.000]
He can't pick your spots.

[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.240]
I mean, you think it's not uncomfortable

[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.780]
around the Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens now when I walk in.

[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.140]
Geez.

[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.000]
Yeah.

[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.300]
Cliff, I understand they got like a dartboard,

[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.080]
Cliff and Pat had got you on the dartboard.

[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.460]
They got Jerry's push right on there.

[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:12.980]
They got it.

[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.020]
And they're hidden right in the middle

[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:14.680]
from what I understood.

[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.140]
Right between the eyes all the time,

[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.400]
but you can't pick your spots.

[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.040]
You said, River, I remember,

[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.020]
it's going to get mad at you.

[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.520]
You don't pick in a spot down there.

[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.260]
That's okay.

[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:22.980]
He's used to it.

[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.960]
He's used to it because the truth

[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.140]
it may hurt, but you got to deal with the truth sooner or later.

[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.540]
Well, listen, thanks a million, say hi to Rhino Claim

[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.180]
and Bob Quill.

[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.500]
Tell Harry to butcher up a little bit.

[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.740]
It's going to be a good, tell him no more.

[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.420]
What is it?

[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.220]
A lovely little pass.

[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.360]
That lovely little pass.

[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.080]
Every game, you know, Gilmour McA nice little behind it back

[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.920]
past and then Rich Eckel going there and sticking it.

[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.340]
And there's a watch and a replay.

[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.380]
There's a lovely little pass from Dougie Gilmour.

[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.380]
Come on, tell him to butcher up.

[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.600]
We're all starting to talk about that.

[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.000]
And we're going to put his name on a list of you.

[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.560]
Don't watch it.

[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.840]
He will never hear that again.

[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.220]
You will never all talk to him.

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.700]
And immediately phone us down to get off that lovely little pass.

[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.800]
And don't forget Bill, you had work on that for me.

[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.580]
I'll do my best.

[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.300]
Thanks a lot, Katie.

[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.580]
Bye.

[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.300]
Talk to you.

[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.920]
Bye, bye.

[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.600]
See now he said to Lou.

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.780]
Got a wonder about that cheering at Harry Neal.

[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.180]
Cherry and Harriet starting to rhyme.

[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.200]
He's unbelievable.

[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.400]
He's my kind of guy.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.460]
He's a guy with a big mouth.

[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.380]
Everybody loves him.

[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.820]
He wears crazy ties.

[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.480]
And for those people who don't know who to hell he is,

[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.560]
all I can say is.

[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.540]
So it's not reasonable for us to be withheld the sock.

[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.940]
That's just, and I'm just making that suggestion,

[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.700]
simply based on the assumption that EDTA testing

[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.760]
ought to be performed at all given the record before the court.

[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.800]
But I'm just assuming that for the sake of argument

[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.980]
before I address the issue.

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.040]
Just trying to be practical and just making that a subject.

[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.940]
They're working on the sock.

[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.500]
OK, they're trying to clean it right now.

[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]
1250, a W-I-D.

[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.440]
Remember that thing about the guy with the sock?

[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.240]
610, W-I-O-D.

[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.500]
We never stop the music.

[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.480]
Of course, we never started either.

[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.120]
OK, 1254, a W-I-D.

[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.280]
They're having a big argument now about the sock

[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.660]
and about the evidence and very shrek rhymes with Drek.

[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.540]
The Simpson team DNA experts have

[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.900]
an big to do here about the sock.

[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.700]
And you're not missing a damn thing.

[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:01.720]
W-I-O-D.

[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:02.840]
Yeah, Neal.

[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.020]
Hey, you know the guy I called before

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.760]
asking about the guy who works at the Burger King.

[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.160]
Yeah.

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.040]
That is a man becoming a woman.

[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.200]
Oh, it's a guy.

[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.440]
And then he's in transit.

[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.240]
He is in transit.

[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.800]
He's in limbo.

[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.900]
He's just about there too.

[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.320]
He's on the way from manhood to ladyhood.

[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.780]
Not quite, but he's almost there.

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.080]
And they got the balls to key.

[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.440]
I say hats off to them.

[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.000]
They got the ball.

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.520]
I guess they can't fire them, huh?

[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.440]
Maybe they don't want to.

[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.940]
Maybe they just have the balls to figure that's

[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.300]
to reach its own.

[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.860]
And he's going through a little change.

[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.000]
He's feeling the change.

[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.360]
Her name is Tanya or his name or whatever.

[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:32.960]
Tanya?

[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.780]
I don't know what he or him.

[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.120]
That's a nice manly name.

[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.180]
Tanya is in Tanya heart.

[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.820]
And he can't get much more macho than that.

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.400]
I guess so.

[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.300]
Hey, stop picking on Jason Wally.

[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.960]
Who is Jason Wally?

[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:43.740]
He's a good player.

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.440]
He's a fence man.

[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.080]
Michigan State.

[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.140]
Oh, he's now.

[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.640]
Why didn't you tell me that before I

[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.460]
talked to Don Sherries from Michigan State,

[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.040]
that change, like Brian Smolinsky.

[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.920]
Now we're talking about a real man.

[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:53.840]
He's a good player.

[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.720]
I hope so.

[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.340]
I hope you're right.

[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.460]
When we start getting guys from the Detroit Vipers,

[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.580]
I start getting real nervous.

[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.920]
Well, he played for the capitals, sir.

[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.100]
Yeah, he played here of 27 games.

[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.280]
He had one goal in four assists in three years.

[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.540]
That's pretty impressive to me.

[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.860]
No, I don't think he got the ice time,

[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.820]
because he's got a good shot.

[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.420]
He's a good player.

[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.200]
And then when Sherry starts telling me

[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.380]
that Joe Serella's a good player,

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.920]
I know that Serella's got not only pictures

[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.720]
of Roger Nielsen, he's got naked pictures

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.680]
everybody in the league.

[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.800]
He got a wonder about that.

[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.400]
That was, I mean, that was between that

[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.460]
and those lovely little passes.

[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.060]
I'm starting to worry about Sherry too now.

[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.760]
Hey, and closing?

[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.220]
Yes.

[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.520]
Mike Palmattear is God.

[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:25.960]
OK.

[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.560]
So yeah, here's a guy who has a Mike Palmattear fetish.

[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.360]
Palmattear was OK.

[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:30.900]
He was all right.

[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.640]
Maple Leafs.

[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.820]
There goes that hockey stuff again.

[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.060]
George is just non-plussed.

[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.320]
Here we go with his sports crap again.

[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.200]
We spent a half hour on sports and hockey

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.020]
and all this other crap.

[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.840]
And you can't even give those damn seats away.

[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.700]
Well, I guess we did.

[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:41.800]
Smarty pants.

[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.900]
And if that kid Sean is listening

[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.980]
our friend from the track, don't go

[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.480]
showing up and looking for no tickets tonight,

[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.260]
because we gave it away.

[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.060]
I didn't hear no phone call, no nothing.

[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.140]
And oh, I'm telling you, these guys

[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.680]
that just play it fast and loose.

[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.440]
Who needs it?

[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.780]
W-I-O-D.

[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.400]
Who's this, George?

[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.120]
Niel.

[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:57.840]
Niel.

[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.020]
Do you want to speak to it?

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.560]
It's Sean.

[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.020]
Niel.

[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.000]
Too late now, paly.

[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:01.700]
I know, buddy.

[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.460]
Listen, I'm sorry.

[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.300]
I'll take a rain check.

[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.620]
Yeah.

[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.520]
You make it up to me?

[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.980]
Will I make it up to you?

[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160]
Will you make it up to me?

[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:07.880]
That's the question.

[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.060]
You're going to have to start sitting a little closer

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.780]
at the track, Sean.

[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.340]
Who's at that college Monday or Tuesday?

[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.320]
Called me about what?

[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.720]
I know they said, what do you do some little boys

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.660]
with young boys with a pantaticket?

[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.520]
Who was it?

[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.280]
Yeah, was that Perry?

[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.500]
Just some O'shaan provocateur.

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]
Perry, Perry Mason.

[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:24.880]
Yeah, I was Perry Mason.

[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.840]
He's asking a lot of questions.

[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.640]
Don't start using people's names on a year now, Sean.

[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]
Like Perry Mason?

[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.340]
How do I know who that was?

[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.480]
Just some troublemaker.

[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.800]
Just somebody trying to paint an ugly picture.

[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.400]
So probably some priest that's getting jealous.

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.860]
A lot of people don't like you, Niel.

[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.060]
Yeah, and you know something?

[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.200]
I'm delighted about that.

[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.660]
How come I get away to have an hour

[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.380]
to get through on the phone?

[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.220]
Because we're doing screenless today.

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:45.960]
OK.

[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.360]
Oh, I never gave it.

[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.680]
Well, you weren't going to go anyway, were you?

[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.720]
Well, I was thinking about it.

[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.080]
Yeah.

[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.520]
Well, you want to go to a better game anyway.

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.660]
We'll get you tickets for a better game.

[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:53.840]
All right.

[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.680]
How about the Ranger's?

[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.680]
Ranger game?

[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.640]
If we ever get it out, see the Ranger will be a tough ticket.

[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:57.960]
We'll see.

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.100]
We have to see what Bob Green's deal is on that.

[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.900]
Straighten him out, Niel.

[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.560]
I'm trying.

[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.020]
I see you.

[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.680]
You made a comment.

[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]
A lot of people don't like me.

[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.420]
You know, I see he, we were, now Sean comes to the track,

[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.260]
sits up there at the table with us, loses his brains,

[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.000]
just like I do.

[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.080]
And his fat rich, you were telling me the other night,

[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.680]
everybody at the track loves me.

[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.900]
Now he's a good friend of mine.

[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.560]
He's a great guy.

[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.740]
Just he's full of crap.

[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.820]
OK, that's the only problem.

[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.800]
Everybody's got a problem.

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.340]
Riches problem is he's full of crap.

[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.460]
And he wants everybody up there

[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.600]
wants to be the center of attraction.

[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.580]
I don't want to be the center of attraction up there.

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.940]
I want to sit at the table, relax, lose in peace.

[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.780]
And that's it.

[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.260]
And if people hate my guts, I feel

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.320]
I must be doing something right.

[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.840]
It's the only way to be, I guess.

[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.400]
There you go.

[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.040]
Well, take care, Niel.

[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.580]
OK, and I will talk to you soon.

[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.480]
I guess me Thursday.

[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.380]
Thursday.

[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.020]
You'll be there, right?

[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:39.540]
It's a track.

[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.120]
We'll be there.

[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.140]
You ain't got nothing else to do.

[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.020]
That's our one chance.

[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.120]
Thursday, OK, we'll see.

[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.540]
It's a date.

[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.480]
It's a date.

[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:45.700]

[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.080]
All right, buddy.

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.700]
OK, there's Sean.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.860]
So anyway, we got it all straightened out.

[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.180]
Yeah, he's soliciting.

[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.460]
He's recruiting those young guys on the air again.

[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.400]
OK, I'll tell you all the action that I've gotten from

[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.900]
being on any, oh, and it's a matter of fact, being on the air.

[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.500]
Today is the 15th of February.

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.140]
That means like 13th of sure months.

[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.560]
You realize less than two weeks is my 19th anniversary

[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.260]
on the air in Miami.

[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.040]
March the first.

[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.040]
March the first is 19 years on the air in Miami.

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.760]
I say if everybody out there sends me $100 for each year

[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.120]
that I've been on the air, it's 1900 times what we got 200

[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.520]
listeners.

[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:16.480]
Not bad.

[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.620]
Who's that on the bat line?

[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.420]
Stefano Lincoln.

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.780]
Who is it?

[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:25.840]
Hello?

[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.420]
Push it again.

[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.080]
Hello.

[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:29.800]
Hello.

[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:30.780]
Who's this?

[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.480]
This is Stefania Lincoln.

[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.380]
Oh, Stefania.

[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.180]
Yeah.

[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.340]
How are you doing, Stefania?

[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:35.760]
Good.

[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.500]
How are you?

[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:36.860]
Great.

[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.680]
Well, I wanted to say goodbye.

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.680]
I'm leaving tomorrow morning to Vegas.

[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.220]
Right.

[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.480]
I'm moving out there.

[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:42.980]
I know.

[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.760]
We're all jealous.

[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.600]
And I just wanted to thank you for the last time when we all

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.400]
went out in June for introducing me to Vegas.

[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.100]
I mean, it was so great.

[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:53.820]
I'm moving there.

[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.140]
See, this is the ultimate testimonial.

[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.500]
She had never been there before in her life.

[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.460]
She comes out on a trip.

[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.400]
And of course, Bob is her dad and comes out with us.

[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.000]
And falls in love with it.

[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.820]
And she's taking a job out there and living there.

[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:05.740]
Absolutely.

[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.840]
The ultimate tribute.

[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:07.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.440]
Well, we'll be looking forward to seeing you there in May.

[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:09.980]
You'll have everything.

[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.240]
I'm sure you'll be there at the other time.

[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:11.900]
I'll have everything ready to be prayed for you.

[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.520]
Everything in place for us this time.

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.040]
It'll be great.

[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.600]
Good luck.

[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.820]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.480]
Have a great time.

[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:17.880]
You too.

[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.240]
Bye-bye.

[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.400]
Boy, are we, uh, what is that?

[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.280]
What is going on in here with this thing, George?

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.960]
Hit it again and again.

[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:24.660]
Oh, God.

[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.180]
So anyway.

[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.160]
Like I started to say, we're having a whale of a time here today.

[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.160]
That Don Sherry, man, I bet you never had an interview quite like that one before, eh?

[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.880]
We'll be hearing about that from Jeff Rimmer.

[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.820]

23-year-old Wilbur Lee Roy Mitchell will spend the rest of his life in prison.

[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.060]
Get manned it.

[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.480]
I f**king stil'em out.

[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.840]
I like it.

[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.440]
I like it.

[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.160]

610 W-I-O-D.

[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.440]
It's the line to two hour.

[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.660]
They're exploiting the Lion King and they won't go away.

[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.980]
The Lion King has gone too far.

[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.900]
He's even on a candy bar.

[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.700]
This stuff's like acting everything.

[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.760]
He's pushing fries at Burger King.

[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.860]
The Lion King is on everything.

[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.440]
Caused his neon's the right.

[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.800]
The silence that that values this block

[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.460]
The profit side upside.

[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.140]
The logo's on on every dress.

[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.060]
It's even on a garlic press.

[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.620]
This one looks on the drain.

[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.980]
A dude that takes a cash from me and you.

[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.800]
Oh, my book is my empty pocket.

[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.840]
My wallet's feeling light.

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.180]
The kids are happy, but I feel crappy.

[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.780]
Because I'll be broke tonight.

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.180]
The McEve, the McEve, the McEve.

[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.260]
The McEve, the McEve, the McEve, the McEve.

[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.540]
So now the judge says they can-

[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.900]
The defense can go ahead and send all of this stuff

[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.260]
for testing out-a-stay to Albany, New York.

[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.260]
I hate to tell you it's not Albany number one.

[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.680]
And he says there will be unbelievable sanctions against the defense.

[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.160]
Any of these items be lost?

[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:57.800]
How do you like that?

[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:04.000]
I don't expect anything will be accepted, but I just want it to advise the court.

[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.900]
He can come and ask me for a good cause exception to the court's order.

[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.100]
Thank you very much, Councilor.

[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.100]
Yeah, now we're going to have anybody on a witness stand today.

[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.860]
Is there going to be any testimony of any significance?

[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.220]
Are we just going to keep fudge-king around?

[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.640]
Is there anything else before we do?

[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.560]
That's exactly the question.

[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.200]
Boy, does he follow lead well?

[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:18.800]
First of all, Rossi.

[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.760]
Can he be funded dance with?

[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.080]
All right, Debbie Hickens, let's have the jury, please.

[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:22.940]
Oh, here we go.

[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.660]
We're bringing a jury.

[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.760]
Somebody's maybe going to testify.

[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.060]
We'll keep our eye on it for you.

[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.240]
Meantime, we're doing scrimless, W-I-O-D.

[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.840]
J-to-4 cast is B.

[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:31.680]
W-I-O-D.

[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.100]
Yeah, on Tarzanale.

[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.480]
Speaking.

[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.780]
Neil, listen.

[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.160]
Yes.

[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.380]
You're a semi-intelligent person.

[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.040]
I can't believe that you think O.J.'s guilty.

[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.820]
I mean, I'm a law student in St. Augustine.

[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.640]
You can't believe that I think he's guilty.

[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.800]
Others, I'm the only one.

[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.260]
Yeah, I'm the only one.

[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.660]
The overwhelming majority of white Americans and every pull that's been taken

[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.840]
believes that he's guilty, but I'm the only one and therefore I'm stupid.

[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.500]
Neil, the facts speak for themselves.

[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.540]
I mean, this guy had everything going for him.

[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.260]
And he goes off and kills his wife.

[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.040]
And that's why he was stalking her all the time.

[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.160]
You see, you're going to be one of the most naive people I've ever talked to in my life.

[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.520]
Because they had everything going for him.

[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.780]
Therefore, that means that they have that their...

[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.720]
Is Royce's wife had a for him?

[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.380]
Oh, he had a for him.

[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:13.700]
Oh, he had a for him.

[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:13.820]
He's the one.

[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.060]
He had a for him.

[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.100]
Therefore, he never killed anybody right like the Menendez brothers,

[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.240]
when everything going for them.

[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:17.700]
They did.

[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.480]
That's totally different.

[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.820]
No, it's not a different story.

[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.620]
The fact that people have a lot of money,

[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.840]
that means that they don't do abhorrent things, that they don't have wild tempers,

[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.880]
which he's already proven that he had, that he was beaten the crap out of his wife

[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.980]
and maybe even the first wife.

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.160]
The guy was an American.

[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.200]
You live in a dream world.

[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.620]
You're serious, too, aren't you?

[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.360]
The guy was an American hero.

[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.080]
He was an American hero.

[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.100]
You're a jackass.

[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.760]
I would even wait in this kid goes to where?

[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.580]
He goes to BCC, is that what he said?

[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.400]
The brain dead C.C.?

[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.280]
Right, he was an American hero.

[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.580]
Therefore, he couldn't do it.

[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.980]
Just like Richard Nixon, just like that dick.

[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.640]
He couldn't commit a crime because he was an American hero.

[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.080]
He was a football god damn player.

[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:01.720]
How do you like that?

[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.500]
Just like jungle, gym, Rivera, and any wait kiss.

[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.560]
They couldn't rape those women.

[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.480]
They were baseball players.

[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.780]
They were stars, baby.

[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.280]
And fatty-arbuckle.

[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.580]
And at damn Darryl Strawberry, he couldn't be doing no drug.

[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.260]
And Dwight good in the same thing.

[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.440]
It's a racial thing.

[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.640]
That must be it.

[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.120]
Because they were superstars.

[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.160]
They were heroes.

[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.260]
Youngsters all over America looked up to them,

[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.840]
rubbed their baseball cards,

[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.840]
sought out their autographs.

[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.240]
And we know that because they were American heroes,

[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.680]
they could have done no wrong.

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.000]
Sir, you could be the dumbest god damn person

[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.820]
I've ever smoked in my life.

[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.760]
I'm smoking right now, just thinking about it.

[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.460]
He's probably smoking before the call.

[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.100]
That's the problem.

[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.020]
Anything good?

[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.360]
W-Y-O-T.

[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.100]
Neil.

[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:45.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.760]
O.J. is guilty.

[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.400]
No.

[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.440]
You're not another dumb guy.

[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.300]
You don't want to be called another dumb guy?

[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.280]
Like, I just got called.

[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.080]
I killed the call.

[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.320]
That was...

[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.100]
I killed the call.

[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.840]
He's totally guilty.

[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.500]
Anyone who does not see through that B.S. is blunt.

[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:00.980]
He's an idiot.

[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.260]
They really are.

[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.800]
The only people...

[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.280]
The American people...

[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.940]
Just take a look at the defense.

[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.600]
Okay, the guy makes the opening statement.

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.900]
And right away he starts out with all this baloney

[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:10.900]
about this Gurches woman.

[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.240]
They have to manufacture all these alibis.

[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.420]
First, it was O.J. was sleeping at night.

[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.660]
Then now he was out there slamming a few golf balls.

[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.580]
Or somebody's balls like Ron Goldman's.

[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.700]
And now we find these wild crazy people

[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.920]
that are testifyingly saw the Virgin Mary walking out of

[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.580]
the street with a dog.

[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.760]
I mean, they got no defense at all, man.

[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.280]
Yeah, he is the world's greatest actor.

[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.380]
He was stalking her.

[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.540]
He was threatening to kill everybody that came anywhere near her.

[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.720]
And this Jackass, because he had a Rolls Royce,

[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.080]
he had everything going for him.

[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.600]
Therefore, he would never come into crime.

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.020]
Right.

[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.800]
O.J. should win the Academy Award.

[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.480]
Exactly.

[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.240]
The best actor.

[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.040]
And if I have to hear any more about that pulp fiction,

[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.720]
I'm gonna puke.

[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.540]
I'll clear that right now.

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.820]
All right, Neil.

[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.780]
That's all I got about a material.

[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.440]
I have a great life.

[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.120]
Okay.

[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.080]
Pulp fiction, my ass.

[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.600]
Don't be in the stand that I would jump in front of a bullet

[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.180]
from the cold.

[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.280]
All right.

[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.380]
Did you, uh, he did.

[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.040]
So anyway, yeah, and of course that forest gum,

[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.100]
I didn't see either one of them.

[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.780]
And I've seen all the crap the last couple days,

[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.400]
forest gum, I mean, Tom Hanks.

[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.660]
That to me right there is the definitive story of Tom Hanks.

[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.700]
He's just a total zero as a human being.

[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.140]
And it just, I don't want to see from a forest gum.

[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.520]
And as far as Pulp fiction is concerned,

[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.280]
I did see all the low lights in the highlights.

[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.020]
And it said it was one of the most gratuitously violent movies,

[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.940]
with absolutely no plot, no set, I mean, no rhyme or reason.

[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:27.140]
Just a lot of blood and gucks and gratuitous sex sounds good to me.

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:28.660]
That's wrong with that.

[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.880]
I say give them all the awards and let's talk about something else, Phil.

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.380]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.480]
Thank you so much, Jennifer.

[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.600]
Oh my God.

[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.000]
A group of men who were fired by blockbuster entertainment

[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.040]
for wearing long hair, filed discrimination charges against the company.

[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:49.440]

[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:55.760]
Kenneth Harper, 28th, Abraham Del Carmen, 23th, Brian Russell, 20th,

[00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:00.580]
and Daniel Gomez, 21th, filed a formal charges of discrimination in the workplace,

[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.080]
with the Florida Department of Human Relations,

[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.860]
the state agency that investigates such complaints,

[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.080]
stating that the work were adopted by blockbuster,

[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.020]
which, ballbuster, which prohibits men from wearing hair below the shirt collar,

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.860]
discriminates on the basis of sex, as in are they getting any?

[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.780]
The work rule adopted by the company on June 1st, 1994, applies to men only.

[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.840]
The charges are the first that before the men can proceed to the federal courts

[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.880]
on their claims of discrimination, said the attorney Miami-Sole Rights lawyer, Brett Clark.

[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.000]
Oh, get him, Brett.

[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:30.780]
Sue their ass.

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.080]
Billions of dollars for these guys and I get half.

[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:33.520]
All right.

[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.380]
113 at WIOD.

[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:36.840]
By the way.

[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:42.600]
610 WIOD, 10th, tone, and oiled for South Florida.

[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.260]
I killed Nicole.

[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.200]
I killed Nicole.

[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.040]
Trust me.

[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.120]
Oh!

[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:53.920]
Okay.

[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.360]
What have you gone and done?

[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.440]
Why did you leave the bloody blood?

[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.280]
That work were you thinking of?

[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.540]
Okay.

[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.540]
You almost got away.

[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.480]
Oh, babe.

[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:20.780]
Instead of driving around the freeways, you should have been on Brazilian airways.

[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.880]
All your friends call you the killer.

[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.920]
They say, I hope the jailbird should take care of you.

[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]
Boock!

[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.880]
Boock!

[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:34.880]

[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.380]
Oh, oh!

[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:37.360]
Oh, oh!

[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.300]
Oh, Jesus!

[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:59.880]
Do you know who said, they're neighbors?

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:51:59.880]

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.680]
So they've väkling all of起 eatin' simple,

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.680]

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.680]

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.680]

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.680]

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.680]

[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:29.120]
it's only gonna be going on for the next 20 or 30 or 40 months and don't worry about it

[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.400]
but they're just saying nothing going on

[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.860]
wait till you hear the latest in this news release about the hair and the blockbuster

[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.900]
the last paragraph says in response to the controversy over this hair policy

[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.380]
blockbuster spokesperson George Johnson claimed

[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:46.780]
wait till you hear this he claims that customers feel threatened by men with long

[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.540]

this is a young man and that won't do

[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.860]
I won't be much

[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.240]
and training

[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:27.680]
regret bathroom

[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.680]
We really fight.

[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.080]
Oh, you put up with a fan,

[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.560]
And you keep who love,

[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.960]
Call the key clone,

[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:05.920]
He's been in,

[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.600]
And I mean,

[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.040]
We're here all the time,

[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.880]
We're gonna face the same man,

[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.600]
It's something kind of hard for us.

[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.360]
Signs, lines, lines,

[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.440]
We're in a sign,

[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.000]
Buying up the scene,

[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.600]
Throwing in my mind,

[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.780]
Do this, don't do that.

[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.460]
We are they assigned.

[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.540]
Oh, hey now, Mr. Cashew,

[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.120]
Read your candles,

[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.200]
You will be,

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.420]
Close to the breeze,

[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.720]
You should talk,

[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.240]
It's high as key.

[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.060]
What we ain't supposed to be,

[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.540]
Queer, drink,

[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.940]
We're alone here.

[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:44.180]

[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.280]
And the Wayne says,

[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.240]
You've got to have a hell of a membership,

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.240]
Cause a random tape tear out.

[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.700]
I know I already have.

[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.580]
I hope you do this soon.

[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.820]
The Wayne says,

[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]
Everybody welcome,

[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.500]
Come in, watch my kids play.

[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.880]
I'm sorry boy,

[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.340]
You suck these rots.

[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.500]
Now I don't have a baby.

[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.560]
But I got my whole free will.

[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.140]
Can I make my whole boy cry?

[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.060]
You won't see a load of doubt with me.

[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.320]
Can I see peace and shine?

[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.100]
Signs, signs,

[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.640]
We're in a sign,

[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.220]
Buying up the scene,

[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.900]
Throwing in my mind,

[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.960]
When you peace and shine,

[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.980]
You're peace and shine.

[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.200]
Yeah, but wait a second.

[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.600]
121 and WIOD.

[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.640]
And it goes on to say,

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.520]
But a Miami-Herald telephone poll conducted in June of last year,

[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.580]
When the policy was announced,

[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.180]
Revealed that 53% of the respondents actually preferred music sales staff,

[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.060]
Who wore their hair longer than the norm.

[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.120]
It's a music store, man.

[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.880]
It's not a goddamn library.

[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.640]
It's a music store.

[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:14.980]
Damn it.

[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.940]
It says there's no word from Viacom,

[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.540]
Which is bought out blockbuster.

[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.280]
If the blockbuster policy, which is believed to have resulted in hundreds of men being thrown out of work,

[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.460]
Would remain in effect, but it better damn that well not.

[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.200]
How do you like that?

[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.360]
You got long hair, you're out.

[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.920]
We know the whole story, and now they're going back in their fightin' them in court,

[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.160]
And they're gonna win like billions of dollars against Wayne,

[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.280]
Because see, the suit is not against Viacom.

[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.440]
The suit is against, obviously, blockbuster and Wayne,

[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.280]
Who are responsible at the time.

[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.320]
And they're gonna have to cough up some real big cash.

[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.320]
Then he won't be afforded by us any real players.

[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.440]
122, we sure don't want Yarm or Yager on the Panthers, man,

[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.060]
Because he's got long freaky hair.

[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.920]
I'll tell you, I really think that Randy Boler was the guy that really woke the penguins up in this game early on, too,

[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.280]
And he was a very physical game.

[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.400]
And a lot to do with it.

[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.960]
The penguins have played on those terms, too.

[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.780]
Here's Robert Tide, who else seems to be back in behind the net.

[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.520]
Yager, being pressured by Gordon Murphy.

[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.920]
Gordon Murphy knocks him down and Stu Barnes takes the puck.

[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.760]
Lost it, it comes to Yager in front, gets it to Randy Schultz and scores.

[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:22.020]
Yager puts it by Van B's brook, and it appears that Elvis has just left the building.

[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.240]
Yager, with that real long freaky hair and that strange,

[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.940]
Your Barbie doll, Pussman, he could never play for the Panthers because he wants too much money, not to hear.

[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.080]
10, WIOG, more fans than Wade, and a better complexion.

[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.840]
Seried in? You now know his false, don't you?

[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:41.080]
Yes.

[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:41.740]
Okay.

[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.120]
But this is the first time that's been rossier.

[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.340]
I take it to Stenios with you, with somewhat cursory.

[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.900]
Yes, probably so.

[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:49.780]
Okay.

[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:50.860]
Yeah.

[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.500]
So what difference does it make for a coplet?

[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.460]
Maybe because he had a copious donut he's used to.

[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:57.900]
It would be wrong, wouldn't it?

[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.520]
Possibly, it's not my job to review the crime scene locks, or that goes into the tactics.

[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.000]
I thought you did review it.

[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.700]
I looked at it, but because it was not your job, you didn't look at it carefully, is that what you're telling me?

[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.060]
I didn't scrutinize it, no.

[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:10.580]

[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.100]
Well, then, the officer risky called you first.

[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.720]
First, he business.

[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.920]
I take it, you did not note the time.

[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.400]
See, now gets back to this boring stuff.

[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.940]
I was always doing this thing at this particular cop.

[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.020]
That wasn't his job anyway.

[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:28.480]
He didn't review the whole thing and how long everybody was there, and who was doing what to whom, and it's a Pandorus.

[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.100]
Okay, let's do Broward, WIOD.

[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.680]
This is Judge Beto.

[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.620]
When court not in session, me and OJ listen to Neil Rajah.

[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.200]
All right, here comes the judge.

[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.400]
WIOD.

[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.380]
Neil.

[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:41.780]
Yes.

[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.380]
How you doing?

[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:42.820]
Okay.

[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:49.080]
I was just wondering, when people are going to be tired for one thing and talking about this Neil trial.

[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.680]
The Neil trial, yeah.

[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.520]
The OJ trial.

[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.780]
I think they'd like to give me the gas right now, as a matter of fact.

[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:56.320]
No, no, no.

[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.160]
There you go.

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.720]
Hey, I'd like to talk about some little more.

[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.460]
Yeah, let's get off.

[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:04.760]
Well, you notice I'm not putting a lot of this stuff on because it's boring and anybody that thinks I'm going to just throw away the whole show

[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:08.980]
so they can hear Eiffely Bailey, hear the clueless throat, and hear the sound of his own voice, we'll get it.

[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.820]
It's dangerous.

[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.300]
It's just fry as ass already and let's get on with something more exciting.

[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.620]
It's been about three years anyway.

[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.320]
Let's get on with more.

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.660]
And you notice that the jury, we know what they're excited about.

[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.200]
What's that?

[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.580]
They petitioned the judge before the weekend that they want to see all the episodes of Melrose placed that they missed.

[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.840]
And they want to, no, seriously.

[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.180]
And they want to have facilities to make sure that on the nights that it shows, they get to copy of it, show to them.

[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:30.700]
It's God.

[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.460]
Melrose plays.

[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.380]
And most of these are black jurors, too, by the way.

[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.520]
Is that tell you what's wrong with America?

[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.320]
Sorta.

[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:35.960]
God.

[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.760]
That's part of the problem.

[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.520]
Melrose plays.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.020]
Melrose?

[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.980]
It's a hell of a show, though.

[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:39.640]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.140]
Oh, okay.

[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:45.980]
Anyway, I want to let you know that because of you, I have to thank you because, uh, day after tomorrow, I'm going to be in Vegas.

[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:46.680]
Great.

[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.360]
And guess who I'm going through?

[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:49.920]
Bob Lincoln.

[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.120]
Bob Lincoln, you're going through him?

[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.160]
That's a big guy to go through.

[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.580]
I hear, you know, he told us he's going to be there this week.

[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:54.980]
He is.

[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.480]
And he wants to hang out with it.

[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.100]
There you go.

[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.580]
So we're going to get together sometimes this weekend.

[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.400]
Well, you'll have a great time.

[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400]
You'll be drunk as a skunk man when you hang out with him, okay?

[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.060]
Yeah, I hope we get the gamble a little too long.

[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.440]
Oh, there.

[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.420]
Now, how old are you?

[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.200]
Uh, 23.

[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.020]
23.

[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.280]
Legal ages 21 or something.

[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:08.860]
There's no problem.

[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.480]
Oh, God.

[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.420]
You know, I have a friend.

[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.420]
I have a friend who, uh, ranges whole trip through Bob Lincoln.

[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:14.820]
Right.

[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:22.860]
He, uh, why are you asking about sort of these ranges he wants to go to while he's out there that, uh, I don't know much about him, though.

[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:29.440]
Maybe you know, they know information about people's gone to him, but, uh, you know, do you reckon, you know, anything about those things or...

[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.580]
Do you ever heard that saying they have it a great time down on a ranch?

[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:32.940]
Yeah.

[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.920]
You'll have a great time.

[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.320]
Oh, God.

[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:34.900]
I hope so.

[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.280]
Okay.

[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.740]
Can I call a couple of people Doosbag and do a new...

[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.480]
Take protection, yes?

[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:38.800]
All right.

[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.740]
Andrew, Rafa and Spickey Ricky, you're all going to do spas.

[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.820]
Oh, thanks.

[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:44.500]
Have a great time.

[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.080]
So he says you're a Doosbag, Andrew.

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.860]
That's what he just said.

[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.820]
So he must know you pretty well.

[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.820]
130 at WID.

[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.140]
Where's the fat, what's his name?

[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.380]
Fat high boy with that check.

[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.440]
He calls, he said he had it in his, uh, fingers...

[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.680]
He's got it in his hand.

[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.020]
Jeff High has got the $2,500 check.

[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.460]
Andy, come in here and do something constructive.

[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.380]
Well, I don't want to order you around, but it's kind of fun.

[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.020]
Uh, see if you can stand like on a step ladder and change that thing for us.

[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.020]
I'll end it up on here to make sure we get the right total.

[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.020]
Our final total, it took a long time.

[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.620]
We had to make physical death threats to a Denise Potvan.

[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.000]
You heard the things that Don Sherry had to say about her, by the way.

[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:15.640]
That was pretty amusing.

[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:17.740]
108,197.

[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.300]
See that looks better than that total right there.

[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.400]
108,197, the absolute positive final total for our center one campaign.

[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.920]
Thank you, profusely, so much.

[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.260]
And then he's Potvan came through under penalty of death and a lot of heavy urging in the deep stretch.

[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.360]
W-I-O-D.

[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.960]
Yeah, hi, I want to take a meal for you.

[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:33.240]
Speaking.

[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.320]
Speaking.

[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.060]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:35.740]
Okay.

[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.960]
I just want to let you know about hockey tickets.

[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.540]
I'm the minus and I have season tickets.

[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.180]
Thanks, Andy.

[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.360]
Uh, we did get our season tickets for replacement games.

[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:45.640]
Yeah.

[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.880]
We got to take it to the mail yesterday.

[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.540]
Oh, yesterday?

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.240]
All right.

[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.240]
So I don't know if they do them by section or if they do them by last name.

[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.580]
So in other words, they are in the process.

[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:54.560]

[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.220]
Well, I would agree, but I'd get his fan ass over here by the moment.

[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.660]
Oh, he did call to say what?

[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.020]
Let's say that he's expecting them any day now.

[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.180]
Any day now?

[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.200]
The game is Tuesday.

[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.700]
That's lying about any day now.

[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.460]
That's like saying the check is in the mail, you know.

[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.880]
Yeah, we've all heard that before.

[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.520]
Well, that's good news.

[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.520]
At least maybe they're starting to do something.

[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.040]
Well, we said we said just to your left room, section 123.

[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:14.740]
Right.

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.840]
So like I said, I don't know if they do it by section or, you know,

[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.000]
or in what way they do it, but they're on the way.

[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.260]
Great. Thanks for the good news.

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.060]
Have a good day.

[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.560]
See you tonight.

[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:22.960]
Bye-bye.

[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.780]
Okay, there you go.

[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.900]
Rest easy, all you guys.

[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.080]
Or not as the case may be.

[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.960]
Maybe she got him and the rest of us are going to get shined.

[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.680]
That could be it.

[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.580]
Maybe Wayne kind of stuck his nose this thing said, well, where's Roger?

[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.640]
What, uh, what name are those tickets in?

[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:38.260]
And see, it would be very nice if we did have the tickets in our own name.

[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:38.820]
Would be nice.

[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.180]
I mean, even the station, but it's all kind of a woody, grabber thing.

[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.300]
And once it's in Woody's hands, you know, he never really sure if he's going to.

[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.460]
Now, what did Woody say exactly?

[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.420]
It's coming any day.

[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.640]
That's what Kathy Willett said, too.

[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:50.980]
W-I-O-D.

[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:51.540]
Yeah.

[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:52.520]

[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.260]
You got any young boys, buddy?

[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.300]
W-I-O-D.

[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.940]
W-I-O-D.

[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.400]
Don's carry.

[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.840]
W-I-O-D.

[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:02.620]
Hey, Neil.

[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:02.980]
Yeah.

[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:03.720]
How you doing?

[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.940]
It was here with a lot of responses to that Don's hearing interview.

[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.700]
It's just overwhelming.

[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.920]
Hey, Neil, I want to talk a little hockey here.

[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.240]
Yeah.

[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.700]
I saw Yager last friend had a hat trick.

[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.880]
Great game.

[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.320]
Yeah.

[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.060]
I wanted enough.

[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.720]
Has there ever been any panthers that have a hat trick?

[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.140]
No.

[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:19.960]
No.

[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.240]
I don't think so.

[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.160]
Okay.

[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.180]
I don't recall any.

[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.100]
Thank you.

[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:25.620]
See ya.

[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.520]
Anybody on the panthers ever get a hat trick?

[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.420]
I do not believe so.

[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:29.860]
But what's the big deal?

[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.120]
Hey, well, just take your hat to the, just take your little baseball cap, your little beanie,

[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.660]
your yarmulka out there, just in case.

[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.680]
Tonight could be the night.

[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.460]
We're playing a pretty weak team there, Ottawa, eh?

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.260]
We could have wind up putting that game like 9 to 4 or something like that.

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.960]
So maybe Stewie Barnes will get the hat trick.

[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.480]
Throw a little something out there on the ice.

[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.140]
Or maybe just bring a couple of octopuses.

[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.580]
I've always wondered about that.

[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.160]
You know, in Detroit, they've been doing that for years.

[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.180]
When somebody gets a hat trick instead of throwing a hat out on the ice, they throw these little octopi.

[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:53.740]
Octopuses.

[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.920]
And where do you buy an octopus?

[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.020]
And not only that, but how do you sneak them into the arena in a Jolywood, Serena?

[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.880]
How do they get them in there?

[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:02.800]
Zip lock bag.

[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.720]
And a pretty damn big zip lock bag.

[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.740]
Seriously, where do you, would you buy a seafood shop?

[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.240]
A seafood shop you can buy an octopi?

[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.460]
First squid.

[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:14.820]
Eh.

[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.360]
All that stuff.

[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.800]
And then the thing in Detroit that they're so proud of, because they have so much experience,

[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.400]
they've been doing it for years there, is that when they put them on the ice there,

[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.120]
instead of like last a couple of years ago when Detroit played Toronto and a playoffs,

[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.920]
and some Detroit fans threw one on the ice in Toronto and they went out with a shovel

[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.160]
and picked it off the ice, which is what I would do.

[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.580]
But in Detroit, they're the real macho man in Detroit.

[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.980]
They go out there and they pick them up with their hands off the ice.

[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.720]
And the octopus too.

[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.860]
134 at WIOD.

[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.980]
Look Stan, WIOD.

[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.320]
More fun than waxing your bikini line.

[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960]
This is the Neorodger show.

[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.720]
This is your brain.

[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.620]
Any questions?

[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.100]
This is your brain.

[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.800]
And this is drugs.

[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.160]
This is your brain on drugs.

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.000]
This is your brain on drugs, with two strips of bacon.

[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:23.140]
This is your brain on drugs, with a pound of ground beef, a can of fresh tomatoes,

[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.480]
a half cup of milk, and a belly.

[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:34.080]
This is your brain on drugs, with a street crew working in the next brain.

[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:40.420]
And this is your brain on drugs, when you've left it on the stove too long.

[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.400]
And it goes to kitchen fire that spread to the neighborhood of your brain.

[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.500]
Any questions?

[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.160]
The partnership for a brain free America.

[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.440]
I think we already got it.

[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.040]
137 at WIOD.

[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.740]
Here's the fact that it says, absolutely incorrect, sir.

[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.480]
Paltfish in was great.

[01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.940]
No plot? No way.

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.080]
The only people I know who saw the movie and didn't like it were old parts,

[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.300]
or it's prudes or simple things.

[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.160]
Great movie, no crap it says.

[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.780]
How do you like that?

[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.300]
Paltfiction.

[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.360]
And I can't stand it because John Travolta was in it number one.

[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.660]
That eliminates it immediately from consideration.

[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.460]
And I also think that Bruce Willis was in it.

[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.880]
Was Bruce Willis in it?

[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:22.100]
Oh, John Revolta and Bruce Willis together again in stereo.

[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.100]
That's more than I could handle on a bad day.

[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.420]
I'd rather watch Canthe Willis do it with a frog.

[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.000]
WIOD.

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.500]
WIOD.

[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.420]
On a US flag Kuwaiti tanker in the...

[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:37.480]
WIOD.

[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.060]
I want my hockey.

[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.300]
WIOD.

[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.380]
Meal.

[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.540]
How are you today?

[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.380]
I've been listening to your OJ coverage.

[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.880]
I think we're missing the boat here.

[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:47.260]
Yeah.

[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.520]
I want to see Colin Ferguson on the... on Trial on TV.

[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.060]
I think that's entertaining.

[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.100]
It is very entertaining.

[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.240]
And of course, I understand yesterday,

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.980]
he filled a little number where Colin was across examining himself and hopping back and forth.

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:57.980]

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:57.980]

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:57.980]

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:57.980]

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:57.980]

[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.820]
From the witness stand.

[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.860]
Oh, man, I missed it.

[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.000]
And I missed that too, but I understand it was very entertaining.

[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:02.900]
Oh, man.

[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.840]
Do you know if Colin is showing it?

[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.640]
Do you know if that court TV station is showing any of that?

[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.840]
Oh, they absolutely are.

[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.620]
Oh, man.

[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]
Our cable stinks.

[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:12.300]
Yeah.

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.520]
Yeah, there's no court TV on this cable here either.

[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.860]
Thank God for that satellite dish.

[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.280]
Really?

[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.920]
It's an F36 on a satellite.

[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.220]
I see.

[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.240]
Well, just wanted to say that.

[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.420]
You have a great day.

[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.140]
And you too.

[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:23.600]
Okay.

[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.100]
And see ya.

[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:24.500]
Okay.

[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:25.860]
Screenless ones, they hear.

[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.020]
We've really been smoking, man.

[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.000]
And Marsha Clark stayed in there pushing her hair lip around a little bit.

[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.140]
And that tanker on her upper lip now has moved down to her bottom lip.

[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.960]
And it seems to be on a way to work cleavage any minute.

[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.000]
W-I-O-D.

[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.320]
I think I killed Nicole.

[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:38.820]
One step.

[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.640]
W-I-O-D.

[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.660]
We'll attack the Neil.

[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.140]
Speaking.

[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.180]
Neil.

[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:42.740]
Yes.

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.520]
Hey, Lanti, those peepees about this.

[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.720]
W-I-O-D.

[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:46.940]
Yard, our shit.

[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.380]
W-I-O-D.

[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:48.720]
Neil.

[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:49.200]
Yes.

[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:49.640]
How are you?

[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.100]
Okay.

[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.060]
Great interview with Mr. Cherish.

[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.780]
Well, that there actually somebody here that actually heard the interview knows who he is

[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.260]
and is responding to.

[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.420]
But this is the first, sir.

[01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.640]
I was smiling from the interview.

[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.120]
I was driving 995.

[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.680]
I think we had a pretty good time for a couple of old parts reminiscing about what it's all about.

[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.900]
And I don't think he ever had an interview quite like that one before.

[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.160]
We got to say a lot more in heated, which is a real, real switch.

[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:09.760]
But...

[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:09.920]
Yeah.

[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:13.700]
Well, I told him this wasn't going to be one of those Ron McLean puff pieces that he's used to.

[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.440]
This was going to be a little different kind of a thing.

[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.420]
But it was great.

[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.020]
I was, I've enjoyed it thoroughly.

[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:25.440]
Now, I think that all the fans, now with a satellite dish, are going to be listening very carefully to see if Harry Neil ever, ever says again a lovely little pass.

[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.580]
A lovely little phone call, yeah.

[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.940]
He always says that, a lovely little pass.

[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:29.620]
I heard it was there before.

[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.980]
And even I'm embarrassed by that.

[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:31.320]
Yeah.

[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.300]
Which takes a lot.

[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.100]
There was one of the best and...

[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:34.420]
I love the show.

[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.120]
Okay, thanks.

[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:35.820]
See ya.

[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]
A call on the John Chery interview, man.

[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:38.540]
Oh!

[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:39.200]

[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.080]
Yeah, the only Chery these guys want to hear about.

[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:42.620]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.560]
And speaking of her, don't forget.

[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.080]
And that ain't no cherry, trust me.

[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.660]
Where's that seal?

[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.180]
Tonight, she's got our squeal of approval.

[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.640]
She's got Randy Weston at tonight.

[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.580]
And then she's got Kathy Willitson next Tuesday, which is really embarrassing.

[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:02.940]
And then she's got that jungle gym Rivera, with that guy's name, that Alex is bringing in, that stripper guy.

[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.340]
See, a lot of guests on that show, all of a sudden.

[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.460]
That's the deal, starting to have a lot of guests on that program.

[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.000]
Now, we had Don Chery on the phone today for like 20 minutes, which I found very entertaining and enjoyable.

[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.520]
So maybe we ought to have like a lot of guests on this show, but I sure as hell doubt it.

[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.000]
W-I-O-D.

[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.500]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:20.880]
Yes.

[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:22.620]
Is Neil?

[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.520]
Yes it is.

[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.400]
How are you doing?

[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.600]
I'm doing good. How are you doing?

[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.460]
I want to talk about, can we have an intelligent conversation?

[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.740]
I doubted, based on what I'm hearing so far.

[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.540]
What is it about what?

[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.540]
I want to talk about the Zoology Simpson trial.

[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:34.860]
Yeah.

[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.400]
You know, everybody's calling sucking up to you about his guilty.

[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.600]
No, they're not. They're giving their opinion is what they're doing.

[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.580]
They're not sucking up with anybody.

[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:43.580]
All right, man.

[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.720]
You got to believe that the...

[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.660]
I got to believe that he's guilty is what I got to believe.

[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.740]
And I got to believe because you're black, you assume that he's not.

[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.040]
Now, how do you think I'm black?

[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.160]
Because it sounds to me like you're awful black.

[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.140]
I am black.

[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.560]
Are you dark black or just like kind of light like real dark?

[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.400]
Real dark, okay.

[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.080]
Now, do you not have an imposter like Michael Jackson?

[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:01.580]
No, no.

[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.340]
Oh, speaking of Michael Jackson.

[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.320]
Or Julian Bodney.

[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.000]
He wants it to get on the bandwagon on this one.

[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.880]
Yeah, not that not. That's just adding salt.

[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.740]
I think he's after...

[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.540]
I think he's after OJ's kid is what I...

[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:11.960]
That's what he wants.

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.000]
That's just like adding salt to the room.

[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.780]
He wants a little piece of that, actually.

[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.360]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:17.720]
I'm Kanye.

[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.200]
Look out for that little bastard that Michael Jackson.

[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.640]
Yeah, you got to watch him closely.

[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.320]
Yeah.

[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:28.200]
Listen, you got this woman, the prosecution, that's not really up on the game here.

[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.660]
And you got to...

[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.500]
She's not in the game?

[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.960]
No, she's not a part of it.

[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.780]
I mean, she's lost.

[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.580]
She's out of the never-neverland somewhere.

[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:35.680]
And you got to...

[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.200]
I don't know, man.

[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.560]
It said that she was a tight end.

[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.480]
I don't know what he meant by that.

[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.020]
He oughta know.

[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.140]
I give up.

[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.280]
You check out...

[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.280]
He knows his tight ends, man.

[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:44.780]
Trust me.

[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.100]
He used to be one.

[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.420]
Have a great day, Palli.

[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:47.940]
Thank you.

[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.720]
See, he's laughing about it.

[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.820]
He knows it's all a bunch of crap.

[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.960]
Here's Sergeant David Rossi.

[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.120]
His brother, Martini, will be on air in just a second.

[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.540]
And they're going to be drinking up a storm with the judge.

[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.760]
He just says, let's go back in chambers and get sloshed.

[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.520]
What do you say about that?

[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:00.780]
Okay?

[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.020]
How about some sukiyaki?

[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:02.620]
I thought good.

[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.200]
Yeah, this little judge, man.

[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.660]
I wouldn't trust him with a dime.

[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.460]
I'll guarantee you that.

[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.180]
Next thing you know, they build another goddamn bomb to drop on Pearl Harbor.

[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.220]
W-I-O-D or Safety Harbor.

[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:13.500]
Hello.

[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.720]
W-I-O-D, there was J. Rokie.

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.040]
Hello.

[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.660]
Passion, tons.

[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.840]
The tons are really hard, like by nearby.

[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.100]
W-I-O-D.

[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.300]
Don Cherry killed the goal.

[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.140]
Okay.

[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.640]
W, I believe it.

[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.360]
W-I-O-D.

[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.480]
Yeah, I'm going with a commercial you guys.

[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.100]
Well, if you put it in the oven, it gets hot, George.

[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:33.780]
Yes?

[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.280]
Yeah, you got to turn a commercial about impotence.

[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:36.780]
Yes.

[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.040]
Yes.

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.080]
What can we do with this?

[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.700]
I don't know if it's my real voice.

[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.460]
That's your real voice?

[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.100]
Yeah, man.

[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.200]
You're not related to Brian Murray of the Panthers, are you?

[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.000]
No, no, no, no.

[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.940]
Because maybe we can get like a group discount, like on a speech therapist for you guys?

[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:52.860]
Ha, ha.

[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.240]
God.

[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.240]
No, no, but see, I say we give this old part to like new 13-year-old girl, Virgin.

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.000]
Okay.

[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.160]
And you got a soul?

[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.280]
When you're done with them?

[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.020]
Yeah.

[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.480]
Okay.

[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.020]
And of course, when you're done with them, there'll still be virgins, so that says it all right there.

[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.480]
He said, yeah, just be in a greable, I guess.

[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.300]
Anyway, we've had one hell of a day here.

[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.180]
I think we're going home early.

[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:11.940]
Just fill out that.

[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.240]
W-I-O-D.

[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.340]
W-I-O-D.

[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.800]
Can I make a request, Neil?

[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.100]
Sure.

[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.600]
That's, that's, that's, we're feces.

[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:20.980]
We're feces?

[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:21.580]
Yeah.

[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.420]
That's the most, that's the most species thing I've ever heard in my life.

[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.320]
And we're all feces.

[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:26.800]
Okay.

[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.260]
Okay.

[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.460]
I played that just yesterday, but you can never play that enough.

[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.900]
Now, we found out yesterday that was Mark Grace of the Cubs.

[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.220]
Who's that?

[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.320]
Or JR Grace.

[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.100]
JR Ewing, is that who it was?

[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.320]
It was JR Grace.

[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.260]
Remember the Grace report years ago that ultra-right wing craft that they put out to try to, you know,

[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.900]
all the ultra-right wingers put it out, because they were geniuses like the guy that was making the speech.

[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.380]
And that was him, JR Grace, Mark, Mark Grace.

[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.280]
Everybody.

[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.060]
Peter?

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.560]
Who's for abortion was at one time themselves a feces.

[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.780]
So, and that includes all of you out there.

[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.900]
You were once a feces.

[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.560]
So, we thank you, Mr. President.

[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.020]
And now, inner will be served.

[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:10.640]
All right.

[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.120]
Yeah.

[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.140]
Okay.

[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:13.560]
144.

[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.520]
And JR Hoover?

[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.160]
JR Edgar Hoover is that one?

[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.060]
W-I-O-D, the purple line.

[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.620]
Hey, you can deal.

[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:21.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.160]
The main secretion that baseball comes back together and it's the SCAP players.

[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:25.540]
Yeah.

[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.620]
Can we get some SCAP announcers for the TV?

[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.540]
Because I don't think I can stand watching JR right now.

[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.400]
We've already got them.

[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.820]
We've got to do a few, if he comes on TV with that.

[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.840]
We've got to do a big SCAP announcers in history, man.

[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.840]
Those, those be the worst.

[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.000]
I mean, they already just get up and like a belly slam each other.

[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.860]
I think they'd be a little bit more under control.

[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:43.280]
In fact, don't you realize what justice it is that JR Randolph and Gary Carter

[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.920]
should be doing SCAP players, then it would fit?

[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.740]
I think they're like in bed with each other.

[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.220]
Okay.

[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.020]
All right, Neil.

[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.640]
See ya.

[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.140]
Oh, man, I'd be punished by the Lord.

[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:53.380]
Oh.

[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.480]
A little bit of that stoolish Nio water, does it every time?

[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:01.640]
W-I-O-D.

[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.160]
All right.

[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.120]
Yeah, but wait a minute.

[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:03.460]
Okay.

[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.580]
W-I-O-D.

[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.820]
Yeah, bring back P.P. from Pembert Pine.

[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.860]
Okay, go find him.

[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:09.740]
Go work on him.

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.340]
W-I-O-D.

[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.680]
Hey, Neil, you're going to be at the game tonight?

[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:13.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:13.740]
All right.

[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.240]
Thanks to you.

[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.220]
I'm a hockey fanatic myself.

[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:15.720]
All right.

[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.160]
Now, this is a game we better win tonight.

[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:18.900]
No monkey around.

[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:19.520]
Yeah.

[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.760]
You're right.

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.500]
Hey, something you're choking on.

[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.260]
I'm choking on it.

[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.260]
Yeah, I'm choking on the remnants of a bad cigar.

[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.400]
What kind of smoke?

[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.780]
A cheap Garciviga.

[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.800]
You got to try those left handed cigarettes or better.

[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:30.320]
Okay.

[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:30.720]
All right.

[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.220]
See ya.

[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.880]
Yeah, there's nothing like a woman with a nice big stoke in her post.

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.500]
That's a real sexy thing to look at.

[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.620]
Watch her lie, set it on fire.

[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.140]
146 at W-I-O-D.

[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.880]
No rap, no hard rock, no wimpy elevator music.

[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.420]
Because we got better things to do than play the same old songs over and over.

[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.600]
16 W-I-O-D.

[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.580]
You're a best.

[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.760]
You're a coffee, Marge.

[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:55.760]
Thanks, Gloria.

[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.460]
Gee, your enclave is a lot more ethnic, be clean than mine.

[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.000]
Thanks.

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.580]
You know, I played something new.

[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:04.460]
Really?

[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:04.980]
Yes.

[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:06.520]
You out for serve.

[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.840]
For powerful ethnic cleansing, nothing else even comes close.

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:10.700]
Serb?

[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.940]
But that's been around for years.

[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.180]
I know.

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.220]
But it's been reformulated for extra cleaning power.

[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.440]
Not even the UN can stand up to the wall up in just a town full.

[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:21.820]
Hmm.

[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.560]
Think I ought to try ultra-serb for my tough ethnic cleansing problems.

[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:33.000]
When you put the concentrated rifle power of ultra-serb up against anything else, it's no contest.

[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.720]
I think I will have more copy, Gloria.

[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.360]
Ultra-serb.

[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.460]
For real, ethnic cleansing.

[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:41.460]
Okay.

[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:41.880]
Anything else?

[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.160]
Yeah.

[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.540]
It's a washout.

[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:44.480]
A washout.

[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:44.780]
Okay.

[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.380]
149 at W.O.D.

[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.560]
So anyway, Fatboy comes in here, brings me that check from Denise Potfans, from the guy that

[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.360]
got the hockey pads.

[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:51.760]
Thank you.

[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.300]
That's official.

[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.720]
The final center won total.

[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.380]
It only took us two extra weeks, 108,197.

[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.220]
And he brings me from Brent.

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.020]
And how do you like this?

[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.840]
Brent gave Padwell two shirts, one for me and one for George.

[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.380]
Last week, let's say, Game On, you know, the hockey thing.

[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.440]
We never got him.

[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.860]
I'm going to tell you something, Larry Padwell.

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.940]
You may think you're working over a cheese still.

[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.360]
You're in a bush, you ought to be back there because that's a good place for it.

[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.860]
You're going to be able to go with tenaglia and all the real bush leagers, which we aren't

[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.280]
much better.

[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.520]
But I'm going to tell you something.

[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.820]
You're not going to play fast and loose with our goddamn shirts.

[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.520]
Where's the merchandise, Padwell?

[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.360]
You puttwhacker, you phony, you slime ball, you sleaze bag, you pinstriped soup wearing

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:27.720]
idiot.

[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.220]
So anyway, Brent sends over to, look at this.

[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.200]
It says, hockey is life.

[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.860]
I'm going to wear this to the game tonight.

[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.040]
Hockey is life.

[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.500]
And it's got two big hockey pucks.

[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.500]
And underneath it says, the rest is just details.

[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.140]
That's a beautiful thing.

[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.040]
And also we got for tomorrow.

[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.560]
Here's a big tease for tomorrow.

[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.620]
If Randy West isn't enough to get everybody real excited tonight, I'm sure he's not.

[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.540]
God, I hope not.

[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:51.980]
I hope not.

[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.860]
We're really desperate.

[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.180]
Tomorrow we got 30 copies.

[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.500]
In fact, we're all going to have a bunch of copies, Rick and Suds and Phil and yours truly.

[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.600]
We're going to have 30 copies of the sports illustrated annual swimsuit issue.

[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.900]
And we'll also have ten posters of the cover.

[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.540]
Look at that.

[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.800]
Is she soaking wet or what?

[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.840]
She ain't wearing too much that blonde from the front cover.

[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:12.400]
What is her name?

[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.280]
What's your name, George?

[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:15.080]
Danielle.

[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.000]
Danielle.

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:16.300]

[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.500]
See, Victor had his name over the thing.

[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.860]
His hand over it.

[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:22.000]
Victor had his hand over her thing, okay, which is about as close as he'll ever get.

[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:22.500]
Trust me.

[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.140]
But anyway, we'll have ten posters of Danielle from the cover, big blown up, so to speak.

[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.000]
And 30 issues of the sport.

[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.440]
Now, ordinarily, Victor brings in magazines.

[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.960]
We couldn't give them away if we put a hundred dollar bill in each one.

[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.260]
If we put a thousand dollar bill in each one.

[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.840]
But these I have a feeling tomorrow will be feeling the mail very soon.

[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.460]
And the post office too.

[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:41.500]
W-I-O-D.

[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:42.240]
Mail.

[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:42.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:43.340]
How you doing?

[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:43.660]
Great.

[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:49.060]
You know, I thought you guys were like poking fun at these French Canadians and stuff, how they drive and all that.

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:49.440]
Yeah.

[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.240]
Until I got stuck behind one yesterday.

[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.420]
Man, this couldn't take a lane.

[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.040]
She probably couldn't even pick a nose.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.360]
Bitch.

[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.340]
Going 25 miles an hour.

[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.820]
So then I like, you know, I speed up and I go to pass her and she's flipping me off.

[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.140]
Smelly bitch.

[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.300]
Exactly.

[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:07.740]
Yeah.

[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:08.980]
Can I call someone to douchebag?

[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.560]
Parleville, go back where they came from.

[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.140]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.980]
Ed, stop picking bugs, but.

[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:13.480]
Okay.

[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:14.000]
Thanks.

[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.520]
W-I-O-D.

[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:15.840]
Hello.

[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:17.860]
W-I-O-D.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:18.820]
Yes, Neil.

[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:19.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.200]
Hey, I've been calling you a...

[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.880]
I heard your interview with Donald S. Sherry, tremendous.

[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:24.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.520]
And I'd like to say, hopefully we can get down on my wife's phone a couple times from medicine, huh?

[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.140]
Right.

[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:33.380]
I'd like to maybe get down and see you at the boss and get in there on Friday.

[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.200]
I'll be there.

[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.480]
The other thing, how come you don't have any good announcers down here for hockey?

[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.260]
These guys are brutal.

[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.280]
You're...

[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.500]
Now you're going to attack Jeff Rimmer?

[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.440]
Well, he's not too bad, really.

[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.100]
He's not too bad.

[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.500]
He's okay.

[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.320]
He's pretty good, no matter.

[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.860]
In fact, if we don't say he's pretty good, I'll get a phone call when I get home.

[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.960]
He'll be crying on the phone.

[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.740]
He's very emotional, a very sensitive guy.

[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.740]
He'll be crying into his mustache.

[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.160]
He does a nice job.

[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.040]
He's unfortunately saddled with that big mouth, and he's pot-fan over there, which he can't help.

[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.500]
But the guy on the radio is the worst I've ever heard in my life.

[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.380]
I said the other day, I said the panthers should make a trade.

[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.040]
They should trade Chris Moore to the Bruins for French Q-Six.

[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.780]
I wish they'd do something.

[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.800]
Like you say, you're a competition that W-1-W-Q-A-M worst.

[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.200]
They give you a 5-minute post-game show.

[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:12.600]
Yeah.

[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.620]
And the guy, they're brutal, like...

[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.360]
Because they know nothing about it.

[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.080]
That's the problem.

[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160]
They don't know what they're talking about.

[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.400]
I guess maybe that's it.

[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.180]
They're clueless.

[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.380]
They should get the...

[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.460]
Oh, I can't think not.

[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:23.980]
Show Bowen.

[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.780]
We're getting Joe Bowen and Harry Neal coming down.

[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:26.840]
With any luck.

[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.020]
With a lovely little pass.

[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:28.600]
That's right.

[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.460]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.180]
Thanks. See you there.

[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:30.560]
Bye-bye.

[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.660]
Okay, there's our friends from Medicine Head.

[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.180]
We got a lot of good connox down here.

[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.800]
Those are the ones who speak in English and don't drive real slow.

[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.340]
And they got the Ontario plates.

[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:38.900]
They're okay.

[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:39.820]
Some of them are few.

[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.600]
But boy, those frogs, man.

[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.180]
With those Quebec plates, those Quebecers rhymes with...

[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.440]
W-I-O-D.

[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.680]
W-I-O-D.

[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.200]
There was one of them.

[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:48.880]
W-I-O-D.

[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:49.920]
Yeah, Neal?

[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:50.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.360]
Hey, I'm driving along here looking to this Orlando newspaper.

[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.020]
Yes?

[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:54.820]
There's an article in here.

[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.600]
X Aldevois says Orlando Priest abused me.

[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.880]
Can I read this to you real quick?

[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.200]
Sure.

[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:00.720]
Okay.

[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.060]
Father.

[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.380]
Oh, no, no, wait a minute.

[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.960]
That's the one we had yesterday about the guy in Ultimat Springs or something?

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.280]
Yeah, but did they give us...

[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:12.320]
Isn't that kind of what I said before, but a little bit more diplomatically than he said?

[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.420]
The guy's name was Father Ben Dickham.

[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.760]
He wanted to live up to his name, okay?

[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.060]
He said just...

[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.640]
Some people don't understand subtlety.

[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:32.160]
He said, father old tool, I...

[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.520]
See, no matter how I want to put this, I can't say it.

[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:41.180]
No matter how I put it, it just comes out like real bad.

[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.880]
W-I-O-D.

[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.320]
That's what he said.

[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.120]
W-I-O-D.

[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:45.740]
Hello?

[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.860]
Right, I know.

[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.020]
W-I-O-D.

[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.380]
Yes?

[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.040]
Is it this Neal?

[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.200]
It is, sounds like me.

[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.240]
How you doing?

[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:58.740]
Okay.

[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.440]
All right, did you buy your baseball ticket, yet?

[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.460]
Oh, yeah, I'm going to go out and buy a dozens today, season tickets.

[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.380]
Buck of peace.

[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.900]
Get out of here. W-I-O-D.

[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.260]
Yo!

[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.000]
Ranger.

[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:11.860]
W-I-O-D.

[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.820]
Wagnwazu Winnie Wackerpeck.

[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.600]
W-I-O-D.

[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:15.700]
Neal.

[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.020]
Yes.

[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:16.880]
How you doing?

[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:17.300]
Great.

[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:19.240]
I've got a special request.

[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:19.800]
Okay.

[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.680]
Is that really Aaron's farmer's laughing over and over?

[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.660]
Yes, it is.

[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.300]
That is the funniest thing I have ever heard in a lot.

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.340]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:29.340]

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.220]
Thank you, man.

[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.880]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:33.820]
Holy cow.

[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.040]
Holy cow.

[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.340]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.860]
Neal, you are dead.

[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.560]
Holy cow.

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:41.080]

[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.320]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.240]
Okay.

[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.360]
Thanks, Neal.

[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.940]
Watch out for that train, a seal.

[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:47.840]
Love you.

[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.380]
See ya.

[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.680]
Here's Johnny Darkin.

[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.940]
He was getting very nervous about that format change on the coast.

[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:53.180]
Yeah.

[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:53.660]
That's what they're going to do.

[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.020]
They're going to be doing it pretty soon as a matter of fact.

[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.380]
W-I-O-D, hello.

[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:57.840]
Can I get down with Neal?

[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:58.780]
You're on right now, sir.

[01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.460]
Oh, sorry.

[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.640]
I didn't recognize the voice.

[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.280]
Don't be sorry.

[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.480]
I just want to call all the guys in the yellow and green dovetory.

[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.520]
They're all bunch of rush limo, loving butt-banging.

[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.180]
Where's that?

[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.740]
That's how it's beaten or less.

[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:08.600]
Where's it?

[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.440]
It's how it's beaten.

[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.680]
A dormitory of what?

[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:11.920]
Oh, my God.

[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.560]
Like I said, a bunch of rush limo, loving butt-banging douchebag.

[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.300]
That says it all.

[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:15.920]
Thanks, Neal.

[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.300]
Thanks.

[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.640]
W-I-O-D.

[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.760]
W-I-O-D.

[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]
That was rush right there.

[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.480]
W-I-O-D.

[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:21.940]
Hi.

[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.200]
Is this Neal?

[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:23.760]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.240]
Hi, Neal.

[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.300]
This is a friend in Margate.

[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:31.080]
I heard on the radio a few days ago that you have a charter that goes to Las Vegas.

[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.100]
And I was wondering how I can get a little more information.

[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.200]
Well, we're putting together a package.

[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.220]
We did it last year and we're going to do it again this year.

[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.620]
It's going to leave on May 18th.

[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:37.940]
Uh-huh.

[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:38.900]
A Thursday night.

[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:39.500]
Yeah.

[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.080]
Get there about eight, nine o'clock Vegas time.

[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:42.500]
Right.

[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.080]
Spend Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, come back on Sunday.

[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.440]
And where do you stay?

[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.180]
And we stay.

[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.260]
There's going to be a choice of three depending on how much you want to pay.

[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.920]
Imperial Palace Seasers or the Rio.

[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:51.980]
Rio Grand Suits.

[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:52.360]
Oh.

[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.300]
I think I'm only familiar with Seasers there.

[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.220]
Are they the other two or are they new?

[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:55.800]
No.

[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.480]
Imperial Palace is right across the street.

[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.820]
We were there last year and it was great.

[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.180]
And the Rio Suits is just like behind Seasers.

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:02.480]
The next block down.

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.060]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:03.780]
And fantastic.

[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:04.600]
Oh, it is.

[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.940]
But if you want to talk to Bob Lincoln about it because he's leaving tomorrow, you can call him today.

[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.100]
Yeah, what's his number there?

[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:09.760]
947.

[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.180]
Oh, you're in Broward, right?

[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:11.720]
I'm in Broward.

[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.100]
What's that toll-free number, George?

[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.620]
1-800-823-7264.

[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:19.640]
723-7264.

[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.600]
723-7264.

[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:20.740]
723-7264.

[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:21.800]
1-800-823-7264.

[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:21.800]

[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.200]
Okay.

[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:22.560]
Okay.

[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:23.000]
Thanks a lot.

[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:23.300]
You bad.

[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:23.860]
Bye-bye.

[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.820]
Yeah, we're leaving on a Thursday night May 18th.

[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.420]
We're putting all the final touches on this.

[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.560]
Bob and his daughter, like you heard before, she's going out there to stay to work there.

[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.500]
And he's going out there, allegedly, of course, to take her out there and help her get acclimated.

[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.020]
But he's just looking for another good way to go out there and have a great time, which is what it's all about.

[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.040]
And he'll set up all the final details.

[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.900]
So at about 10 days, we're going to like put everything together.

[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.200]
The final touches on it.

[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.440]
We're keeping the promotions people out of this thing this year.

[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.800]
We're keeping the sales manager out of this thing this year.

[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.880]
We're keeping a program director out of this thing this year.

[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.780]
Now, let me ask you, they're going to have a large cargo section because Jeff High is the sales guy in charge of it.

[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.720]
So if he has a wife come along, we're really in deep-puh, do-do.

[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.780]
W-I-O-D.

[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.280]
N-I-O-R-J-S-R.

[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:05.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.140]
Okay.

[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.300]
How was it?

[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:08.400]
W-I-O-D.

[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.780]
W-I-O-D.

[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.060]
Jennifer Rimm.

[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:12.680]
God.

[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.220]
W-I-O-D.

[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.720]
Hello, dark lady.

[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:17.540]
A little bit too close, you know.

[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.340]
It was close.

[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.940]
It was right on the edge, but he didn't get his little bleep in here in the middle.

[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.580]
In fact, I thought I heard Jennifer say.

[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:24.360]
Hey, asshole.

[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:24.880]
Yeah.

[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.100]
Okay.

[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.740]
Or maybe she actually said she was astonished with those pictures, Barbara.

[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.480]
It just keeps getting bigger.

[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.720]
I, Luis Miguel, play it, baby.

[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:35.640]
Okay.

[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.400]
I'm still waiting for the little red light.

[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.380]
When you go to Amsterdam, it's always good to kind of walk around, get your feet wet.

[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.360]
Look for the little red light.

[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.480]
Is that thing ever going to come back on again or what?

[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.860]
I think I'll go ahead, live dangerously.

[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.000]
No, I'm, yeah, right.

[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.120]
You live dangerously on your show, asshole.

[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.280]
W-I-O-D.

[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:53.580]
Hello.

[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:54.920]
Hello.

[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:55.520]
Yes?

[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.240]
Yes, Neil?

[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:57.880]
Yes.

[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.060]
Yeah, how are you?

[01:24:59.260 --> 01:24:59.520]
Okay.

[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.360]
You got to start doing your screenless, man.

[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.300]
They drive me crazy.

[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.340]
If you...

[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:04.860]
I love it.

[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.200]
This has been a great show today.

[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.500]
It's been an ice kicker, man.

[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.860]
Yeah, but you've really find out how many lunatics you got out there.

[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.560]
I love it.

[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.540]
That's what it's all about.

[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.380]
The more the barrier.

[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.900]
Can I make a desperate attempt at a court?

[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:15.320]
Yes.

[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.200]
I, Rosalo, peace.

[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:18.680]
Beauty.

[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:19.740]
See ya.

[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:20.500]
Bye-bye.

[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:21.780]
W-I-O-D.

[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:23.560]
Hello.

[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:24.800]
W-I-O-D.

[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:26.980]
Hello, Neil.

[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.440]
W-I-O-D.

[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.200]
Neil.

[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:29.580]
Yes.

[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.300]
Just got to tell you, Aaron, some other video could just make sex so boring.

[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.140]
Yeah.

[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.240]
I didn't think it was possible.

[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.900]
She'd take it and just make it, she destroys it.

[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.340]
Okay.

[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.740]
I wasn't taking a couple of no-dos, but watch out because when you stand up they might fall out.

[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:47.580]
The only radio station that doesn't suck.

[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.920]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.140]
610 W-I-O-D.

[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.000]
Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.800]
Problem air?

[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.000]
Talk to Mr. Red.

[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.820]
Good afternoon at 2 o'clock on Jennifer Ramm.

[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.800]
610 W-I-O-D news.

[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.720]
Brought to you by US Air.

[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.360]
A Palm Beach County judge has ruled...
