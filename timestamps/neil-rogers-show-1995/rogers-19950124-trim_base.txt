Now, the Neil Rogers Show, a news talk at Entertainment Radio 610 WIOD

[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.120]
As whole, as whole

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.520]
But the that way, hyzing is such an as whole

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.820]
He held that man-ditch, that creature

[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.360]
He turned

[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.160]
Because he would take a shower with

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.100]
Hank Olberg as whole

[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.580]
As whole

[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.640]
Each way hyzing is such an as whole

[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.440]
He's just like Hitler

[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.280]
And Abe Abram

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.760]
What's that? He's pounding on

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.900]
As whole, as whole

[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.140]
We miss a quintessential as whole

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.740]
The only thing there is left to say

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.180]
Is drop test right away

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.300]
Oh

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.580]
I think I'm gonna be there

[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.860]
I think that it's now

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.400]
A girl I'm going to wear

[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.820]
That's gay 25

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.180]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.410]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.090]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.010]
Or she don't care

[00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.390]
She says that the waiting plant

[00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.210]
I cause her distress

[00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.230]
Yeah

[00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.230]
I don't know how she will fit in her wedding dress

[00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.930]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.250]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.010]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.690]
I'm telling you why you pushed her too wide

[00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.570]
She don't even know where she got it

[00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.990]
She's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.990]
To the glides

[00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.210]
To the glides

[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.210]

[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.210]

[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.270]
She did what she thought

[00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.950]
Oh, I know everything that I knew

[00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.610]
I believe it is

[00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.470]
To drive the opera's slim way

[00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.670]
Or see Jenny Craig

[00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.490]
Oh, she's gotta touch her swine

[00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.830]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.390]
She's gotta touch her swine

[00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.270]
And she don't care

[00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.210]
I'm telling you why you pushed her too wide

[00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.210]
She don't even know where she got it

[00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.470]
She's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.610]
To the glides she did what she thought

[00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.550]
Oh, I believe it is

[00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.870]
To drive the opera's slim way

[00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.710]
Or see Jenny Craig

[00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.870]
Oh, she's gotta touch her swine

[00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:32.850]
And she don't even know where she got it

[00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.890]
She's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.890]

[00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.890]

[00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.530]
Oh, she's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.550]
To drive the opera's slim way

[00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.510]
Or see Jenny Craig

[00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:01.270]
Oh, she's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.270]

[00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.270]

[00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.450]
Oh, she's gonna have to go on a diet

[00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.510]
To drive the opera's slim way

[00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.950]
What?

[00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.690]
How do you like that for time?

[00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.650]
All right, morning, council

[00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.750]
Here's the judge

[00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.450]
All right, back on the record in the early釷

[00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.690]
Mr. Simpson is again present before the court with his council

[00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.950]
Mr. Almond, Mr. Schicuro, Mr. Revlon

[00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.010]
Mr. Douglas, Mr. Bailey

[00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.590]
People represented by Mr. Clark, Mr. Darden, and Mr. Hutchman

[00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.790]
In other words, I don't got it

[00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.850]
I don't got it

[00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.150]
You have matters to dispose of before we reach our opening statement stage

[00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.550]
Uh, council

[00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.670]
Yesterday the jurors when they retired

[00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.210]
We got the hall

[00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.510]
One of the jurors handed the bailiffs a note for the court

[00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.630]
And they were just curious

[00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.590]
Whether or not the court was gonna allow them to watch the Super Bowl

[00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.850]
Because we can, and I've indicated to them that yes they can

[00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.190]
And that we would arrange their participation to record it

[00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.650]
Only in America, this has got to be the epitome

[00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.150]
He hasn't got his tongue wet yet from speaking

[00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.470]
Ten seconds out of his push this judge

[00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.090]
What are we concerned about?

[00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.670]
Here's the biggest, most ballyhooed, most hyped murder trial

[00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.110]
In the history of the goddamn human race

[00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.990]
And within the first five seconds

[00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.510]
What is the judge addressing?

[00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.950]
The jury wants to know

[00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.530]
Can they watch the Super Bowl this weekend

[00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.810]
All right

[00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.130]
Does that tell you everything you need to know?

[00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.230]
And I wonder, I wonder who's the judge's bet not

[00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.470]
Okay crank it up a second

[00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.690]
Here's the free here at Deuce Bag

[00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.450]
You're old, you're old

[00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.370]
You're on the first objection

[00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.490]
I thought you were like exposed by the people

[00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.590]
Is that this has never been done before

[00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.790]
Yeah, and we have located at least two California presidents

[00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.910]
They were the ass-bow to the four

[00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.150]
The first came in, let's carry this, probably, what, oh the first case of the century

[00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.270]
Which was the trial of the Clarence Darrow here in Los Angeles for jury bribery

[00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.770]
Even though Mr. Darrow was represented by an innocent girl Rogers

[00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.790]
He was allowed to directly participate

[00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.270]
What's that thing?

[00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.130]
The case with the guy that he met presentation

[00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.850]
Rob the opening statement and closing argument to the jury

[00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.830]
Yeah, stop mocking her

[00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.590]
The second example came in 1972

[00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.910]
In the trial of Angela Davis

[00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.050]
Dr. Michael Jackson liked to share more than California

[00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.350]
In which although she was represented by council

[00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.930]
She also was allowed to present

[00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.930]
Opening remarks to the jury

[00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:46.130]
Yeah, so it's not a question of proposing something that has never been done before

[00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.070]
As to which there is no precedent

[00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.290]
Okay, let's get on with it

[00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:56.210]
The second objection raised by the people is that they will be deprived of their right of cross examination

[00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.010]
And I think that really misconceives what is being proposed here

[00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.810]
All right, first of all, I'll be talking

[00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.570]
Okay, now do you want to hear this?

[00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.870]
Hello?

[00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:07.810]
Yes

[00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:08.810]
You do want to hear it?

[00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.530]
Yeah, for a little bit

[00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.450]
Okay, hang on, you want to hear it?

[00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.190]
Yeah

[00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.870]
Hang on, you want to hear it?

[00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.630]
Hello?

[00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.770]
Line six

[00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.010]
Rowered

[00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.070]
They're gone anyway, screw them. You want to hear it?

[00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.870]
Hello?

[00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.770]
Palm Beach

[00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.870]
What is that?

[00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.570]
Okay, crank it back up again. We got like two people in front of an opening statement

[00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:40.590]
What we are hoping to like proposing is that Mr. Simpson be allowed to introduce himself to the jurors

[00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.750]
To introduce the defense team, the lawyers who are representing him

[00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.870]
And to simply reiterate his plea of not guilty

[00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.650]
Oh, man

[00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:57.570]
Now of course the prosecution has no opportunity to cross examine a plea

[00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.190]
Of course not

[00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.350]
And we believe this crack in there would be quite appropriate

[00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.430]
Quite inappropriate

[00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.810]
For the jury to hear the plea of not guilty and the public justice trial on a motion

[00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.050]
Directly bending the lips of the implying jury and brain inducing

[00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.630]
This is not really all that remarkable a request

[00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.070]
What it really is is the focus, the attention of the jury

[00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.090]
Backward, long years and the midst of all of this hoopla

[00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.930]
And that is on the defendant who is on trial

[00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.870]
To remind them that what's really a stake in this trial is one men freedom

[00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.630]
We want them to see who that man is

[00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:51.890]
A lawyer to prevent them from hearing from him very briefly in terms of introducing himself, introducing counsel and reiterating his plea

[00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.270]
Yeah

[00:09:52.270 --> 00:10:02.550]
The second part of the motion simply addresses a physical demonstration that is routinely done by the prosecution

[00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:12.510]
As well as the defense to try to best rise and bring out and involve any testimony but simply a preview of evidence that will be presented in the court

[00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:22.250]
Okay, here we go

[00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.090]
Regarding certain surgeries that he has undergone as a result of his court

[00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.430]
That's what it is, maybe you want to see my knee?

[00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.730]
Yes, that is correct

[00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.590]
We're going to show him his knee

[00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:44.510]
And have you contemplated the security desires of the sheriff's department that they have their bailiff within close proximity of Mr. Simpson at the time that this is done

[00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:53.230]
And how you would do that in a manner that would not convey a unnecessarily negative message to the jury

[00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:59.330]
Well that was the reason we brought this up in advance, so that it adequate

[00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:07.470]
How about Baldwin Sheen? The preparation could be made to post a run-step on this side of the courtroom if that's necessary

[00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.290]
But it simply involves him walking from one side of the courtroom to the other

[00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:19.490]
And unfortunately the logical place to do that is right by the prosecution council there

[00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.730]
Okay, here's the rule of the proximate pride as well

[00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.770]
We got spots to do judge what kind of play did the lawyer say to the law?

[00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.690]
Unfortunately, a small courtroom

[00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:35.850]
Well, if the prosecution wants to just switch sides with us, we'll be glad to move over to this side of the courtroom

[00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:43.310]
But I don't think that they have any concerns about being in proximity of the defendant

[00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.550]
Well, I have just had concerns about that as a security concern is all

[00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.930]
All right, thank you, come on, Judge

[00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.290]
Say something

[00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.730]
Judge, say it, do it

[00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.210]
Get off the pot already

[00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.610]
Say something beside you want to watch the damn Superboy?

[00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.670]
Judge, always be per just went off under his row by

[00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.190]
I'm informed of wine is often has distressed the issue with the bailiff

[00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.370]
There's no problem with the bailiff being in touch

[00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.570]
Just passed a memo to the jury and the line is nice and nice

[00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.030]
Addresses a jury or this place is neat

[00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.570]
Okay, let's go, let's go, the guy who already finished your thing, sit for a second

[00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.190]
And then he's going to ask down and let's go

[00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.590]
Let's get it wrong, now Marsha Clark's about to get off, she's going to hop your china

[00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.810]
Thank you and good morning, your honor

[00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.310]
Okay, get rid of this, we'll do this right

[00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.410]
And by the time it comes back, maybe the judge is going to finally do something

[00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.090]
Something or somebody, 1218 at your OJ station, W-I-O-D

[00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.970]
610 W-I-O-D, remind you, friends don't let friends listen to anyone else

[00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.270]
I'm going to start on this theme and I'm going to wrap it all year long

[00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.430]
Second tight end comes into the game, one running back is Greg Hill

[00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.270]
Both white outs are to the left side now, JJ Burton in motion light

[00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.790]
First in 10, Kansas City Bono back to pass again, has time

[00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.910]
He's throwing deep down to the sideline, it is taking away

[00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.550]
Intercepted by Gene Acton's, he's returning up the sideline

[00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.510]
Don't get up to the middle, he's to the 40s, to the 45th lateral

[00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.410]
He knocks down the official and Troy Vincent is out

[00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.790]
Troy, oh my god, the 35th lateral

[00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.330]
He's got out

[00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.510]
Out, out, out, out

[00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.510]
T-O-D

[00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.050]
Gene Acton and Troy Vincent combined on the interception return

[00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.150]
And I think Gene Acton's maybe hurt

[00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.530]
Oh my god, what a sensational play

[00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.530]
Yes

[00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.810]
Yes

[00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.470]
Okay, 1221, let's potter up a little low there

[00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.530]
She's basically saying there's plenty of, a little low-wice

[00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.950]
Mr. I don't know if we have any of this

[00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.790]
Steped on by no district attorney, bitch

[00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.390]
She says there's plenty of case law like for example one guy in some case wanted to show his tattoos

[00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.270]
To the gerina, said that would be offering testimony

[00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.550]
And the same as he wants to show all his knees or his weenie or whatever he wants to show him

[00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.310]
That's offering testimony but he don't want to be cross-examined

[00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:21.850]
And she said keep this douchebag, but he wants to if he wants to get out of a standard testify that's fine

[00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.310]
And then we'll ask him some really good hard questions that we would like to ask Sam

[00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.290]
Turn it on

[00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:31.190]
To have the defendant exhibit his arms to the jury without first being sworn as a witness

[00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.310]
That case 35, cal up 3812

[00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.690]
This is on the morning in question, I mean this is the end of January 95

[00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:42.110]
The thing happened on June 12th of last year he was playing golf that morning the week before the murders

[00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:47.750]
He completed an exercise video so if he's gonna cry that he's like in such bad shape to stick in bad turn it up

[00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.990]
The court was upheld and it was determined that if it was a testimonial

[00:14:51.990 --> 00:15:00.590]
It was if it was being offered a testimonial evidence it was properly refused when the defendant declined to be sworn as a witness and subject himself to cross examination

[00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:01.830]
Yeah

[00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:08.990]
It also ruled that if the offer was a demonstrative one then the trial court was justified in rejecting it on the basis that it was irrelevant

[00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.410]
As I've indicated to the court yesterday his arm was being offered on May 7th

[00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:20.570]
And I want to judge starts opening up his post then we'll get you know his arm down off off position shut up bitch

[00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.610]
Okay, let's go to a sunrise hello

[00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.830]
Yes, how do you like it so far?

[00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:31.190]
So far it's pretty pathetic. Yeah, I got a kidding perspective everyone no one's called in today

[00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.790]
You can tell you about Eric. I said to call it again. That's good

[00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.130]
Still suck. I listen to get she still sucks. It's so pathetic. Yeah

[00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.010]
But the thing is what she does have one help of a sense of humor

[00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:55.070]
She is a tremendous but in fact, she was the inspiration for that song we just play talk us to wide. What about the one before we are love

[00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.770]
But what is it? Yeah, that was it

[00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:02.810]
The thing is and someone mentioned a couple days ago is that if she didn't get that we should we you guys should do a test

[00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.790]
She didn't get any close like 15 minutes and see what happens. Yeah, because it's just a question

[00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.730]
We should disconnect the passion lines is what we ought to do that would fix her ass pretty good

[00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:18.550]
Let me see what she does watch her fake her way through like I'm gonna do for the next 172 days here 172 days

[00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.210]
Oh my god

[00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.970]
This is like a death sentence he's gonna get off and we're the ones that are getting punished out of you like that

[00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.050]
That's America for you

[00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.790]
Okay, then the hockey to do you into the game by say yes, sir you bet

[00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.410]
How could they lose how could they lose it was easy. It's called no defense

[00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:39.550]
From the brain stuff. I was sitting actually pretty close to the brain step. Were you really he was right next to the other

[00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.050]
Bernie Kosar and Ivan Lindel with a bad team

[00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.190]
If you say earlier Bernie always have a kind of like cheesy

[00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.970]
But most work on the same. Yeah, I always very happy. Yeah

[00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.010]
Yeah, too bad he's stay well

[00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.450]
He's when he threw a side-side like I guess you're happy a lot, but it was embarrassing when he he turned right

[00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:02.530]
He turned right to high Zanga who at least whether you like him or not is a man with a few bucks in the owns the teams and everything and

[00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.230]
Bernie turns right to Zanga and says

[00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.550]
And Wayne turned red as a beat it was beautiful

[00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.430]
Okay

[00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.310]
Potted up judges sitting there with his finger up his nose. He's picking a winner

[00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.890]
Oh, no, he's really reading the racing for oh, now don't don't analyze it get this guy off this douchebag

[00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.930]
Judges like I'm for this

[00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.370]
The judges the check-in-out case lawyer's got a couple of

[00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.090]
And at one there and goes on

[00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:45.010]
The holding 1348 nine give the fast-led exposition 1350 kiss the ruling. Yeah

[00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.250]
And oh

[00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.750]
And I don't know. Don't do this. What is it the OJ Simpson trial air

[00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.490]
CNN is putting a slide up on this thing

[00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.530]
What the hell is that and they're going to a commercial break okay kill it

[00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.550]
So he must be gonna analyze this thing now for a couple of minutes because you know that when they go to commercial break

[00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.670]
It's like in a football game when they take an official timeout. It's a TV timeout

[00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.790]
So even in this trial not to say that the media is orchestrating this at all of course

[00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.830]
But when they come back from the commercial they gave him the signal

[00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.030]
They flashed into the little red light goes on in the courtroom like during the hockey game and as soon as the light goes off

[00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:29.190]
Well, I've decided to take a good dump and I'll come back here South Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes. I'm still dying over here

[00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.410]
So how do you like it so far?

[00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:37.730]
They're gonna let him watch the Super Bowl this weekend and of course you notice how the sports people have made the OJ thing into a sports story

[00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.810]
So I wouldn't be at all surprised that they sneak a few things in here and

[00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.270]
They're gonna bring back the old OJ commercial and run it to the airport

[00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.810]
Make Donald's emblems on that I believe it

[00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:55.410]
This and I got one thing to say about this about the seven-score foreigners and all of the on neon fans and all the people who want to neon neon down here for the for the dolphins

[00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.190]
Yeah, I have one thing to say yeah

[00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.570]
First thing goal on the five yard line with six minutes left to go cowboys down by 10. Yeah, they're not gonna win

[00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.970]
There's no way San Francisco to change but with the official stand five feet in front of them

[00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.150]
They don't have a fly because he's neon down. Hey, no penalty cowboys lose

[00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.270]
They got the rest of the cowboys got the rest kick cut the crack. Hey, hey, all right. They got their ass

[00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.210]
I gotta pretend you're on the jury rice and Taylor and those guys they they just turn them apart like

[00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.570]
Like a monster watch they were on Troy ackman like stick on Wayne man like stick on the brainstem

[00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.970]
I don't know it next year. I mentioned the brainstem dusting too when you think about it, you know nasty

[00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.870]
Yes, in there. It's covered with all that blow wow. We know why it's middle of lunch hour

[00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:42.750]
Listen, I got a birthday wish going out of here. Yeah, okay my dad's listening and he's turned 51 years old today 51 almost is old a far design

[00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.530]

[00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:07.690]
Oh, okay, we all get that because the bridge tenders worn out he needs a long rest. He's got him. He's got him for Seema real bad

[00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.730]
So a language lab part. Oh, and I gotta go in a here and get it see I'm a little I'm kind of like laying back because we're

[00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:30.150]
This is gonna be a very interesting thing we're out of finesse our way through this and of course our programming department is

[00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:35.870]
Staying out of this which is probably just as well. Let's see disc 645 because you know ordinarily we'd say well

[00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.690]
You know the people are want to watch and listen et cetera. They're gonna be gone

[00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:44.150]
Well, we can't accept that because if we accept that we're gonna be out of business for six months now the people listen to the coast

[00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.670]
And how will oh five they be gone okay because they're all on the oh Jay

[00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.370]
But as far as work concerned we can like mix and match we can like you know through a couple of bits in there

[00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.130]
Let the judge take a little dump every once in a while and it'll fit in perfect

[00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.170]
And I bet you this will fit in perfect too between now when he comes back and says keep his ass away from the jury

[00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.250]
Bang which tape number six the convenience store

[00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.930]

ordering Chinese food over the phone okay, so the judges just made a ruling you said I don't

[00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:29.470]
1229 a W I O D 16 W I O D listen longer and you'll get an attitude too

[00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:36.150]
So judge Edo is just ruled that OJ do not going to be arrested jury he has denied permission

[00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:41.010]
But he will allow him to show his knees and his scars on his knees and his old football injuries

[00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.530]
Etc. Runs so on and sign autographs for everybody

[00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.490]
But

[00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.110]
So he cannot address the jury but it can show him his knees and maybe like a few other good parts

[00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:55.830]
Okay, here's a jensen b chillow hey nil yes, hey, oh, they should be wearing those knee pads or something

[00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.470]
I wouldn't be surprised when he yanks up his trousers. He's wearing them

[00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.770]
Yeah, listen, what if they're gonna let him autograph his jockstrap to the ovc you

[00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.810]
Well, I try you can't get iod either or night whatever station she's on in Orlando

[00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.670]
You most definitely cannot get a night and of course tap a forget it. So what is that all about?

[00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.870]
I had heard her in Orlando a while back, but I

Iod about right at the end of the field show almost you know it's borderline well it sundown

Yeah, it changes every month as it gets later in the summer. It's later on, you know

[00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.550]
So how do you need more 800 lines?

[00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.930]
For Orlando and Tampa and Aaron

[00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:41.670]
She's the starner she hasn't she hasn't had one rating period she hasn't had one anything and she's the superstar now

[00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.930]
Everything is catered to this bit. I mean to her

[00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:50.050]
The whole phone setup we've been here some of us for a hundred years and this broad comes in because she's got a great ass and

[00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.850]
Pats the pd on a ass if she can still find it all of a sudden she's got 85 personal phone lines now

[00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.070]
Unreal. How do you like that?

[00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.070]
Unreal not that I begrudge or anything. I hope she gets a 20 share because it'll help the rest of us

[00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.010]
But in the meantime we'd like a couple of phone lines is somewhere, you know

[00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.530]
Yeah, now that they took away our damn bell sound line really bastards

[00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.250]
But I was watching the game last night at martin county and we were four to three

[00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.210]
I thought you were some kind of guru or something. Yeah, I said four three and then all of a sudden Wayne said oh that's a score that

[00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:22.110]
Faggot predicted we better give up a couple of goals exactly right anyway. All right, Neil have a great day, pali see you

[00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:27.210]
So what was the final verdict? I guess we didn't get a verdict from him or from OJ about the Aaron show

[00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.790]
We don't want to get into that again. Do we we do we have an open line in day at 751

[00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.890]
WIOD if you're worried that you're missing something right now you may think it's really heavy duty, but it's not

[00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.970]
OJ just blew his nose he said his news

[00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.330]
He says here's some good news

[00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.350]
So anyway

[00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.430]
Uh-huh

[00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:52.890]
So his one of the five hundred attorneys for OJ now one of the brothers is up there and they're like presenting um

[00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.970]
exhibits

[00:24:54.590 --> 00:25:00.230]
Art exhibits and football exhibits. Here's the NFL trophy the most valuable player trove no not that kind

[00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.990]
But they got the exhibits not their argument about that and about one in the p.m

[00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.230]
Which is about a half hour from now they're getting ready for opening statements whenever they get done

[00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.790]
Dittling around with these stupid exhibits

[00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:15.010]
But in the meantime the only important thing that you thought you were gonna miss is the judge says

[00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.130]
OJ cannot address the jury cut the crap and stop for the grandsteading

[00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:24.230]
But if you want to show him your knees and your scars and any other body parts that might be attractive or stimulating

[00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.750]
No problem. I'd like to look to is what he said

[00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.750]
Because I'm a big fan. He did he said I'm a big fan and can I get your autograph mr. OJ

[00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.890]
Please here's a lady in Kendall. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. You may. Isn't this a joke?

[00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.150]
Neil. It's a psychus. You know what you can say

[00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:47.070]
Holy bull holy bull is right remember that yes, I do. Oh, it was only two days ago. I can remember that

[00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.750]
Oh wonderful

[00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:54.930]
Uh, I wish I was there, but anyway. No, I'm not I'm not into that. I'm into what holy bull

[00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.510]
No, I mean

[00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:57.570]
OJ

[00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:02.030]
Yeah, you are come on come on you're hanging on every description now

[00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.830]
Neil you must admit I'm spicing it up a lot better than they are on CNN. You know what I have it on mute

[00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.450]
Yeah, and listening to you same as I do I got my TV on and I'm mute and a boy

[00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:19.170]
Okay, sweetheart. Take care. Okay. Bye. See ya. See that's what everybody in time's gonna do. They have it on mute

[00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.830]
Muted there we go and they'll listen to us and we'll just do the

[00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.450]
And of course when Phil is on it's really going to be good because Phil

[00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:32.930]
Uh, they're not going to know whether it's the judge speaking or OJ or Steve Ornell or Margaret or

[00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.290]
Marsha Clark or Clark Kent or who the hell are lowest lane

[00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.230]
1236 it. I'm sorry to do it again so soon, but you got to solve backed up by screwing up the hour George

[00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.270]
1236 w ojd

[00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:51.670]
10 w i o d just like a thing for not puppy. He's a national death and that's hairy thing in the back of your refrigerator

[00:26:51.670 --> 00:27:03.170]
We're getting bigger all the time. Oh my god. Let's strap OJ in a comfy chair and give him the gas somewhere's in cal

[00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.690]
490

[00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.670]
Yes, let's do it today

[00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.030]
Oi

[00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:17.630]
Anita Brian's gonna have the job of twisting the knobs that gives the

[00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:22.750]
Choose that special gas. Oh my god. He's a pain in my ass

[00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:32.310]
I don't give a crap about the chase scene or the 20,000 special reports

[00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:39.490]
The only thing I'm interested in is whether or not he soils his shorts

[00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:47.610]
Oh, let's wrap OJ in a comfy chair and give him the gas somewhere's in cal

[00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.130]
490

[00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.330]
Let's do it today

[00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:00.030]
So anyway, they're doing the thing with the exhibits and they get to the very first one to show you how long this trial is gonna

[00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.410]
Take and the first one is some videotapes they got and I have no idea what's on them

[00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.350]
And they got one that they just handed to the prosecution this morning. This of course is the defense

[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.730]
And I think this one is called OJ scores five against uh Notre Dame for USC

[00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.430]
The only problem is and of course she though nothing about football and the deal is it was earning Davis

[00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:23.010]
Who scored five touchdowns for no for USC against Notre Dame not OJ and now the judge says well don't you think we ought to watch

[00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.950]
At least the first five or ten minutes of this

[00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:30.630]
Because he really put on some great moves and broke a couple of tackles and she's standing there like well

[00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.070]
You know how long are you gonna drag the sun douchebag why don't you go back to Japan where you came from

[00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.010]
And then she said something else about his ancestry and about his first wife and how she was beaten and abused or whether

[00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.790]
Or was it his wife's first husband that's what it was right

[00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:53.090]
Something about gook. Here's the pember pines on the purple line. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing Neil great first time caller all right

[00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.930]
Uh listen, a funny story

[00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:00.350]
I was uh in a local clothing chain. Yeah, I went there to get a suit

[00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.770]
Yeah, you know, she always laughs at the wrong time

[00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.230]
Okay, well long story short. I'm yeah

[00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.350]
I'm a little bigger on the top than the bottom. They always have to measure my pants

[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:17.430]
You're a little bigger on the top than on the bottom. Okay, in other words the head on the top is bigger. Okay

[00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:22.010]
Well, there's always taken in my pants at the bottom anyway. It's time it turns out it's a

[00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.650]
woman there who is doing the measurements everything really

[00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.230]
Yeah, a woman is measuring your inseam

[00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.750]
Well, yeah, well, and when while she's doing it she was uh

[00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:40.070]
Touching it here and there. Oh my god. I'm sure it was all accidental. Yeah, right

[00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:45.950]
But anyway, right. All right. What about a half an hour? It excited me a little bit. We're gonna get the cleaning bill now

[00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.330]
Yeah, yeah, excited me a little bit. So uh

[00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.250]
Anyway

[00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.290]
A little bit a lot

[00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.430]
He starts to talk about

[00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.190]
I'm wearing my

[00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.490]
She's to tell me I'm wearing my body

[00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.670]
To the right which normally it falls to the left

[00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.390]
You're wearing your body to the right

[00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.470]
Yes, it is so hard. Yeah

[00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:14.250]
So anyway, she's proceeded to tell me about how the pants are made

[00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.070]
bigger on the left leg than the right because most men wear their body to the left

[00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:25.270]
Well, what a crock that is. Uh-uh. They wear their body to the left most men

[00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:25.950]
It

[00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.570]
Falls to the left. Anyway, it's so big they have to make a bigger pant leg for it

[00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.830]
Oh, give me a break and I've heard some wild pills

[00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:41.290]
What? That's true. It's true. What tailors measure you they ask you if you're left to a right drape if they're a good tailor

[00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.110]
They don't ask me that

[00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.670]
They say where do you put that button mushroom?

[00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:55.290]
You got to be kidding me a left to a right drape now this college intended to make all of us feel inferior is what this is

[00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.750]
Anyway, I want to congratulate you. So no, it's Peter North was hanging south. Is that what you're saying?

[00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.910]
I'm gonna congratulate you on your numbers yesterday. They were great

[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.670]
especially your 10 to 11 which I always

[00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.790]
Switched you from Howard right thank God and

[00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.410]
What's uh, like you know you're always complaining you don't get paid enough

[00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.610]
I think you need to mention to your superiors there that

[00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:23.330]
Howard, I mean look how many people they have on the payroll for Howard in there

[00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.870]
They have like five people to help them out whenever he runs out of it

[00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.550]
A lot better with the activate George so damn much that kind of drags me down a little bit

[00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.530]
So honey about that caller earlier about the

[00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.410]
About the events why people are later in south florida. Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious

[00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:45.050]
It's the area we live in my sister married into a human family and their late

[00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:51.970]
To everything. Oh, yeah, our late to every it's Cuban time right? So exactly. So that's why in south florida

[00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.490]
You have all these people arriving late even the Jews do that Cuban time

[00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.990]
Have a great day pali

[00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.070]
Okay, see a open line on the purple line at cellular one pound iod

[00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.930]
We're keeping you drift CNN is in a commercial break right now. This is gonna be heavy duty

[00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:17.050]
I should be getting paid extra we should both begin paid a lot extra for as long as this trial goes on

[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:23.090]
Because Mark Ferman and the gloves it indicates plural at no time how do you like that?

[00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.010]
So testifying the chart is misleading

[00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.490]
We're giving you nothing to see them. No giving it

[00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.730]
There busy running spots people object

[00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.850]
To that to the use of the plural

[00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.670]
That never occurred

[00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.090]
See pluralism is that in the merc of entire definitely that are warrant

[00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.610]
Search warrant and circumstances of the search

[00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.150]
Yeah

[00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.850]
I

[00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.010]
Relevant to the trial before the trial of fact that is a legal issue that the court rules upon

[00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.070]
That is improper to raise

[00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.790]
You know opening statements let alone in trial or did you

[00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:03.970]
I was further um mentioned to the court. I thought the court ruled that Mark Ferman could not be mentioned in opening statement

[00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:04.550]
correct

[00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.630]
The people object on that basis as well

[00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.550]
All right, I won't happen. They just cut out they just died

[00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:15.610]
Oh

[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:23.910]
Well, I think Ted Turner got pissed off because CNN cut away the commercial break and he doesn't want AP radio or CBS

[00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.550]
Radio the other network see now you're telling me that the young and the horny is on

[00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:33.010]
That CBS is running soap, but I have a feeling that when the opening arguments started one o'clock

[00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:37.370]
What's gonna happen to Nick are they're gonna slice him right off in the middle that would be bad and painful

[00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:42.370]
What what's gonna happen there? I can't be wasting my time with the young and the horny although now I can tape it again

[00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.350]
Now that I know they're feeding it and this is very very confusing

[00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:50.390]
So for the eight people out there who don't have cable at all we're doing one heavy duty service

[00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.490]
1246 at W.I.O.D

[00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.390]
16 W I O D more gas than X on

[00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.010]

Here's Sharon Mahoney and Puerto Rico will I'll be damned hi Neil what's going on Sharon?

[00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:12.070]
Oh god you wouldn't believe all the crazy things are going on yeah like well of now for something completely different

[00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:18.590]
My brother-in-law is making his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. Well, isn't that great another Pavrote?

[00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:25.010]
Yeah, he was barassorta though his name is what another mouthful barassorta barassorta

So what's up Sharon?

[00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.910]
Well, I have I have another child

[00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:46.350]
Yeah, I'm the mother of a baby making machine by the way. She has 87 children since she left us about four or five years ago here at W I O D

[00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.530]
You know how glad they are I left before I started having them

[00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:54.830]
And we have about 72 people who've replaced her in that orifice by the way they're about the 85 90 people who've

[00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:59.930]
Followed near footsteps. Well when I called this morning. I called the newsroom and I was like well

Who who is there that I know it turned out no one's there that I still know there's nobody here that I know currently either by the way

[00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.530]
Well, but you're lucky then yeah, it's just all a blur is it I just come rushing in and Russian out

[00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.450]
Now let's see you're not with Terry the pirate anymore

Oh, yeah, sure sure now the pirate oh really? Yeah, it's Miguel the pirate though. Mickey Luis Miguel the pirate

[00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.310]
No, not Luis Miguel. Oh, what a shame. That would have been a good in

[00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:48.750]
So anyway, uh, the Metropolitan Opera House February 7th. Was that a shameless plug? Yeah, oh, I've never done it before

[00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.610]
What's his name? Luciano LaSorta?

If you wish his name is Antonio Barasorta. Barasorta. Yes

[00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.370]

[00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.930]
And so I named him well my daughter is

[00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:12.750]
Opera singer. Well, what is he some kind of a faggot or something sure? Well, uh, I don't think so I think he's like kind of uh, he likes the ladies

[00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:18.670]
Yeah, which is you know, he wants to dress up for something unusual and different Neil wants to dress up like ladies

[00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:26.190]
Well, he's actually gonna be dressing up as a clown. Uh-huh. Oh, well, I said she's it for me. Yeah, okay. Yeah, Pallacci, you know, great

[00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.350]
I got you

[00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:35.910]
Well, it's Sharon. It's a really great talk to you, but you know, I know you got a go-neel. Hi, Marciza. We got the OJ business going on here

[00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.990]
Not that you're not important to us, but you know, OJ. Yes, well, we're all around his ass

[00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:47.210]
Fight on fight the good fight Neil. Okay, Sharon take care of yourself. Bye. Nice hearing you. Bye. Bye

[00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.470]
But once you started singing that I couldn't handle it

[00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.250]
Okay, we have an open line in dates 751 purple line

[00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:56.290]
Well, we got the not too many open lines people are hanging on here just so they can hear it on the damn phone

[00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.570]
Oh, here's the defense tape now. What is this?

[00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.250]
This is OJ

[00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.130]
Climb in the fair

[00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.730]
What is that?

[00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.250]
It's a defense tape of uh somebody going oh, that's the crime scene

[00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.570]
Yeah

[00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.170]
The show and watch cost botched the investigation

[00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:20.790]
They're trying to show you a lot of stuff. There's filling coffee on one of the corpses and tripping over the body

[00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.730]
So what's wrong with that? What's the lot? What's their dead you think where there's no sense. There's no feeling

[00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:30.070]
Although that caffeine might have said in and started decomposition a little bit too soon

[00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.690]
Spilled coffee on one of the body. What do you expect from the LAPD a little like a good job?

[00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.050]
Hey, I think if they came close, I think they know that's good enough

[00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.250]
Are you if you've got the audio off for something? Why?

[00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.430]
They're watching the video. This is not an audio presentation Mr

[00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.290]
I thought maybe they would make sound effects or something

[00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.590]
Well, wait a minute

[00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.810]
That's a judge man

[00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.910]
He had the three Wendy's double cheese for lunch and he is really regretting it now

[00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:03.950]
You notice how he's like squeezed his cheeks are squeezed together real tight on a see that's bad when you're caught in fact when I

[00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:05.210]
What

[00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.110]
What are you looking at?

[00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.170]
What are you getting excited about I was coughing. Oh, I'll turn that down a minute

[00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:18.570]
When I was uh when I left WNWS and they tried to sue to keep me from going over to INZ

[00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:24.270]
I was in limbo for about two or three months this is years ago and then we had to go to court and of course my good friend judge riftkin

[00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.730]
formerly

[00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.630]
Cheryl's husband. Oh the judge the judge. He's a good friend of mine. He's a hundred eighty years old

[00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.110]
But anyway, he was the judge and we came my turn to testify on this thing

[00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:38.550]
I get up there in the course, uh, you know, you're sitting there for a long time in court and all of a sudden I had a pee

[00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.530]
I mean real

[00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.950]
Real bad how I got through that thing on the witness stand all the while I'm sitting there and well

[00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:53.170]
Did your contracts say this and did Don Corleone say that and did Dave writer or ever steal a freight train at INZ and man

[00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:59.330]
When I got through with that testimony I flew out of that courtroom down the hall and of course in these court houses trying to find a

[00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:04.330]
Turlott man is unbelievable. Oh, well, that's on the third floor take the elevator the one that stuck over here

[00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.810]
I run down the stairs and go and

[00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.410]
Tip the judge 85 bucks. He might give you a secret pass key to the judge's turlott. It was brutal

[00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.830]
So judge Edo has got some bad gas

[00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.610]
And they're watching the videotape of the crime scene trying to prove how the the

[00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.050]
Acousticution botched it all up and the LA cops are incompetent

[00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:25.750]
We don't need a trial to prove that to us. We already know that just bring out the man in this brother. They'll tell you

[00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:32.870]
Oh, and now speaking of that you notice on the Susan Smith thing where they're going with that she was molested

[00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:38.930]
She was when she was 17 years old. That's the new deal. What a concept. She was molested

[00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.350]
See, I want to say something that may be very revolutionary to you

[00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:46.670]
Okay, but the fact that somebody was molested a years ago or six months ago

[00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:53.430]
Don't kind of excuse in my mind the fact that she had enough common sense and enough wits about her to go and fall in love and get married

[00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:58.950]
And the hop in a sack a whole bunch of times and make a couple of babies and raise them until they were old enough to drown

[00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:02.770]
And then take them out in the car and the drown them. Okay, she was molested

[00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.350]
She's so misunderstood like my mother says she feels sorry for the poor little thing

[00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.970]
Here's a Tamarack hello

[00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.110]
Not gonna understand it because I feel sorry for my poor little thing hello Tamarack gone

[00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.030]
Somebody's on there

[00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.150]
Somebody's

[00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:24.170]
Kind of one of our lines I think they're gone open line and Broward 524 w. I. O. D

[00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:30.430]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello, Neil. Yeah, how's it going great? I went and visited yet the peaches the other day

[00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:34.570]
Right and got a little autographs in the thing. Yeah, and

[00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:39.450]
Went to the panthers game last night. You're sure getting around ban. Yeah, it's

[00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.050]
Yeah, it was

[00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:43.690]
depressing what the game were coming to peaches

[00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.750]
No, the game. Yeah, yeah, it was depressing

[00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.250]
It's I mean, you know, we didn't expect to be Pittsburgh in the first place

[00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.370]
But then as long as you got a tubo lead twice in the game and it looks like the Beasers playing on conscious

[00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.910]
Why not just go ahead and win the dance? I don't think they thought they were gonna win. Yeah, so did I

[00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:02.510]
But you know, but then once it got to be four four I'm thinking oh boy. This is gonna be bad, eh?

[00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:09.310]
It's gonna be a blow. Well, you know, I think the reason why nobody showed up is because I think they were given my free heat tickets

[00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.010]
Yeah, that would keep me away. Yeah, exactly

[00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.130]
I got a card for you. Okay, Greg

[00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.970]
Okay, this Greg man he has created quite a cult following and hopefully they'll

[00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.970]
encircle him and keeping the hell away from us

[00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:31.610]
We have an open line on the blue line and Broward one on the green passion line and on the purple line now the purple line should definitely be on there

[00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.610]
Sell you to one all they don't want to get on the phone because they can't hear it as well over the phone as they can't all right now

[00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.410]
Marsha Clark is saying something here

[00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:45.730]
Like tell the defense how to try their case the people are asking this court only to make sure that the jury is not misled

[00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:53.310]
So that they get the truth so that they understand what the evidence really is not spin and not just don't ask and not have truth

[00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:59.270]
He says talk about a problem with videos such as this one

[00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:06.430]
Is that no way of knowing when it was shot and the inference that the defense seeks to draw from it may be completely false

[00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:14.050]
In which case the jury begins the case with a total misconception about the conditions under which the evidence was collected

[00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.730]
And that is a very damaging thing and that's why the defense of course seeks to do it. I understand okay, but

[00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:27.350]
You're not the appropriate kill it the jury just boy. You're like talking with a little Jennifer there. I mean, what is it?

[00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:35.630]
All Jennifer said was spread them and say cheese. Yeah, got my attention. Yeah, but it did so anyway. What's Marsha just saying now

[00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.070]
potta that is again totally missed down

[00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.390]
I got an ebs going on here

[00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.050]
Well now what's okay see

[00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:50.110]
They're dropping new three weapons at home today and this guy's worried about that when we got the guy to emoji throughout

[00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:54.910]
We've been waiting for since the middle of June that's six. This is seven and a half months

[00:42:54.910 --> 00:43:00.090]
We've been waiting for this trial and you're worried about the fact that they're having like a nuclear spill a three mile island or something like that

[00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.890]
I still haven't recovered from Jennifer testing her teas out on me

[00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.710]
Spread them and say cheese rhymes with teas

[00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:10.810]
So anyway that the center one total is a hundred thousand seven eighty three

[00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.310]
Got another week to go to go up into peaches and get your best stuff

[00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:18.990]
And you can call capture glory and thanks again a time to me go for doing a far better than we deserve job

[00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.450]
This man worked his brains out on the center one project

[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:25.450]
He's a hell of a guy. He can't occasionally be a real pain in the ass because he's a perfectionist

[00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.950]
He don't understand. He's working with W. I. O. D. We're imperfections our mental name

[00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:34.210]
But anyway, thanks Tom thanks to national telecommunications who donated that tool for you to lie and they like us

[00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:35.490]
1 800 610

[00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.310]

[00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.250]

[00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.870]
It's worse than this go

[00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.650]
Worst that achy breaky fever to

[00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.970]
This is LA air mean

[00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.490]
If I gotta hear the steeper little song and I die

[00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.750]
But it's all next to me I'm in the way

[00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.650]
The slack is chill growing nothing

[00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:46.870]
This song is sure of me one I'm sure it's catchy as gotta be making money

[00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.270]
But it's

[00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:55.090]
But Chris bit of me and I wonder if I hear it every day the rest of my whole life

[00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:00.110]
When a snappy DJ and drowseth song

[00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.050]
I'm dangerous in coastal radio speaker

[00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.850]
But I turn off quick with a scowbar

[00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:11.010]
All I want to do is trash this song

[00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:19.310]
I got feeling I'm not the only one what I want to do is load my gun

[00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:27.230]
Give me that CD I put some holy one is no longer new it's overdone

[00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:35.350]
It gives me a headache and I'm not the only one all I want to do is like this too

[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:40.910]
And when this song comes on with this stereo right out of my

[00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:41.230]
Oh

[00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.810]
And if my home is one with my hair I don't think

[00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.030]
Spread them and say cheese

[00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.710]
107 at W.O.D. In case you think you're missing anything real exciting if you're in your car

[00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.670]
If you're in your office if you can't get near a TV if you're getting all bent out of shape because you're

[00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:09.930]
Part of the 99 and 9 tens of 100 percent that are absolutely obsessed with at least the opening statements and opening up the whole

[00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.650]
Cana worms then getting in there with your forking knife and eating them

[00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:18.830]
They're not doing nothing. They're like arguing now. They're debating heavily back and forth and up and down and in and out

[00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:24.350]
What can be said and what can't be said in the opening arguments instead of just starting out and saying what the opening

[00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.710]
Are while you can't say this you can't talk about Mark Furman you can't talk about that

[00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:34.150]
And then Johnny Cochran got so exasperated he blurted out. Okay. If there's anybody we got the evidence in our side

[00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.890]
If there's anybody in this courtroom believes that the juice done it raise your hand right now

[00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.630]
And O.J.'s hand pop right up in the air

[00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:47.950]
And all the five attorneys gave him a dirty look at O.J. say oh man. Well, he slipped

[00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:53.290]
Let's go to Miami Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes

[00:46:53.290 --> 00:47:02.510]
Yes, I am the Roger. See how are you? When is this Gerardo? When is Tadam days? When is Tadam? It's gonna about Gerardo. How's Gerardo doing? Everything okay? Who's Gerardo doing?

[00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.850]
I can hear you. Well, I'm in the car from Priapasta. You're what?

[00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.590]
Gerardo from Priapasta. Priapasta. What is that?

[00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:17.170]
And in the restaurant makes a little homemade pasta that I have a new pasta that I want you to try tomorrow

[00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:22.310]
And I want to send it over very healthy. What is it? It's an annuality with

[00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:29.630]
Only vegetables inside and outside fresh tomato base. It's just a little garlic. It's fantastic. Joe peshy is inside

[00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:32.530]
Because he Joe peshy made it

[00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.690]
I'll be damned. He's me. I said I hope he was careful

[00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.970]
No, where is this place?

[00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:48.470]
This place is on 414-74-3. Priapasta, he's been here before. Oh, I premium pasta. I'll find it in the memory

[00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.410]
They brought us all at seafood that time that I don't eat seafood and that because whoever got us in touch with it

[00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.270]
Who was that that got us in touch with them and screwed us all up? Yes, you don't need to

[00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.470]
Huh, you don't need seafood. You like no, I'm not a seafood man. I'm telling you it's uh, you know

[00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.990]
I see it I eat it

[00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:07.230]
First tomato base. You'll there you go sounds magnifico

[00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:13.170]
The omitted tomorrow for lunch. What time tomorrow for lunch would be better left by 11 30 11 30. I'll be there like

Nothing last time. I'm not gonna let the bridge stop me beautiful. All right

[00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.070]
Well, and I stopped it. Multiband

[00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:25.830]
I listen to how your picture right in the front of the restaurant you have to come see it probably chasing everybody out

[00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.090]
When they see that they probably all run out

[00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.710]
Yeah, we got we got right in the front of the restaurant beautiful. I'll see you tomorrow

[00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.690]
I said tomorrow. It's already now. It's already there

[00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.090]
And show

[00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.190]
Okay, we have an open line in date seven five one and one on the green line there ain't nothing going on

[00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:44.350]
If you even got this geek on CNN who's sitting in there like filling in the gap now they're going to a commercial break

[00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.330]
Does that tell you how bad it is? They're going to a commercial break

[00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:53.470]
All will I be starting the I don't want to fill the get-up set but I have a feeling that the opening arguments could be like right about

[00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.570]
205 are you positive?

[00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.730]
Here's the lady in the south Miami. Hello

[00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:09.690]
Tape at night because I'm assuming it was going to be preempted this week and am I missing anything good?

[00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.890]
And now right now it's field hagg and

[00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.510]
And if you're in the knees crowd as soon as they were again today

[00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:20.730]
The old hag and now it's a victor and yeah, nothing good. No good. Thank God. Nothing good

[00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.870]
I guess I knew it was a day week regardless

[00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:27.370]
Hey, I went to the hot game last night. It was my first one. Yeah, very exciting

[00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.250]
It was exciting. You got to say that it was very into it

[00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:34.410]
But you know we were talking about the blockbuster Disney influence on everything

[00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:40.150]
Do you know that it's on the scoreboard when you know, and they want you to clap your hands? Yeah, Mickey Mouse hands

[00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:45.950]
Oh, that's right. Isn't that Mickey Mouse hands and the bitty Davis eyes? Yeah, it's right now. Oh wait wait

[00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:52.390]
Mickey Sharon they're talking oh wait, I'm a nicking Sharon around. Well, I'm not gonna flip over to I can flip it real quick here. Wait a second

[00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.230]
Oh boy looking pretty good today guys both of them

[00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:02.850]
Right yeah, yeah got that hair straightened out Nick. That's nice. She right her fingers through it and the hair too

[00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:08.290]
If they want to go out they're gonna go out and to hell with that mat and who's gonna murder him and

[00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:14.290]
So you want my prediction? What's your prediction that he's gonna fight out about the rape and it's gonna

[00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:18.330]
But Matt's gonna get murdered and it's gonna turn out they think it's him and then they'll think it's

[00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.730]
Who else could it be but it's gonna turn out to be her mother the old lady and the wheelchair right?

[00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.330]
She's gonna roll over in the wheelchair. She's gonna roll over in a grave and she's gonna kill Matt's ass

[00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.290]
I'm telling you right now

[00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:35.830]
Somebody's gonna shoot him and first it'll be Nick. They suspect and they'll suspect Victor and they'll suspect everybody in their brother-in-law

[00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:40.690]
And of course they'll suspect Sharon, but it comes to find out in the end. I believe it's gonna be the old bag

[00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:44.510]
Wow, who's getting younger by the minute you notice? Yeah, I haven't had a site boy

[00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:49.010]
I wish we could get whatever pill she took that got her her hair went from great a dark black and

[00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:53.190]
And she go like lost he lost 20 years, but she gained 50 pounds

[00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:59.190]
So it's kind of a trade-off right you can't have everything. Oh, she's going into closet and there's the oh no, I already saw this one

[00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:04.110]
This is the one where he makes her put the code on this is the one that I taped last Thursday

[00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:09.810]
So would they are behind see because this is already Tuesday already saw this and she puts the code on that he bought her

[00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:14.050]
And she says well button it up and I want to see how it looks in there. Here you go. So I already saw it

[00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:15.890]
Ah nothing nothing to exciting

[00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:18.590]
Nothing to excited but they're gonna go out to some restaurant and then

[00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:23.870]
Nookie and Victor get all upset and Victor's gonna go out there because he's finds out where they're going and probably this is when

[00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:26.110]
Matt's gonna get he's gonna get off

[00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:34.290]
Cool be off. Yeah, I'm not into that Matt guy. Huh? I'm not into Matt. No, not at all too much makeup too much heavy pancake makeup bad attitude

[00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.910]
Yeah, kind of like Ryan is lipstick right

[00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.850]
Yeah, they find it got they find it got Nick's lipstick straight. No, yeah

[00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:42.430]
I noticed that today he looks normal

[00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:43.730]
Find today

[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:50.450]
Ryan was too pink the other day did you think yeah that wedding that never happened in the hospital?

[00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:56.310]
Yeah, you know Ryan's lipstick was way too pink. Yeah, not too many just yeah Ryan finally shaved off that smut's though

[00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.990]
He's at least moving in the right direction

[00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.550]
If he just dumps that knee and now he'll be all right

[00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.030]
Listen have a great day. Yeah, everything. You know, thanks for alerting us. All right. See you. Bye. Bye

[00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:10.410]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and one of those passion lines is open now

[00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:15.550]
If you'd like to comment on the year and summer show from Orlando or Tampa, we'd sure like to have your comment not at

[00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:20.130]
1-800-944-9463 how did she do in the book by oh she wasn't here?

[00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:25.550]
Well, how come she's got 72 phone lines now she wasn't even here. She's got 28 Orlando lines

[00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:31.310]
63 Tampa lines 175 local lines all on it now. Let me ask you a stupid question

[00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:36.230]
Do you remember back before when we first got co-hosted and going on as you went in Tampa, George?

[00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:44.650]
And we had a 800 line or a couple of 800 lines that flipped over and it could also be date or Broward lines whatever that was

[00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:53.690]
We had one 800 line, but they made the concession because we complained yeah about letting the 800 line roll over into the date and or Broward lines

[00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:56.350]
Well, why can't we do that with this line seven?

[00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:03.990]
That was a temporary measure until they could put in more 800 lines which they did and that's why we have all these lines now

[00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:11.530]
So when Aaron showed up no, no just the system and line seven used to be the Bellsoft mobility line before those douchebags took out our line because they like censorship

[00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:19.190]
But why is it that since that used to be a line that we can use meaning we all of us it is that rolls over from our regular 800 line

[00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:23.290]
It goes from 8 to 7. I understand that you're not leasing man

[00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:28.750]
What I'm saying is why can't that be both like the other lines were why can't line 8 be that

[00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:34.670]
An 800 number that also rolls over when it's not being dialed 800 to a deadline or Broward line

[00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.470]
Oh, what a concept huh there. We go starting up trouble again

[00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.270]
Okay, wait a minute put it up the second because there's a not all pot enough

[00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:49.590]
They just showed the wall in there the judge just ordered out for more cheeseburgers. Oh, you ordered out this time from jacket a body

[00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:51.650]
Okay, that should be good

[00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.750]

I'm doing Harry karaoke in my act now Harry karaoke. Yeah, well you have to assume that at some point

[00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:40.310]
Harry's gonna get sick of singing take me out to the ballgame

[00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.370]
So he'll probably bust into something by Zeppelin

[00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:48.570]

[00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.610]
Harry snapping

[00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.530]
He's snapping

[00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.170]
Well they have baseball and Florida knowledge I think yeah

[00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:27.130]
I must be fun watching 90 year old people doing the wave

[00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:32.690]
In the event of a rally oxygen master popping from the upper

[00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.330]
Opening day somebody throws out the first hip

[00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.250]
hahaha

[00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:44.710]
Lines to the restrooms would be real short though thanks to depends

[00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:50.970]
It would be like the only stadium in the country where the lights are connected to the clapper

[00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:58.450]
Somebody hits over and it looked like disco night at a strider convention

[00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:06.310]
Okay 120 at WIOD this thing in the people magazine thank god that Victor didn't bring lesan thank goodness

[00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:12.230]
Brad Pitt the sexiest man alive they do this now at least they picked a guy that if they would clean him up and to give me her cut

[00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:15.930]
He used to look pretty good back when I discovered him before they made him ugly the same with Johnny Depp

[00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:21.330]
But if he's the sexiest man alive then I think everybody's giving it up for a forum

[00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.910]
sexiest man alive my ass isn't that ridiculous

[00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:27.670]
sexiest man alive Brad Pitt

[00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:32.930]
And just at the time when they made him really grow test can he's in all those stupid movies with Tom Cruise

[00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:34.410]
What if they're doing it

[00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:40.530]
So anyway, we got some naked bitch on air is getting their body wrapped up on CNN real tight and plastic

[00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:46.730]
Which is kind of interesting, but in the meantime you notice they're doing like a long long long commercial break in anticipation

[00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.310]
Well, we better do one here too. Didn't we just do one?

[00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:55.270]
Well, we better do another one. I'm taunia. How long do you think those opening arguments are gonna go on mister?

[00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:58.010]
Forever

[00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:04.430]
Hours hours in fact, I would assume that the now who starts the prosecution starts

[00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:11.990]
So there's a last let's see it's 10 20 and more until like lunch time which they'll probably have to take a late lunch and it does gonna last all day

[00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:13.510]
Uh-oh

[00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:19.790]
Here's another promo when they ever get back with it stop with a promo stop with a spot so I can coordinate my thing here

[00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:23.190]
So we don't have to get our news department psychotic. We want to be first

[00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:26.350]
We want to be right on top of it and we want you to know that we had some crap

[00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:32.470]
I'll CNN was in commercial not this break, but the previous one we had marshal saying a few things like like that

[00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:38.250]
Which they did not have so how to lose you for us, but here's this butt plug again from CNN's puts

[00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:43.790]
The defense request got it sounds like they got his things in a vice don't it man

[00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:45.450]
Driving me nuts

[00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.910]
During Johnny Coffin's opening statement

[00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:53.870]
We heard OJ Simpson's defense attorney Gerald Juleman make the argument to the judge now

[00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:57.590]
And I see this is okay. We'll do our break because they're rehashing recap and right now

[00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:02.130]
And I'm telling you to order they're eating those E. coli burgers from jack in the box

[00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:04.250]

Don't try to fight

[00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.470]
We'll make white water

[00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.590]
Or build some ass

[00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:29.690]
We're right in hand

[00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.870]
No more status quo

[00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.930]

[01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:03.890]
Let's look for new homes

127 and WID

[01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.590]
Speaking of Brad Pitt, the sexiest man alive

[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.350]
according to the people at People magazine

[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.810]
and of course Ray Charles is the editor of that publication

[01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.470]
Aaron Somers tonight, that's going to be the poll question

[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:17.210]
P-O-L-E

[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:19.210]
on passion bombs

[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.450]
And the question is going to be quick

[01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.750]
Now we have to clean it up on the show

[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.150]
How does she use that language that we can't use during the daytime

[01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:26.230]
What?

[01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:27.750]
Because she's got a great ass

[01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.250]
No, the question is going to be for all the ladies in the audience

[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.470]
Would you bury your

[01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:33.670]
Hooter for Brad Pitt

[01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:34.870]
Well she's not going to say Hooter

[01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.810]
It rhymes with Pitt

[01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:38.790]
Here's a lady in Volca

[01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:39.630]
Hello

[01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:45.210]
Yes ma'am

[01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.770]
I don't know if everybody's watching the same game I was

[01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.530]
But I hear everybody the whole entire time

[01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:51.710]
And on your show this morning

[01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.370]
Everybody making fun of

[01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.310]
And Taren and Joe Cyrill up for it

[01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:57.090]
That's right, and deservedly so he sucks

[01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.070]
Not as bad as Keith Brown said

[01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:00.590]
Well you're right, he was pathetic too

[01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.930]
But I see Joe as a class

[01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:04.710]
He doesn't realize that he's allowed to touch the puck when he's out on the ice

[01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.170]
No he's not, it's in his contract

[01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:09.170]
I guess so, that must be what it is

[01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.350]
Right

[01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.910]
And Cyrill wasn't out there for two of those goals

[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:12.510]
Yeah

[01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.190]
But Keith Brown was out there all the time

[01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.810]
So Cyrill was stuck to join out, he was terrible

[01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.430]
He lit in both goals on the islander game on Saturday

[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:21.490]
He was out there and yesterday he couldn't be too close to the goal

[01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.550]
Because he kept falling down every time he was down the ice

[01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.250]
Every time somebody, every time

[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.250]
Yarmour Yager went flying past him

[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.470]
He just took a belly flop and was down there on his head

[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.410]
Yeah, that's yeah

[01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:35.890]
Personally I think maybe we could possibly have won that game

[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:36.270]
Yeah

[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:40.470]
If we didn't have Bob Kiddell, Skid, Keith Brown, and Van B's Brook and Goal

[01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.310]
Van B's Brook demand they would have scored 10 goals in the first two periods

[01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:46.710]
He was unconscious, he made 8 million great saves

[01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:50.010]
But it's only because he flaps his fat ass on the ground

[01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.310]
Every time he stands up to stop the puck

[01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.990]
So B'sr has a fat ass

[01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.070]
He is a large person

[01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:59.270]
He's not, have you ever seen him without all that crap on him?

[01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:01.270]
Yes I am, I've seen him live in person

[01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:03.250]
You have not, he is not a large person

[01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.930]
He's just getting his real soul vie

[01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:09.270]
And he is, if he stands is when the puck goes in the islander game

[01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:10.770]
Van B'sr is a midget

[01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.670]
Yeah, he's short but he's still got a lot of weight behind him

[01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.070]
He's got a tiny ass

[01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:17.990]
Oh, well I personally wasn't looking at it

[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:20.350]
Well I wasn't even, I was not checking out his ass

[01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:23.470]
They don't have nobody on that team when they were over here

[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:27.050]
How about Jody Hall? Now, how come Jody's got all that facial out here

[01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:28.430]
He's got hair on his post this year

[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.650]
I have no idea

[01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:33.510]
The Brad Pitt look for good ditch to hair Jody, forget it

[01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.670]
He's going for that man looking sexy as man

[01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.070]
He wants to have the great ass right

[01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:39.530]
Right

[01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:40.350]
Or just get some

[01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.930]
Right, well put the rumor going around

[01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.530]
And our section last night was that Don Shuler was coaching him last night

[01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:48.770]
It's interesting, it's funny

[01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:50.450]
The only one that picked up on it

[01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.930]
BrainStem was there and of course BrainStem

[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:57.210]
They thought he was the lucky charm because Wayne brought him in two games last year

[01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.910]
And we kicked ass in both games in one

[01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.790]
So I always think of the same thing that would happen last night too

[01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:03.090]
But it got to the third period

[01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.150]
And the BrainStem says to Wayne

[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:07.330]
He says well you know I'm such a good luck to him

[01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.390]
Why don't you let me do the coaching here in the third period

[01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.790]
I'll send all the information over there to Roger

[01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.490]
I'll decide who's going to be on a power play

[01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.230]
Who's going to be in the game

[01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:15.830]
And that's what was going on here last night

[01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:16.530]
Exactly

[01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:18.130]
Bernie had the headset on

[01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:21.670]
And Bernie was like whispering street sweet nothings in Nielsen's ear

[01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:22.250]
Exactly

[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.310]
And that's why we lost the goddamn game you're right

[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:26.370]
Yeah, that's exactly right

[01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:29.650]
You're the only person that crowd pur spacacation set up to pick up on it

[01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:30.350]
Of course

[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:30.710]
Yep

[01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:32.010]
Because we're the real fans

[01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:36.070]
And if you could have heard in the locker room after the game when Roger Nielsen said

[01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:38.250]
I'm sure I f***ing

[01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:38.650]
Oh

[01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:42.270]
Which is quite a bit of frustration coming from a sour push like him

[01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:43.190]
Exactly

[01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.890]
You bet

[01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.570]
What is the deal with everybody leaving early?

[01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:48.290]
I did

[01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:49.550]
You left early

[01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:53.070]
Which I never do but when I got to be 64 I just I threw it

[01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.090]
Yeah but there was plenty of time left

[01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.390]
I almost came back and tied it up

[01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.170]
Almost only counts in horseshoes honey

[01:03:59.170 --> 01:03:59.950]
That's true

[01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:00.190]
Right

[01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:02.290]
Okay listen have a great day see you Thursday

[01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:03.730]
Oh my god I have one more thing to say

[01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:04.230]
In closing

[01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.990]
I have one more thing to say to somebody else

[01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.730]
Somebody out there

[01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.270]
Stouled my brother's jacket last night at the game

[01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.330]
Bring it back and we're gonna send OJ after you

[01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:11.830]
Exactly

[01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:13.530]
Okay see you Thursday

[01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:13.910]
Bye

[01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.550]
So what's the deal now?

[01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.110]
Here's Judge Edo, Hero Hito

[01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:18.910]
He's right now

[01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.650]
He's right now his order for a lot

[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.350]
How often does this guy eat?

[01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.450]
Man talk about fat

[01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.330]
How could you say the beasur is fat

[01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.030]
You ever seen John van Beasbrook?

[01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.010]
He's a little twirpy guy and he wears 600 pounds of hockey equipment

[01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.330]
He looks like a lard ass

[01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:33.190]
He's a little guy

[01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:34.610]
And a great gold tender

[01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:35.830]
And we love you beasur

[01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.970]
We don't care what they say

[01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:40.430]
And don't forget by the way those hockey pads over to these pot fans sports

[01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:42.210]
Oh and you know that bread

[01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.030]
Brent

[01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.310]
Bread pit

[01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.290]
No Brent from the

[01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:48.470]
Denies pot fans now comes by last night

[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:51.110]
Gives me a song and a dance they still have only 1200 bucks

[01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:53.090]
This is the most important thing of all

[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.150]
Forget the OJ trial

[01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.430]
They still have a $1,200 bid on those hockey pads

[01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.630]
That the beasur wore last season and in the all-star game

[01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.510]
And the autographed picture that goes with it

[01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:04.230]
From the these pot fans that all the money goes to center one

[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.570]
And I says to Brent

[01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:08.330]
I says I thought they were going to announce this and the PA here

[01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:09.870]
Which all the hockey fans are there

[01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.330]
That would really goose it up a lot

[01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.370]
All the people who are into collectibles and hockey stuff

[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.890]
Well, well, any ham then you ought

[01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:17.290]
So once again

[01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:19.430]
Dean Jordan and Wayne Heisinga

[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:21.550]
And the Gatsamish Buh-ho over there

[01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.070]
Because it's an IOD thing

[01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:24.110]
No, we won't do that

[01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:26.270]
They wield out that phony silly embarrassing radio

[01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:28.450]
That QAM piece of turd for no reason

[01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.430]
They're the beginning of the game

[01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:31.250]
And had all those silly calls up there

[01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:32.670]
Oh, here they all stood up right now

[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.630]
The judge just just farted

[01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.030]
And they all stood up

[01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:36.770]
They're airing it out

[01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:38.810]
They're airing out their differences

[01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:42.910]
Now what is this?

[01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.390]
Is the jury coming in?

[01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:45.090]
They're all standing

[01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:47.170]
Yeah, they're waiting for the jury

[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:47.850]
The jury's coming in?

[01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:48.530]
Shuffle one of this

[01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.970]
OJs tried to take off

[01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.350]
Shapiro is standing on his feet

[01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:53.490]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.150]
Which Shapiro is about three feet tall also

[01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.190]
He looks like B's are junior with a bad hairdo

[01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:00.690]
Boy, that Chuck Alphairi could cheer help Bobby Shapiro

[01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.710]
Good morning, gentlemen

[01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:03.490]
Good morning, judge, here we go

[01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.950]
Have you got it on there?

[01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.890]
Hot that baby up

[01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.690]
Humans made by the lawyers in the case

[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.030]
Thank God we took that way

[01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:12.850]
Remind you from my instructions

[01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:16.410]
Who you yesterday that any statements made to you

[01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:19.250]
By the attorneys during the course of their opening statements

[01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:20.570]
Or not evidence right now

[01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.930]
You should not be considered as the

[01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:22.610]
Advocating by you

[01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:31.290]
These opening statements are normally given by the attorneys to sort of give you an overall view of the evidence that they intend to present

[01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:33.090]
To manipulate parts of the given way

[01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:36.230]
Road map, free to speak, yet to how to evaluate the evidence

[01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.630]
Yeah

[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.470]
This case, as you know, will be relatively long

[01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:46.030]
And by necessity, some of this evidence will be presented to you out of chronological or logical order

[01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:49.830]
So they'll need to explain to you the case that they intend to present

[01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:52.990]
All right, both sides prepared to go forward

[01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:54.030]
Yes, and we are

[01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:58.530]
All right, the people wish to make an opening statement

[01:06:58.530 --> 01:06:58.910]
Let's go

[01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:01.170]
All right, you make your seat

[01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:01.570]
Come on, Bobby

[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.070]
What are you old?

[01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:02.850]
Marsha Clark

[01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:05.790]
Leading the prosecution team

[01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:08.610]
Let's get with the bitch, get up out of the chair and start the line

[01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:09.830]
There she is, look at that, she just...

[01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:12.610]
However, she pans off

[01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.450]
She handles the law

[01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:16.770]
The willy-darden, one of the deputy prosecutors

[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:18.910]
That's close to me, out of the police, fully dark

[01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.530]
The Brown family, the Goldman family

[01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.050]
The Reds, Gold

[01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:23.110]
And the Simpson family

[01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:26.190]
And to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good morning

[01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:31.250]
I think it's fair to say that I have the toughest job in town today

[01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.570]
Except for the job that you have, your job may just be a little bit tougher for your job

[01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:44.170]
And like my job, both have a central focus

[01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:48.430]
A single objective, and that objective is justice obviously

[01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:51.830]
It's going to be a long trial

[01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:56.590]
And I want you to know how much we appreciate your being on the panel

[01:07:56.590 --> 01:08:00.170]
We appreciate the personal sacrifices you're making by being sequestered

[01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.190]
We understand that can be difficult

[01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:06.430]
And I'd like to thank you in advance

[01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.090]
For keeping the promises you made to us

[01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.690]
When you were selected for the jury initially

[01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:14.790]
You promised to be fair

[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.550]
You promised to be open-minded

[01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:23.310]
You promised to hear and see and carefully consider all the evidence in the case

[01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.910]
And you promised to find this case

[01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:34.010]
To come to a verdict in this case solely on the basis of the evidence and the law given to you by Judge Edo

[01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:40.470]
And you promised to do that based on the law, based on the facts and the evidence

[01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:42.210]
And nothing else

[01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.250]
You promised us that you had no hidden agenda, that you only wanted to see justice done

[01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:55.030]
And you promised us that you would do everything you could under the law to see that justice was done

[01:08:55.890 --> 01:09:00.490]
And so I thank you for that, and I thank you in advance for the verdict

[01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.990]
You will at some point render in this case

[01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:10.530]
And we're here today obviously to resolve an issue

[01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:16.890]
To settle a question, a question that has been on the minds of people throughout the country these last seven months

[01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:20.450]
It certainly has been on the mind of my people left in Richmond, California

[01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:25.510]
And friends in Fayetteville, Georgia and all across the country and everybody wants to know and everybody I know

[01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:29.250]
Often posed a question to me

[01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:33.970]
Did OJ Simpson really kill on the court?

[01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:35.830]
So Brown, Ronald Goldman

[01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:40.970]
Well finally ladies and gentlemen I am here in front of you this morning

[01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:43.350]
To answer that question

[01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:48.050]
And we'll answer that question from the witness stand

[01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:51.990]
And from the exhibits you'll see in this case and from the evidence

[01:09:51.990 --> 01:10:00.870]
And when you see the evidence and when you hear the witnesses and when you put it all together and consider the totality of circumstances in this case

[01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.430]
The answer will be clear to you as well

[01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.690]
The answer to the question is yes

[01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:11.150]
The evidence will show that the answer to the question is yes

[01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:17.110]
OJ Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman

[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:20.190]
And I'm sure you'll be wondering why

[01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:24.630]
That's a trial of receipts online and I'm sure you're wondering why right now

[01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.330]
As a judge instructed you already, opening statements are not evidence

[01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:37.650]
Opening statements are given by lawyers and in an opening statement we inform the jury of what we think the evidence will show in this case

[01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:40.530]
But we believe the evidence will show

[01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:47.270]
But we're lawyers, we're not witnesses, we're not under oath, nothing we say is evidence

[01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:54.610]
The things we say to you today are not the things that you should carry into the jury room and then to deliver evidence

[01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:07.330]
The evidence in the case, the testimony from the witness stand, the exhibits admitted at trial, the instructions given to you by the court

[01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:18.270]
And when you look at all of that, when you go back and reflect on the testimony and the exhibits and everything you heard and saw in this case, you'll know why

[01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.470]
He killed Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman

[01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:32.390]
And when I give you the answer as I have, sit her and you stop considering you think why would he do it?

[01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:39.690]
Why would he do it? Not OJ Simpson, not the OJ Simpson we think we know, not the OJ Simpson we've seen over the years

[01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:45.610]
But that raises another question and that question is do you know OJ Simpson?

[01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:54.190]
We've seen him play football for USC, we watched him press UCLA and play in the roles of OJ

[01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:56.650]
We watched him win the Highs and Trophy

[01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:02.510]
He may be the best running back in the history of the NFL

[01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:10.390]
We watched him lead turn styles and chairs and run to airplanes and the Hurts commercials

[01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:17.610]
And we watched him with a 50 inch afro and naked gun 33 and a half and we've seen him time and time again

[01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.530]
And we came to think that we know him

[01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:28.370]
But we've been seen ladies and gentlemen, it's the public face, the public persona

[01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:32.290]
The face of the athlete, the face of the actor

[01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:37.770]
It is not the actor who is on trial here today ladies and gentlemen

[01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.590]
It is not that public face

[01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:45.650]
It is his other face like many men in public, like many public men

[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:52.890]
They have a public image, a public persona, a public side, a public life

[01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:59.530]
And they also have a private side, a private life, a private face

[01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.350]
And that is the face we will expose to you in this trial

[01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:08.950]
The other side of OJ Simpson, the side you've never met before

[01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:14.190]
Who will expose in this trial and show to you in this trial that other face

[01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:19.530]
The face he wore behind the locks and the gates and the walls at Rocking Hill

[01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.250]
That other face

[01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:29.330]
The one in the cold brown encountered almost every day of her adult life

[01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:36.990]
The one she encountered during the last moments of her adult life

[01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.570]
The same face

[01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:45.610]
Ronald Goldman encountered during the last moments of his life

[01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:52.030]
When we look upon and look behind that public face

[01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.610]
The public face of the man who sits here in court today

[01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:00.970]
You will see a different face

[01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.210]
And the other side will show

[01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:05.310]
The face you will see

[01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.110]
And the man that you will see

[01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.210]
Will be the face of a batterer

[01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:13.750]
A wife-beater

[01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.170]
Are you an abuser?

[01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:19.550]
A controller?

[01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:25.530]
You see the face

[01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.130]
Of Ron

[01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:29.830]
Of Ron's and Nicole's murderer

[01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:33.830]
To understand what happened at Bundy

[01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:42.450]
We need to examine this defendance relationship with Nicole

[01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:46.730]
Because when we do

[01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:52.110]
We can discern from that we can see a motive

[01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.010]
We can see his motive for killing his ex-wife

[01:14:57.730 --> 01:15:00.810]
And I submit to you ladies and gentlemen that ask the trial for season

[01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.530]
And as you hear the evidence in this case

[01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:05.850]
That motive will become clear

[01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:12.730]
He killed Nicole for a single reason

[01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.590]
Not because he hated her

[01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:18.870]
He didn't hate Nicole

[01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:25.910]
He didn't kill her because he didn't love her anymore because in his mom

[01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.210]
What mom?

[01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.210]
He did

[01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:40.030]
He killed her for a reason all those ago is mankind itself

[01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.950]
He killed her out of jealousy

[01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:44.070]
Are you sure?

[01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:46.530]
He killed her

[01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.090]
Because he couldn't have her

[01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:54.450]
And if he couldn't have her he didn't want anybody else

[01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:59.610]
He killed her to control her

[01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.970]
Control is a continuing thing

[01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.630]
And why is a continuing thing

[01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:11.190]
The central focus of their entire relationship

[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:16.390]
By killing Nicole, this defendant assumed total control over her

[01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:20.470]
By killing her in the community ultimate act of control

[01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:24.670]
By killing her no one else could have her

[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:27.530]
No one but him

[01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.030]
And he killed Ron Goldman

[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.870]
And he killed Ron Goldman for another reason

[01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:37.690]
He killed Ron Goldman because he got in the way

[01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:42.710]
He killed Nicole because he had a problem with it

[01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:45.710]
Because men and women sometimes do have in relationships

[01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:46.730]
They have a problem

[01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:48.310]
And this defendants problem

[01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:50.910]
The man in the court for him

[01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.670]
I think he stated his problem

[01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:56.950]
He had relations with him

[01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:00.470]
And he said then

[01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.190]
And he said on other occasions

[01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.130]
And I quote

[01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:05.430]
He said

[01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:08.030]
I was standing over that cast

[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:09.410]
I was standing over the post-bottom

[01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.170]
My problem

[01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.650]
Was that I loved him too much

[01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:18.770]
But it wasn't really love ladies and gentlemen

[01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:20.370]
And this will be reflected in the evidence

[01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:23.710]
And the evidence will establish this that it wasn't really love

[01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:26.550]
What this defended hat for Nicole Brown wasn't love

[01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:27.510]
It was obsession

[01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:31.630]
He became obsessed with her

[01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:34.530]
And his obsession was so great

[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:38.730]
That he developed a need to control her

[01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.930]
And his need to control

[01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:46.470]
And his being in the possession of a discussion was so great

[01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:49.430]
That when he came to realize that he could not keep her

[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:53.870]
He killed her

[01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:57.450]
Because the letter go would mean to lose control of her

[01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:59.330]
So let her go with Ron Goldman

[01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:01.750]
Or someone else would mean to lose control

[01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:05.450]
He couldn't have her

[01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.790]
And neither could anyone else

[01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:17.250]
Now the evidence in this case will establish that the man in the courtroom

[01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:20.130]
There's defendant

[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.790]
There's an extremely controlling and possessive man

[01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:29.750]
And as I said before, control and possessiveness

[01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:34.110]
Was a single dominant theme throughout their relationship

[01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:37.390]
And he controlled her in a variety of ways

[01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:39.970]
He controlled her financially

[01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.390]
And the defendant and Nicole first met

[01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:47.690]
She was barely 18 years old, he was almost 30

[01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.390]
She shared an apartment

[01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.770]
He owned a man

[01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:57.950]
She waited tables

[01:18:58.530 --> 01:18:59.390]
At a restaurant

[01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.910]
He was a millionaire

[01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.670]
No one had ever heard of Nicole Brown

[01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:09.610]
But he was one of the most recognized men in America

[01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:14.290]
But after he met her, he slowly began to control her

[01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.910]
She shared an apartment with a friend

[01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:18.610]
He got her her own apartment

[01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:21.970]
He bought her things, he gave her things

[01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:25.950]
The time she was 19, she was driving the port, she got it for her

[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.730]
She began to gain control over her

[01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:38.130]
And throughout the year, throughout their relationship, he maintained that economic control over her

[01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:42.590]
That financial control, the evidence was shown that Nicole never really held a job

[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:45.750]
She never really worked

[01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.230]
She never really operated a business

[01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:53.250]
She never had an income really of her own

[01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:57.070]
Throughout her entire adult life, this man

[01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:58.810]
He was a defendant in the courtroom

[01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.490]
He held the first ring in her life

[01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:08.730]
Whatever money she got, whatever material possessions she got, she got from the defendant

[01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:15.750]
People can sometimes be bald

[01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:22.090]
And young people sometimes can be easily misled

[01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:27.390]
Nicole was a very young woman, if a woman at all

[01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:31.930]
When she first met this defendant, the man seated in the courtroom

[01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:37.070]
And as the years went on, and as they continue to date

[01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:40.310]
And as he gained more and more control over her

[01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:49.410]
The more control he gained, the more abusive he became

[01:20:52.190 --> 01:20:57.330]
As you listen to the evidence in this case, you're going to be hearing evidence regarding

[01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:01.070]
domestic abuse, domestic violence,

[01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.590]
talking, intimidation,

[01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:09.690]
physical abuse,

[01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:12.490]
life feeding,

[01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:15.550]
public humiliation

[01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:22.410]
As you listen to the trial, and as you hear this evidence, and see this evidence, please keep in mind

[01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:26.730]
That all of these different kinds of abuse

[01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:34.390]
Were all different methods to control her

[01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:37.850]
Let me proceed on

[01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:41.410]
The evidence was shown in his case that he abused her mentally

[01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.590]
He stripped her of a self-esteem

[01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:49.830]
This defendant dictated the way Nicole was dressed

[01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:54.930]
He dictated the way she would wear her hair

[01:21:56.930 --> 01:22:01.290]
And when he didn't like her appearance, he would criticize her, he would humiliate her

[01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.510]
And for the point that she would cry

[01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:06.230]
If he didn't like her, she would go out and boss you

[01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:07.890]
This is what I want you to wear

[01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:10.890]
Wear this, look like this

[01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.050]
She was not a Barbie doll, ladies and gentlemen

[01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:24.190]
The evidence was shown that he was so controlling that he attempted to define her right

[01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:26.990]
The attempted to define who she was

[01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:35.530]
When she was pregnant and put on weight

[01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:42.870]
The evidence was shown that this defendant was so abusive that he called her names

[01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:45.270]
He called her Pat

[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:47.650]
He called her Pig

[01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:52.070]
And he did this in the presence of her family

[01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:54.170]
And in the presence of her friends

[01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:57.870]
And he humiliated her

[01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:01.610]
That of the face would be a chance to expose and destroy

[01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:03.930]
That's the other side of his defendant

[01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:06.830]
We're going to show you and his trial

[01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:11.850]
And by doing these things and by hurling these insults

[01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:13.170]
He stripped her of his self-esteem

[01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:15.750]
And when you're controlling someone financially

[01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:17.970]
And when they have no self-esteem

[01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.050]
And when they have no identity

[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:21.590]
You have them

[01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:23.250]
You control them

[01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:30.590]
The evidence was shown that this defendant, this man in the courtroom was a very controlling and possessive man

[01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:34.230]
And that's a dominant thing throughout their relationship

[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:37.690]
With his control

[01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:40.250]
With Nicole Brown

[01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.470]
But he did more

[01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:48.530]
He did more than just demean her in the presence of others

[01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:52.890]
He attempted to isolate her

[01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.070]
Sometimes from some people

[01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.470]
From certain men came around

[01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:03.110]
He became jealous

[01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:09.250]
And he became so jealous that he got to the point that she would not

[01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.930]
A real walk to be around certain men

[01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:16.010]
And she confirmed that he might be jealous

[01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:21.090]
Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden giving the opening statement for the prosecution

[01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:23.370]
He's occasionally walking away from the podium

[01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:24.770]
In the courtroom

[01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:28.250]
And that is why he sounds very far off microphone sometimes

[01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:33.130]
He also, as you can hear, is often pumping the lectern for emphasis

[01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:37.050]
When her friends came around her girl friends came around

[01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:40.170]
And when he felt that she was spending too much time with those girlfriends

[01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.110]
He talked to the girlfriend

[01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:45.790]
He let them know he didn't like them hanging around

[01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:50.710]
He dissuaded a girlfriend from hanging around

[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:54.490]
He attempted to isolate her from other people

[01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.010]
And when you isolate someone

[01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:58.710]
And when you have economic control over someone

[01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:01.070]
And when you strip someone of their self-esteem

[01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:03.530]
And when you establish their identity

[01:25:07.050 --> 01:25:07.630]
You have

[01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:11.930]
They're yours, you can control them

[01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:18.110]
And the evidence will show in this case that this man has an extremely possessive and controlling individual

[01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:24.010]
And that he is an extremely possessive individual when he came to Nicole

[01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:29.230]
And his obsession was manifested

[01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:35.550]
By the things he did toward controlling her

[01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:38.670]
For demeaning her

[01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:40.750]
And controlling the purse frame

[01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:44.250]
And isolating her and defining who she would see and who she wouldn't see

[01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:46.810]
And who her friends would be and who they would not be

[01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:51.530]
Was an obvious defendant did to control this woman

[01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:58.070]
There are more powerful forms of control

[01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.850]
Okay, I'm at now we're going to dump off for a second

[01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:04.150]
153 Christopher Darden, who's the Deputy District Attorney

[01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:09.210]
Is doing the opening statement very poorly too I might add it's extraordinarily weak

[01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:12.090]
Anyway, well come right back to it with though because it's riveting

[01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:14.150]
153 at the WIOT

[01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.310]
155 at WIOT now will be doing the regular news at two

[01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:20.150]
Phil Henry is going to be here and then of course at 205

[01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:24.790]
That's going to be your problem is to figure out whose voice is really on the arrow

[01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:28.210]
Because I think Steve Warnell may be doing the arrest of the opening argument

[01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:30.990]
And quite frankly probably one hell of a better job than this douchebag

[01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:32.490]
Are you listening to this guy?

[01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:38.310]
Weak really all there is he's dumping on it every now and I think he's like trying to build up a little confidence

[01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:40.210]
He's trying to like wake up the jury is where he's trying to

[01:26:40.210 --> 01:26:41.430]
Okay, let's go back to it

[01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:43.910]
He headed off the ball to Chris, he's on the 325

[01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:48.650]
15, he fumbled it and OJ picked it up

[01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:51.870]
And tossed it off to the judge

[01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:53.110]
That's a difficult topic

[01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.990]
It is

[01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:59.450]
Of course the domestic violence is something that happens behind the gates in the walls

[01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:00.490]
We're pounding it man

[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:09.670]
It happens in the bedroom and inside the home and in places where the public can't see

[01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:13.090]
The domestic violence is a private affair

[01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:15.970]
Generally while it's occurring

[01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:24.470]
And so it makes it difficult for paying evidence to gain proof

[01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:32.470]
The violence occurred and it makes it difficult to obtain evidence and gain proof

[01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:35.530]
That the relationship is a violent relationship

[01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:37.250]
But we do have

[01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:40.290]
That proof

[01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.370]
We do have proof, we do have evidence

[01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:47.190]
You will hear testimony in the witness of the Mimitage

[01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:52.850]
And they will discuss the violent relationship with violent marriage

[01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:55.010]
This defendant had was Nicole Brown

[01:27:57.810 --> 01:27:59.210]
In 1985

[01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:03.450]
The police responded to

[01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:08.470]
The defendant's home was rocking him in response to a call

[01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:12.590]
And when they arrived they were met by Nicole

[01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:15.750]
She was prom

[01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:18.010]
She was upset

[01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:21.490]
Her face was puffy

[01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:28.690]
Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden, beginning the prosecution opening statement

[01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:33.070]
On this first day of opening statements in the OJ Simpson murder trial

[01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:37.630]
I'm Mark Smith, you're listening to continuing coverage of the Simpson murder trial for May-P Network News

[01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:40.950]
I was trying to leave and when I tried to leave the defendant grabbed the baseball bat

[01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:42.630]
And he took that baseball bat

[01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.610]
We're not mad and we'll show it to my car

[01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:49.930]
This is my 1980 bomb

[01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:56.710]
And as they looked around these law enforcement officers they looked to the right

[01:28:56.710 --> 01:29:01.490]
And they saw a white 450 SL Mercedes-Benz

[01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:06.850]
And the windshield was smashed out

[01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:17.610]
And just then the defendant came out of the house

[01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:23.630]
And he offered an explanation

[01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:30.290]
Well the police didn't arrest them

[01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:35.470]
They left Nicole's there, they left the defendant there

[01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:43.330]
And that isn't an act of physical violence towards Nicole

[01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:45.010]
Yes it

[01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.430]
Or is it?

[01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:49.770]
Maybe it is

[01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:51.330]
Or not

[01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:53.030]
The cold ground

[01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:57.670]
Was there the witness to that?

[01:29:58.170 --> 01:29:59.410]
This violence on her vehicle

[01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:05.090]
And if you married to someone and you love someone and you have a fight with them

[01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:09.070]
And they take a baseball bat and they do something like that to one of your prized possessions

[01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.290]
Could it be

[01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.610]
It's really the thing that they have seen in the past
