[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.440]
The stench of cow manure covers over this performance by the Dalton.

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:17.040]
In the wind, D-A-Y, as you see, hey, yes.

[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.640]
You're some of the best.

[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.120]
Oh!

[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.140]
Noob, I'm not just foul and distasteful, the Dalton's a cursing and man, it's disgraceful

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.500]
because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying,

[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.040]
Suck my t***, make my f*** a s***, God new, mother f***ers,

[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.360]
of love, they toss and the microphone, the duck button,

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.180]
just can't seem to be left alone in all of this is because they like saying,

[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.700]
Suck my t***, make my f*** a s***, God new, mother f***er.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.420]
Oh!

[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.840]
But they play for thought badly.

[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.240]
How did the patriots kick their ass?

[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.920]
Suck my f***, well, they make it to the Super Bowl.

[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840]
But with an attitude as bad as theirs,

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.840]
they're tossing our hopes down the stairs.

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.460]
Oh, man, dude, I'm not just foul and distasteful,

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.180]
the Dalton's a cursing and man, it's disgraceful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying,

[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.600]
Suck my t***, make my f*** a s***, God new,

[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.640]
Yes, they're saying, Suck my t***, make my f*** a s***,

[00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:02.220]
God new, mother f***er,

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.220]
Hey, happy Monday to you, Tau 7, at an SWLD,

[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.160]
the natives are a little bit psychotic today,

[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400]
not as psychotic as Brian Cox was yesterday,

[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.340]
but to be expected, you know what I'm saying?

[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.280]
What he said, guys, are killing me.

[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.520]
Any breath, any puff could be the last one.

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.260]
So how about those dolphins, huh?

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.320]
How about that game yesterday?

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.060]
How about that turnout we had on Saturday?

[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.940]
That was the good thing to have it over the weekend.

[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.240]
Did we have a beautiful, a lovely and attractive and large

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.520]
and well-endowed turnout there on Saturday?

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.060]
We sure did, at the fountain shops.

[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.260]
By the way, Melissa Roger, you suck old bitch.

[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.920]
Can you believe that?

[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.940]
This goes to show you that if you just finger them a little bit,

[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.740]
all of a sudden they try to hop back into line.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.560]
This is the same bitch who a few months ago,

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.400]
a couple of months ago when the CDs first became available,

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.920]
wrote that very cryptic column about the fact,

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.780]
like, well, if you're into the WYODC crap,

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.500]
they got their CDs and cassettes, of course,

[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.420]
if you're not getting enough of them,

[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.480]
but already with the shows and the tapes and the audio,

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.600]
and then of course we found out that she was a bedding down

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.700]
when they boarded off from Big 106,

[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.260]
which is why every column on radio in the Sun Central

[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.820]
was about Big 106 and about how we're this and about David Ross

[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.360]
is a great guy and never stole a freight train, etc.

[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.920]
So you can imagine my shock when I pick up the Sun Central

[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.860]
on Saturday morning, roll it out of its sleeve and the paper too.

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.400]
And look at this radio column by the same Melissa Rogeri

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.700]
that's been bedding down with a morning guy there

[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.300]
from Big 106's producer.

[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.920]
And she says, best of the erodgers,

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.840]
if you can't decide what the stuff on Wayne Cousin-Jose Christmas

[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.580]
stocking with, head to Borders Books and Music

[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.340]
and pick up either of Neil Rogers' best of CDs or cassettes.

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.360]
These song parodies are truly hilarious,

[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.480]
though a bit off color for the more stayed listed.

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.880]
And the products are worth every set of their $20 list price.

[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.780]
The money benefits the AIDS organization set of one.

[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.840]
Neil and his Mary 610WYOD men, Phil Henry and Rick and Suds

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.220]
will appear at the Fashion Mall in plantation today from noon to two.

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.880]
Well listen, so we were at the fountain shop, not the Fashion Mall,

[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.380]
and it was one to three not noon to two.

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.940]
So she made sure to screw that up there at the end.

[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.740]
God forbid that anybody extra should have shown up.

[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.860]
Well guess what? We had to stay an extra 20 minutes anyway.

[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.320]
We didn't have time for nobody extra.

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.240]
Bitch. But it's just the idea.

[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.480]
It goes to show you that if you just bring these people out of the closet

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.340]
and bring them in the sunlight and shine the a flashlight on them

[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.960]
and show that they're full of crap,

[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.280]
that they've got something that they're doing somebody else's handiwork.

[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.380]
Which is the case in most of the media that somebody is just smearing

[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.080]
some friend of theirs ass or somebody that they're bedding down

[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.460]
with or whatever the hell it is or both.

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.360]
Nice going Melissa, you stupid idiotic bitch.

[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.200]
And then here's a great column today which goes to show you that

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080]
if you're right enough of them sooner or later one is good.

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.900]
Tom Jicca, the Grinch's in WFOR cast away an anchor.

[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.440]
Antiboy Tom, it's about somebody at time.

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.220]
Somebody in this town gives credit to somebody who does a good job.

[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.340]
The lovely, the talented by close personal friend Barbara Sloan

[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.280]
who is one of the best and one of the sweetest people who's ever worked in this town.

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.960]
She gets screwed by the people they're a channel for.

[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.600]
And you know something they made the big switch.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.500]
They used to be channel six with a crappy signal.

[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.260]
And everybody said, well, their numbers are really in a crapper

[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.500]
because nobody can see them.

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.340]
And so they switched with the four and now it's WFOR.

[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.560]
They're over on a big signal and their number's still soft.

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.560]
How about that?

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.420]
And they've lost one of you or me.

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.380]
I'll tell you that I'm watching even channel seven news once in a while.

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.720]
When I'm in a really good mood or when I'm really depressed and I want a few laughs.

[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.060]
I'm even watching channel seven news.

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.500]
Or channel six or channel 10 or CNN or anything.

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.080]
Or even the CDC news on the satellite as opposed to channel FOR.

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.120]
We screw you over so we can have those great newsmen.

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.900]
There's little bimbo to bring in from Atlanta.

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.960]
Where have they come from?

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.580]
Where is she coming from?

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.480]
From Denver like I said, even worse.

[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.140]
So we got the beautiful Dave game on here covering up the screen.

[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.140]
We got Dr. Steve who can't find his way out of the brush.

[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.160]
Bush.

[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.100]
And we got the camera Marshall with those Martian lips.

[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.700]
We've got a hell of a cast of characters over there on FOR.

[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.500]
You can take your news.

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.360]
And then the last straw for me was not only they can barb is loan and screw her over.

[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.900]
But Friday night or Thursday night on your sensitive a six o'clock dinner hour newscast.

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.540]
When they show that Santa Ria guy with all the blood and the chickens and the goats.

[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.040]
And they just kept showing it over and over again.

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.360]
In addition to which they're very, very big, very, very big on that puke cam.

[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.400]
I don't see that too much on the other channels.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.860]
But channel four man.

[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.360]
If you don't puke from watching Dave game in camera Marshall, you're going to puke and Joseph Gackie.

[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.720]
How'd you like to watch Joseph Gackie in the middle of your lunch hour?

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.400]
Oh, and you know what am I going to do about this?

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.300]
I guess during the break from my media was switched that over because Rick was so entrolled with somebody bailing them out of that nine to ten hour.

[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.340]
So thanks Tom jicke for writing it like it is about the great Barbara Sloan.

[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.040]
She'll be all right.

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.560]
She'll be way to hell ahead of the game getting out of a toilet like that.

[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.320]
I'll go into that.

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.000]
Our center one total is way over 80 grand.

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.640]
I have no idea what it is because another little miss buff.

[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.220]
She hasn't shown her a lovely push in here yet this morning.

[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.760]
So we don't know what they'll we did on Saturday.

[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.420]
We don't know much of anything because it's the holidays now from now to the end of the year.

[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.000]
It's going to be a lot of parties, a lot of busts and holidays.

[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.980]
And that's why we're giving away a bunch of adult videos here this morning.

[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.600]
Because I'll tell you one thing after that thing we went through with the CDs last week.

[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.200]
I will never ever buy another show given away a bunch of stuff except today.

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.000]
I'll make an exception.

[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.520]
And I think we got some hockey tickets coming out Wednesday.

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.920]
We're coming in and Don Sherry is going to be on our Wednesday.

[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.760]
I hope.

[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.560]
And they will probably give away a bunch of hockey.

[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.840]
Well, it's the holidays isn't this the time to give away a bunch of crap to everybody?

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.280]
Isn't this the time to like open up your big push and say, hey, I love you.

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.060]
Even if I don't really.

[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.860]
Hi, this is Marie Poe which wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.060]
Okay, don't forget our Vegas trip.

[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.120]
I'll give you those numbers in a minute.

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.460]
We got to get a whole bunch of people signed up for that by the end of the month,

[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.560]
which means we got about two weeks.

[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.140]
And we're going to have 50 people signed sealed and delivered.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.400]
And by the way, speaking of that, Steve, you wonder, will be flying the plane.

[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.120]
1013 at WIOD.

[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.520]
It's another Kendall Toyota exclusive right now.

[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.340]
And probably only from next 30, 40 years.

[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.760]
Kendall Toyota will pay you at least four grand for your trade no matter what condition it is in.

[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.280]
Even if he got a toad in, Yankee didn't push it in, shove it in in the car too.

[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.380]
They'll give you at least four grand to the purchase of any brand new.

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.260]
1996 Toyota Previa van for winner Revlon Super Tacoma de Camry Ali, Camry Wagon.

[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.140]
Camry V6, Celica 200 pickup Tacoma extra cataco.

[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.260]
A T100 extra cat to come up pickup or land cruiser and stock got it.

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:06.080]
Everybody who buys a new Toyota right now, Kendall Toyota also gets at no extra charge in AT&T cellular phone.

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.780]
And maybe even gets to sit down and have a schmooze with Don Cox.

[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300]
So get your ass down there.

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:17.020]
And don't forget, as always, Kendall Toyota will beat any other price on any other Toyota from any other dealer advertised or otherwise.

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.040]
So if you want to waste money, go someplace else.

[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.000]
If you want the best deal available anywhere in the world, you head for Kendall Toyota on US1, just south of the day land.

[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.460]
This offer based on MSRP excludes your sales, corollas and pesseos and of course, not a conjunction with any other offer.

[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.420]
If you want to hear about the negative stuff, we got it done.

[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.160]
I mean, how I won't go with we want a game.

[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.020]
I want to hear nothing negative. I want to read no negative, isn't paper to morph.

[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.780]
We finally want a game.

[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.020]
This is a fine gloss.

[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.380]
A gloss one.

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.600]
So that's good for you, sir.

[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.360]
So that's good for you.

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.480]
The life is missing.

[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.660]
The nightmares of her permission.

[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.220]
I'm wearing her clothes, her self-agency clothes.

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.900]
Walking around in waves, underwear.

[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.080]
So that's what I'm doing.

[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.280]
So that's what I'm doing.

[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.320]
So that's what I'm doing.

[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.760]
I'm wearing her clothes, self-agency clothes.

[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:21.900]
Walking around in waves, underwear.

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.720]
Walking around in waves, underwear.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.460]

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.440]
10, 19, and W.I.D.

[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.860]
So here we got a manifestly irresponsible out of control asshole named Brian Cox,

[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.720]
who has the big play of the game on his shoulders.

[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.880]
This isn't an imaginary play and an imaginary tackle that he allegedly made against Atlanta

[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.960]
two weeks ago that they kept talking about all the yesterday,

[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.380]
which he did not make that play and Tim Bowen's did.

[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.800]
It's just like, I've told you this before,

[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.500]
Van Patrick, who used to do the Lions games for 100 years,

[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.760]
was such a big fan, such an ass kisser of Joe Schmidt,

[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.040]
that even when Schmidt was on a bench,

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.940]
and there'd be a big tackle in the game,

[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.740]
and Joe Schmidt makes another great tackle to say the game for the Lions.

[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.720]
And he'd be on a bench.

[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.660]
So it's another phantom tackle that Brian Cox made to Wixiel.

[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.320]
But even assuming he made that one,

[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.120]
yesterday, Thurmond Thomas ran through him,

[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.500]
over him, under him, around him, and up his ass to quote Harry Neal.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.940]
Up his ass.

[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.060]
Throughout the entire game, marched for nearly 200 yards,

[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.000]
single-handedly defeated the dolphins,

[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.860]
running over under his legs,

[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.720]
and then of course the game's saving play potentially,

[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.200]
which might have given the dolphins the bell back in a chance to tie it up or win it.

[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.980]
And here's Thurmond Thomas, and Cox's demand to make the tackle.

[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.280]
Ereas, right into his arms,

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.840]
Cax seems to have him stopped,

[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.180]
and as he opes, there he goes.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.660]
He sports out of his hands,

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.000]
dies for the extra yard and a half for two yards,

[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.120]
makes the first down.

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.560]
And now comes the emotional out-of-control offers,

[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.340]
one more time for the East Coast.

[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.800]
There we go.

[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.900]
Punching and yelling, and of course the guy down the bills.

[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.140]
He knows how to punch his buttons.

[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.920]
I mean, it's easy.

[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.700]
Is it hard to punch Brian Cox's buttons?

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.220]
It's the easiest thing going.

[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.300]
And I want you to keep in mind.

[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.140]
Here's your guy that's suing everybody in the world.

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.940]
He's suing their stadium.

[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.760]
He's suing the NFL.

[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.660]
He's suing Phil Henry.

[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.840]
He's suing the God.

[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.740]
He's suing everybody.

[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.140]
Because it's everybody else's fault

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.580]
that he looks like a fool and a jackass

[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.520]
to his kids and everybody else's kids and grown-ups

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.760]
and people that we haven't determined what origin they're out.

[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.260]
And that's the problem.

[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.920]
It's always somebody else's fault.

[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.920]
The Brian Cox looks like a raving, lunatic, and asshole.

[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.820]
And so there he is, walking, waltzing off the field.

[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.000]
This is the same tundra, or he gave him the big finger,

[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.160]
the big one finger salute.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.440]
Which at the time we all thought was amusing, right?

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.140]
That's pretty funny.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.640]
But now when you put it in context of his ongoing overall behavior,

[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.540]
you realize this is a frightening guy.

[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.640]
Frightening, pathetic.

[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.260]
Who doesn't contribute when he's really called on to make the big play

[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.620]
and spider what the media says?

[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.680]
And here's another example of why many of us have been saying all along.

[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.440]
Shula has lost control of these guys.

[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.520]
He never would have had an raving spikes on a team

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.760]
or a Brian Cox 10, 15 years ago.

[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.640]
And I don't care how well raving spikes return kickoffs yesterday.

[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.720]
There's another disgrace.

[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.380]
What hell is he doing on that team?

[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.460]
Dave Hyde, by the way, nice going again.

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.440]
Dave right on target.

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.300]
Cox is spitting image of a team in trouble.

[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.240]
Yeah, he is full of spit.

[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:24.800]
You're right, Rick.

[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.780]
He's full of spit.

[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:28.700]
Unbelievable.

[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.340]
Spitting.

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.980]
I wish you would have liked frozen right there in the middle of the frigid air

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.720]
in Buffalo and like done a back at your right in his ugly post.

[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.120]
Spitting and spitting and spitting and gesticulating and flailing

[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.540]
and carrying on like another goofball out of control.

[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.660]
So the kids really respect you, Brian.

[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.600]
It's only Phil Henry.

[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.440]
He's responsible.

[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.440]
That's why nobody respects you because anybody who would see your beautiful behavior on a field

[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.600]
and see you making those big plays, they'd have immediate respect for what a genius you are.

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.540]
Sue in the NFL because he's being discriminated against because he's black.

[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.840]
There's racism involved there.

[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.960]
Even though what would you say?

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.520]
60, 70% of the players in the NFL are black?

[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.940]
At least 60%.

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.340]
And how about those cowboys wriggling off the hood?

[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.760]
Oh my God was I praying.

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.140]
You know, it was too good to be true.

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.380]
Losing to a girls team like the Giants, the loose three and a war wise very swiss your stand around the sidelines.

[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.640]
Look how I wasn't what's going on out there.

[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.200]
I'm surprised when they got down ready to kick the field goal there at the end of the game that he didn't punt.

[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.380]
I mean, this man is an accident away to happen.

[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.700]
And Dion was 35 million dollars.

[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.720]
He's fighting the big one.

[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.580]
Got nice defensive holding penalty there in the first half.

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.420]
That's about all I remember him doing all day long.

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.660]
35 million dollar.

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.360]
Another hot dog.

[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.000]
Another asshole.

[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.660]
Okay, don't forget Karl Rocky at Regal Travel.

[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.640]
If you want to go to Vegas with a staple 18 through 21st, we're going to state the MGM talent.

[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.880]
The new MGM grand the new tower three nights, the lux rooms.

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.800]
This is Vegas at its best.

[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.020]
It's doing it up right.

[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.600]
Not some like, you know, marginal middle of the road.

[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.940]
599 bucks per person for a double, including tax baggage handling and a bunch of extras were throwing in.

[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.300]
$569 per person for a triple and 552 for a quad.

[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.600]
They need a hundred fifty dollar down payment per person by the summer 31st to balance you pay by February 1st.

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.540]
So you'll still have like two more months to pay.

[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.460]
But in the meantime, if you do want to go, I urge you.

[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.340]
I'm trying to get like a sense of urgency on this.

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.680]
They had a great response on Friday.

[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.260]
Let's keep it up this week.

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.900]
Because we want to make sure that this thing flies.

[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.160]
You can call it from Dator Broward.

[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.160]
Rocky at Regal Travel called 445 4740.

[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.700]
445 7740 from Palm Beach.

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.220]
It's 989 8888.

[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.800]
989 8888 or toll free stay wide.

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.520]
It's 1 866 866 1161 1 800 686 1161.

[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.940]
It is going to be great.

[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.960]
I'm starting to sound like Chris Collins work a little on a raspy side.

[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.600]
These cigars are killing us.

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.280]
Did you hear that show again, by the way?

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.380]
He had on Wayne.

[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:02.920]
Yes, it was.

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.140]
Wayne Fots of the Lions who wins every day like 144 to nothing or 70.

[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.760]
He had a lot of stuff like that.

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.900]
Talking about sticking a cigar up his ass.

[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.540]
It was great.

[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.540]
A lot of good comments about that show too at our appearance.

[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.620]
1024 at WIOD.

[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.620]
With Neil to Las Vegas, could be a lucrative deal for you.

[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.880]
But if you're not there, these odds will be against you.

[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.060]
Vegas in April with Neil.

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.040]
Commercial Shumbles out of Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.600]
Rooms at the MGM Grand.

[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.260]
And his transfers to Bonds.

[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.420]
And the incredible energy of Las Vegas.

[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.100]
And in April 18th through the 21st looking now.

[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:47.340]
Ripple fell 445, 7740, or 9988, 8840, running 11686, 1161.

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.840]
Neil, going to Vegas with you.

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.400]
At News, Target Entertainment Radio, 610 WIOD.

[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.720]
Wilson, in for blocking support.

[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.980]
He is Parmaly in the eye formation in the backfield.

[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.080]
White out, T-Quay.

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.220]
Lotion from Mick Duffey, the handoff of the counter.

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.680]
Most of Parmaly, he's at the three.

[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.220]
In two.

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.420]
Touchdowned off it.

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:11.980]
Okay.

[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.240]
Parmaly behind the right turn.

[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.080]
Would you believe Andrew Greenley has been the end zone?

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.120]
That is fantastic and a great drive for Miami.

[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.000]
Yes!

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.980]
Yes!

[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.800]
Yes!

[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.640]
Yes!

[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.500]
Yes!

[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]

[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:31.980]
Yes!

[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.560]
Yes!

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:33.520]

[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.140]
Yes!

[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.920]
Yes!

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.140]

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.140]

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.140]

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.140]

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.140]

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.300]
Yes!

[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:45.300]

[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.420]

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.520]
Yes!

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:46.520]

[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:46.940]

[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.640]
Yes!

[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:47.940]

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:48.900]
Yes!

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.040]

[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.000]
Yes!

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:54.760]

[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.120]
Yes!

[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:38.140]
Yes!

[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.200]

[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.200]

[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.200]

[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.200]

[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:38.680]
Yes!

[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:38.940]

[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.180]
Yes!

[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.180]
Yes!

[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:45.340]

[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:45.860]

[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:45.860]

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:46.580]
Yes!

[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.320]
Yes!

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:48.640]
Yes!

[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:50.340]
Yes!

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.440]

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.440]

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.440]

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.440]

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.440]

[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:56.780]
Yes!

[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:57.580]
Yes!

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.000]

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.000]

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.000]

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.000]

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.000]

[00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.180]

[00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.180]

[00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.320]
Yes!

[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.320]
Yes!

[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.000]

[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.340]
Yes!

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:01.960]
Yes!

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.000]

[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.220]
Yes!

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:03.500]
Yes!

[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:04.560]
Yes!

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.020]
Yes!

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:06.980]
Yes!

[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:07.960]
Yes!

[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:08.280]

[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.000]
Yes!

[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.540]
Yes!

[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.020]
Yes!

[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.080]
Yes!

[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.800]
Yes!

[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.080]
Yes!

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.080]
Yes!

[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.180]
Yes!

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.640]

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:26.740]
Yes!

[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:26.820]

[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:26.820]

[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.220]
Yes!

[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:30.620]
Yes!

[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:30.780]
Yes!

[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.020]

[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.020]

[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.020]
Yes!

[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:33.980]
Yes!

[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.920]
Yes!

[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.040]
Yes!

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.080]
Yes!

[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.040]
Yes!

[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.460]
Yes!

[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.440]
Yes!

[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.120]
Yes!

[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:42.980]
Yes!

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.740]
Yes!

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:47.580]

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:47.580]

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:47.760]
Yes!

[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.420]
Yes!

[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.220]
Let me ask you what I have to do.

[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.600]
Wait a minute.

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.500]
Why are you propped up against the wall over there with that box?

[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.700]
What which one is it?

[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.940]
Here comes lunch.

[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.520]
Yes!

[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.840]
Well, there's lunch, breakfast, and dinner.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.480]
What's wrong with that?

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.140]
More than you ever saw, sweetheart, with that Jewish judge.

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.560]
And the other one.

[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.720]
But anyway, what were you saying, Roberto?

[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:05.200]
I'm sorry.

[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.800]
How is the dress code?

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.900]
I mean, I've...

[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.160]
You know...

[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.680]
You can dress like sloppy.

[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.820]
You can defancy.

[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.020]
The sloppier, the better.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.800]
Okay.

[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.700]
There's no dress code, even in the...

[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.300]
I would say there might be maybe a couple of restaurants in Vegas,

[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.900]
where you want to wear a sport jacket, but I don't think you're going to be in there.

[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.680]
But, Jen, even in that real expensive one, what's the name of that place, George?

[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.960]
The restaurant with the lobster down there.

[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.020]
Oh, damn it.

[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.720]
With the big lobster on the sign, where we ate, you wouldn't know.

[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.100]
It's above your price range, sure.

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.200]
But even in a place like that, you don't have to go in.

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.460]
You can go in very casual.

[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.340]
Okay, that's great.

[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.100]
They just want your money.

[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.720]
Well, I want to call Rocky today now.

[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.000]
It's open until what time?

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.780]
If I get out of work, like, you know, little late.

[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.560]
Well, why can't you call her now?

[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.120]
Well, because I'm on an illegal break on the phone.

[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.120]
You're not how it is up there.

[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.220]
So you can't take like two minutes to call her during the day?

[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.200]
Yeah, I can do it.

[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.240]
I mean, it's 2.32 late.

[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.440]
No, of course not.

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.180]
Okay, well, great.

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.300]
So I'll get a picture of today.

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:58.800]
Great.

[00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.380]
Or is it him?

[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:00.820]
Yeah, her.

[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.740]
Well, you won't know the difference.

[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.780]
See you later.

[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.040]
Okay, thank you.

[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.460]
Adios.

[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.900]
We have an open line in date, 7519-463-751-WIOD.

[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.260]
Every time we have these adult videos in here,

[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.840]
which I think are relatively tame to be honest with you,

[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.320]
Cheryl comes in here and has to final love the boxes.

[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.840]
For that once, he was squeezing that box so tight

[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.920]
I thought we were going to have an accident.

[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.360]
But my favorite is that Larry King one day.

[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.360]
Larry King's throwing me so horny, that's my favorite.

[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.720]
Here's Port St. Lucie.

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.060]
Hello.

[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.680]
Ryan's a foul tempered soul fan.

[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.140]
Really hates IOD.

[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.060]
And if you'd like to taunt him,

[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.480]
he'll sue you just like Bill Hendrie.

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.400]
So good.

[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:55.660]
All of the other soul fans used to laugh and have some fun.

[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.460]
Yeah.

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.720]
They always follow Master Brian.

[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.040]
And now look where their season's gone.

[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:04.820]
Yes.

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.840]
Then one Sunday afternoon, the brain stem will come,

[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.720]
his mouth.

[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.620]
Oi!

[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.560]
He claimed Brian Cox lost his temper too fast

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.620]
because Bill Hendrie made him look like an ass.

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.320]
But the thin Wayne will bring in Jimmy

[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.960]
because he'll have been living in the past.

[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:28.620]
So good.

[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.660]
And Brian will have to cut the crap then.

[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.260]
Or Jimmy will just trade his ass.

[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.700]
We need some help.

[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.860]
Jimmy will trade his ass.

[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.720]
Rest of him too.

[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.700]
Okay.

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.280]
See that's Greg from Boyton Beach.

[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.180]
If he just calls like once every four years with something like that, we love him.

[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.440]
We have an open line.

[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.720]
Of course he said, don't be given no stuff away on the air.

[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.440]
Or else I'll call in and sing something.

[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.760]
Open line on a green line there.

[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.960]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.880]
We got these Hidalth videos here, which I'm going to milk.

[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.200]
Not that I'm buying calls, given stuff away.

[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.880]
Not after that traumatic game yesterday.

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.980]
See the audience?

[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.580]
They're back.

[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.460]
The whole town is right back on a bad wagon.

[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.040]
Let's have the Lynch mob for the brain stand.

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.800]
We need some help.

[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.260]
Exactly.

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.920]
Who the hell is this man kidding anyway?

[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:15.200]
Okay.

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.900]
Talk about life is passing him by.

[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.940]
What the hell of a one like in the last 23 years?

[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.080]
Once in a great, great while.

[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.500]
I'm a rarest of occasion.

[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.820]
They might win the division.

[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.260]
Mike.

[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.320]
Rarely.

[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.740]
But hey, when it comes down to the big games,

[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.540]
I remember that AFC championship game three years ago

[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.700]
when we had that really good season and Buffalo came in here and hope sore high.

[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.460]
And that was the year we were going to the Super Bowl.

[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.080]
And this team pulled it up like a goddamn accordion.

[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.360]
It was pathetic.

[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.120]
Talk about not even showing up.

[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.300]
Not that we want to put a lot of pressure on Don.

[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.780]
It's just time for the Don.

[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.820]
Like they said, the Don is slipping.

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.840]
With all due respect, the Don is slipping.

[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.120]
And Marv Leedy outcoaches this man game after game after game,

[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.500]
year after year, especially the more significant there is in the outcome of the game,

[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.440]
the more Marv Leedy outcoaches him.

[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.540]
And if you read Dave Hyde's column, they were astonished.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.040]
They were shocked like they ran, they ran the end-around place,

[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.060]
685 times yesterday with Steve Tasker.

[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.120]
And he would have thought that after the first 650 times,

[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.580]
they would have seen it coming.

[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.060]
No.

[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.960]
And he talks about that.

[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.300]
And here's saying that the Bill's coaching staff was just shocked.

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.660]
The entire team was shocked that they just kept running on the same place over and over again.

[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.220]
And nobody adjusted to it.

[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.240]
Even the great Jeff Cross said some of the simple lead plays to Thomas,

[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.640]
they just kept running him.

[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.140]
We just mustn't be good enough to win, says the great Jeff Cross.

[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.020]
How do you like that?

[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.380]
We just must not be good enough to win.

[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.620]
And the most amazing part of it is, first of all, Caroline,

[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.280]
you do realize the story of the century in sports,

[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.760]
they're probably going to wind up 500.

[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.960]
If they win next week, they could be the first 500 expansion team,

[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.940]
certainly in the history of the NFL.

[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.040]
It's unheard of.

[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.980]
And when you stop and think about it, that even if Miami wins next week

[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.860]
against the pathetic St. Louis Rams, which they probably will,

[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.760]
it should, it might, that they wind up 9 and 7.

[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.140]
Carolina, which is a girls team with that little punky kid that quarterback from Penn State,

[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.960]
they're going to wind up possibly 8 and 8, which is only one game off of that.

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.220]
Just stop, just stop and the, uh,

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.460]
trot, that'll run a little bit and spit it out.

[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.760]
1049 at W.I.O.D.

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.700]
Listen, Brian was just listening to what's your name, Dr. Marion.

[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.180]
Remember Dr. Marion, the Grabowski, the sex bitch from you,

[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.320]
a van years ago, when it doubts, spit it out.

[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.060]
You always said it.

[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.720]
There's a new choice, a smart choice for cellular service here in South Florida.

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.160]
And that choice is mobile one cellular network switch over to mobile one to get these three stocking

[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.500]
stuffers, a car lighter power adapter, a leather carrying case for your phone,

[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.580]
and a motor roller pager.

[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.200]
That's 150 bucks worth of free stuff when you switch over to mobile one.

[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.240]
Along with your free stocking stuffers, mobile one will give you the lowest individual rate plan anywhere in town.

[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.060]
You'll pay just 1995 per month and then it includes free airtime.

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.680]
And on the average extra airtime will cost you only 33 cents a minute.

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.160]
So car mobile one today at 1-800-Fone M1 and make the switch to mobile one cellular,

[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.540]
South Florida's new cellular choice will get three stocking stuffers worth 150 bucks.

[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.720]
And most importantly, the lowest individual rate plan available anywhere in South Florida.

Call them today, make the big switch. 1-800-Fone M1. 1-800-Fone M1, mobile one cellular.

[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.440]
Connection T required for your free motor roller pager.

[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.220]
Covering the news of South Florida on a garbage pass for some radio stations.

[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.960]
But they don't have the people we do at 610-WIOD News.

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.900]
Doesn't matter where the story is. Doesn't matter one time it happens.

[00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:02.280]
We'll be there. The best news. 24 hours a day. Every day. News, talk, and entertainment radio.

[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.540]
610-WIOD.

[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.220]
Holy cow, errands coming.

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.960]
By new you are coming, I'd a big dick ache.

[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.840]
Tonight, and a current affair.

[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.140]
Shocking videos of the Brady Bunches all night, Western oil orgies.

[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.700]
How about you, sitting here, you ready for it?

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.060]
Yeah.

[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.600]
Plus, never before seen episodes 2-Racy for network television.

[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.920]
Wow, wow, I'm coming, I'm coming.

[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.180]
Aw, congratulations, honey. Always go tell Alice the news, she's in her room.

[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.200]
That's tonight, I'm not current affair.

[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.060]
1052-WIOD that's sent away, total just keeps zooming up there. Baby, it's incredible.

[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.100]
86,739, you see when you kick these bastards in the ass a little bit.

[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.500]
Plus the fact it's like right in the middle of Hanukkah now Christmas is only like seven days away a week from today.

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.400]
We're gonna have some really great programming for you next week, aren't we? I think like dead air.

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.700]
Did we sign off overnight last night, by the way?

[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.340]
I think we were off the year last night for technical maintenance.

[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.840]
What is this, I'm seeing on Latin MTV right now.

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.000]
Man, oh man.

[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.140]
Father and son said and done.

[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.620]
Boys on, boys on what?

[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.780]
Here's the Boyton Beach. Hello.

[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.200]
Boyton Beach is gone.

[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:20.160]
All right, that's a good move. Open line on the green line. 1-800-944. Here's a mobile in Orlando. Hello.

[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.540]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.220]
Okay, sir.

[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.220]
I wanted to talk to you about another gutless wonder. Dan Reeve.

[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.000]
How does the coach of the New York Giants, a team that's going nowhere?

[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.500]
Yes.

[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.440]
That's the going nowhere.

[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.300]
Right. They've got four minutes to go in a game against the division leader.

[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.540]
And they kick a field rule.

[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.100]
And they punt.

[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.800]
They punt it with four minutes to go to give Dallas back to ball with twenty-four.

[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:51.560]
Wait a minute, where I saw the last half of that game or last three quarters of that game.

[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.280]
Where were we talking about?

[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.040]
At the very, very important.

[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.240]
Where were they? Where was the ball?

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:02.980]
It was, they had the ball somewhere between thirty and thirty-five, the wrong thirty-five yard line.

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.140]
And there was fourth and what?

[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.220]
Right, and they punted the ball.

[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.800]
But it was fourth and what? How far did they have to...

[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.080]
On the wrong thirty to thirty-five, and you want them to go for it when they got a two-point lead?

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.540]
Yes, they had a two-point lead.

[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.120]
I know, I know, but the teams go as well. They've got nothing to lose.

[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.660]
They've got nothing to lose.

[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:25.080]
I understand that, but the point is, listen, the kid for Dallas, the field rule here in a manual has made like 700 kicks in a row.

[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.100]
Right, he made one of those.

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.960]
Over that game already.

[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.360]
But the point is, so if you've given the ball on your own, if you don't make it and you've given the ball on your own thirty-five yard line,

[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.040]
That's already only a fifty-two yard field rule if they don't make anything at all.

[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.040]
You're not going to do that.

[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.960]
You're going to fail at that point.

[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.860]
Dallas had been driving the ball, but they have not got into the end zone, so.

[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.600]
So you back them up in their own territory? That's the point.

[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.000]
You back them up as far as sir, you know nothing about football. You're a bozo, you're an idiot.

[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.740]
You're a clown.

[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.360]
That's the dumb, this guy, call up Barry Switzer and get him in touch with this guy.

[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.540]
Well, yeah, that is the dumbest call.

[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.320]
I mean, I know that most of the people down here are totally unknowledgeable about any sport,

[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.560]
but that's just, that could be the dumbest call I've ever had in my life.

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.400]
From a guy that sounds like his IQ is bigger than his penis, but maybe not.

[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.240]
Well, if it's three, I mean, that's just amazing.

[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.960]
They should have gone for it on their own thirty-five yard line with four minutes left in the game and they got a two-point lead.

[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:24.220]
What is this man talking about? What kind of caca are we talking here, baby?

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.940]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.140]
Yeah, sir.

[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:29.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.540]
Did you like that call?

[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.320]
Is that an knowledgeable guy?

[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.460]
Yeah, right out there.

[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.260]
He wants to pull up Barry Switzer this guy.

[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.020]
Yeah, right.

[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.120]
But anyway.

[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.960]
Yeah, on inside NFL, HBO show.

[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.600]
Yes, Nick Bona Cone tried to hit Schula right between the eyes with a good question.

[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.040]
Yeah.

[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.920]
Oh, that's it first.

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.260]
Yeah, but Schula's dodged the hard point.

[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.540]
He'll never talk to him again.

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.240]
Are you a T of F?

[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.840]
Well, he kind of asked him to say, hey, coach, team seems to be in array.

[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.040]
This array.

[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:56.520]
Yeah.

[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.100]
They're screaming at each other.

[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.080]
They're screaming at the coaches on the sideline.

[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.120]
He says, why don't you just kick them in the ass like you used to do that?

[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:03.680]
You're ready.

[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:13.000]
And Schula came back with something like, well, you know, how is this big or bigger than you guys back in those days?

[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.060]
We need some now.

[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.440]
Yeah.

[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.260]
Now he's just a shriveled up old man.

[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.620]
Yeah.

[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.040]
He doesn't have control.

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.640]
Maybe he, they're out of control.

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.700]
The natives are running the asylum over there.

[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.820]
Yeah, you need physical intimidation to be able.

[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.900]
Maybe he's just a brain brain or spitting his face.

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.620]
I think so or worse than that.

[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.160]
Yeah, he might sit on him.

[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.300]
Yeah, he need a welder's mask.

[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.760]
He might sit on the old brains then.

[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.600]
Which of course we know that's where Brian's brains are anyway if he's got any.

[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.000]
So how did you like that performance here at the end of the game yesterday?

[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.340]
Didn't that like bring great credit to the adult organization in the city of Miami and our entire NFL?

[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.420]
For all the little kids that were watching at the 40 afternoon on Sunday?

[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.100]
Well, he doesn't want to be a role model.

[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.500]
That's why this is cool.

[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:52.900]
Right.

[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.520]
Fred the word.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.900]
Okay, thank you so much for whatever it is you were saying.

[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.600]
Thank you, Terry, for whatever this is.

[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.960]
Mounts in Buffalo, Miami, Dalton's, the linebacker, Brian Cox.

[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.840]
Now what is this from?

[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.520]
What's from the Palm Beach Post?

[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:14.820]
Spits at Buffalo fans Saturday as he's escorted the locker room after being ejected from the game for fighting late in the fourth quarter.

[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.380]
Below a Buffalo fan uses a side to send Cox a message of his own.

[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.080]
The fan is holding up a side that says Brian Cox proudly wears his IQ on his chest.

[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.940]
Brian Cox wears his IQ on his chest as in 51.

[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.760]
I think the guys give him a little bit too much credit.

[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.380]
So what is it about 48 points too much unbelievable?

[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.940]
Here's a keep us game.

[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.260]
Hello.

[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.600]
Hey, how you doing Neil?

[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:43.940]
Great.

[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.160]
Long time no talking.

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.640]
All right.

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.420]
I'm your buddy from Washington North.

[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:47.940]
Sure.

[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.680]
Well, we lost you on S.U.A.

[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.440]
So I think I had to move down here to hear you.

[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:52.840]
Good.

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:53.780]
How you doing?

[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.780]
I'm doing okay.

[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.640]
Well, happy birthday.

[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.100]
Happy birthday to you and me.

[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:58.980]
I'm sorry I couldn't get to you before.

[00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.600]
I've been working.

[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.160]
Yeah.

[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.320]
I work at the U of M.

[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.140]
You work at the U of M?

[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.720]
Yes, I do.

[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.040]
You work at the U of M?

[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.040]

[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.040]

[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:05.980]
I do.

[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.200]
You work at the U of M?

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.200]

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.080]
I run a pitch.

[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.340]
One of the capturias.

[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.600]
Oh, good.

[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.400]
I always say you put a lot of good stuff for those football players.

[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:12.960]
You're terrible.

[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.980]
Yeah, I bet you.

[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.240]
Listen about your cigars.

[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.000]
What are you smoking today?

[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.680]
I'm smoking Garcia Vega, um, Galantes.

[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:21.500]
Okay.

[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.360]
Can I pass by and drop the off one?

[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.580]
I got a nice Cuban 40.

[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.440]
I don't smoke though.

[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.500]
You can drop it off for George.

[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.340]
I won't smoke it.

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.300]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:29.700]
Oh, no.

[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.040]
Is it one of those big gut wrench?

[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.880]
No, no, no, no.

[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.360]
It's like I hit the bottom as a positive thing.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.200]
I'm smoking a small one.

[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.220]
Nice to keep Cuban.

[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.720]
Nice to keep Cuban.

[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.460]
Yeah, I'm smoking a little bit today.

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.500]
Yeah, drop by a nice to keep Cuban.

[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.980]
So about 5'8".

[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.300]
I don't want 5'8".

[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.380]
140 pounds.

[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.280]
5'6", about 150, alright?

[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.040]
No, here on the chest.

[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:50.880]
Nice black here.

[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.340]
Good heart.

[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.400]
I love the man when I got here, you check.

[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.660]
Yeah, you're out.

[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.060]
Good.

[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.420]
Hey, Anil, can I check up for one of your dates?

[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:58.940]
Sure.

[00:45:59.260 --> 00:45:59.680]
Which one?

[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:00.940]
Which one?

[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:01.460]
Which one?

[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.880]
The one you choose to send it on us.

[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.420]
Well, me so horny is right on top.

[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.120]
Give me that one.

[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:05.440]
Huh?

[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.240]
Give me that one.

[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.140]
I'll give it to you.

[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:07.640]
Oh, right.

[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.300]
In fact, if you come in, we'll swap it with a cigar.

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.300]
It's the Larry King story.

[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.340]
Me so horny.

[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:11.700]
Yep.

[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.920]
I'll do that on my way home.

[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:13.500]
Okay.

[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.440]
I'll live right down the street.

[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:14.720]
Yeah.

[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.320]
Okay, you get this.

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.700]
You'll probably do it on my way home.

[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.420]
Okay, hang on.

[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.260]
Hang on.

[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.100]
Lion 3, he's so horny, baby.

[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.080]
Okay, give this beautiful thing.

[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.340]
Look at those pictures there on the front.

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:24.880]
Look at that.

[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.920]
Oh my God.

[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.180]
She's having breakfast.

[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.180]
She's having lunch.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.020]
She's having dinner.

[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.180]
She's having desserts.

[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.740]
And this guy, I can't take away this one.

[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.180]
How come most of the guys, except for Peter North and Warner

[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.820]
to other guys, most of the guys in adult videos are also ugly.

[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:41.900]
Ugly.

[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.340]
That's in those straight videos.

[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.600]
Of course, in the Fag videos, they're not going to put up with too many ugly guys.

[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:46.980]
Okay.

[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.920]
Once in a great while, they'll put in like a token ugly guy in a Fag video,

[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.460]
just to prove that there are some ugly Fags.

[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:55.820]
Let's figure that out.

[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.520]
Look at this George Michael on Latin MTV.

[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.920]
So anyway, don't forget Vegas Trip.

[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.040]
Get on a horn with the Rocky.

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.500]
4457740.

[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.380]
And set it one.

[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.900]
We're like almost 90 grand.

[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.020]
We are almost get to feeling we might be doing it.

[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:10.560]
Almost.

[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:11.860]
Almost.

[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.660]
Not the way things ought to be.

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.780]
The way things are.

[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.840]
610 WIOD.

[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.380]
Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.780]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.080]
610 WIOD.

[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.560]
Pikes it versus Doc.

[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.120]
Mike Tyson.

[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.000]
Princess Diana.

[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.880]
Fifty rounds to decide who will wear the crown.

[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.800]
That's magic!

[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.700]
No more you hiding this.

[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.760]
I keep your weight.

[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.720]
Mike Tyson wanted a fight that would bring him the box.

[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.320]
That's right.

[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.780]
Princess Diana just wanted to beat up a man.

[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:46.740]
Any man.

[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.160]
I should come to so hard.

[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.460]
Go and leave us out, women.

[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:49.980]
Yes.

[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.000]
You can get sick.

[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.920]
John King and the Queen.

[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:53.540]
Present.

[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.440]
Tyson versus Diana.

[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.440]
Rodney and Scuster.

[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.020]
Mama, you should have pulled around with a box in his truck.

[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.320]
I don't know the crown.

[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.560]
You'll buy us a new family too.

[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.500]
I ain't no fair touchy, Mr. Marvel.

[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:06.660]
Yes.

[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.160]
Now is in the palace.

[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.540]
Tyson and Doc.

[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.440]
I'm a putter on a key in fucking hands.

[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.800]
Right, midnight on King for you.

[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.180]
OK, 1006 at WIOD.

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.740]
Happy holidays to you.

[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.400]
Happy Wednesday.

[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.940]
Happy whatever the hell you got on.

[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.440]
Happy Kwanza, etc.

[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.800]
What is that?

[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.120]
What is that Kwanza stuff, huh?

[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.120]
That's like the 26th.

[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.320]
No, I don't mean like when.

[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.740]
I mean like what is it?

[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.040]
See, I'm trying to say anything that would like evade the obvious at this point.

[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.740]
And thank God, Jeff Rumer is here.

[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.400]
When the hell would I ever think I would say that?

[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.200]
Thank God, Jeff Rumer is here on this particular day.

[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.920]
Mani Stanahalahazep.

[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.740]
Why is this day any different from any other day?

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.640]
That's because Jeff Rumer is here to save the day.

[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.160]
He might have been OK here this morning.

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:50.520]
You know what?

[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.520]
But that's another story which we'll talk about later.

[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.380]
I'm sure we will.

[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.100]
I might just have one or two comments to make.

[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.220]
But you know, not now.

[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.840]
That's not spoiler good time.

[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.020]
So anyway, Don Cherry's going to be with us on the phone in about 20 minutes.

[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.280]
Don't sit back in a chair like sit up there by that thing's a microphone.

[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.840]
I don't want you to see that.

[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.300]
I don't want to interrupt anything.

[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:08.860]
Yeah.

[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.200]
After all, this is an stimulating radio class.

[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:11.680]
We're out.

[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.860]
Oh, so you're going to start.

[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.280]
You're going to start.

[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.420]
Hey, what time is your show on?

[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.880]
I don't have one.

[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.580]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.380]
That's my point.

[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.040]
Well, I know.

[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:24.700]
OK.

[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.000]
OK, best I don't say it.

[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.540]
Let's all just do like the Henry now.

[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.400]
No comment.

[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.240]
No matter what it is, no comment.

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:30.680]
OK?

[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:31.960]
No comment.

[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.840]
Let's see if we got anybody listening this morning.

[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.160]
OK.

[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.920]
Now, how many tickets did you bring by the way?

[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.140]
No, hang out a second here.

[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.460]
Now, you're assuming something.

[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.340]
Assuming what?

[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.040]
That I'm going to get tickets away today.

[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:41.580]
Yeah.

[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.800]
That I bring a second to before.

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:43.860]
I'm assuming that.

[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.060]
I never said I was going to get tickets.

[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.900]
Because you and Jeff Moss are into this ego thing.

[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.960]
Oh, come on.

[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.160]
You leave Jeff alone.

[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.720]
See, this isn't QAM.

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.880]
We don't sit here and play these like cute little games.

[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.740]
You know, everything is like.

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.000]
I'm not playing any cute games.

[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.120]
You've been in these five arguments between Assin Awards there in the little dog or whatever

[00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.620]
the guy's name.

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.640]
We don't do that.

[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.520]
No, we don't.

[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.440]
We don't bring people on here to stick their head up.

[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.600]
We want somebody to kiss ass.

[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.420]
We got depot.

[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.580]
We don't have that.

[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.440]
You kiss an ass.

[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.200]
Well, listen, I was listening down on my way in here up the dial.

[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:12.660]
Yeah.

[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.040]
They're defending Brian Cox.

[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:14.800]
You can say.

[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.200]
I'm a coach.

[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.020]
You're defending Brian Cox.

[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.860]
They're defending Brian Cox based on.

[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.460]
You don't believe it.

[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.980]
Based on the fact one thing, he's on that radio station on Thursday nights.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.980]
Well, that don't sound like a conflict interest to me.

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.780]
Give me a break.

[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:27.180]
Yeah.

[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.460]
Anyway, it's a credible state.

[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.200]
Did you tell me they said, Joe, New and I went to Pittsburgh?

[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:32.940]
Yeah.

[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.080]
First of all, who would believe that?

[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.580]
Didn't the penguins just unload robot high and all in both Samuelsons because they couldn't

[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.720]
afford to pay well and they're still in financial problems?

[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.080]
The penguins need more scoring power like I need more hemorrhoids.

[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.140]
Well, Joe, New and I did get traded.

[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.540]
He got traded late last night after the deadline.

[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.060]
I might add, yeah, the trade wasn't made by midnight.

[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.460]
I just looked at the late edition of the USA today, which doesn't go to bed until 2 a.m.

[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.320]
And there's no deal in the newspaper, but for all hockey fans tuning in this morning,

[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.260]
doing, doing, like, went and it's just a bogus trade.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.360]
He went to Dallas for Dallas's number one pick.

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:17.360]
First name Jerome, second name Alphabet and Cory Millen, who was in the internationally

[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.320]
for most of last year.

[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.960]
Now, I know for a fact, I was there to be like, when you couldn't pronounce the names on a

[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.080]
PA that one gave you the same thing again.

[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.020]
We can't pronounce his last name, so it's Alphabet soup.

[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.740]
He's the number one pick at a Camelook British Columbia.

[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.160]
I like that.

[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.920]
That's my favorite place, Camelooks.

[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.840]
Yeah, Camelooks.

[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.020]
Next to the medicine.

[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.560]
Fruit loops.

[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.580]
But anyway, don't start underneath already, will you?

[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.620]
I'm not starting on the knees.

[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.480]
Give me a break.

[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.420]
The fact of the matter is, New and Dijk gets traded to the Dallas star signs of five million.

[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.180]
What a war on it.

[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.740]
Oh my god.

[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.400]
You can talk about a team that many other talented like, they can't score.

[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.180]
That team is so godly and boring.

[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.480]
So maybe there's some justice there.

[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.140]
Because they need a battle and New and Dijk would have been nice if the lease would have

[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.460]
got them.

[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.780]
But I mean, we realize that the Panthers got them.

[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:07.720]
But the Panthers are doing great and the big article today is how they're doing great with the low payroll.

[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:13.040]
So they're not looking like the paid anybody gigantic money with all these substories we're hearing now from Wayne.

[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.580]
So Brian Murray tried to get to New and Dijk and in fact, I know.

[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.780]
But we couldn't afford to.

[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.260]
No, it's nothing to do with money.

[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.020]
That was it for them.

[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.980]
The Panthers offered the better package of players than Dallas.

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.380]
Then what Dallas did, we get the Rangers offered better players.

[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.740]
Why did New Jersey devils?

[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.040]
Because the guy that's now running the show, Doug Reisbrogg, got fired.

[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.140]
Alcoats was afraid to pull the trigger.

[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.840]
I was talking last night to a hockey guy who told me that the general.

[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.440]
Don't say pull the trigger because there are a lot of us around here today.

[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.820]
Who are right on the.

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.020]
In fact, I walked into building this morning.

[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.160]
I have never seen it.

[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.280]
There were like 50 people.

[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:51.940]
All the people associated with the AM in this building were sitting around getting preparing to play Russian who led.

[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.000]
The only problem is the guns were all fully loaded.

[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.000]
So that should paint a verbal picture for you how things are around here.

[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.640]
But anyway, he was telling Alcoats was reluctant to make a trade.

[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:09.720]
And certainly obviously he trades him to Dallas when really there's no question that in the Eastern Conference alone with the Rangers and the Fires and the Panthers and the devils.

[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.340]
He could have made a much better deal in the first part.

[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.700]
Why would he want to trade him to somebody in his own conference anyway?

[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:14.740]
That's what they did.

[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.180]
They traded him Calgary and the Dallas stars are in the same conference.

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.580]
They played a nice game last night against the Penguins Calgary.

[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.060]
It's seven to one. They got blown out.

[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.080]
Anyway, you were asking me about tickets.

[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.560]
And why would you assume that I'm bringing tickets?

[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.500]
I already told you that because Jeff Moss said,

[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.920]
you tell me what day Rimmer is coming on and we'll have like a contest to see who's going to bring in the most tickets.

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.580]
Which to me indicates probably like two or three pair of pieces.

[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.640]
All the reason I came is I want to see what I could move off of you.

[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.020]
I mean, where's my gift for coming?

[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.080]
Yeah, we got to give.

[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.420]
We got to give.

[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.460]
We got to give Fred over here, Rimmer.

[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:49.060]
Your gift will be Don Sherry on the phone in about 10, 15 minutes.

[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:49.540]
The best.

[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.500]
The best Don Sherry.

[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.960]
And what is that got off the show?

[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.040]
I was watching KBL on Sunday night.

[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.300]
It's an old show.

[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.660]
Where he's sitting in the bar and he had, he was interviewing Ron Sherry's grapevine.

[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.440]
Yeah, what is that?

[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.500]
It was two years old.

[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.720]
Well, they're re-running the best of Don Sherry.

[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:05.960]
The best of.

[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.940]
We don't want no more like the best of this morning.

[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.360]
Right.

[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.660]
You see, there he goes again.

[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.160]
More shots.

[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.280]
See, if you want to suck your way back into this place,

[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.880]
which I know you're desperate to do, this ain't the way to do it.

[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.840]
Rimmer, I'll tell you that right now.

[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.580]
See, I'm out of rock.

[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.580]
Reavadi-

[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:18.820]
Yeah.

[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.720]
See, why don't you just for one time you say,

[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.500]
on the air what you tell me off the air,

[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.220]
that would be a first.

[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.720]
There's a first for every day like that pot fan guy.

[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.240]
But we'll get into that in a minute.

[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.020]
12.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.580]
12 minutes after your mic's off.

[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.200]
12 after 10 at WIOD.

[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.140]
Jeff Rimmer, the voice of the Florida Panthers.

[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.600]
And by the way, I should mention,

[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.800]
the first place in a conference end in the league Panthers still because,

[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.160]
thank you New Jersey, they finally scored more than two goals last night.

[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.280]
Every time it's great,

[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.620]
more than two goals, they win a game.

[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.000]
Over time, they beat the flyers.

[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.460]
All right.

[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:48.800]
And you like that.

[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.980]
So thank you so much for stilling first place in the league.

[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.340]
12 after 10 at WIOD.

[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.980]
I deal automotive and truck accessories has the biggest inventory of bedliners

[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.620]
for your truck.

[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.360]
If you're packing up, they're going to get out of town.

[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.140]
Here's the way to do it.

[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.360]
I deal price and selection on bedliners is the best in South Florida.

[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.680]
In fact, they'll beat anybody's price on bedliners.

[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.360]
I always over 2000 in stock, including new bodyguard.

[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.420]
Cargo grip surface bedliner.

[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.140]
It's gripping.

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.960]
This bedliners up to four times less likely to let cargo slip in your regular

[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.160]
smooth surface bedliner.

[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.260]
It increases the resale value of your truck.

[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.900]
And it's resistant to products like gasoline, chemicals and acid.

[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.840]
And you'll find that idea, lot of automotive and truck accessories.

[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.140]
Ideals got that big one, baby, of 30,000 square foot.

[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.720]
Sure, that is jam packed with everything you need at wholesale prices,

[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.280]
bug shields for cars and trucks, toolbox and accessories for your truck

[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.780]
like running for its visers like covers.

[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.640]
They've got it all at 7.01 Northwest, 57th place in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.020]
So as if on over there were column tool three, 1 866 to 164.

[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.140]
1 866 to 164.

[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.240]
Nobody beats their prices.

[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.900]
Nobody beats their selection.

[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.820]
Ideal automotive and truck accessories.

[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.600]
They be the best.

[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.580]
Don't tell me what's your secret this evening, my dear.

[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.920]
I get that running up one way just from the Southwest.

[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.200]
I hate this crap man, I was pissed.

[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.280]
That's a fun, 8 PM's o midnight.

[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.340]
On news, talk and entertainment radio.

[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.020]
610 WIOD.

[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:16.860]
Oh, Neil, my queen.

[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.400]
Go.

[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.180]
That damn bag, I can't stand it.

[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.800]
Okay, 1016 to WIOD.

[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.500]
So what were you just saying about the East Park Bend?

[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.560]
We got a real epidemic.

[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.040]
I want to talk to Cherry about this.

[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.100]
We have a real epidemic in hockey.

[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.420]
And I'm one of those people who's a real nut about listening and watching the hockey games

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.380]
and have great respect for great broadcasters.

[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.940]
I don't want to get into a big thing about that.

[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:42.020]
But whether you're good, bad or indifferent, the jockocracy that Howard Fussell talked about,

[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.500]
where we got these X-Jocks who think that their gods answered

[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.620]
to whatever the question is, no matter what it is, and everybody wants to hear them.

[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.060]
We don't want to hear them.

[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:55.760]
And I know being the name dropper that you are, you're always love talking about John Davidson, JD.

[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.500]
I want to salute Red Fisher, that old fart up in Montreal, ripped to the ass and hockey night and carried over the weekend.

[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.460]
I just want to be aware of that.

[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.840]
So John Davidson is a big, he's a big pile of turd.

[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.320]
Okay, and I'm going to tell you the same thing.

[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.540]
I said, see, when I come on the year, I tell the same thing that I tell you on the phone.

[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.220]
I don't waffle.

[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.020]
I don't cover my bets, okay?

[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.600]
I don't like Wimpout and Kiss-Az.

[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.900]
John Davidson never shuts up.

[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:18.580]
That's your epitome.

[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.120]
Sam Rosen ought to sue him for like, he should, he ought to sue him, he's killing this man.

[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.520]
JD is known around the National Hockey League as a premier analyst in the game.

[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.180]
He couldn't lick Harry Neal's ass.

[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.240]
Well, hey, that's your interpretation.

[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.480]
It's also objective.

[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.440]
It's also objective.

[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.440]
I think John Davidson from an information point of view is from an analytical point of view.

[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:39.780]
Absolutely.

[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.580]
I think he's terrific.

[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.720]
I think he's great.

[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.620]
Yeah, you're course you do because he's a personal friend of yours.

[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.740]
Even if he wasn't a personal friend of mine.

[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.700]
Yeah, I feel like he was good.

[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.200]
He was so in a brawl.

[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.740]
He is very strong.

[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.600]
So in other words, no way to make things.

[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:59.200]
So in other words, you like as a play by play broadcaster yourself who's always winding to me on the phone.

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.180]
A lot of people talking over you.

[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.880]
You like having the color guy, the X-Jot, talking while you're trying to describe the game.

[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.880]
Is that what you're just saying to me?

[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.900]
I think there's a time in a place for it.

[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:09.300]
Yeah.

[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.140]
I think there's a time.

[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.080]
For talking over the nurse.

[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.700]
When there's a lot of neutrals old play.

[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:12.880]
Right.

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.980]
There's nothing wrong with coming in with a comment.

[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.100]
And that's the key.

[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.820]
But when you're incessantly talking and get involved in a conversation that has nothing to do with the play,

[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:25.360]
there's a poppers stand, a fairy told me the last week you got all over me.

[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.380]
Which fairy was that?

[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:27.500]
I don't know.

[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.240]
But you know, a lot of them are like this.

[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:30.820]
That's what I hear.

[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.760]
The tooth fairy.

[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.160]
Yeah.

[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:32.640]
How's that?

[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.300]
Tell me you got all over me because we were discussing what was going on on the other side of the race.

[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.760]
That's what the Boston rules get.

[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.020]
Got a two on one break.

[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.740]
We got a great chance to put the game away.

[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.260]
There wasn't a two on one break when we started discussing it.

[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.820]
But normally you were going to get nine times out of ten.

[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.240]
You're going to be able to complete what you want to get in.

[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.060]
But there is.

[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:58.440]
There's a lot of play by play guys that don't like any any analytical commentary at all during the play by play.

[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.760]
When the whistle stops fine.

[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:00.680]
I don't mind it.

[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.040]
I don't mind it at all.

[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.120]
And John Davidson and Sam Rosen I think are terrific team.

[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.220]
I kind of like it.

[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.560]
If you like hearing guys have a conversation that has nothing to do with watching the game.

[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.620]
If you enjoy somebody making the game exciting.

[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.480]
You also understand it's a television sport.

[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:17.640]
Yeah.

[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.100]
It's not radio.

[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:19.700]
Now radio.

[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.180]
It's but don't have to play.

[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.560]
You don't have to do as much verbal.

[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.840]
I can see things.

[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.680]
You can like to do a little more diversion.

[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.900]
But nevertheless, there are people watching.

[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.060]
There are people who are veteran fans and understand everything that's going on.

[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.520]
There are people tuning in for the first time every day.

[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.140]
You're trying to make the sport exciting.

[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.580]
You don't make it exciting when you're talking about Kaka.

[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.440]
So you're saying there's an epidemic going around the national hockey league right now.

[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.140]
I'm going to say that major epidemic.

[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.680]
I told you about Saturday night.

[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.460]
I'm watching the hockey night in Canada.

[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.600]
They're the Lisa pounding the Kings by the way.

[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.260]
Lisa winning every day should mention it.

[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:54.240]
And Harry Neal who usually and I just told you I think he's the best on color.

[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.500]
He's talking over Chris Cuffford.

[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.180]
Now listen Chris Cuffford is he could have been doing that morning show here this morning.

[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:00.980]
He wouldn't know the difference.

[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.500]
Chris Cuffford is weak.

[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.440]
So it's bad enough that we get Bob Cole doing a Montreal game.

[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.840]
And we got to put up with Chris Cuffford doing a lease.

[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.720]
That's bad enough.

[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.680]
Harry Neal is talking while Leaf score a goal.

[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.720]
The man doesn't even get a chance to score the goal.

[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.720]
Later on into game in the third period.

[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.420]
At this point it's 4-3 Toronto.

[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.820]
It's only Harry Neal was the best.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.480]
He's talking while there was a goal.

[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.960]
Because he's catching the epidemic.

[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.080]
No matter how good you are, it's like Ebola.

[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.720]
No matter what a good person you are, it's in the area you catch it.

[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.000]
And then later on in the third period, it's only 4-3 Toronto.

[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]
It's a tense game.

[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:31.880]
It's a tight game.

[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.420]
The L.A. is making a bit comeback.

[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.460]
And here's Ron McClain.

[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.360]
Another great guy.

[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.640]
But he's the studio guy.

[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.320]
And the game is going on.

[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.980]
He's interviewing Rob Blake of the Kings.

[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.040]
He's injured and not playing.

[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.480]
And they're talking while the game is going on.

[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.280]
Here's Paul D. Pietro scores the fifth which turned out to be the decisive goal in the game.

[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.040]
There's no call.

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.080]
There is no call.

[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:53.780]
There's no anything.

[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.340]
And Ron McClain says, here I am talking again when Chris you should be talking.

[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.720]
And he still doesn't stop.

[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.580]
Now he still goes on and finishes the interview.

[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.480]
How can you be interviewing the guy while the game is going on?

[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:13.900]
I guess the epidemic has continued right through not only hockey, but now the NFL they have the play by play an outsourless game where they had Brad shot.

[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.780]
But this shows you me Johnson.

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.420]
This shows me that the powers that be don't think they don't understand the importance of the great play by play broadcasters who can paint the picture either on radio or television.

[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:40.460]
They don't appreciate that they think that everybody wants to hear what the jocks have to say like Paul McWire who's nothing but a big pile of crap, a big buffoon who laughs at his own material or Chris Collins worth with that gravity voice that were things that you know, maybe he's auditioning to be doing that night time sports.

[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.820]
Or they got on Eric Q.A. with that guy with the gravity voice.

[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.060]
I don't I don't get it.

[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:44.960]
I don't understand it.

[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.180]
Well, I think there's got to be a happy medium.

[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.440]
I understand what you're saying.

[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.920]
And there are a lot of hockey fans that I've talked to agree with you.

[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:57.220]
But when there is neutral zone play and there doesn't seem to be a great flurry going on, I see nothing wrong.

[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.080]
The great flurry.

[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.400]
He needs a haircut by the way they had him on last night in the Pittsburgh Calgary.

[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.020]
He's on the cover.

[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.380]
He needs a haircut.

[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.400]
Now there's a great little player that somebody should get.

[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.960]
Calgary will never let him go, but there's a great little player.

[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:08.800]
They can't.

[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.400]
And they wouldn't let New Indy go if he would have agreed to go back.

[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.600]
But they embarrassed me.

[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.800]
I understand he enjoyed hanging out with the guys at Cornell is the rumor that I get.

[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.620]
Well, he did enjoy hanging out with the guys.

[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.480]
Yeah, a little bit too much from what I'm just saying.

[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:19.700]
Wow.

[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.660]
No, that's not true.

[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:21.980]
How do you know that?

[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.380]
Well, it's just a joke, but right away you're defensive.

[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.400]
See, you're starting to start.

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.160]
And you're starting to succumb all those pressures, all those stories again.

[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.220]
So anyway, let's talk about Chris Moore for a moment when we come back.

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.840]
I'm trying to loosen you up a little bit because you're like since you're losing me up.

[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.580]
You're the guy that's all fired up today.

[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.600]
Not me. I'm fine.

[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.820]
I was looking forward to coming in.

[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.780]
I'm going to try to divert my mental process from the internal things that are

[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:46.460]
happening here.

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.220]
Don't you look white as it goes to him.

[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:48.360]

[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.980]
It's a good thing we're not on television today.

[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:50.300]
I am.

[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.340]
You're in a blue shirt and you're white in your match.

[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.720]
Don't you remember the movie of Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim?

[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.680]
I'm ready to put on that silly hat and the gown and start dancing around just to try to avoid the reality here,

[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.780]
which is a pretty ugly thing.

[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.940]
Okay, you got, we'll get Sherry on the phone.

[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.240]
And I'm going to give him really holy hell.

[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.600]
I give him the holy hell, but he's got no power anymore.

[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.720]
He just talks a good game.

[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.720]
He doesn't get anything done.

[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.340]
I've got to ask him about his tirade against the Canadians and the fans of Muckery.

[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.320]
Oh, don't worry about that about the frogs.

[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:17.720]
Yeah.

[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.880]
About Mike Keane.

[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.940]
Okay, they get rid of Mike Keane, the ex-Captain.

[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.120]
Captains are flying out there.

[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.840]
If you don't speak French up there, if there's anybody down here that thinks bilingualism works,

[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.780]
just look at that election they had up there.

[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.160]
Just look at the whole Muckery, all-credits Canadian organization.

[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.240]
They had to bring in Pierre Tuzon and all those frogs to satisfy them.

[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.780]
And anybody who dared to make a comment about it like Mike Keane was the last captain, you're out.

[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:39.200]
Okay.

[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.540]
Kirk, Moller is out.

[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.420]
Mike Keane is out.

[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.280]
You got to have a flash-pork-optin.

[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.740]
Captain's including Guy Carbonel.

[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.760]
It's a Frenchman that got traded.

[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:47.520]
It's a frog.

[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.580]
It's a frog fest is what it is.

[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.000]
Anyway, 1023 at WIOV.

[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.100]
And so what's the story on the tickets?

[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.300]
Because these people hang up.

[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.240]
They think you got free tickets for tomorrow night's game.

[01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.640]
I guess I got to make your show.

[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.240]
So I'd like to...

[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:01.880]
Oh, 10 pair.

[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.260]
Okay.

[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.980]
You can be sure that Goofall never makes that.

[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:05.520]
No chance.

[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.080]
1020's for you.

[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:07.920]
Ben Piers for tomorrow night.

[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.000]
I also want to mention...

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.920]
If you have Maus, you'd be lucky to have one pair, but that's an other story.

[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.160]
This is a feather in your cap.

[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.220]
You realize, remember when we last time we were out, we gave away the icebreaker?

[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:16.920]
Yeah.

[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.440]
Which was a six-ticket voucher.

[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:18.820]
You do.

[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.880]
And you didn't even understand what I was doing with you.

[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.360]
And the John Van Beesbrook autographed right.

[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.520]
Well, John's not very happy with you right now.

[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.520]
Because he's had to sign quite a few pucks.

[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:28.920]
Yeah.

[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.740]
They have sold a ton of them.

[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.280]
They have sold a ton of them.

[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:32.420]
They have sold a ton of them.

[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:32.520]
Great.

[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.600]
Of the icebreakers.

[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.980]
And by the way, they will stop selling them as of Christmas.

[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.940]
So still time.

[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.460]
Yeah, you still got like five days.

[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.300]
That's a great holiday.

[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.620]
One hundred gold panic, call up one eight hundred gold panc.

[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.340]
And by that icebreaker package, which we'll tell you more of it, that's like for six games.

[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.400]
And it's with the puck and all the other six tickets.

[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.480]
Not six games.

[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.960]
Are you going to start again admitting that you don't understand what it's for?

[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.400]
It's not for six games.

[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.300]
It's six tickets for one game or you can use...

[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.900]
But unless you're going by yourself, you can use it for six games.

[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960]
Or three games or three games.

[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:06.960]

[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:07.940]
It's six tickets.

[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:08.660]
Six tickets.

[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.200]
If you said six games, it can be.

[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.200]
We have a lot of animals by yourself.

[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.100]
Some people in this audience will go by themselves.

[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:14.680]
Okay.

[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.280]
Cut the crap.

[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.640]
Okay, 1024, WI of the Year.

[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.100]
We still...

[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.580]
Is this station still on the air?

[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.140]
We're not.

[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.340]
Tourists, we're not on the air.

[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.400]
So don't take it too serious.

[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.700]
If you're short on holiday cash, need to buy Christmas presents.

[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.780]
Where are you going to get the money?

[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.000]
Right here's the answer for you.

[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:29.680]
I'm glad you asked.

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.000]
Fast out of loans.

[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.240]
They're your one solution whenever you need cash fast.

[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.580]
If you've got three in clear title of your car, fast out of loans could put

[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.900]
25 hundred bucks in your pocket two day.

[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.180]
Don't be fooled by the imitators wind up paying way too much interest.

[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.000]
Fast out of loans isn't upon shop.

[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.000]
You don't pay them some gigantic balloon payment.

[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.380]
And you sure as hell don't sign over the title of your car.

[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.620]
Fast out of loans just has a lien on your title.

[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.320]
You drive the car.

[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:51.960]
You get the cash.

[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:52.820]
That's the way it works.

[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.300]
No inversing credit checks.

[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.640]
No long approval process to sit around waiting on.

[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.640]
So call now for instant approval.

[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.960]
And the cash will be in your hands within 24 hours.

[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.520]
With special holiday rates,

[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.720]
when they need the money for a month or a year for a lifetime.

[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.020]
Fast out of loans is fully licensed by the Florida Department of Finance.

[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.920]
And they participate in BBB Care.

[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.320]
That's a program administered by the Better Business Bureau of South Florida.

[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.300]
Three convenient locations.

[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.120]
Soon to be four.

[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.920]
They're in power.

[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:17.500]
They're in aid.

[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.300]
They're in Palm Beach.

[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:18.880]
Call them today.

[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.180]
Get some money in your hand.

[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.000]
1-800-910-FAST.

[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.800]
1-800-910-FAST.

[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.240]
This is Rick Riley.

[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.860]
I'm going skiing in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, February 17th through the 24th.

[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.720]
I'd love to have you come with me.

[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.100]
So let's go pick up the phone, make the call to Peter Glenn Travel,

[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.360]
and come on out to Steamboat with us.

[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.360]
Check this out.

[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:45.280]
You're going to be getting round trip air to Denver, bus transfer to Steamboat accommodations at the ranch.

[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.380]
It's an absolutely gorgeous place.

[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.980]
With an outdoor heated hot tub, pool, sauna, plus a five-day lift to get to ski steamboat,

[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.360]
champagne powder, and an on mountain barbecue, and an Astar race with 12-fees in awards.

[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.560]
All of this starting at just $999.

[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.700]
But hurry up.

[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.660]
Seats are going fast.

[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.180]
Time is running out.

[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.260]
Call Peter Glenn Travel today at 1-800-FUN-Tuesday.

[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.560]
That's 1-800-FUN-Tuesday.

[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.500]
And make sure you don't get left behind.

[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.180]
Get your reservations now.

[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.100]
Call 1-800-FUN-Tuesday.

[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.360]
That's 1-800-FUN.

[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.360]
The number two SKI.

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.540]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:23.740]

[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.360]
6-10-W-I-O-D.

[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.380]
Set your page your defibrite.

[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.200]
This is your ball and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.220]
They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.860]
Moles and hockey diving Canada on CDC

[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.660]
brought to you by Moles and exports.

[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.580]
Next says it all.

[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.920]
By Ford of Canada, where quality is job one, the day it's working.

[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.880]
By Imperial Oil and Ethel Associates, proud to be one of the leading sponsors of UConnkey in Canada.

[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.500]
And by Pepsi, gotta have it.

[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.860]
Okay, we like to balance things out a little bit.

[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.080]
We got one guy here that's a buckkisser and don't tell it like it is.

[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.080]
And we got another guy that we think we better balance it out and get grapes on here.

[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.120]
Don Sherries here who doesn't kiss butt and does tell it like it is most of the time.

[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.040]
I knew he, that's team.

[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.080]
All the Canadians down there have got kills right now.

[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.680]
I'll tell you that's one of the greatest teams of all time.

[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.680]
It really is and I can remember Bill Hewitt.

[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.040]
I want to put that bug in here again.

[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.140]
I remember him coming in here.

[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.660]
Yeah sure do, but of course you don't have men to hall of fame yet.

[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.040]
You know I give you an easy assignment.

[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.160]
Well, you know what I'm saying?

[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:45.380]
Yeah.

[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:46.780]
You not?

[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.320]
No.

[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.200]
Well, that's because you made too many enemies.

[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.020]
That's your problem.

[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.820]
Hey, grapes, get this guy off my back.

[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.660]
Get this guy off my back.

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.880]
Okay, now listen, I know.

[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.160]
No good like it is right now.

[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:57.780]
That's right.

[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.540]
Graves and I, the only two in America in North America that tell it like it is now.

[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.960]
Oh, now you're being nice to him.

[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.100]
You're stuck another one.

[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:04.140]

[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.420]
I got the poor deck on that one.

[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.820]
You're being nice to him and sucking up to him.

[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.900]
You're ready to carve him off.

[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.840]
Wait till I get cherry on here.

[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.780]
I'm gonna straighten him off.

[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.600]
Now you're saying he's the only guy that tells it like it is.

[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.820]
I'm setting this mic off, grapes.

[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:16.520]
Good, good.

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.200]
So anyway, I was just talking about his good friend JD, John Davidson.

[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.540]
He loves dropping names, you know, his good buddy JD.

[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.720]
I know that JD, you think every now and then is full of crap.

[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.520]
And of course he keeps talking through the game and poor Sam Rosen,

[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.720]
you've got to put up with that stuff.

[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.100]
And now I told him, or it's catching because Saturday night, I'm watching the Leafs game.

[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.640]
And you guys are out there with Los Angeles.

[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.100]
Perry is talking over, poor Chris Cuffrey.

[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.240]
You know, it's bad enough we got to put up with Chris Cuffbert.

[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.940]
We want Bob Cole doing the Leafs.

[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.620]
We don't want him doing no frog games.

[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.720]
We want him on the Leafs.

[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.080]
So we've got to put up with Chris Cuffbert.

[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.760]
Perry is talking over while the Leafs score the first two goals.

[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.560]
Then Ron McClain is talking to Bob, Rob Blake there when D.P.

[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.480]
Echros scores the goal.

[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:57.740]
Now what the hell is going on here?

[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.660]
Get these old jocks off the air already.

[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.760]
Doesn't matter, Nioh.

[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.240]
Doesn't matter.

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.080]
It's all the longest coaches quarter three.

[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:03.920]
That's the thing.

[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.000]
What do you want?

[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:05.500]
Are you going?

[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.180]
Hey, well, we figured we talked about the frogs today.

[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.420]
That's one of the things.

[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.000]
Coaches corner a week, not this fast shatter.

[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.300]
You know, telling Don this the other day when I called him to invite him on your show

[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:17.560]
deal.

[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.680]
The show before this last Saturdays was one of the best, one of the all-time classics.

[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.880]
And I got you a little back up for that one.

[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.560]
You better hang on to your seat tight, great.

[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.780]
The suction's starting already.

[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.160]
Wait a minute.

[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.200]
They're all put there.

[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.280]
Get some better, guys.

[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.740]
Okay, well that one was better.

[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.220]
That one was a lot better.

[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.460]
And I'll tell you what, you went after the fans in Montreal.

[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.460]
You went after Ray John Oul and you went after Mario Tromblitt.

[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.600]
But I was a little disappointed.

[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.640]
You still haven't used the word frog yet.

[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.120]
You're coming close with that frog.

[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.060]
Todd the frog, but you still aren't using the frog yet.

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.920]
Well, when I was the guy that started Pat Roy, I don't understand them.

[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.360]
I never heard of Rob Rogers.

[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.100]
I'll tell you that.

[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.400]
Rob Rogers.

[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.380]
Yeah, they're both cool.

[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.620]
I mean, this is one of the greatest stories in the last 10 years.

[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.360]
And unbelievable.

[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.160]
And when are you guys going to get out of all already?

[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.020]
When are you going to learn we got the best coach going?

[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:04.780]
Absolutely.

[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.320]
And he's going to be on the old start team.

[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.140]
And he can believe that.

[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.360]
I was there in the league seven years, never made it one.

[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.620]
And he's going to be in the first place to conference.

[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.740]
He could be in the old start.

[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.240]
That's right.

[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.900]
I wonder if you'll come up with his own video now.

[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:18.740]
Challenge you.

[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.520]
Oh, never know.

[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.380]
You've got nobody touches that one.

[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.280]
We're going over 200,000 this year.

[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.000]
Unbelievable.

[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.220]
Rockham Sockham Seven.

[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:25.560]
Yeah.

[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.880]
You haven't sent Neil and I our copies yet.

[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.320]
Hey.

[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.840]
You haven't sent Neil and I our copies.

[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.580]
Can you do Neil?

[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.320]
I'll get you one.

[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.160]
It's just, it's just so busy up here that you know how that is.

[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.480]
But Scott Melody, 36 points.

[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:43.500]
You guys know that Jody Hall plus 17 leads to league in shooting for study?

[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.160]
There you go.

[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.200]
Jody Hall is good.

[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.380]
I've been saying that all along.

[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.320]
These guys don't know what it's all about.

[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.720]
I'll tell you, you guys carry guys through the end of that.

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:52.940]
Yeah.

[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.940]
You guys ought to get a little bit more on us Panthers on it.

[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:56.680]
Hockey night in Canada.

[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.440]
Teach some of those guys up there a little bit.

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.000]
What about a great hockey team's all about.

[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.000]
And the fact that you don't have to pay guys millions of dollars to play well either.

[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.020]
A grapes.

[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.340]
You know, this guy's being so nice to you today.

[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:10.040]
Now one thing you know about me when I tell you something honor off the air.

[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:10.920]
It's going to be the same.

[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.080]
Oh my God.

[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:13.560]
Oh my God.

[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:13.940]
Oh my God.

[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:14.900]
Hang on.

[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.380]
Last week he's saying to me, river.

[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.660]
He was just a little.

[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.300]
So I'm going to let me finish here.

[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.040]
Let me finish here.

[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:22.040]

[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.440]
Oh my God.

[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:24.780]

[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.260]
Hang on a second.

[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:27.920]
Hang on.

[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:28.360]
Yeah.

[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.400]
Let me just, I'm going to dig a whole living.

[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:30.860]
You'll be.

[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.600]
Listen to this one here.

[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.320]
He says, wait till we get grapes on because now I think clip.

[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.100]
Letters listening too much to grapes.

[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.640]
We've got bar right now.

[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.400]
So many of you.

[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.860]
And Tommy and and dummy and all these other guys before my mess of scored to two goals in that one game.

[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.240]
I'll see.

[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.400]
The other guy like from the mental and how about the Paul D Pietro.

[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.260]
Hey, that's that's a great.

[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.120]
That's a great story.

[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.500]
D Pietro comes back from like oblivion and scores right off the bat and the kids doing good.

[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.760]
But anyhow, let's get back to you guys.

[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.860]
No, let's talk about the leads for just a second.

[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:03.540]
You know, you look.

[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.820]
We'll get back to them.

[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.000]
We'll get back to them in a minute.

[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.020]
But how about giving our leads a little bit of credit.

[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.500]
There's seven games over 500.

[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.940]
They don't have that great of a personnel.

[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.840]
But Pat's got them playing pretty good.

[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.560]
Well, there's a lot that long.

[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.540]
It's a lot that day.

[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.440]
And it's rolling.

[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.100]
I don't understand why somebody doesn't watch the guy.

[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.360]
He's better than he's damn good.

[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:22.600]

[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.440]
Back up goal tender and he gets in every third game.

[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.780]
I don't understand why somebody doesn't make a thing.

[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.860]
Your broons could use it.

[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.980]
Yeah, the broons could use it.

[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.920]
That's from why they they might as well just have an empty net to broons.

[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:33.960]
They got no goal tender.

[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.760]
I felt sorry for Blaine Locker.

[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:35.860]
Yeah.

[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.220]
And he exploded after the game.

[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.280]
That didn't treat breakfast almost once again.

[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.100]
You know, he's second year in the league.

[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.380]
You don't start giving Boston reporters.

[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.000]
Actually, they'll remember and they'll get them there.

[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.380]
That was after the Florida game.

[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:48.680]
Yeah.

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.600]
And he said we came back almost got even in that game.

[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.300]
He's also the same goalie that told Don or Jerry Chievers last year, grapes.

[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.380]
After he was struggling for a while.

[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.680]
Chievers, the Hall of Famer, your former goalie.

[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.560]
Chievers went to help the kid out and said,

[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.780]
hey, listen, the game's changed.

[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:04.440]
Thanks.

[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.700]
I know you're Hall of Famer, but no thanks.

[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.800]
That's exactly what he told them.

[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.300]
That's what he told them last year.

[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.760]
He said, you don't have to help me.

[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.680]
I know how long you to play for you.

[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.180]
I can't imagine back to what Chievers thought of that day.

[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.820]
So he was pretty pissed off.

[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.000]
Well, I would imagine.

[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.360]
I never heard that would be for it.

[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.980]
Well, hey, you hear a lot of things.

[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.520]
So let's get back to this frog fest up there, Montreal.

[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.880]
You know, we all watched with just amazed and shocked

[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.440]
that they had the dead election up there in Quebec.

[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.840]
The crap that went on there.

[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.540]
And now you see the same thing, a microcosm of it on a Canadians

[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:40.580]
where unless you know, my king comes out, the captain of the team

[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.000]
and he made one little comment about people that speak French

[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.620]
and about if you don't do this and all of a sudden his ass is gone.

[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.200]
And it's true.

[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.760]
They got to have Turgent and all those frogs up there.

[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.600]
And it's a sad thing that they got to build a hockey franchise

[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.160]
based on something ethnic instead of talent.

[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.780]
Well, absolutely right.

[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.020]
And what about the guy in Denver?

[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.400]
He said that he actually said this in the hockey do's

[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.160]
that if he has choice between an English guy and a French guy

[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.660]
he choose the French guy for an Asian one.

[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.700]
They got a Turgio here in the French.

[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.700]
They can't speak English.

[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.580]
Figure that one out with him.

[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.220]
What do they do all around it?

[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.960]
They think they're still in Quebec, is that it?

[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:17.520]
That's it.

[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.660]
And you know, it's totally, you know,

[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.660]
it's a lot of only what's the absolute guy for.

[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.420]
He's the guy that stood up in the dress room and said,

[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.380]
look, okay, that's right there.

[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.200]
Let's start up and let's start playing hockey.

[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.280]
And he's the leader on this club that unfortunately

[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.560]
his first name's got Pierre, so he was on the Catholic.

[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.880]
Here you're absolutely right.

[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.780]
Nobody says that up here any there.

[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:40.860]
Absolutely, Craig.

[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.540]
Believe it or not, we've got three French guys in this saga.

[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.900]
We've got French guys all over the place.

[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.280]
40, 40, West Madden.

[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.320]
More than in boxing with a three French guys in this saga.

[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:52.860]
It's unbelievable.

[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.360]
First, the news, the two parties that we got run it up here

[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.020]
both spoke their names are drawn.

[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.000]
So figure it out.

[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.400]
And by the way, speaking of Pat Royce,

[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.680]
since the Avalanche got him, which I predict to this,

[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.860]
because I think he's watched up.

[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.340]
They're not winning the games anymore.

[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:09.440]
Well, through the muscle, that's all you need.

[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.480]
You got to roll it along.

[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:13.300]
You could do the same thing at four to throw like something

[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.380]
that's straight, screwed under something like that.

[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.000]
Throw that little, can't be enough.

[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]
They're not going to trade, screwed.

[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:18.940]
Oh, I know they're not.

[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:19.640]
I just said that.

[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.040]
Like, I care to your guy.

[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.760]
And if they get something like that,

[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.460]
it's really chemistry off and you're done.

[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.240]
Speaking of trades, how about this new and dyke deal?

[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:32.440]
You can't tell me sitting here that there are a number of teams

[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.020]
including the Leaves, Neil Rogers Maple Leaves,

[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.120]
and the Florida Panthers, and the Devils,

[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.240]
and the Rangers that couldn't have come up with a better deal

[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.000]
than what Dallas has done in getting Joe Newandie.

[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.320]
Well, I'd say a new guy can throw those guys at center.

[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.140]
He can turn the whole franchise around.

[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.560]
But what happens in the Calgary that's fitting there,

[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.700]
they've got to make the playoffs, the crowds are there.

[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.720]
Nobody's coming up with a better deal.

[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.760]
I mean, when you've got a gun to your head like that,

[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.820]
the same thing is Hilberry in New York Islanders.

[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.000]
He's got a gun to his head, and they're like,

[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.920]
they're like, the GMs, they just sit in the waist

[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.980]
until your week to fall, so I guess they better get something

[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.680]
for him before the deadline.

[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.560]
Well, they made the trade last night.

[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.460]
I don't know if you heard it,

[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.640]
but they picked up a kid from Cam Loops.

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.560]
He was a number one pick out of Dallas last year.

[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.600]
Obviously a future.

[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.960]
He's not going to help them make the playoffs.

[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.080]
And Cory Millen, who Dallas could even bring up from the miners

[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.880]
until the last week or two.

[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.500]
I mean, that trade, it sticks.

[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.760]
The guy that's the 50, you know, that's the...

[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.860]
And you've got to do something.

[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.400]
It's the old deal that says,

[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.360]
it's better to have somebody there than nobody there.

[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.040]
And if they don't get going soon,

[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.920]
they won't make the playoffs, and you know and hockey.

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.480]
If you don't make the playoffs, you're in deep, deep, deep,

[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.420]
deep trouble financially.

[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.660]
Well, Alcoats, I think, sealed his own fate as the future general

[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.100]
manager in Calgary without great.

[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.220]
They're not going to make the playoffs.

[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:55.860]
They're going nowhere.

[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.580]
That game they played against, Pittsburgh last night,

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.600]
they might as well as stayed home.

[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.480]
They didn't even show up.

[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.140]
Pretty rough.

[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.980]
You know, when you have guys like that,

[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.180]
and you just, if they just lost too many guys,

[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.900]
they did not want to let auto goal.

[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.920]
If we let all of the kiddos goal,

[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.520]
you can see they were going down the pipe,

[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.340]
and if you started that stuff, burn and go,

[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.900]
you didn't want to pay the big money,

[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.700]
and then when you don't want to pay the big money,

[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.520]
it's a force anymore.

[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.820]
You're going to end up fine.

[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.640]
Then I tell you they're playing no defense.

[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.580]
It's Trevor Kiddles,

[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.200]
that he looked like he was in a game playing a game by himself,

[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.580]
man. It was an ugly thing to watch,

[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.100]
especially when you're playing those penguins.

[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.900]
Well, nobody's going to,

[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.680]
no, no, no, no.

[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.180]
If they're in the mood to play,

[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.680]
and they want to play,

[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.200]
and Barats and Reggaert start coming through,

[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280]
they're going to be in the finals,

[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.260]
but sometimes they just go up,

[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.700]
they're not ready to play, but boy,

[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.060]
can they put on a clinic if they want to go?

[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:44.480]
You bet.

[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.620]
Okay, hang on a second grapes.

[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.500]
We've been doing a little break.

[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.340]
We'll come right back down.

[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.460]
Chiris here in the Jeff Rimmers here to hold his hand.

[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.040]
It's 21 till 11 at WIOD.

[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.360]
You're going to love it now more than ever.

[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.080]
It's the new pump.

[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.340]
It'll park racing for the thrill of excitement of life,

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.540]
harness racing, action and nightly full-car ride,

[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.080]
cymo casting from your favorite tracks.

[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.120]
Come visit pump,

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.160]
but it'll park racing now.

[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.920]
WACB Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,

[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.280]
like tonight with first post-time 730.

[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.140]
This Friday night's co-features will be the Philly and Mirro open pace

[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.500]
and the open trot for a full night's worth of valuable entertainment.

[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.220]
Start off at the top of the park.

[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.540]
Restaurant gets yourself a great meal.

[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.620]
Enjoy beautiful panoramic view of the skyline

[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.980]
and plunge your brains out.

[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.020]
Come check out South Food's nighttime hotspot for food.

[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.840]
For fun, excitement, take I-95 or the turnpike

[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.300]
to the Atlantic Boulevard exit that's out to Power Line Road.

[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.360]
For good times, good food and great racing.

[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.760]
It's the new pump and opark racing.

[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.420]
And the best news is, Jackie Lee won't be there.

[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.680]
We're going to be spending the weekend express by the host guests

[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.460]
for collars on WIOD.

[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.180]

This is Mike Probe.

[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.700]
Seen your writer with the hockey news.

[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.300]
They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.640]
Get the panoramic out of the play again.

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.380]
Run it in the bus, he's gone!

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.480]
Okay, so we got a little bill, you would on there

[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.000]
to try to put the implant to see to get his mind again

[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.920]
and get him in the hall of fame and quit postponing the inevitable, you know?

[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.760]
Well, I do the best they can.

[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.940]
I'm not too popular with the hall of fame as remember knows,

[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.000]
but I'll do my best.

[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.240]
If I put the word in, for me won't make it secure.

[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.620]
Yeah, it sounds like you got Neil Rogers syndrome.

[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.040]
Yeah.

[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:21.820]
What the hell?

[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:21.980]
What the hell?

[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.440]
Rimmer said to me, you know, every time you're out with Cheri

[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.660]
and never play one of my calls in one of those great calls

[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.180]
of Panthers, Corolli's, schools,

[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.240]
here we go.

[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.760]
I'll call playing a Jeff Rimmer call of one of those great goals.

[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.440]
I said, today's the day I'm going to do it.

[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.740]
So, Cheri can hear some of your great words.

[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:40.500]
Those great design for the final goal in the speech of the media

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.360]
and towards the night to hand them a call to sign.

[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.360]
And to the bunch of branches now,

[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.800]
back to Dan from the New York round the neck.

[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.340]
The youth turns around and suits them.

[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.500]
They're still going to say something.

[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.020]
There will be a lot of back one more time.

[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.700]
The view again and still goes to branches.

[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.400]
Relief to you.

[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.500]
No, the young one.

[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.080]
He wants it.

[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.080]
He's got a team here, six.

[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:00.700]
Ten.

[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.700]
Hello, the cultural young boss.

[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:04.440]
Liger at the least,

[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.040]
a lot of like a fan cigar.

[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.620]
You'll leave the auger like that one on one.

[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.140]
You'll burn you in that a Thai hockey game.

[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.160]
You're very young.

[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.640]
He's starting to sun more like Mike Lang all the time.

[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.020]
And he grapes.

[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.720]
Uh, like, you know, I, I, when I hear stuff like that,

[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.540]
you know, I want to absolutely weak, you know what I mean?

[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.760]
I, I, I hear this guy, he doesn't make it that you will.

[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.360]
It's tough like that.

[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.320]
Where did go, great?

[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.820]
I love you, great.

[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.500]
I knew this was set up ahead of time.

[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.520]
It wasn't set up.

[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.600]
How much was the check for?

[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.020]
How much did he send you to say this?

[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.820]
Ah, I can't say.

[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.220]
Look, hockey, I know all the stuff that's coming in,

[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.380]
we're standing on our heads.

[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.960]
And we're pretty soon, we're going to be in Austin's balls like,

[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:44.640]
boom.

[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.140]
We're going to have little midgets running around.

[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:48.920]
That's Chris Moore.

[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.140]
That's Chris Moore does that.

[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.020]
Alright, Chris Moore does that.

[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.600]
I know, I know.

[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.420]
He already says that.

[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:53.880]
Alright.

[01:21:54.540 --> 01:22:00.340]
I just, you know, take fall has been the same since those 1800s.

[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.100]
We make ball road changes.

[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.520]
We have guys coming in.

[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.180]
How about this one, Rimmer?

[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.800]
Feel the holes of the hole.

[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.540]
I like the one, yes, flutter will move.

[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.620]
Does that mean sideways?

[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.040]
Keep the puck in, I guess.

[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.440]
Reverse pull.

[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.660]
I mean, that seems to be turning from back.

[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.320]
How about this one?

[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.460]
The harder round.

[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:20.920]
Oh, the harder round, yes.

[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.440]
Sounds like something sexual to me.

[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:22.820]

[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.580]
She'll see them on the harder round.

[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.140]
I don't want to tell you, Rimmer's the one that says that one by the way.

[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.440]
I don't like the one where they say the top's gold.

[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.340]
I don't like that one.

[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.640]
Well, that's another sex thing, see?

[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.300]
That's pot-vent again, Denise.

[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:35.780]
Great.

[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.480]
Graves, let's get serious here for a minute.

[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:38.880]
Take off.

[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.400]
You're coaching an asses object.

[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.480]
You're coaching in the National Hockey League today.

[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.520]
And this takes over for a debate that Neil and I had last time I was in here.

[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.460]
You're coaching in the NHL today.

[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.820]
You have your choice as your number one center.

[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.740]
Lindros or Lumieu.

[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:54.940]
Who do you take?

[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.440]
I'll pick Lindros.

[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.300]
Alright.

[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:57.920]
Alright.

[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:58.700]
I'm your first.

[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.640]
You know, I've been head before in my life.

[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.040]
But this is the biggest setup I have ever been putting the middle of in my life.

[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.380]
No way, not a setup.

[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.600]
The last time I got set up like this with those Cambridge Diet takers,

[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.800]
they've came in and they set up all the calls at the time.

[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.700]
That's like 15 years ago for Crynowlough.

[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.700]
This thing is all planned.

[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.540]
It's all scripted.

[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.280]
I can't believe even Sherry's got a price.

[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.000]
I can see that.

[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.280]
First of all, the eight heck of all the back.

[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.100]
And Lindros is a complete package.

[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.480]
There's a lot of there hasn't been a lot.

[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.800]
I've got to come along like him.

[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.480]
Big truck hit, fight block shot, score goals set up.

[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.720]
Alright, let's put the question a little bit different.

[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.500]
Right now, forget about who you'd rather have for the long run.

[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.500]
Right now, who's playing the best in league?

[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.740]
I'd have to stay mario when he plays right now.

[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.740]
There's no doubt about it.

[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.700]
No doubt about it.

[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.820]
Lindros has to hurt a couple of times.

[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.060]
Yeah.

[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.660]
If it hit her, it's in blocking shots.

[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.660]
And that's one thing mario will never be good.

[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.940]
I'm going to say, Mario scored a goal last night.

[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:52.640]
I don't know if you saw it.

[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:53.400]
I'm a beauty.

[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:53.520]
I'm a beauty.

[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.920]
It's about the third time I've seen him.

[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.480]
He's behind the red line.

[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.000]
It's an impossible angle.

[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.980]
And somehow he slides it across that red line.

[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.760]
And just it just curves into that.

[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.960]
I don't know how anybody's going to get the long run at angle.

[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.240]
No, that was a simple goal.

[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.220]
And he's done it three times.

[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.300]
He wants against the Panthers.

[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:09.760]
Right.

[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.000]
Bobby Orr said that he's never seen a guy.

[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.220]
He's the best he's ever seen.

[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.720]
He's skill-wise.

[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.980]
Maybe not the best player.

[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.740]
But skill-wise, he's the best he's ever seen.

[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.820]
That's always when Bobby didn't look in the mirror.

[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.660]
That's all it's.

[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:24.860]
Yeah.

[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.980]
But he's got skills.

[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:33.640]
He made a move on board two years ago that for a Raymond Bork, all of Stubbs, Norris,

[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.820]
I'm not put to knock on him.

[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.900]
He put him, he was throwing himself right into the ice.

[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.680]
From that one where he give me some, come back and lock it around.

[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.580]
I mean, he does things that are unbelievable.

[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.180]
He was a floater.

[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.780]
The first two or three years, he would definitely was a floater.

[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.340]
But he went to Steve's Canada.

[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.860]
And he saw a dress team.

[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:50.740]
He saw a pocket.

[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.640]
And guys like that showed up every night.

[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.280]
That's when he turned into a hockey player.

[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.720]
But you know, there's some guys you talk about Bobby, where there are some guys in this time.

[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.300]
I don't want to say who they would like to pretend that Denise Potman was a better defenseman than Bobby Orr.

[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.240]
Well, I'm not not the potman.

[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.680]
He was top two and he could put the pocket in and he could make plays.

[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:11.540]
He could block shots.

[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.460]
He could do well out.

[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.180]
Well, you put him in the same class with Bobby.

[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.340]
I put him right at right behind Bobby.

[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:16.740]
But nobody.

[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.340]
I'm not talking to fifths.

[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.260]
But I'm talking what?

[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.060]
I don't think Bobby ought to have him right behind him.

[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:27.060]
Well, listen, if you could have, you see, we've been, and you talked to Danny, and he could say,

[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.400]
I'm right up close to Orr.

[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.320]
It's pretty good.

[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.620]
Thirds of art said there's a player star, super stars, and then there was Bobby Orr.

[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.380]
There you go.

[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.980]
Speaking of third of art, I read yesterday that he was interviewed for the Ottawa General Manager's job.

[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.900]
I couldn't adjust the minute of art.

[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:45.920]
But we're not again.

[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.680]
But Rose got you doing some, uh, powering at me.

[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.280]
You asked me to put up the Christmas tree.

[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:50.760]
Uh-oh.

[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.200]
Well, we're going to have to let you go ahead.

[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.020]
What was that again about?

[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:53.660]
Thirds by Bobby.

[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:59.240]
I was going to say Sir Sevard, the story was, I read it yesterday in the Boston Globe that he was, uh,

[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:04.500]
at least interviewed and being considered for the GM job in Ottawa before they hired Pierre Goethe.

[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.860]
Oh, I don't.

[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.660]
Thirds, I talked to Thirds after the thing.

[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.360]
He was after he got fired, and he was a weightsoat fan, and his guy is rumor of tellyah.

[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.540]
He's a millionaire.

[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.500]
He doesn't need that activation.

[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:24.300]
I'll say that right now, but that'd be good because again, you have to have a French guy in Ottawa because

[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.840]
Paul's right across the river, and they're trying to get the French people.

[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.360]
Look, then that's why they give Dingo a draw of 0.5 million.

[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.800]
They found the most overrated player in the game, most overpaid player.

[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.060]
Oh, whoever in the history of the sports.

[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:38.520]
Yep.

[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.680]
And in the meantime, they're not drawing flies in there, and, uh, when they're going to build that big, uh, bigger arena,

[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.500]
and, uh, they're still not going to draw flies.

[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.780]
Unless they got a product put on that.

[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.740]
What are we going to get to talk about Florida?

[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:49.620]
I'd like to...

[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.040]
Okay, let's do it.

[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.780]
And I want to hear more about Florida, the hockey, that in Canada,

[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.420]
so all these people all over the world with their satellite dishes can hear what a great team and a great coach we got.

[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.860]
Absolutely, and, you know, he went under a judge.

[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.420]
I'm a pain when under a very pocket in that job because everybody said I'm going to say it.

[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:11.500]
So he got it, was that Brian Murray is his friend, and, uh, that's why he got it.

[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.380]
Yeah, I got something to that thing.

[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:14.200]
That's what I believe.

[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.980]
Yeah, and somebody said, well, Brian got it because of that.

[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.760]
He could fire him a little, and then he could back coach it again.

[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.020]
I guess he saw them all.

[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.100]
Uh, Stoltenowski, I'm telling you, this guy, he is one of my favorite players.

[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.860]
The guy comes down to that left side boy in his side, and when he hits, he's like,

[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.880]
you know, he might have Lindross in a way.

[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.300]
He hits the hurt.

[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.940]
He just doesn't hit, you know, hits the hits.

[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.040]
He's pressed everybody.

[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.200]
Now, one a great kid loves to play the game.

[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.180]
Graves always will smile on his face.

[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:46.400]
And I had to laugh one time when he was in the final two years ago.

[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.500]
They brought all the first rounder style and I say, remember, you remember this?

[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.900]
I sent them my coaches quarter and four killers straight.

[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.800]
It said he must have been a real thrill to meet Mark Vestier, you know, after the copy's done,

[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.060]
all the real thrill was thrown.

[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.400]
Our coaches quarter was great.

[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.380]
That's true.

[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.300]
That's why I love it.

[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.220]
That's why I love it.

[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.040]
I know there was another reason.

[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.620]
Now, now you're not too big on those Europeans, but this kid, Wadak Dvorak, this kid's going to be a star.

[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.660]
Well, Doug McFaith said he's a tough kid.

[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.340]
I see Jack comparatively speaking.

[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:16.360]
So we look at that.

[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:22.580]
Yeah, he's not that, but the playoffs come around and then he gets Harry Parker plus 14.

[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.540]
Paul, if anybody, he's got a lovely blend here.

[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.060]
You anybody wants to school around?

[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:27.860]
He got Paul Long.

[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.040]
He can straight the boat.

[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:34.440]
And everybody talks about his V-fruck and he is a kid, 1471.

[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.700]
But I never hear anybody talking about his Patrick night one and one.

[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.680]
He's played phenomenal.

[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.120]
That's right.

[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.180]
Well, see, they only name they know down here.

[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.540]
Unfortunately, he's Van D'sbrook because they like the sound of it.

[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.260]
But Fitzs Pizzi's played great too.

[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:53.300]
Of course, all this stuff about the Europeans, it must make your blood boil when you watch those red wings out there.

[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.080]
Again, great regular season.

[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.420]
We don't know if they'll choke into playoffs.

[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.040]
But they put that all Russian line.

[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.260]
Those five Russian guys out there, you must be going nuts.

[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.080]
For all Bruce Boyle, you got Paul Cockney, a thousand points.

[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.200]
Can't make it powerfully.

[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.040]
You figured out one out.

[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.220]
And all I got to say when I was on it, you said, talk to the first flight.

[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.780]
And remember, all I was talking about, police, police on the K,

[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:17.380]
they threw the mode against those Europeans there.

[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.720]
They said he gets cattle frauds to get them on the ice.

[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:27.000]
And you got to have, you got to have, you got to have, you got to have, you got to have, you got to have, you got to have, pop in the gold set.

[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.680]
But in the playoffs, take a look at the guys that come through in the playoffs all the time.

[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.960]
Now, one guy's on Detroit.

[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.620]
You can't get on the ice, sister, Ellen.

[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.160]
Yeah, well, there's another big one.

[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.800]
I knew we never get to, I never knew we never get to go all out without Rimmer getting sister,

[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.700]
Rellie's name in there.

[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.320]
They've been fighting since he got there.

[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.020]
You don't need them.

[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:45.680]
You probably need them.

[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.520]
You know what, Scotty fought before they got there.

[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.480]
Yeah, I can hear the guy that's here.

[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.480]
That's the playoffs guy.

[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.660]
If they don't play like he did in the playoffs last year, they might have won a Stanley Cup.

[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.480]
Thank you very much.

[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.220]
Okay, we're going to let you go.

[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.220]
But let me just make your prediction right now.

[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:01.940]
Put you on the spot.

[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.600]
Who do you like in the finalists?

[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.540]
I like Detroit.

[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.180]
It's frigging the finals and you won't believe this, Rimmer.

[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.620]
I was almost what I said.

[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.820]
I almost found the plague.

[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:12.280]
That's a very opening.

[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.280]
You know how you have a talk.

[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.580]
You've got about a minute to go.

[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:16.540]
It's up, you've got to fill.

[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.860]
Right off the bat before the season started.

[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:23.800]
The first team, he says, who's going to win the Stanley Cup and who's going to be in the finals?

[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.060]
So I got somebody.

[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.780]
You didn't get in the season started.

[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.860]
You've got to tell me right now I should be straight, hit the bird with Detroit lit it.

[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:31.980]
And that was before.

[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.380]
Did you?

[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:34.600]

[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.540]
I am amazing.

[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.460]
You think this is the year they're finally going to forget how to choke.

[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.140]
Is that what you're saying?

[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.940]
This is the year they're going to tell you choke.

[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.440]
But I'll tell you my favorite team to watch.

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.660]
I got to stay right now.

[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:49.640]
It's Chicago.

[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.760]
I'll tell you something.

[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.640]
Boy, you're not doing very good going.

[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.660]
When they, if something moves on the eighth, they come to play.

[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:58.900]
And Probert is playing the best he ever played his life.

[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.380]
But I mean, but I'm going to tell you, Eddie the Eagle man, pretty shaky the update.

[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.640]
He's not playing very well in that.

[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.480]
Well, in the Eagle, they got to get the Hacker in there.

[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.400]
Eddie the Eagle, he had 29 shots to game and lost some both.

[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.640]
They've reached the gift that sometimes in a, in a period.

[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:13.920]
Right.

[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.560]
So away, this is the Belford.

[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.540]
I've said this to Long.

[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.940]
He plays what he wants to play.

[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:19.500]
You've got to get Hacker in there.

[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.540]
He's one of the slides to three.

[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.160]
Hey, grapes.

[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.840]
What's your prediction for the Panthers and the playoffs?

[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.900]
It only depends again.

[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.500]
You go back to, you know, the deep rock of this Patrick.

[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.560]
If you have your injuries, you guys got a team that you can have two or three injuries.

[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.760]
You have two or three serious injuries that it's trying to.

[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:37.620]
But you know what?

[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:38.860]
It's a little different though here.

[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.460]
And this is something you can talk about on Hockey Night in Canada.

[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.660]
A little different with the Panthers because they don't have a superstar.

[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.900]
And Doug McLean can roll four lines.

[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:49.980]
And when it gets to the playoffs, things tighten up defensively.

[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.660]
The Panthers can play that well.

[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.480]
They've got a decent back line.

[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.540]
And they've got, as you mentioned here a couple of times, they've got great goal tending.

[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.640]
So they're going to be in the playoffs now.

[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.360]
They've played 500 from here on in.

[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:01.280]
They're in the playoffs.

[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.460]
And the fact of the matter is, anything as you well know as coach of the Bruins,

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.000]
anything can happen to the playoffs.

[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.140]
Well, that's true.

[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.960]
But the only thing I see about Florida, they haven't been there before.

[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.780]
And sometimes when a team like that makes the playoffs, they say,

[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.760]
oh, this is their family cup.

[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.940]
You've seen that before.

[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.720]
They've got to think it's not enough just to make the playoffs.

[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.680]
They've got to talk us up up there.

[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.240]
Will you please?

[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:23.860]
I'll do our best.

[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:24.900]
OK, thanks a lot.

[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.120]
You have a great holiday, grapes.

[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.700]
And we'll talk to soon.

[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:28.580]
Who do you want?

[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.040]
OK, say how to roll 1056 at WIOD.

[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.920]
Did you know you can buy a dolphin football helmet for just $9.99?

[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:35.700]
It's true.

[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.700]
It even has the dolphins official logo on it.

[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:41.520]
What's more, it's the most delicious football helmet you've ever come into contact with.

[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.500]
That's because this football helmet is the newest ice cream cake from Carvelle.

[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.640]
It's shaped like a helmet decorated with the dolphins logo and handmade of rich, delicious ice cream.

[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.800]
You're participating Carvelle ice cream bakery.

[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.160]
Your favorite supermarkets got them for only $9.99.

[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.040]
And with proof of purchase, you can send in for a free spiral football.

[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.000]
So look for the Carvelle football helmet.

[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.800]
It takes you to participate in Carvelle ice cream bakery or your favorite supermarket.

[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.780]
They're only $9.99.

[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.420]
So pick up a bunch for the holidays.

[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.960]
And don't forget to send in for that free spiral football, too.

[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:12.740]
The Carvelle football helmet is at your Carvelle ice cream bakery right now

[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.440]
because Carvelle believes everything should be made of ice cream even dolphin football helmets.

[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.660]
So you can watch the Weather Channel cable network.

[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:26.360]
You'll see messages touting 610WIODSV radio station with the best news traffic and weather.

[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.800]
The Weather Channel knows.

[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.740]
And that's why they called us.

[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.820]
No fan came weather baves here.

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.300]
Weather probes on news talking and entertainment radio.

[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:37.620]
610WIOD.

[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.520]
Okay, we're almost up on the news now, which I never ever do that.

[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:43.840]
But in the case when you got grapes on the phone, you don't munch around, munch around and cut it short.

[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.800]
And it's real fascinating to see.

[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.580]
Like I said, when you're head, you admit it.

[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.660]
You say, okay, I've been head.

[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.980]
I know this was a setup deal during the break.

[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:54.420]
Now, rumor admitted he sent a nice check up there and a nice holiday check to cheer.

[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:54.760]
I did.

[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.840]
It's a great door.

[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:57.040]
I'm going to fight flying a big ass.

[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.340]
Oh, give a song.

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.660]
It's about Eric Lindross.

[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.060]
And, you know, everybody's got their price.

[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.220]
The emotional stability is not what it's cracked up to me.

[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.400]
WIOD, my answer for Waterdale.

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.660]
News talking and entertainment radio.

[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.720]
610WIOD.
