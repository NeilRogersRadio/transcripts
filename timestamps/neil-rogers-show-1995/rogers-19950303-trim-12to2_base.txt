We're all friends here.

[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.540]
Is Phil Henry an asshole?

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.860]
Okay.

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.740]
All right, let's go to a phone car, too, here.

[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.140]
Got him lined up.

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440]
Here's Jeff and Miami.

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.000]
Hi, Jeff.

[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.220]
Yeah, hi, Erin.

[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.360]
How are you?

[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.180]
I just have one comment to make and that is...

[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.280]
You just lost a listener, you asshole.

[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.640]
Okay, I got you down.

[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080]
I got you down.

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.420]
And let's go here to Miami.

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.380]
Got him down for asshole.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.780]
Hi.

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.640]
Yes, how are you doing, how are you doing, Pete?

[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.060]
What's Phil pulling?

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.360]
I mean, what if I told him his mother was dying and stinking out the joint?

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.020]
Okay.

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.400]
Please, don't get out the joint.

[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.740]
I'll mark you down.

[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.000]
I'll mark you down.

[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000]
All right, we got down two assholes.

[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.780]
Is Phil Henry an asshole?

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.480]
I am Erin Salle.

[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.400]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, Lisa Haid.

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.300]
Hi, Erin.

[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.100]
How are you?

[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.060]
Pretty good, and you?

[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.800]
I'm good.

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.540]
I'm beginning to hyperventilate.

[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.360]
Oh, great.

[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.360]
Latt of times when you expel too much oxygen and you take in too much carbon dioxide in heaven.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.580]
Okay, I'll take it for my eyes.

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.440]
Come on.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.160]
Yeah, hi.

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.060]
I think Phil is not an asshole, but his listeners are.

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.520]
Okay, I got you down.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.380]
I'd love to get you down.

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.860]
Okay.

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.280]
Hey, Erin Summers.

[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.780]
It's Phil Henry an asshole.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.160]
Here's Miami.

[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.720]
It's Tim.

[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.680]
Hi, Tim.

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.340]
Welcome to PassionFile.

[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.440]
Hey, I just love this new hour you're working.

[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.420]
Thank you.

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.820]
Hey, Erin.

[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.200]
You don't know.

[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.700]
I think he's more an affected smock.

[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.880]
An affected smock.

[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.780]
With that being asshole, is that...

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.500]
If you were to put a photo on the screen, I'd like to see you.

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.780]
An affected smock on a scale of 1 to 10.

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.260]
It's an asshole.

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.600]
Oh, it is an asshole.

[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.980]
I got you down.

[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.980]
Okay, killer.

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.940]
We don't want to kill it for tomorrow.

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.180]
We're going to hear the best of Phil tomorrow.

[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.220]
That'll be on it, right?

[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.360]
What time, five o'clock?

[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.960]
5 p.m. tomorrow.

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.300]
From yesterday, one of the great hours in the history of broadcasting.

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.340]
For all this past 11 months, I've been telling all these people, Phil Henry,

[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.920]
one of the radio geniuses in the history of industry.

[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.220]
No, we don't understand.

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.220]
It's a ponderous.

[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.400]
We know who Margaret is right.

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.400]
This man is absolutely...

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.540]
Unbelatable.

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.980]
He is.

[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.180]
And he sure does a great air in summers.

[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.220]
Okay, let's go to our thing.

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.820]
Here we got Rosa standing by, by the way.

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.800]
We're keeping our finger on it.

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.200]
And by the way, the bad news is that if Rosa should be going like it about 12.55,

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.080]
too bad, L. Presidente is doing it.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120]
I'm going to do a news conference today at 12.55 or 1 o'clock or something.

[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.920]
So they're dumping out of Rosa for a few minutes.

[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.040]
Some nerve he's got.

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.280]
Who the hell does he think he is?

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.640]
Here's Poppano Beach.

[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.940]
Hello.

[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.260]
And I would say he's got the same credibility that she does.

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.580]
Hello.

[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.440]
Poppano Beach.

[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]
Oh, Neil, congratulations.

[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.320]
And back to you.

[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.720]
I mean, thank you.

[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.940]
Did you happen to catch good events last night?

[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.140]
Yes, they are in the analysis.

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.020]
Grate of Ondike, I didn't see her yesterday.

[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.340]
Yeah, she said that.

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.740]
She was hoping with Eva von Braun.

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.460]
Yeah, second cousin.

[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.940]
She said she was eating Chris Dundee's lunch.

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.320]
She was just making a fool out of him.

[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.340]
Chris Darden.

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.300]
Who says, how could she say that?

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.260]
I don't know what she was saying.

[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.060]
Making a fool out of everybody else said that they made her look like a clown.

[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.420]
Like a circus clown.

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.140]
Her exact phrase was, she's eating his lunch.

[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.200]
Oh, my God.

[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.740]
Unbelievable.

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.500]
This bitch, O.J. could get up right.

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.200]
I'm telling you, she is so, I guess she's being paid just to do a purposefully to piss off.

[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.800]
I mean, here's what I'm part of.

[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.840]
He could stand right up in court with a straight look on his face and say,

[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.700]
I'm killing the cold.

[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.960]
And she'd say, boys, he got a sense of humor or what?

[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.620]
And what about the seven hours?

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.600]
Chris should have said, Rosa, you mean to tell me for seven hours all he did was keep saying,

[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.080]
tell the truth, tell the truth.

[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.580]
I don't know.

[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.640]
Seven hours?

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.120]
Yeah.

[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.360]
One other thing.

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.440]
Incredibly, yes.

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.960]
If I may.

[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.460]
Yes.

[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560]
You know your friend from Canada calls you all the time?

[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.120]
Yes, I do.

[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.720]
You hold you there.

[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.000]
I think you're missing something there.

[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.040]
It's not the bridge tender.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.480]
You should have him on every day.

[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.640]
Why don't you go back to Canada, you bastard.

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.760]
Okay.

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.380]
And have a crossfire type thing on a different subject every day for five minutes.

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.200]
We'll work on it.

[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.820]
It would be great.

[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.400]
See ya.

[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.760]
Okay.

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.200]
Bye.

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.620]
We got it down.

[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.700]
We have an open line in Broward, 5249463.

[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.420]
Don't forget on DFO, seven o'clock to that on sports talk in the second hour of power,

[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.240]
shower power, with Greg Lucenas on tape, by the way.

[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.700]
There'll be no live questions on the phone.

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.560]
Here's the Fort Lauderdale on the purple line.

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.840]
Hello.

[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.580]
Neo.

[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.500]
Yes, I am.

[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.780]
Good afternoon, sir.

[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.700]
Buenos tardes.

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.680]
Hey, I'm wondering when your listeners are going to realize that talk radio is like the WWF.

[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.160]
They don't get it.

[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.800]
Well, I...

[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.600]
And you like that old guy that called me about 10 to 10 to know, and it was like, uh...

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.140]
Well, what's this?

[00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.800]
Are you leaving?

[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.380]
I keep hearing my wife and I.

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.120]
What is that?

[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.700]
I mean, how many...

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.980]
Do you have to draw them a diaphragm?

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.760]
Well, you have to change the pens at least.

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.960]
They just don't get it.

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.920]
Also, secondly, I think...

[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.300]
It's your husband an interesting 19 years, and I'll miss it badly.

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.100]
I just wanted to say that it's about time that Wayne digs deep into the craters of his

[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.840]
faith to pull out some cash to get some offense for that panther.

[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.380]
Oh, please.

[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.480]
Please.

[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.540]
He's probably got plenty of cash.

[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.300]
And I'm going to say it again, that kid Rob Goodrow, you'll see him Wednesday.

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.180]
I'd throttle again.

[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.380]
And this kid's been playing real good.

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.100]
It would have cost just pocket change for him.

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.540]
He was available in a waiver draft, and he wasn't protected by San Jose, and this kid's

[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.020]
a real player, and he's a fast gator, and he can stick it in there in the puck too, and

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.640]
we didn't want him.

[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.440]
I mean, I just...

[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.880]
I don't get it.

[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.580]
I'm missing something.

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.900]
Well, they need a total package player.

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.480]
Somebody that could really score, and that could hit, and break some teeth.

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.160]
There you go.

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.060]
We want some a guy who can really score.

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.320]
Thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.280]
Have a nice weekend.

[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.800]
And you too.

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.460]
We got it down.

[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.100]
We have an open line and a purple line, pound IOD, and they're like addressing the judge

[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.600]
right now.

[00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.320]
They're addressing him.

[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.000]
They're standing right there.

[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.920]
Johnny is conquering.

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.860]
There's Chris Darden.

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.340]
And there's some other guy who's the...

[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.900]
Oh, isn't that the guy who's one of the attorneys?

[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.420]
She's got two of them, by the way, now.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.940]
Rosa.

[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.620]
She's got two attorneys.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.860]
She's got this guy, and she's got that hamburger bitch.

[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.020]
Maryland hamburger.

[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.780]
And Hamilton Burger.

[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.260]
I guess you watch too much Perry Mason.

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.060]
I think we're breaking up with this deal.

[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.880]
He's handing out a bunch of pages here, which is people signing up for the judges' autobiography

[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.320]
for some personally signed autographed copies.

[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.860]
That'll be nice.

[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.040]
Are they on this thing yet or what?

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.720]
How do you like?

[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.720]
And there's that Greta Von Braun again in the bottom right hand corner on CNN.

[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.300]
Got somebody out of just a bitch slap that piece of crap.

[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.680]
I almost said the C-word right there.

[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.160]
I'll see you next time, Greta.

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.140]
1213 at IOD.

[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.600]
No rap, no hard rock, no wimpy elevator music.

[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.140]
Because we got better things to do than play the same old songs over and over.

[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.280]
610 WIOD.

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.460]
Maybe you milked my jockey shorts.

[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.380]
Here's my story, said by Drew.

[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.820]
About a girl called Sifilessou.

[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.900]
Inc. Able.

[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.680]
Had a bug and ran it around.

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.200]
Gave it to every guy in town.

[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.360]
Oh my god.

[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:44.920]
Hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:09:14.900]
God is there go, go there,

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.660]
She likes to sleep around

[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.740]
Yeah, even dinner with my bastard house

[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.520]
We didn't dare start it to come

[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.300]
Now I'm afraid of falling off

[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.060]
Here's the moral of the story from a guy who knows

[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.100]
Used to have a hose where this fungus grows

[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.320]
And scanning food that she ever knew

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.060]
A keep away from a syphilis suer

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.720]
Yeah, keep away from that girl

[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.360]
Couple of interesting facts is here

[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.720]
1217 at W.I.D. by the way

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.800]
For your time watch, here's the screw up the replay tapes

[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.200]
Anyway, here's a facts from Chris in Fort Lauderdale

[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.020]
Do you see this?

[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.580]
It's a beautiful thing

[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.340]
He's got the band symbol over a frog

[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.980]
This isn't just your ordinary frog, it's a frog squatting

[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.860]
With big goofy eyes

[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.600]
And it's got like a little beret on it said

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.960]
It's got like a little French beret as in

[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.620]
Nice going, Chris

[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.000]
Also, here's the facts from all the chronics

[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.660]
Are getting in here today

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.740]
Yes, I got your anniversary card

[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.620]
Roberto, thank you so much and get a life

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.880]
Here's Rolando, another one who needs a life

[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.520]
And it says from watching the game last night

[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.980]
The Maple Leafs terribly miss Wendell Clark

[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.180]
They look slow, unmotivated, etc and so on

[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.560]
That's right, they stink and no argument

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.400]
Now here's the fact, this is the kind of facts

[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.800]
That really gets to me, okay?

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.240]
Especially the timing of it is great

[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.620]
What time was this sent?

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.180]
It was sent at 10.25

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.520]
Almost as soon as I came in this morning

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.280]
I made my reference to

[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.120]
We got you down

[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120]
I was talking about that

[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.180]
And then we just got through playing about five minutes of

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.740]
Feel show for me

[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.860]
And then it says, Neil, why haven't you mentioned

[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.780]
Yesterday's Feel a Henry show which happened to be

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.100]
The greatest radio show in history

[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.900]
Isn't that what I just said and we played five minutes

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.380]
Which I've never played five minutes of anybody else's show

[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.220]
It was the two o'clock hour in his passion phone

[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.460]
It's Feel a Henry and asshole

[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.980]
Feel God, I went my pants

[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.700]
I just got through playing it man and saying it and doing it

[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.620]
And I agreed I've been saying that for the last 11 months

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.200]
Yeah, but wait a second

[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.120]
And now they're starting to catch on, they're a little slow

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.740]
But we do got you down

[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.620]
Here's what is that? Oh, the finger man, yes sir

[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.540]
Where is, where is Diaz?

[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.200]
Hello? Hello?

[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.080]
Hello, he's in his? Yes

[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.600]
I call the new photo comprato level

[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.000]
Do you have 19 years in TVA? Thanks

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.540]
And also to blame myself for being

[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.080]
Listened to the pure adaptation for solo

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.900]
There you go, what a bad mistake that was

[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.060]
I changed to your adaptation and now two years ago

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.920]
And I had to send you a lot because you

[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.120]
Help me to get out of the closet

[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.580]
Or in my experience

[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.040]
Traumatic experience

[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.400]
Right

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.840]
We helped you to finger it out right

[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.440]
I think you were a fox one day

[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.560]
I believed that you was going to quit

[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.960]
But I found that it's not true

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.660]
And I am so happy to have true

[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.040]
It is just a big yolk

[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.840]
Yes, you were a big yolk, but it's nice yolk

[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.220]
Let me tell you I had to believe in it at the end

[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.680]
And I said, oh my God, what I do without me now

[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.020]
Yeah, you know? I'm ready to finger it out

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.800]
No, yes, I finger it out

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.720]
But don't mention the finger I got it

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.560]
No, let's not do that

[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.780]
I get a lot of different

[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.060]
We don't want to get that too deep again

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.340]
I get depressed when I hear about the finger

[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.060]
I know

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.920]
Because I care my experience with you and your listeners

[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.040]
I was out of the closet and I feel free now

[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:14.740]
Free

[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.420]
Hallelujah

[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.760]
Thank you, Hallelujah

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.860]
We get last

[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.640]
I don't want to say I was the key to know me just to him

[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.360]
I take it personally

[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.960]
Our station's hotline anchored programming

[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.780]
Okay, hotline, we do cover the 40 voice already

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.640]
We're just a sensitive profile

[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.960]
It begins on AP hotline at 21 minutes past

[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.020]
21 minutes after she's on here right now talking

[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.060]
What the hell is wrong with him?

[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.880]
This AP man

[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.480]
They stink the big one

[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.040]
We don't need you guys, okay, we'll wait

[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.960]
Here she is

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.860]
No, I can't record it

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.100]
No, I can't record it

[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.040]
No, I can't record it

[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.600]
I don't know

[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.340]
Yes sir

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.460]
Yes sir

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.040]
I'm going to start for two minutes

[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.560]
You two for the

[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.000]
I didn't see it

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.300]
I got that in the last 20

[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.260]
It's three minutes before 920 sir

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.940]
And the other one over there says 920

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.260]
Your honor, the interpreter will make a request

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.760]
Yes

[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.340]
Would both counsel and witness the admonished

[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.720]
Please wait for interpretations

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.480]
If that a girl, honey

[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.700]
In not the crap in other words

[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.000]
In other words, custody is back to town

[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.560]
I can only go so fast

[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.400]
You can relate to that

[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.960]
Your little society I jab she said

[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.100]
With 917

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.060]
For the large clock

[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.680]
Which is never

[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.400]
This is I agree to go real fast to want to see honey

[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.380]
So anyway, he's right there

[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.040]
They're right at the AP

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.840]
This is just a but not

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.920]
Now he's trying to get her to see if she can read time

[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.240]
First of all, she doesn't wear a watch most of the time

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.600]
But that night she happened to be

[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.520]
And of course it was the interview where her suggested her

[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.300]
Just possibly the private dick

[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.260]
Who suggested her that maybe it was around 1015, 1020, 1040, 5

[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.520]
Sometime after 10 like between 10 o'clock at night

[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.540]
And 5 o'clock in the morning

[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.460]
That she saw the guy named Bronco Park there

[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.780]
Of course, once the limo driver picked him up and took him to the airport

[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.460]
Guess what?

[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.520]
The Bronco was still there

[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.400]
But don't confuse us with the facts

[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.700]
We'll be doing Rosa in a second

[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.380]
It's 1021, 1021, God this is a goddamn slow show

[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.460]
I know Homentosh and either

[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.380]
1221 at WIOD

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.300]
16 WIOD

[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.780]
The only good Canadians are still in Montreal

[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.460]
But if I am guilty of anything

[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.380]
It is of giving all that I have to give

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.960]
My penis, my buttocks, my lower torso, thighs

[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.380]
And any other error that they wanted

[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.020]
To help children all over the world

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.620]
I killed Nicole, I killed Nicole, I killed Nicole

[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.260]
This is a perra vieja, correct?

[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.800]
I think so

[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800]
And are you okay?

[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.480]
No, if you know, dog have some type of arthritic conditions

[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.860]
And if you know

[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.520]
Is this dog suffering from any kind of air conditioning?

[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.800]
Sometimes yes

[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.700]
And the dog has allergies

[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.400]
And the perra has allergies?

[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.280]
Yes, sir

[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.000]
Yes, sir

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.400]
And the dog is always being taken to the veterinarian for treatment

[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.940]
No wait, the dog has got arthritis

[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.080]
I thought it was OJ with the bed

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.000]
And he's the dog who's got the bed in here

[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.160]
And the dog who's practicing his golf swing?

[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.600]
Yes, sir, the gentleman takes her one and a one

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.460]
The dog is batting his balls around

[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.800]
And someone comes to treat the dog

[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.620]
That's why there was a lot of people going on

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.920]
And someone comes from the treatment to the perra

[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.720]
And the perra is weekly

[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.440]
And the man comes every two weeks

[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.740]
And the man comes to bathe every two weeks

[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.960]
Well, it is because of the dog's age and medical problems

[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.280]
That Mr. Salon told you to never take the dog out to the street, correct?

[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.420]
It's done at the age of the perra

[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.220]
And at the medical problems

[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.820]
That Mr. Salon told you that you never take the perra to the street, correct?

[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:41.640]
Correct

[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:41.860]
Correct

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.760]
That's why he said it, sir

[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.840]
Well, Mr. Salon did tell you not to take the dog to the street, correct?

[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.480]
Well, the gentleman said that you never take the perra to the street, correct?

[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.060]
I don't know, yes, sir

[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.820]
There are no sidewalks directly outside to Mr. Salon, correct?

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.680]
There are no windows, I'm going to front to the house of the family of the house, correct?

[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]
No, sir

[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.020]
Are there sidewalks directly in front of the house, your home?

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.660]
There are windows, directly in front of the house of the family of the house, correct?

[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.760]
There are no windows, sir

[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.880]
Well, he has a yard, sir

[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.340]
Squared, squirt? Well, you remained in the yard, correct?

[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.180]
Yes, when you were in the yard, correct?

[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:19.940]
Yes, sir

[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.400]
You didn't take the dog out to the street, correct?

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.040]
You didn't take the perra to the street, correct?

[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.600]
No, sir, no, sir

[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.960]
Did you take the dog out to the street?

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.700]
Did you take the perra to the street, correct?

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.480]
And I told him that you already told you I did not, sir

[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:35.940]
Yeah

[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.180]
Well, she's got good eyesight

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.420]
That's why she needs those magnets when you took the dog out

[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.840]
When you took the perra to the street

[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.160]
You see that the other day when they tried to have her read something off the monitor

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.580]
which is like two inches in front of her purse and she couldn't read it

[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.740]
and everybody in the courtroom was given her their bifocals

[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.000]
and she's still going to read the goddamn thing

[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.420]
but she saw the Bronco and she had a watch and etc and so on

[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.040]
and it was sometime between 10 o'clock and 5 in the next morning

[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.280]
Here's a lady in the hammock snow less

[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.620]
Hello

[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.460]
A lady in the hammock?

[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.460]
I'm not a lady in the hammock

[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.340]
You're in North Miami Beach, I'm on a wrong line, hang on

[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.020]
Like I said, here's a lady in the hammock, hello

[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.780]
Hello, Neil

[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.420]
See like I said, I can't see a damn thing

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.960]
I don't know what was going on there

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.340]
Well, Neil, I'm Rosa out

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:14.840]
Rosa?

[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.180]
I don't know what to do, she's I'm trapped in my house, I'm oozing, I have the chicken pox

[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:20.980]
I don't know

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.500]
Really?

[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.520]
Yes, and I wanted to thank you and congratulate you of course for your 19 years

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.280]
Thank you so much

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.380]
Thank you so much

[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.640]
You're all week and I have a shameless reply

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.660]
I say a pox on a Rosa's, what else?

[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.660]
Oh my god, it's the worst

[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.420]
How could anybody, you know, Johnny Cochrane, all these guys, they're sitting there

[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.660]
Of course they're getting paid millions of dollars to put on a good pox

[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.280]
But how could anybody believe this woman?

[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.060]
She's like a comedy routine

[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.620]
Even Lucille Ball is spinning in her grave

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.080]
She looks like the crypt

[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.280]
I have no, she's scary

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.900]
I think she might have been on dork shadows

[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.100]
I don't know what to do Neil, because I'm trapped

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.140]
I have nothing else, nothing in my life except for you

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.940]
So what about me, honey, am I a...

[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.200]
I have you, baby, oh my god

[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]
That's certainly not

[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.880]
By the way, speaking of chop liver and mashed potatoes

[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.340]
There's a thing in here in excess for the best garlic mashed potatoes

[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.960]
Do you know, did you ever had garlic mashed potato?

[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.920]
I have, but from where?

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.940]
You're not a yuppie, are you?

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.220]
Certainly not

[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.860]
Bistro mesaluna, and for Lauderdale

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.960]
Ooh, Ronald Goldman

[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.080]
Bistro mesal... oh that's right, mesaluna

[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.420]
Look at how this ties in together, I don't know if I'd want to go there or not

[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.160]
I don't know, how trendy is that?

[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.700]
Getting to the garlic mashed potatoes at Bistro mesaluna requires the dexterity and endurance of a steeple chase runner

[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.080]
There are obstacles to overcome

[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.640]
The restaurant...

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.980]
The restaurant is in a strip mall on 17th Street Causeway next to a doboise pizza and a dry cleaner

[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.120]
There is pretentious yet friendly valley parking this by tons of open spots outside

[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.100]
Then nearby Walgreens, no reservations accepted, meaning wait to over now on Friday night

[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.760]
The wait staff, doats on regulars, but can ignore first-time diners

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.540]
And don't leave your glasses there

[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.560]
All we believe because the garlic mashed potatoes are so damn heavenly that repeat businesses assured

[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.680]
These potatoes are moist, fluffy, saturated with garlic and drizzled with butter

[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.200]
They go well with everything from the yellowtail snapper to the grilled primed rib chop

[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.400]
We've tasted no better mashed potatoes anywhere, how do you like that?

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.920]
In fact, I think Henry Barrow once ate there

[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.600]
I have just tasted your snapper

[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.460]
How do you like that?

[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.600]
I like it

[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.240]
No, I bet

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.400]
Neil, could you do any a big, big favor?

[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.240]
Yeah, I can do you a small favor

[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.840]
Well

[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.900]
Not a real big one, yeah

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.220]
Well, some I think, how about that?

[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.360]
I need to hear the mandage duet to dry out my pox

[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.580]
The mandage duet?

[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.540]
The duet, the two things are recent, he sings his little song

[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.100]
Oh, the mandage thing, yeah

[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.020]
Yes, please

[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.120]
No problemo

[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.980]
I love you, I love you, Neil

[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.840]
Now would you rather hear mandage sings, or would you rather hear arosa?

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.320]
Have a great day

[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.000]
At the close call, thanks Neil, love you

[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.840]
He'll up, bye

[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.100]
Bye-bye, or just heal

[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.080]
We have an open line in day, it's 751 pox

[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.800]
The mad dog is out of control

[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.880]
And you'll find out why when you hear the latest release from Blackbuster Entertainment

[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.740]
Jim mandage sings duet

[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.540]
Well, alright

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.900]
Right around in the trees

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.840]
Well, it's alright

[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.200]
Here's the mad dog

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.460]
Jim mandage sings classic rock

[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.000]
Well, it's alright

[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.820]
Here's the mad dog

[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:21.820]

[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.140]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.400]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.260]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.960]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.720]
The mad dog is out of control

[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.340]
The mandage duet is out of control

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:46.000]
Well, alright around in the trees

[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.440]
Well, alright around in the trees

[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.420]
Well, alright around in the trees

[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.140]
Well, alright around in the trees

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.580]
Well, alright around in the trees

[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.980]
At first, Jim said he felt a little bit foolish

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.800]
I don't like that

[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.500]
You're not gonna whore, huh?

[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.020]
But now he says

[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.760]
I like it

[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.460]
I like it

[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.540]
The mad dog just can't kiss enough

[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.100]
For that cottage cheese butt

[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.200]
If he wants me to sing God Bless America

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.080]
And paste these in the G-string up here

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.700]
I'll do it

[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.040]
You got foam

[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.540]
And everybody knows that it's alright

[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.380]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.580]
Listen to the mad dog sing himself happy

[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.080]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.200]
Oh, right around in the trees

[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.020]
Jim mandage sings duet

[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.340]
Developed now it all blocks us through us

[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.000]
So Rosa has continued to left her bifogals in the car

[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.240]
in El Carro

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.140]
And what the hell is that all about?

[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.660]
I don't know

[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.380]
So now she, Eiffely Bailey comes over with his bifogals

[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.320]
to get him as well do something

[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.000]
He's just sitting there like a big goddamn lump

[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.140]
Cause he ain't getting paid anyway

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.760]
And now she's got, I can see it on the big thing over there

[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.920]
Give me the pointer and give me this

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.680]
And she's kinda like Boston, the whole goddamn thing

[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.500]
Including the little jab judge around too

[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.740]
And it's getting out of control

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.660]
And I think that what's your name?

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.760]
Greta von Braun is right

[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.080]
Chris Darden

[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.660]
He should not be doing this

[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.580]
But I still say, Marsha Clark should be slicing this bitch and ass

[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.940]
Here's North Miami Beach

[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.220]
Hello

[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.160]
How you doing Neil?

[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.000]
Happy 19

[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.940]
Thank you so much

[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.820]
A couple of things

[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.220]
When I watch the hockey games

[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.920]
Every time they show the camera goes to the bench

[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.480]
Is that a cardboard cut out of Roger Nielsen?

[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.140]
Here's the perceptive guy

[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.620]
Here's the first guy to realize that

[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.620]
Roger's out of town

[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.700]
His expression I've never seen this guy move once

[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.220]
Every time the camera goes down

[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.420]
The real Roger is on vacation

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.120]
A host job

[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.060]
I tell you that that is a cardboard cutout

[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.380]
Another thing, if they want to solve this trial real quick

[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.860]
They can do it with the dog

[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.640]
You want to know why?

[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.260]
The dog is in the key to right

[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.540]
And the key to comes from Japan

[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.080]
What is Judge Edo?

[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.140]
People talk to the dog in Japanese

[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.480]
They can speak to the same speak, you're right

[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.620]
They would find out exactly what happened

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.640]
The dog has to know

[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.040]
And the dog only speaks Japanese

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.780]
The dog will be on a stand Monday

[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.800]
Now another thing

[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.880]
You want to get good pizza?

[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.320]
Yeah

[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.040]
Kinos in the Sky Lake Mall

[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.960]
In the Sky Lake Mall?

[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.000]
In the Sky Lake Mall

[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.760]
I'm telling you, we love pizza

[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.620]
And we can't find anything good

[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.380]
I'd have to take security guards to go in a Sky Lake Mall

[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.840]
Can you imagine all the blue hairs in there?

[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.180]
Oh, there's Daniel sent him a badge

[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.760]
Let's get him with our purse

[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.380]
That's good pizza though, you're right

[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.560]
If you can squeeze through you should try it

[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.580]
Okay, I'll get my red one

[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.600]
I'll go and drag

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.200]
Thank you

[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.640]
Thanks a lot

[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.420]
Open line in date 751

[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.400]
Here's another one by the way

[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.100]
I can just can't...

[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.740]
There's 450 pages of best restaurants

[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.820]
And interestingly without 450 ads

[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.840]
I wonder if there's any connection with that

[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.380]
Best Italian restaurant expensive

[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.800]
Here's another one, never heard of it

[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:38.960]
Primavera

[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.680]
840 East Oakland Park Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale

[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.840]
A bastion of solid Italian cooking

[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.080]
The pastas are fresh and generally well cooked

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.040]
As is the fish, the wine list is...

[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.900]
Who cares about the goddamn wine list?

[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.240]
God

[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.540]
I mean, you know, you can get the...

[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.440]
You can try the wine anywhere, including up in the bathtub

[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.220]
And at Old Geyshaus with Malcolm McDowell

[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.280]
For a special evening, you can't go wrong by coming here

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.140]
Apatizer 795 to 995

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.860]
Main course is 1395

[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.640]
Like in pasta and 2595

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.800]
For the loobster

[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.360]
The Primavera, never heard of it

[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.640]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.680]
Neil! Yes sir

[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.380]
Hey listen, you talk about buying into F. Phil Henry stuff

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.620]
The other day when you were out sick

[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.240]
I was buying into your show, I thought it was live for the longest time

[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:22.480]
Yeah

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:29.420]
And then you came on and you said something about that freedom from religion

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.320]
Remember you were doing a tirade on that

[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.220]
And you said, well maybe the next day I'll bring in the information on it

[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.560]
I never did by the way

[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.980]
Well, and I'm thinking it's the next day's going to be tomorrow

[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.580]
And then I find out it's a prerequisite

[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.400]
Could you bring that in at some time? It sounds like a fascinating thing

[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.300]
I don't have it, I looked at home to see if I have any of their stuff

[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.280]
It's in Madison, Wisconsin

[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.780]
Oh okay, so if anybody wants to call maybe they can get us that info

[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.140]
Like call info information or something and get a phone number and address

[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:57.720]
When I get...

[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.380]
It's called a Freedom from Religion Foundation, Madison, Wisconsin

[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.380]
Okay, when I get to the office, I'll do it in call your back

[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.520]
Okay, thanks

[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.500]
Gracius, we have an open line in date, 751WID, how's Rosa doing?

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.760]
Speak for yourself at this point

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.740]
Sit down Johnny

[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.260]
Mr. Darden, you're dead meat baby

[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.760]
Sit down

[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.560]
I'm having a moment, show up

[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.580]
Sit down and shut up for you face

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.520]
Oh he said let's take a moment because Niels got a break

[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.240]
Thank you very much Chris, like I said, you're doing a masterful job

[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.540]
1236 at WIOD

[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.620]
And WIOD

[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.600]
The only appliance you own that talks back

[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.860]
It's Friday, you bastard

[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.720]
Okay, 21 till 1 at WIOD

[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.100]
I think they had to get that bitch her glasses

[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.720]
Here's a lady in Wellington, hello

[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.080]
Hi Niels, how you doing?

[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.020]
Happy anniversary

[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.720]
Thank you

[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.600]
I have to say it's my one year anniversary of listening to you

[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.360]
Are you cereal?

[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.160]
I'm cereal and I'm very appreciative

[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.720]
That's just for us, for both of us

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.880]
That was great, I was sweet

[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.700]
I think I'm the only woman in Wellington that calls you

[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.060]
I call you every couple a week

[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.440]
Don't let the word get out

[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.880]
I won't, but I am trying to convert everybody that I talk to

[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.920]
And as soon as you say my name, they say

[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:04.180]
Well, I just want to say shame on all the women out there

[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.660]
That listen and you know you have many that do

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.660]
And don't call because they say they're afraid of you

[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.580]
Isn't that pathetic?

[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.660]
You have been nothing but a gentleman whenever I call

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.240]
There you go

[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.820]
And I hope to meet you, I'm going to the last hockey game of the season

[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.780]
Against the Rangers

[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.540]
Yeah

[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.920]
And maybe if they don't bore you too much, I'll see you at that game

[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.060]
I'll be there, I'm always there, when loser draw

[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.500]
Or even if I take a good nap, you know, can't be dead

[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.920]
Specs in 125, right?

[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.080]
You bet

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.300]
Great, also I'm just curious, have you ever like bumped into Aaron

[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.640]
Since she's been on the air?

[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.200]
No, I have not

[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.280]
She came that first day, I mean she came in that first day

[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.260]
And in fact, I don't think it was the day she started

[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.700]
It was like just before she started

[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.800]
And I gave her a big welcome and a send off

[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.600]
We were playing her phonyed up audition tapes that she sent down here

[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.840]
And that was it, that's the last time that I saw her and her gigantic ass

[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.120]
Yeah

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.980]
Also, I'm very...

[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.740]
Do you listen to her show?

[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.080]
No, not at all

[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.640]
You're not missing much

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.660]
My husband, he listens to a few minutes every night on his way home

[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.360]
And he says he can't take it for more than a minute and a half

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.800]
Because it is just like...

[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.760]
I know a lot of guys like that

[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.980]
It's just like Phil Hendry's show yesterday, I mean she cuts everybody off

[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.500]
And it was just, you know, he says she's terminal

[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.200]
Yeah, but let me say something for...

[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.900]
Let me say something

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.320]
Yeah

[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.560]
That was the best hour of her

[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.280]
Wasn't that incredible?

[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:21.800]
It was great

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.620]
It'll be on again tomorrow between 5 and 6

[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.120]
We ought to get an 90 share with that

[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.740]
I will be listening in one last thing, Neil

[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:26.900]
See

[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.320]
Any of your Spanish speaking listeners, I'm wondering if the translator is really any good

[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.180]
Because I'm a news here in West Palm last night

[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:42.040]
They had some translation expert and they said that she is totally botching up the translation

[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:42.200]
Really?

[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:42.740]
Yeah

[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.440]
Something I don't understand, and that is because I was watching it during the break here

[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.260]
Every time Chris Darden asked a question

[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.620]
And they come back and she starts interpreting it, she starts out a voino

[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.360]
And then she goes on and repeats it

[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.840]
What does that mean?

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.120]
Because Rosa is saying well

[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.020]
No, no, she's not interpreting her answer, she's interpreting his question, he's not saying

[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.020]
well, she just starts every sentence with that

[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.360]
It's not a sloppy but she's getting a gist right

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.600]
Oh, well yet I'm not repeating that

[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:11.800]
I'm not repeating that

[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.400]
He would know

[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.540]
Yeah, he knows

[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:13.920]
He knows

[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.920]
Neil, have a great weekend

[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.720]
And back to you, thanks

[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.260]
See ya

[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.180]
Okay, there's a lady from Wellington, we also had a lady from what was the other place before that

[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.460]
I couldn't even believe that we never had...

[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.900]
What was it, began with an H?

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.760]
Who's with an H?

[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:26.520]
Hennax

[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.940]
We never had a call from the Hamhawks before

[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.680]
Boy, we're making some real progress now, man, we're building it one at a time

[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.760]
Best FAD restaurant according to the readers, if I don't know, not the readers, according to the editors of excess, the Yuppies

[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.780]
California Pizza Kitchen and Fort Lauderdale and Volca, etc

[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.980]
It is the classic pizza, what Denny's is, the breakfast

[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.840]
You've had better, but the convenience can be intoxicating

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.080]
What does that mean by convenience?

[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.820]
I thought they had like long lines there

[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.440]
I thought they had, you had to wait forever for 85,000 Yuppies online

[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.520]
Who are practicing for later in life down here, they'll be wonderful at the Rascal House

[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.940]
Here's Pevark Pine, hello

[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.940]
Hey, Pallee

[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.540]
Yes, sir

[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:03.980]
How you doing?

[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:04.460]
Great

[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:10.840]
Yeah, I just want to ask you a question on that tape of Jim Mandage when he says I'll wear pasties in a G-string

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.080]
If he wants me to, he'll be talking about Wayne Heisenga

[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.900]
Of course

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.660]
Oh, alright

[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.400]
That's the guy, he's pulling all the strings, baby, all the G-strings

[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.360]
Yeah, I got something I think you'd like to hear

[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.080]
I was in a park a lot of publics on hiatus and taffs

[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.260]
Yeah

[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.760]
And I pulled out and I was driving through the aisle

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.980]
And there's this big Lincoln town car sticking halfway out

[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.260]
Oh, hey

[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.860]
And there was a Geo-Metro in the same spot facing another car in the opposite parking lot

[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]
You just trapped in there

[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.560]
I love it

[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.280]
Can you believe it?

[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.440]
Trapped by a Juke anew, I can't believe it

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.800]
Oh man

[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.780]
Unbelievable

[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.880]
Hey, congratulations

[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.180]
Thank you so much

[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.560]
Well, it's about time

[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.420]
And I want you to play the bridge tender, thank you

[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.840]
Okay, alright, see ya

[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.480]
We have an open line in date, I will play it someday

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.420]
Open line in date, 751, 1 and 1 and 1 and 5, 2, 4

[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.160]
And the passion lines, of course

[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.520]
And 1-800-944-9463

[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.340]
How's Rosa doing?

[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.680]
You're doing well

[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.180]
Correct?

[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:09.920]
Correct?

[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.120]
I'm doing my short, sir

[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:11.820]
Correct?

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.900]
You didn't want the person outside to see you, correct?

[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.300]
You didn't want the person outside to see you, right?

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.760]
No, sir

[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.960]
No, sir, you don't want that person to know that you're insane

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.400]
Correct?

[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.800]
You didn't want that person to see you, correct?

[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.120]
No, sir, you don't want that person to see you, correct?

[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.360]
Bitch

[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.200]
Or you afraid that that person might harm you

[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.820]
That person

[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.380]
Realized that you were there

[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.440]
I thought, I liked that person to tell you that she was a criminal

[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.400]
If that person was aware that she was there

[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.560]
And I don't know, sir, is it something?

[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.000]
No, I'm just afraid

[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.720]
I don't know, that's all.

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.760]
I don't know, that's all.

[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.040]
Okay, did you call the police?

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.280]
Very well, stay in the police.

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.200]
No, sir, what for?

[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.860]
Well, you were very frightened, correct?

[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.940]
Well, you were very frightened, correct?

[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.700]
I was very scared, but what am I going to do, sir?

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.100]
I was frightened, but what could I do, sir?

[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.440]
Well, and this person wasn't supposed to be on the property.

[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.140]
Look at this California Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell switches parties.

[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.520]
What did I say?

[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.080]
California.

[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.960]
Like I said, Colorado, giving the GOP a 50-4 to 46-age in the Senate.

[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.240]
What, everybody's becoming a Republican now?

[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.140]
They put a gun to his head and they said either your signature or your brains will be on a plate

[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.100]
and he said it will still be empty in either case, on freaking believable.

[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.900]
Okay, let's go to a hellendale on the purple line.

[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.200]
Hello.

[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:28.940]
Hello.

[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.620]
Yes.

[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.420]
How's hellendale?

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.320]
Hellendale, you're right.

[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.460]
By the time you guys got to me, I'm in West Palm already.

[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.200]
Thank God.

[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.740]
Hey, congratulations, Neil.

[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.820]
Thank you so much.

[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.800]
You know, I've felt like we were a little right that first day.

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.500]
Not the second day should I say the first day.

[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.440]
I kind of figured it out, but the second day after you went there,

[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.460]
he was yet scared for me.

[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.560]
Not only is he a genius, but he's also the luckiest man I've ever seen in my life.

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.740]
He just fell into a bucket of stuff there that second day when I got, you know,

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.020]
I was getting ready to come to work and I took those goddamn zinc tablets and I'm puking and I'm all over the place

[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.980]
and he just lucked into a whole deal there.

[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.560]
Beautiful.

[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.340]
Should take him along to the track.

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.120]
Great.

[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.840]
Listen, I want to say something to somebody who's listening to me right now is a very important person to me.

[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:15.180]

[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:15.620]
Yes.

[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.060]
Mind?

[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:16.900]
Who is he?

[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.780]
Mark Genital Facts.

[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.000]
Listen, I'm not...

[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.500]
Well, I mean, this is what we call him.

[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:28.340]
I mean, I don't want to say his last name, but I just want to tell him that we're in his area.

[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.880]
We stole a lot of machines and we're taking all his money.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.700]
Okay.

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.240]
Okay.

[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.160]
I've got it done.

[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.720]
Okay.

[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:35.280]
Bye.

[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.360]
Open line and day George is non-plus to say the best.

[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.700]
Open line and day 751, purple, pound line and pound IOD and one in Broward.

[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.260]
This is our biggest law of the day so far and probably cause a Rosa.

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.080]
Now look at it, CNN's going to commercial break.

[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.680]
So here you are.

[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.480]
I'm on. Why you were inside the house that evening?

[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.240]
There's a little piece of the inside that you will get on CNN.

[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.140]
I always turn it on, sir.

[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.640]
Okay. She always turns it on.

[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.540]
The water pick.

[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.360]
I think Rosa's got a water pick.

[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.640]
And so even though you were very frightened that night.

[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.600]
You know, that's why it's not that much that you were scared of.

[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.600]
That night?

[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.120]
You turned off the burglar alarm?

[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.780]
You left the house with the security bars.

[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.040]
You left the house with the security bars?

[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.620]
She left the house.

[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:24.920]
This is staying.

[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.420]
Can I finish the question?

[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.720]
I can't do things that I've done.

[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.980]
Oh, it's too weak. You see weak.

[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.160]
One at a time, Darden. Okay, drama, diaphragm, will ya?

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.920]
1248 at WIOD.

[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.400]
10 WIOD. If you're old, gray and wrinkled. Too bad for you.

[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.820]
Hey, enough with the panthers already.

[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.660]
When the hell was the base bosses of me get anywhere?

[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.760]
Hey, Billy, what would you like for your birthday?

[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.480]
My own Louisville slugger.

[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:53.940]
Briefcase.

[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:01.120]
If your kid likes $800 business suits expensive cigars and would rather bet on his little league games than play in them,

[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.940]
we're proud to introduce...

[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.960]
The official 1994 baseball strike trading cards.

[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:14.780]
Yes, each card features an action photo of a sleazy power attorney who helped bring America's pastime to a screeching hall.

[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.740]
Wow, damn. Remember this guy? Dick Ravitch?

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.080]
He really played hardball behind closed doors. And he's wearing in our money.

[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.200]
Yeah, Billy, and look, the backs of the cards give stats too.

[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.260]
Here's a scumbag who's batting over 600 in favorable court settlements.

[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.240]
I know. It says he shut down an airline, a school system, two city governments, and now baseball.

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.900]
Collect all 50 owner and player rep cards.

[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.900]
Frame them, trade them, or flush them down the toilet like they did the baseball season.

[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.680]
Okay, Billy, time for bed.

[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.300]
Don't try it, Dad. I'll slap it in junction on you so fast it'll take the shine off those cheap loafers you're wearing.

[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.920]
The 1994 baseball strike trading cards. It sports in the 90s.

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:35:01.540]
About 52 at W.O.D., I'll tell you we have just a momentary low-layer and I think the reason being that it's almost 1 o'clock and the baseball game is almost getting underway, baby. Don't forget.

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.180]
You better tune over right now because Joe Angel and Dave O'Brien are going to be doing...

[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.320]
I wonder if Phil's going to do some of that today and do a little of his own ball game.

[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.500]
They're going to be doing the replacement players pretending that they're the real marlins and the real astros and it's going to be a real lush...

[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.560]
It's going to be a sham, man. Even Boog's shamby is upset about this piece.

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.700]
So don't miss that, whatever you do. They're expecting 13-hour people today. It should be phenomenal.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.000]
I can't imagine why anybody, anybody, would pay a dime to go see that.

[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.520]
I think that everybody who shows up at those games should be shot immediately.

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.640]
First in the leg is kind of a gentle warning.

[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.680]
So anyway, I'm looking through the things here, the categories I did find what I was looking for.

[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.920]
And here's the best steakhouse. I'll give you 85 guesses who it might be.

[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.360]
Shula Steakhouse.

[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.120]
Legendary Mime Dolphins coached on Shula's made a name for himself off the field with Shula Steakhouse.

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.920]
Aiyadi-adi-adi. How especially 28 ounce prime rib with saute mushrooms and onions, 2395.

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.600]
And you know what all that meat tends to do?

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.760]
Gigantic amounts of meat clogs the arteries and gets to the brain. That's what it does.

[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.820]
You wind up with Alzheimer's, you can't think straight, you can't see straight.

[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.240]
We need some help. We need some help.

[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.800]
So that explains it. And that's why he's got that gigantic puppy too.

[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.400]
And how about that great tight end, Randall Hill, D-Fo?

[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.540]
What is that man talking about? Here's Pompano. Hello.

[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.580]
Yes, I'm Neil. My buddy has horses with Neppolotino, Jr.

[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.180]
Yes? At Pompano. Right.

[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.840]
And they went up to the metal lands and he's racing up there tonight in one of the races.

[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.060]
And a couple of races. One from the metal lands, one from Yonkers.

[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.620]
And the night on satellite dish, I picked you up on Pompano.

[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.200]
I met you on one of the horses at Jet Center.

[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.500]
Right, exactly. Played by the rules, Dave.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.800]
Right. Yeah, they're going up to watch the race tonight.

[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.480]
I wanted to tell you, once in a while I can pick you up when you're on Pompano on the satellite dish.

[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:49.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.520]
And I picked you up that night that you gave up a whole bunch of winners, the $19 horse.

[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.860]
Right, 10 winners.

[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.640]
Right, you were unbelievable at night.

[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.220]
But guess what, I'm not doing it anymore, sir.

[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.700]
You're all you're not.

[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.120]
Not doing it anymore because the drivers are very thin, skinned, very upset.

[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.680]
They didn't like my comments. And so I said, you know, screw you guys.

[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.640]
But normally you can't pick that up on a satellite dish, can you?

[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.740]
No, it's supposed to be scrambled. They probably forgot.

[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.180]
Can I just give my band a plug for tonight?

[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.020]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.900]
Saturday nights at Talk to Feel Good, the regulators.

[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.340]
Thanks a lot.

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.060]
Okay, plunge your brains out.

[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.940]
Open line and dates and Broward.

[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.460]
I mean, whatever the hell I had placed is 5249463.

[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.960]
I do notice by the way, since excess, which is, I guess it's mainly more of a Broward thing than a date, isn't it?

[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.660]
Yeah, new times is more of a date one and excess more of Broward.

[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.480]
But nonetheless, they do cover both date and Broward here in all the categories.

[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.260]
But more of their selections on restaurants are in Broward and rightfully so.

[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.240]
Because most of the restaurants in town are in Broward.

[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.240]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.820]
Here's North Miami Beach on a date on a Broward line.

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.060]
Hello.

[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.920]
Okay, like I said, there's an asshole on a Broward line wasting a lot of somebody's money.

[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.860]
Two open lines and Broward, 5249463.

[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.660]
See what I'm saying?

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.120]
In the baseball game is coming on out.

[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.140]
It's not Rosa Lopez.

[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.680]
Oh, and that's right.

[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.240]
They're gone.

[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.880]
CNN has still got it on there.

[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.140]
But AP Radio is crappin' out because they'll president a, who also has a bad memory and keeps swaffling all over the place like her.

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.460]
He's doing a press conference.

[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.720]
So AP Radio is crappin' out on us.

[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:15.680]
So, too bad for us.

[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.960]
Now we're really between the baseball game and Rosa and CNN were done.

[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.400]
We're finished.

[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.900]
Here's Miami.

[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.300]
Hello.

[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.080]
Hello.

[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:23.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.360]
Neil.

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:24.880]
See.

[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.180]
I don't think Miss Rosa, No Mast Lopez needs interpreter.

[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:29.760]
Yeah.

[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.460]
Because when she started out, you know, the people were telling you.

[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.000]
Yeah.

[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.380]
They were telling you your liar and she would answer like, what do you mean?

[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.760]
I mean, I'm like, I mean, I'm a general no-mast one.

[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.380]
Yeah, well, they showed that interview, that TV interview I mentioned this before.

[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.240]
And the very first interview she did, the guy was talking only in English from one of the commercial stations in LA.

[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.480]
And she understood every word and she was responding, you know, a little broken English, but, you know, you could understand it.

[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.440]
And then she started the thing with the voices.

[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.640]
She heard voices and then he said, oh, she never said no voice.

[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.580]
She had no voices, noises.

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.620]
She is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen in my life.

[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.340]
No, boy.

[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.320]
Also a happy anniversary.

[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.460]
Thank you so much.

[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.880]
And everybody at FPL wishes you a good, next five years.

[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.340]
And here's for them.

[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:20.460]
And also in closing, they are over her Miss Rosa talking to interpreter and she said, see, OJ,

[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.200]
no mató a Nicole, el hipoporto.

[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.180]
Okay.

[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.580]
See, yeah.

[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.280]
We have an open line.

[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.240]
It did.

[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.120]
751, Piejo.

[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.320]
751, WIOD.

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.220]
What the hell was that all about?

[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.800]
I don't know.

[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.460]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:35.860]
Hello.

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.300]
Happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.340]
Thank you so much.

[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:45.580]
I'm calling because I, um, long time ago, somebody called up and said the peaches by Tony Roma, the oldest one, closed down.

[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:45.900]
Right.

[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:53.300]
Okay, well, there's a sign out on the window that says Wayne Hypinga grows again.

[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.480]
Really?

[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.080]
They're turning it into a blockbuster.

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.840]
Oh, and yeah, right.

[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.220]
Yeah, they bought it out.

[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.520]
I can't believe it.

[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.120]
And guess what else?

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.160]
I guess you don't know this yet.

[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.280]
They're buying up specs, too.

[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.040]
Oh, God.

[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.800]
All the specs are being bought by Blockbuster.

[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.860]
Oh, God.

[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.140]
So all the specs.

[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:08.640]
All the why?

[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.320]
All the specs.

[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.300]
All the specs are being bought by Jackbuster, right?

[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.240]
No, thank you.

[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.180]
How do you like that?

[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.220]
No, thank you.

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.660]
I can't stand him.

[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.280]
And I can't stand OG.

[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.120]
I'm one of the few lady listeners that don't, uh, you're the only one I got left.

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.300]
You're the only one.

[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.440]
They're all roasting it right now.

[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.440]
I can't stand her.

[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.520]
Isn't that, isn't that, how can anybody watch it?

[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.540]
I can't stand her.

[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.260]
And when I go home, I turn it on and I've been accused of watching it list because I've got some interest in it.

[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:38.380]
I turn it on and the house because I'm afraid I'm going to miss something that I got to talk about here on the air.

[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.340]
And the fact is there's nothing to miss.

[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.620]
It's just so ponderous.

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.500]
It just goes on and on and it's so slow.

[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.920]
I like anything else in court.

[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.160]
See, people really believe because they're the creatures of the television age.

[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.760]
They really believe that everything in court is like perimation.

[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:58.060]
And it's very dramatic and they go real quick from one to the other and all of a sudden somebody gets up in the audience and in the crowd.

[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.160]
And he's like, hey, you did it.

[00:40:59.260 --> 00:40:59.960]
Yeah, I did it.

[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:00.640]
And that's it.

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.400]
Life doesn't work that way in the court.

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.560]
It is very slow and very tedious and very boring.

[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.560]
And lots of long terminal pauses.

[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.680]
And how do people are staying with us beats me?

[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.000]
It beats me too.

[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.560]
I mean, if anybody...

[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.020]
I'm hearing it twice every time she talks because I understand Spanish.

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.660]
I'm a spick.

[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:17.980]
Right.

[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.460]
And I mean, it's ridiculous.

[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.520]
It's totally ridiculous.

[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.420]
I mean, even the judge yesterday, he got so tired of this about two-thirds of the way through.

[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.760]
He looked up and said, I have no life.

[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.360]
God, it's just pathetic.

[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.540]
Well, we knew that anyway.

[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:29.980]
Exactly.

[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.300]
I have a request.

[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:31.820]
You bet.

[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.620]
If you can play the Neil God song, you got it.

[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.180]
I love it.

[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.120]
Can I call somebody a douchebag?

[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.340]
Sure.

[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.700]
Momo, you're a douchebag.

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.460]
And a real Momo.

[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.220]
Have a great day.

[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:43.700]
Have a great day.

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.080]
Three, two.

[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.500]
Bye-bye.

[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.860]
Open line of day at 751, the green lines, they were very...

[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.400]
They were smoking.

[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.320]
They were very hot.

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.040]
The beginning of the show.

[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.840]
Now they're not so hot.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.820]
Now they're cold as ice, baby.

[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.620]
Now there is cold as...

[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.360]
1-800-944-946-3-189-444-W.

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.480]
Don't forget Greg Lucena-san with the D-FO.

[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.560]
I had a line I was going to use about that, but not a good choice.

[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.100]
He'll be on with D-FO on Sports Talk by tape, of course, 7-8 tonight.

[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.560]
Here's a mobile and four-loader deal.

[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:08.840]
Hello.

[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.320]
Hello.

[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.360]
You got me?

[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:12.880]
Got you.

[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.340]
I got one shameless request, but first I'd like to wish you a happy 19th anniversary.

[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:17.940]
Thank you.

[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.000]
A shameless request is the Uranus commercial.

[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:22.780]
Yeah.

[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.620]
The car commercial.

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.820]
I was wondering if you could get that on.

[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.380]
You mean Ben Dover's Uranus?

[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.560]
I guess that's what it would be.

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.120]
Okay.

[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.980]
And I'd like to call Rick in Coral Springs a douchebag.

[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.560]
Okay.

[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.100]
Thanks.

[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:34.700]
See ya.

[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:39.660]
Okay, we have an open line in day at 7-5-1-1-1-524, and the four people who are still ruining

[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.000]
listening now that Rosa's only on CNN, please call.

[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.700]
We need the help.

[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.380]
Hey, Goldberg, for Bature Hardout.

[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.780]
News, talk, and entertainment radio.

[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.360]
I have no idea.

[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.040]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.920]
Miami, Fort Lauderdale.

[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.060]
Yeah.

[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.720]
Do you believe that?

[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.940]
How the hell did that have?

[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:47.580]
The video I-O-D.

[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.640]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.460]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.660]
More power than it else, President Seyman.

[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:55.900]
Yeah.

[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.160]
I'm the most powerful God-day man in the world.

[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.280]
Yes, I am.

[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.520]
Oh boy, there's God.

[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.560]
Neil, God.

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.760]
More power than it else, President Seyman.

[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:04.980]
Yeah.

[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.260]
I'm the most powerful God-day man in the world.

[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.960]
So is the Coral Duis.

[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.780]
Burgers are made out of people.

[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:11.740]
Oh boy.

[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.960]
Six for never.

[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:14.260]

[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.260]
You can't get that taste and smell.

[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.120]
How do you feel?

[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.740]
While 86% of newborn boys in this cup are circumcised,

[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.500]
the procedure is widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.

[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.580]
I have no pre-pure.

[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.820]
I'm glad I am.

[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.740]
Oh boy.

[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.740]
Neil, God.

[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:30.820]
Neil, God.

[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.200]
Oh boy.

[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.860]
Oh boy.

[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.400]
Oh boy.

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:35.380]

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.700]
Oh boy.

[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.500]
Oh boy.

[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.940]
Neil, God.

[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.400]
Oh boy.

[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:40.980]
Neil, God.

[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:40.980]

[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:40.980]

[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.620]
Oh boy.

[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.160]
I am.

[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.560]
Oh boy.

[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.880]
I will not patronize blockbuster or any other company that perpetuates this kind of behavior.

[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.140]
You got to ask me.

[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.560]
You got to ask me.

[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.460]
You heard me.

[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:53.580]
You got to ask me.

[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.420]
It's me again.

[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.900]
It's an all-john provocateur.

[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.540]
Oh yeah.

[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.600]
Don't have a bone spot.

[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.680]
Don't think I'll hate.

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.280]
I know that the Lord even loves Daniel Rogers.

[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.480]
Father of the Lord.

[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.080]
God.

[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.300]
Neil, God.

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.620]
Oh boy.

[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.000]
This is Mary Converter.

[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.920]
Neil, God.

[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:11.440]
Oh boy.

[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:11.440]

[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:11.440]

[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:11.800]
John, I'm glad.

[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.360]
How's that hand job?

[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.080]
Something long time.

[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:15.920]
Ah, you have no peace.

[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.440]
I don't do myself as well when I'm telling you.

[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.200]
It isn't that.

[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.180]
It's great radio.

[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.320]
I am that hemorrhage.

[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.060]
Do we have a longer cord than a spence of crap?

[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:23.600]
Look at this.

[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.960]
Look how short this damn thing is.

[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.480]
I'm going to take this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his neck.

[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:28.860]
Okay.

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.320]
Oh, Neil.

[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.580]
This place operates like a freaking nut house.

[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.240]
It really does.

[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.260]
I want to be left to freak alone, okay?

[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.120]
I'm in and mine, but she's got a 4-tubby bag.

[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.400]
Look, protect yourself.

[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.500]
Oh, boy.

[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:41.760]
Neil, God.

[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.380]
Oh, she did their fail.

[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.420]
They're doing that crap again out there.

[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:47.880]
God.

[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:48.720]
Yes.

[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:49.780]
Oh, boy.

[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.760]
Neil, God.

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.520]
I don't know.

[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.220]
How are they now?

[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.180]
President, say, man.

[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.640]
I'm the most powerful God damn man in the world.

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.000]
Absolutely correct.

[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.740]
Here's the lady, mobile and Davy.

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:01.020]
Hello.

[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:01.760]
Hi.

[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.360]
How are you doing?

[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:02.820]
Great.

[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.380]
My name is Kayla and I'm calling to tell you that I have had numerous arguments with self-operability

[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.440]
and they tell me that you guys are the ones to cancel the contract.

[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.860]
They are the biggest liars on the face of the earth, okay?

[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:17.240]
Yeah.

[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.180]
You're in Tide.

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.260]
Well, they keep on telling me.

[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.320]
I said that to them and they said no way.

[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.180]
And, truthfully, they didn't need this number for business and my clients didn't all have it.

[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:26.780]
I would have canceled.

[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.900]
But they can't insist that you're the ones that.

[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.600]
They are absolutely, they lie through their teeth.

[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.320]
I have one more statement to you.

[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.240]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.260]
My son chaps his body and he's not gay.

[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.060]
Your son shaves his body?

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.380]
Oh, he discussed that before.

[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:40.900]
How old is he?

[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.500]
About six?

[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:42.680]
Yeah, I guess.

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.700]
Twenty five.

[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.180]
Well, I'll close, twenty three.

[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.260]
Twenty-three and he shaves his body because he says he's not gay.

[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.460]
And he says he's not a fag.

[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:50.760]
Right.

[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.320]
he works out. Yes, all he hangs out at the gym allot he shaves his body. Yes, pictures of

[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.100]
Greg Lucena son of a wall in his bedroom. Well, his girlfriend hates it too, but what's his name?

[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.560]
What's the he takes up and for football and hate the pose of hair is a drive them crazy. On his chest?

[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.080]
No, no. On his legs. On his legs. He doesn't shave his chest. Please tell me. I don't know, but I wouldn't put it past him.

[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:19.440]
I don't know. Unbelievable. Okay, be ready on that day when a big announcement comes, okay?

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:26.360]
Have a great weekend. Bye bye. Hey, look at this. There is a there is a God somewhere. Man, there's a serpent.

[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.520]
There's a Andy Christ or something because look who's on air right now. It's old Baba. He's all choked up.

[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.900]
Baba's on air on CNN too. So you notice did you see how they all disappeared because they all ran to

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:44.100]
CNN because AP audio didn't have Rosa no more, but guess what? Surprise. Too bad. You'll lose.

[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.520]
CNN says, well, you know, we're going to try to remain incredible news outfit, even though he is

[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:53.320]
pretty boring and nobody cares about him anymore. And we got 85 billion Republicans now and everybody's

[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.680]
ashamed. See, first what they did, they made the word liberal, a dirty word. Nobody was a liberal

[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.940]
anymore. Then progressive. Now that's like liberal. That's bad. Then like Democrat. Oops, that's bad.

[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:09.120]
So even the dockies have been banned and Washington now no more ass. Here's North Bay Village. Hello.

[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:15.900]
Neil. Yes, sir. I just got done reading that excess survival guide. Yes. And I just want to say,

[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.680]
the people who reviewed those columns are a bunch of stunk and agonist. Yeah. Because the only

[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.340]
ad that they got right, the only review they got right was the one about you being the best radio

[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.620]
personality. That's the only one in the entire list. You're absolutely correct, sir. And the one

[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:41.240]
that they missed the most was the video store because video waves rule. What a sense of humor.

[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.060]
Have a great life, Fally. Put a lid on it. We have an open line and a purple line at pound

[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.560]
IOD. I think the air pounded over there right now wouldn't be a first. Anyway, now what is that?

[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.960]
The best of Johnny Cochran? Where the hell did that come from? What is that? You've seen him on the TV.

[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:02.300]
You've seen him in the corner. He's sweeping the nation as the master of cross examination.

[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:09.400]
And now he's singing for you. He's Johnny Cochran. And he's welling out of pounder hand,

[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:18.080]
flabbin' foot, softin' toe, it's his own. Who's making love to O.K.'s old lady? He was running on his

[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:25.060]
good foot, running on his good foot. Yes, he was Johnny Cochran. Singing with Wayne Cochran.

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:33.000]
Get down with it. You're really doing well. Let's do the dunk and get down with it. Yeah, baby.

[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:41.000]
Get down with it. Because I feel very good. I feel quite well, thank you.

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:50.780]
I knew that I would. I'm quite confident, quite confident that O.K. is telling the truth.

[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.760]
I like it. Johnny Cochran, right? And help O.K.

[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:03.960]
He's being true. I put it to you with great certitudes that O.K. is telling the truth.

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.020]
Yes.

[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.360]
Yes.

[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.740]
He'll Nicole.

[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.280]
Okay, told him. 113 at WIOD.

[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.380]
16 WIOD.

[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.640]
We're not my aunties number one station, but hey, we can't speak Spanish.

[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.920]
If he wants me to sing, God bless America and paste these in a G-string up here, I'll do it.

[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.620]
If your car's life is over, go see Bend over.

[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.780]
Oh, yeah. You've enjoyed driving Mercury. You loved your Saturn.

[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.180]
Now come and dig Uranus. Love that new car smell. Nothing smells like Uranus.

[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.720]
Dependability. No one has ever got stuck in Uranus.

[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.740]
Take the plunge, now be courageous. Bend over and ride your Uranus.

[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.560]
And if you like a car that holds the road, you couldn't wipe out Uranus if you tried.

[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:12.640]
Uranus. Powerful. Yet great with gas. Need trunk space? Rest assured you can pack anything in

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.840]
Uranus. And if Uranus is rear-ended, our well-lover kidded joints will soften the blow.

[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:23.140]
Come to our showroom and pick out Uranus and leave that messy paperwork to us.

[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.960]
Check out Uranus.

[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.220]
Take the dive light, Greg, Blue.

[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.500]
Bend over and ride your Uranus.

[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.320]
117 at WIOD, I am just a, this is for me.

[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.740]
Oh no!

[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:37.620]
Oh!

[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:47.520]
From Kathy the Slut Willets, autographed picture, Neil Hot and Wet Kisses love Kathy Willets

[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:54.580]
in a provocative squat pose. And here's Shane Tyler with two enormous

[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.360]
memories.

[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.500]
To Neil Rogers, I'm a big fan, your great love you.

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.860]
Shane Tyler, I got to doubt Shane.

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.740]
And most of the guys in the audience would like to.

[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.720]
Look at that. Boy, now that's something where, uh,

[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.840]
her next to Kathy Willets, I mean, is that something they even think about hard?

[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.620]
Where's that thing? Oh, she's, uh, uh, no.

[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.700]
Every time I see Kathy's picture, I do that.

[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.260]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:21.260]

[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.080]
Miami.

[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.020]
Hello.

[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:24.500]
Yes.

[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.380]
Oh, Dale.

[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.100]
Yes.

[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:26.780]
You're a bit.

[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.740]
Okay, here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:28.960]
Hello.

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:30.380]
Daddy.

[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.180]
Okay, we're on a roll now.

[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.100]
Here's Boynton Beach.

[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:33.440]
Hello.

[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.380]
Classic stuff.

[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:34.820]
Yeah.

[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.300]
Well, we're here for the stuff that dreams are made of.

[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.100]
Great news.

[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.060]
Read a waiver from CBS Pucks with a Whisp.

[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.000]
So it's actually a weed up waiver when you ask questions.

[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:42.560]
Yes, it is.

[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.380]
It's very funny.

[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:43.600]
Anyway.

[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.420]
Anyway, it's time bullcaw.

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.620]
Listen, you cannot believe what's going on.

[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.420]
Probably how she got it.

[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.560]
What is going on out there?

[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.500]
It's just a brutal radio wise.

[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.460]
Not only is your former protege up here in the afternoon,

[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.440]
putting everybody to sleep with their analyses of the trial.

[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.520]
Yes, she's analyzing it.

[00:52:59.620 --> 00:52:59.760]
Yes.

[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.480]
Where's the net?

[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.880]
She hates every opportunity.

[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.960]
The prosecution makes and kills them on everything.

[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.660]
Her league takes a ridiculous point of view

[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.160]
that everyone is credible, except, of course,

[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.760]
to state the police, the prosecutors,

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.660]
anyone else who happened to be the vicinity of me.

[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:10.900]

[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:11.940]
It's pathetic.

[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:12.540]
For you.

[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.260]
It hits me on that.

[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.520]
About the way she was taking shots and does take credit

[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.320]
for a man that's and does use that stuff on the air.

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.760]
So I don't know if he can't care about that.

[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.220]
What do you mean, take credit for Mandage?

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.420]
She said that was her original call.

[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.060]
No, it was not.

[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.320]
She said that was her original fine.

[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.320]
And you kind of a kind of a...

[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.080]
What was her fine?

[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:27.640]
For pre-eated.

[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.080]
What?

[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:28.880]
Mandage.

[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.520]
The fact that he used to say...

[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.500]
Well, you know what he used to say.

[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.400]
Whatever you mean what he said.

[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.440]
All these clips were taken out of Dolphin Broadcast

[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.420]
that run his station.

[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.420]
Well, you know what I'm saying?

[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.580]
She discovered it and she just said,

[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.840]
I'm not going to go into this.

[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.040]
Because they're people like you that want to start a heavy thing.

[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.240]
I wouldn't waste my time.

[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:43.560]
All right.

[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:44.480]
All right.

[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:44.780]
All right.

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.740]
I only empathize for the fact that she's got to work up there

[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.440]
with a bunch of 900-year-old retards

[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.600]
and more power to it.

[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:50.920]
That's all.

[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.860]
I understand completely.

[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.460]
And you are still God, by the way.

[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.520]
I thought that was Henry who did the second.

[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.080]
Oh, was that Drusy?

[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:58.820]
I always thought that was Henry.

[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.400]
Henry's on another planet.

[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.960]
Henry's still on Uranus with...

[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.700]
Henry's is...

[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.580]
Oh, there you go.

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.160]
There you go.

[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.540]
Can't you tell the difference between...

[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:06.680]
Oh!

[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:07.480]
And...

[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.280]
You're absolutely right.

[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.660]
I got my own mixed up.

[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.520]
Have a great life, Faling.

[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.040]
Later, I'm...

[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:12.320]
See ya.

[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.640]
Quick, stirring up the pot.

[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.520]
He's stirring the pot.

[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.200]
Go smoke it.

[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:15.700]
Don't stir it.

[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.880]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.520]
Here's Mara Lieson from National Public Radio,

[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.260]
asking the president,

[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.260]
Hey, what's the story?

[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.600]
Are you still a president or what?

[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.080]
He says, well, it's what I have to think about.

[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:25.720]
I'll have to...

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.220]
I want to look at how they're implemented.

[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.520]
For one thing, if you look at the rules and what they mean,

[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.900]
it's difficult to draw a...

[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.800]
a conclusion about whether they even do it.

[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.180]
Oh, God.

[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.180]
You thought Rosa was boring.

[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.520]
Okay, 120 at the WIOD.

[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.000]
I just thought I would mention that.

[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.340]
16 WIOD.

[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.880]
9 out of 10 Dennis Drill to WIOD.

[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.380]
Okay, speaking of drilling it, man,

[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.680]
we got something to give away now.

[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.100]
See that?

[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.880]
Mitch from Video Waves, he is a painting the ass.

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.740]
But nonetheless, he came all the way down here

[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.360]
and brought us a bunch of stuff to give away

[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.440]
or for me to take home, which I don't want any of this.

[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.060]
And we sure don't want Lisa to see the covers on ease

[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.180]
because she'll get really upset.

[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.400]
Now there's nothing bad on there.

[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.320]
They're just doing it.

[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.000]
Yeah, oh my God.

[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.580]
So, we got four porno tapes here.

[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.820]
You must be over the age of 18

[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.900]
because if you lie about that,

[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.280]
we'll come to your house and give you a spanking.

[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.300]
But we'll give these away on the air.

[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.560]
And then Mitch from Video Waves thinks

[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.820]
that we're going to bring him in here and put him

[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.540]
as that what he thought.

[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.860]
We're going to invite him back here.

[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.340]
We don't want you in here, man.

[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.420]
You're a pain in the grass.

[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.360]
He bought one spot on a shore right away.

[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.520]
Now he's a superstar in here.

[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:23.660]
He thinks he's ponytail, Jr.

[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.200]
So let's give these four away.

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.700]
Now here's one is sabotage

[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.080]
starring Vilaria,

[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.100]
Bridget Amy,

[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.400]
Sandy Beach,

[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.700]
Sandy Beach.

[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.120]
That's Ned Smith.

[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.520]
Boy, how the...

[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.480]
You might hear fallen, huh?

[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.860]
With Steven Sanquah,

[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.900]
Peter North, Tom Byron, and TT Boy.

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.620]
And of course, in this one,

[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.760]
Peter North is so old.

[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.120]
Look at that.

[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.100]
It looks like a wrinkle old man.

[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.000]
Looks like he's doing it at cemetery village.

[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.520]
At least it has to look again.

[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.800]
Let me take a peek at that, you said.

[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.200]
And we got John Leslie's

[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.300]
The Boy You're starring Liquid Slater.

[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.780]
Liquid Slater in her debut tape,

[00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.840]
No Holes Bar,

[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.740]
but here's another one, The Boy You're Number Two.

[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.620]
Directed and produced and written by that aging,

[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.920]
really ugly John Leslie.

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.440]
Who else is in this?

[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.380]
With Sean Michaels,

[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.540]

[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:10.740]
Doe,

[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.220]
Don't you love the name of all the pornostars,

[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.080]
John Doe,

[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.220]
Joey Silvera?

[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.200]
Oh, and you know that Ebola virus?

[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.440]
That's the right, it's the Arbola virus.

[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.360]
That's what you get from watching all these old pornotapes.

[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400]
Don't you remember Arbola?

[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.200]
I think he was in Debbie Does Dallas.

[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:25.860]

[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.040]
Ricky Ricardo.

[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.880]
Oh my God, just at the moment,

[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.480]
at the moment of excitement in this video,

[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.420]
you know what it is that Ricky Ricardo says, don't you?

[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.020]
So that's the The Boy You're Number Two,

[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.400]

[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.040]
Four more hours of awesome redhead,

Seid,

[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:25.640]
Sad.

[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.040]
And old what's her name,

[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.620]
I think, has got a Camille in there too.

[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.160]
Not that old and not that,

[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.600]
okay, here's a mobile in Miami on a Broward Line.

[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:34.880]
Hello.

[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.920]
Hello, sir.

[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:36.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.120]
Yes, I would like to get one of those

[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:39.920]
tornadoes.

[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:40.660]
But you're really?

[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:41.780]
Yeah, I would, man.

[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.860]
Well, which one sounds appealing to you, sir?

[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.120]
What was that one that you did in Nicole Simpson

[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.300]
was introducing in in Nicole Simpson

[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.860]
or what Nicole Hendrickson,

[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.520]
or what did you think?

[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.040]
I said,

[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.660]
Up In Flames was the one with Nicole.

[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.240]
Nicole, is that a good one?

[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.600]
I don't know.

[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.880]
Which one are you talking about?

[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.380]
I don't know.

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.240]
Get cereal now,

[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.220]
you're going to lose your spot.

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:57:59.620]
Right.

[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.480]
Tell them you,

[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.960]
you recommend one to me.

[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.040]
I think you'd like,

[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.840]
Sabotage looks pretty good.

[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.300]
Sabotage.

[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.080]
Looks good to me.

[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.220]
That sounds pretty good to me.

[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.540]
Some very gigantic hooters.

[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:10.280]
If you're a hooter man,

[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.320]
this is up your alley, man.

[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.120]
I'm an ass man.

[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:12.880]
I like ass.

[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.880]
Some very elegant ass in this one,

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.680]
too, as a matter of fact.

[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.560]
I like that, babe.

[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.540]
Okay, you got it, pal.

[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.460]
Okay, how do I get it?

[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.280]
Just hang on.

[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.440]
Okay, I'm holding it.

[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.780]
And don't hold it too tight, though.

[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.440]
What? Why?

[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:23.220]
Don't wear it out.

[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.120]
I will.

[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.560]
Okay, there's a guy in six.

[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.160]
I think that's Mitch Coden from Video Waves

[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.400]
trying to get his tapes back now.

[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.120]
If he gives you the name Mitch,

[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:30.640]
anything,

[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.340]
or anything that rhymes with Mitch.

[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.200]
So that got some instant response on the phone.

[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:35.580]
Look at that.

[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.600]
Even the green lines are all lit up.

[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.500]
What the hell is that on the floor that I keep stepping on?

[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.200]
God, there's some goddamn mung down there.

[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:41.620]
It's bad.

[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.180]
It's bad.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.020]
I think it's the Arbolovirus.

[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.160]
Anybody know who Arbol is?

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.500]
Very ugly, very hairy.

[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.440]
Another one of these really.

[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.380]
See, that's the problem with the porno industry

[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.860]
is that there's about 15 people.

[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.000]
And I'm talking about, wow, maybe 20.

[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.040]
Going back over the years.

[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:55.940]
Over the last 20 years,

[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.620]
it's the same goddamn 20 people.

[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.760]
And you got Amber Lynn and Loretta Lynn

[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.100]
and Tracy Lord and Jack Lord.

[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.240]
And just the same guy in Peter North

[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.700]
who of course is now 85 years old

[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.660]
and used to look really great.

[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.560]
It's still a straight shooter.

[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.900]
And you got that Joey Severa,

[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.640]
whose name used to be Joey Silvera.

[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.700]
And in a same old,

[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.080]
hired terminal.

[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.320]
And there's a few hot numbers,

[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.040]
but not too many.

[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.200]
Here's a lady in South Miami

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.580]
who I'm sure doesn't want any of this

[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:24.320]
disgusting feel.

[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:24.700]
Hello.

[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.040]
Here we have that.

[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:26.680]
Video on WK.

[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.020]
Okay, we have an open line in day,

[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.860]
751 and one in Broward,

[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.000]
524, 9463.

[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.180]
It's really worth waiting

[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.960]
about a half an hour, 40 minutes to go on

[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.020]
for about a half a second

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.140]
with all your clever little rigged up crap, man.

[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.860]
That's, you talk about a half no life.

[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.300]
That's the one thing about this show,

[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.500]
about every show,

[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.000]
every about talk radio in general.

[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.340]
That's really revealing.

[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.300]
Is when they wait and they wait and they wait.

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.440]
They've got it all queued up

[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.480]
and they got their little plans

[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.140]
and they're going to,

[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:51.920]
that's it.

[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.220]
Just for a quick,

[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.800]
I hope it was good for you, man.

[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.040]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:56.380]
Hello.

[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:56.980]
Hey, Neil.

[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:57.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.640]
Hey, that, that one was Ricky Riccardo.

[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.620]
Ricky Riccardo.

[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.400]
Is that real?

[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.820]
Here's an I love Loosley fan.

[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:03.260]
Really?

[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.920]
He comes home and Loosies naked

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.280]
with another girl and he says,

[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.680]
Loosley, you've got a lot of

[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.460]
splain in total.

[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.100]
Yeah.

[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.320]
Hey, listen to Sandy Payton and Jill Beach.

[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.100]
I think they're in

[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.700]
that Sandy Beach, you center.

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.360]
Sandy Payton and Jill Beach are doing it

[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.220]
on the beach on the waterfront

[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.800]
with Marlon Brando.

[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:19.920]
Hey, Neil, great to hear you.

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.020]
Where's the Ricky Riccardo in here?

[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.460]
I'm a serial.

[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.460]
Anyway, go ahead.

[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.020]
Yeah.

[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.180]
Glad to see that that wasn't true.

[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:27.960]
I got a little,

[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.460]
got chaotic.

[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.200]
My life was getting...

[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.180]
You actually believed it, huh?

[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:31.840]
Here's another...

[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.300]
No, you know,

[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.560]
do you want me to tell you something

[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.500]
that's really embarrassing

[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.520]
these last couple of days?

[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.880]
Is that now that the cat is out of the bag

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.200]
and this whole charade of fill,

[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.640]
which is, you know, just a bunch of cramp.

[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.420]
All these people bought it

[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.540]
and they don't want to admit it.

[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.760]
Did you ever want me to enjoy

[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.640]
the people bought it?

[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.120]
And now it's, oh, we knew all the time.

[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.400]
And boy, that fill is sure got a great,

[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.080]
he's number one.

[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.020]
He's got a great sense of humor.

[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:51.960]
But they were buying it.

[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.560]
Neil, I asked him one question.

[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.400]
I knew it wasn't true.

[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:54.620]
Yeah.

[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.420]
I said, are you happy that he's gone?

[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.400]
I said, how do you feel?

[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.180]
But he said, I'm sad.

[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.200]
I said, if you were gone,

[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.060]
he'd be the happiest.

[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:01.860]
Yeah, I didn't.

[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:02.360]
Right.

[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.000]
He'd be top of the totem, Paul.

[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.280]
Yeah, well, then he started going

[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.080]
into that thing about

[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.480]
how he was number one now

[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.720]
and things were going to change around it.

[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.420]
I mean, that's the way he does all his stick.

[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.880]
Yeah, well, he starts out at one point.

[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.060]
He keeps making it crazier and crazier

[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.160]
and more and more ridiculous.

[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.480]
Neil's going to start a family

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.780]
up there in upstate New York.

[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.360]
Right, of course.

[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.220]
There you go.

[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.120]
All right, Neil.

[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:20.540]
Yes.

[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.100]
Honey, get the junior.

[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.940]
That's father O'Toole again.

[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.280]
Father O'Toole, God.

[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.700]
Let's try that one more time the other way.

[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.340]
Father O'Toole, God.

[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.240]
Get the honey, junior.

[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.680]
Here's Margate.

[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.000]
Hello.

[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.160]
Neil, yes, sir.

[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.080]
Steve Nichol here.

[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.800]
You had a caller call up earlier

[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.000]
and say that I did the sports

[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.240]
on the morning show.

[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:42.920]
Yes, Steve.

[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.560]
Well, that's true.

[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.580]
We had to send Sunny

[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.620]
on a project upstate 95 north.

[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.540]
I told him to go to.

[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.400]
He hit the dead end.

[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:50.900]
Yeah.

[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.120]
Now, I've only been here a short time,

[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.620]
Neil at W.I.D., but I feel like we are a family.

[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.880]
And I would like to officially offer you

[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.420]
a contract extension for the next five years

[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.100]
when your current one runs out.

[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.740]
Well, Steve, I got an extension for you

[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.960]
and I think it'll come in handy

[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.440]
because from what I've heard,

[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.220]
we have an open line in Broward,

[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.540]
5249-463-524-WIOD.

[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.220]
He doesn't have a long contract.

[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.220]
He's got a short one.

[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.620]
Anyway, it's 131.

[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.540]
Phil Henry will be here.

[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.360]
The real Phil Henry.

[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.040]
Okay.

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.100]
At the two.

[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.440]
And then the best of Phil,

[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.220]
the more the best of Neil,

[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.660]
the more the best of Phil, the more we got,

[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.040]
tapes up the ass over the weekend.

[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.480]
And man, are we really happy to be saving all that money?

[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.620]
Because we never had any audience

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.700]
on the weekend in the first place,

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.400]
except when that bitch, Meg Green, was on.

[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.040]
How's Meg Green doing, by the way?

[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.580]
Anybody talked to her lately?

[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.720]
Anybody seen that she looks over 70 on Channel 4

[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.680]
on the morning now on Saturday?

[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.820]
Meg Green on money.

[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.700]
Meg Green on money.

[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.600]
This morning at 10 on South Florida's

[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.300]
news traffic and weather station.

[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.800]
News talk radio.

[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.900]
610-WIOD.

[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.620]
See, when Meg was a little girl,

[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.100]
she thought that thing was a piggy bank.

[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.780]
But every time she put the coins in and stood up,

[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.660]
they kept falling out.

[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.940]
Okay, let's go to a mobile in Pompano.

[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:13.240]
Hello.

[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.620]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.300]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.860]
I got to have a video, man.

[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.380]
What do you mean by that?

[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.660]
I got to have it.

[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.260]
Your desperate?

[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.540]
I'm desperate as hell.

[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.640]
Well, what do we got left here?

[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.280]
We got Voyer 2, the John Leslie

[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.200]
directing and producing,

[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.500]
which means it's probably pretty boring.

[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.780]
Oh, there's a lot of die-caxing.

[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.500]
This one looks like.

[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.160]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.020]
I wonder if that redhead one sounds good.

[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.980]
The redhead one up in flames?

[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:34.980]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.800]
Four more hours of awesome redhead head, it says.

[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:38.680]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.300]
So you can't get much more head than that.

[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.120]
Bobby Clark in that?

[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.720]
Bobby Clark is in there, yeah.

[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.860]
And red barbers in here, too, as a matter of fact.

[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.180]
So the action's gotta be pretty good.

[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.480]
And Rusty Stop, also.

[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:47.960]
Oh, Rusty, yeah.

[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.840]
Leigh Ron or Raj's deflaming a ranch.

[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.080]
Hang on, let me go.

[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:51.560]
All right.

[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.500]
Okay, there's a desperate horny guy on five.

[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.260]
He's getting the,

[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.380]
are you marking down who's getting what, by the way?

[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.680]
It's a good thing all these guys sound really old

[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.800]
because we sure don't want to be given away

[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.740]
no porno tapes to any minors on here.

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.980]
That's all we need.

[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.620]
The AFA would have a goddamn nervous breakdown, wouldn't they?

[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.060]
And wouldn't that be too bad?

[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.000]
Because they might see something

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.880]
that they probably been doing all week anyway.

[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.520]
133, let's go to a crawl springs on a purple line.

[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:14.820]
Hello.

[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.320]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:16.800]
Pretty good.

[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.020]
Is red fox in that tape?

[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.360]
Red fox is in there, too, yeah.

[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.440]
Hey, I got a couple of questions about...

[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.380]
Jimmy Hendrix does Foxy Lady on a soundtrack.

[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.140]
Hey, the satellite dish getting back to the important business.

[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:27.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.500]
If you live in coral springs, you need no permits.

[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]
You can just hang the thing.

[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.800]
Well, these things are so small that, I mean,

[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.640]
if you've got a south, a southern or southwest exposure,

[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.360]
you'll, you know, they can put it on the ground.

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.860]
In other words, they...

[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.400]
You're in your porch, huh?

[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.360]
Rowie put on your porch, you can put it outside.

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.520]
You're window, you can put it in this spot.

[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.880]
I'm sure everybody has got a spot.

[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.840]
Don't worry about that stuff.

[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.620]
You'll find a spot.

[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.480]
Okay, then do you just stay up because...

[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.180]
I look around.

[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.980]
Because the best part of it is...

[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.300]
This is the great deal.

[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.120]
Is that the satellite that it's on is like in the middle of the spectrum.

[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.640]
So it's like straight up in the air.

[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.440]
Yeah, it's...

[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.780]
So it's not like something that has the point

[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.780]
and you have to start moving trees and bushes.

[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.760]
You don't have to worry about anything blocking it.

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.620]
As long as they don't put it under like an overhang

[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:07.760]
or a ledge or something like that.

[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.380]
You know what you follow?

[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.140]
I'm with you.

[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.300]
As long as it's got a straight shot,

[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.880]
we're like right up in the air, there it is.

[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.260]
What about the, you know, I've been looking at them now,

[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.460]
since you've been talking about it,

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.880]
the, you know, the 899 versus 699.

[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.600]
I don't know anything about that.

[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.020]
Has anybody explained to you what the difference is in the TV Sievers?

[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.140]
So they said that the only difference is you can hook up another TV.

[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.240]
And that's the only difference?

[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:28.060]
That's the only difference.

[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]
In other words, if you ever...

[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.400]
So yeah, it's got more outputs.

[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.400]
So in other words, I paid an extra 200 value.

[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.520]
Mohammed, I'm gonna, I'm gonna strangle you, man.

[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.940]
I don't wanna hang up no extra.

[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.700]
I thought that it was a different receiver.

[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.180]
It just has more outputs.

[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.700]
So go for the cheaper that makes it even more advertising.

[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.800]
So it's only 699 plus installation.

[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.440]
So for about 900, 800...

[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.640]
Is it 699 or 599?

[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.180]
699.

[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.020]
Well, hold on, I wanna clarify the 899.

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.320]
He said it gives you the ability to hook up another TV.

[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:53.860]
Right.

[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.900]
Yeah, because it's got more outputs on it.

[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.360]
Right, okay.

[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:56.860]
Right.

[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.420]
You're the satellite man.

[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:58.860]
Huh?

[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.040]
You're the satellite man.

[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.720]
I know, but I'm saying if you don't care about that,

[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.940]
which most people don't, then screw it.

[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.040]
Go for the 200 bucks less.

[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.040]
Yeah, I just put around the big 60-incher.

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:07.500]
Right.

[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.260]
And let her fly.

[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:08.780]
Exactly.

[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.620]
So the, well, I think, I think I'm so...

[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.900]
Listen, I'm serious.

[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.540]
I love mine.

[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.520]
I'm so ecstatic that I got to stay in the picture.

[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.080]
It's fabulous and it's so convenient having now.

[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.200]
Now with my big dish, I basically only like diddler

[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.420]
around with the sports channels in my CBC Canada

[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.940]
for the hockey games and some of the back-haul feeds,

[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.280]
you know, that you can't get on the other dish.

[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.920]
But other than that, I don't have to mess with

[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.800]
the big dish that much.

[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.720]
And now, the little one.

[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.200]
And I'll tell you, the hockey games

[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.600]
is quite a few like last night,

[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.480]
there were, I think, four hockey games on there,

[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.700]
out of the five that were we've played.

[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.840]
And tomorrow, there's four more games on.

[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.280]
So there's a lot of sports on there.

[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.960]
Well, and I ordered the direct TV.

[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.080]
At the football packages, 1.19.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.980]
Somebody called up and said it was 1.49.

[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.720]
And 1.19, and that's for all the games.

[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.100]
Yeah, that was erroneous.

[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.320]
Right.

[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.900]
But in closing.

[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.720]
And the great part of it will be this.

[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.720]
And that is that, though, I mean,

[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.700]
they also want a big dish to rely on one satellite.

[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.620]
But on this, it'll all be just flipped

[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.640]
from one channel to another.

[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.280]
And they'll all be right there right next to each other.

[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.200]
That's how they do all the sports.

[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.420]
Now, how much should you pay to have it put in?

[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.340]
Well, they say a couple hundred.

[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.220]
A couple hundred dollars.

[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.760]
That's what your Mohammed guy charges.

[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.000]
Right.

[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.380]
Okay, the one last thing is,

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.780]
hey, Phil had us all going.

[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880]
I don't care what anybody says.

[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.140]
The part he messed up was,

[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.940]
somebody on the news should have reported it,

[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.540]
not on the big news, but on your local station, your 610.

[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:19.920]
Yeah.

[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.500]
And then people get really hit.

[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.380]
People get asked in that, which is the obvious thing.

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.760]
But hey, don't confuse him with the facts.

[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.100]
Hey, he can't cover everything.

[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.220]
In closing, settle your big,

[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.600]
don't smoke and douchebag.

[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.020]
Okay.

[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:31.540]
See ya.

[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:31.900]
See ya.

[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.240]
Yeah, the DCS, man, is the way to go.

[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.840]
I'll say it again.

[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:35.680]
I gave the address out.

[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.520]
I gave the phone number out.

[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.900]
I'll do it again because I'm a big believer.

[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.180]
And plus I find out that Cox cable is involved deeply

[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.960]
in this prime, prime star crap

[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.340]
with the cable company.

[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.540]
And of course they are a cable company.

[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.220]
So screw them.

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.720]
Let's really plug the DSS now.

[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:47.460]
Big time.

[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.000]
And just what I told Bob Green,

[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.900]
who of course wished me a happy anniversary,

[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.440]
not or anything else,

[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.280]
because they're too busy.

[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.140]
They're having their meetings.

[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.640]
They just don't care about people.

[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.440]
Keep that in mind.

[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.460]
Don't ever forget that.

[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.780]
And it was interesting when Phil was doing this

[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.460]
stick people saying,

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.560]
we didn't always had all these problems

[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.600]
with management and they treat people like crap.

[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.640]
And that's true.

[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.380]
That part is not stick or anything else.

[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.280]
Believe me when I tell you,

[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.020]
these people are ass murderers.

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:10.640]
They use people.

[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.340]
They drain them.

[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:11.940]
They twist them.

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.480]
They bleed them.

[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.000]
And they discard them like yesterday's Goddamn garbage.

[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.520]
I'm looking through here.

[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.080]
Here it is.

[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.920]
If you want to get more information about direct TV,

[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.140]
you can call our toll free number.

[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.000]
This is the 18 NCRCA satellite.

[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:28.180]
The number is 1-800-347-3288-1800-direct-tv.

[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.780]
Not direct, direct.

[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.280]
1-800-347-3288.

[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680]
And it'll give you all the dope

[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.200]
and tell you what's available and, uh,

[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.040]
et cetera, and so on.

[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.980]
And you can go into any standard brands

[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.240]
or a lot of the other electronic stores

[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.040]
and take a look at it.

[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.020]
I'm sure they have them all set up.

[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.000]
And you can see the picture is great.

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.260]
Anybody tells you otherwise.

[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.120]
Anybody tells you that there's a lot of downtime

[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:46.680]
with a picture.

[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.020]
Tell them they are full of it.

[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:48.780]
They're loaded with it.

[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.580]
138-2WIOD.

[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.560]
And WIOZ.

[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.720]
Dream Atture Modulation.

[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.420]
Kathy, well, it sucks.

[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.500]
So what else is new?

[01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.400]
Oh!

[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.540]
Goin' out with lots of girls.

[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.480]
We were ready for a brand new scene.

[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.680]
All of them streeters like kings.

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.480]
But we're really just a pair of queens.

[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.580]
Straight and pants and so called.

[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.000]
And rollin' on ships.

[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.580]
But kiss the new world in our ships.

[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.380]
No one cares.

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.380]

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.380]

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.380]

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.380]

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.380]

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.760]
We're here to New York City.

[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.060]
And our ship.

[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.860]
Out is where the king is.

[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.100]
And our ship is heading.

[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.840]
We were 80s underwear.

[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.080]
Okay.

[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.480]
We're going to the same swaying.

[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.920]
We're like the same.

[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.520]
And dancing in our seats.

[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:47.500]
Wow.

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.480]
He doesn't matter.

[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:50.740]
He's got a mate.

[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.960]
And just as long as we can taste.

[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.260]
So come on.

[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.240]
Every guy around the guy.

[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.880]
Everyone at this.

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.000]
Don't buy.

[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.140]
And don't dance.

[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.480]
We're dancing in our seats.

[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.140]
We're dancing in our seats.

[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.100]
The seven sisters go see A.

[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.720]
We're dancing in our seats.

[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.000]
Let's go easy DC now.

[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.240]
Just forget that he's our pretty.

[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.580]
We're dancing on.

[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.380]
All is where the king is.

[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.420]
We're dancing.

[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.660]
We were 80s underwear.

[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.320]
We're going to the same.

[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.820]
We're like the same.

[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.360]
And dancing in our seats.

[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.200]
We're dancing in the seats.

[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.420]
And dancing in our seats.

[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.840]
Dancing in the seats.

[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.440]
Dancing in our seats.

[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.040]
We're dancing in the seats.

[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.540]
143 at WID still might snatch one of these two tapes that we got left between now and two.

[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.960]
If you're lucky and of course is not.

[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.620]
Here's a bokeh. Hello.

[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.120]
Hello Neil. Yes sir.

[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:51.940]
First time caller.

[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.180]
Great. Happy New Year to you.

[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.680]
Thank you so much and happy Jervos.

[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.420]
Yes thank you.

[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.600]
And happy Porum. Yes.

[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.180]
Thank you to you too.

[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.900]
You know I listened to Aaron Somershow for the first time coming back on 95 years.

[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.040]
I almost drove into a bridge.

[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.120]
It was driving me crazy.

[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.340]
Really? But when I listened to her it was so good.

[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.760]
She was great on Phil show.

[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:10.920]
She was great at two yesterday.

[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.800]
That was probably the best hour she's done on the stage.

[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.240]
If she could do a lot more like that.

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.100]
Yeah. And be a lot more natural and laid back and relaxed.

[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.820]
Then she'd butch that show up a little bit.

[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.960]
Maybe do about a one five.

[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:20.940]
And what she looked like.

[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.040]
She's okay. She's got a great ass.

[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.160]
She's got ample hooters and she's alright.

[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:25.500]
Yeah.

[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.120]
I gave her about a seven.

[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.300]
Okay. But which she speaks you know.

[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.320]
I gave her appearance about a seven.

[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.000]
The show about a minus 85.

[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.440]
Now if you could just kind of even that out a little bit.

[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.400]
Right. She then put about a minus 75.

[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:37.720]
Right.

[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.040]
Do you have another tape available?

[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.820]
I have a badlands two back into hell speaking of Aaron Somershow.

[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.680]
Yeah. Is she in the tape?

[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.620]
She makes a cameo in it.

[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.060]
Okay.

[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.380]
And she's the one with the water massage.

[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.600]
Sarah Jane Hamilton is in this one with Bridget Amy and Sahara Sen.

[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.400]
So that either got that or the warrior with liquid slater.

[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.760]
Liquid slater.

[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.620]
Yeah. And a lot of dyke action in that one.

[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:00.140]
I like that.

[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.480]
And dyke action and dark action both.

[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.280]
Okay. Hang on pal.

[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:03.960]
Yeah. Thank you.

[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.260]
Okay. That guy's on seven area.

[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.200]
Another repurvert.

[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.620]
See this is where it's at.

[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.660]
All these guys want these goddamn porn movies.

[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.360]
What the hell is this world coming to anyway?

[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:16.620]
All these people want to see a bunch of naked people doing all kinds of animalistic barbaric disgusting things.

[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.340]
And why the hell not?

[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.020]
What's wrong with that?

[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.400]
What's wrong with watching people do it?

[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.700]
If you can't do it yourself, you might as well watch somebody else do it.

[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.560]
That's what I've already said.

[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.940]
And of course, then if you can always kind of dive in.

[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.200]
And I want to get very emotional people.

[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.320]
So why even worry about it right now?

[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.720]
Let's not say not usually.

[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.120]
Here's a mobile in Bombay.

[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:35.440]
Hello.

[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.300]
Daniel happy, a belated anniversary.

[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.380]
Thank you so much.

[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.320]
I was debating whether I was going to become a season ticket holder for the dolphins or buy one of those DSS dishes.

[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:45.740]
Yeah.

[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.280]
It's probably quite about the same.

[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.420]
No contest.

[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.280]
You really?

[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.480]
Not even close.

[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.460]
They've jacked the prices up on the dolphin thing now.

[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.740]
I mean, I'd say screw it.

[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.700]
I'm not buying any.

[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.060]
You ripped the gun to go back.

[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:57.680]
No, I'm not.

[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.520]
Because you had pretty choice seats.

[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.140]
Oh, the best.

[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.200]
The best seats in the house.

[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.040]
Wow.

[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.400]
And I guarantee you a fat rich's ass will be in both of them this coming season.

[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.640]
He needs both of those seats.

[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:06.940]
He does.

[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.920]
To begin with, there's one last tape left.

[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.200]
Is that still available?

[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.320]
I'm going to get the last choice.

[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:13.740]
Yes.

[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.900]
You have a choice of badlands two back into hell or badlands two back into hell.

[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.740]
Oh, take the first one.

[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.420]
Take the first one.

[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:22.920]
You got it.

[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:23.480]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:23.900]
Hang on.

[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:24.720]
That guy's on six.

[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.980]
He's got a grip on that.

[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:26.560]
And there you go.

[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.240]
I told you, it's not something good for us today.

[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:28.580]
And we did.

[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.300]
Thanks to Mitch from Video Wave, so Spot is coming up in a moment anyway.

[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:31.880]
So, watch it.

[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.420]
He's running a spot on his show.

[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:33.980]
What a guy.

[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:34.800]
Huh?

[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.800]
Running a couple of spots on the show.

[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.140]
He thinks he owns a goddamn place.

[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:38.980]
Takes more than that.

[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.260]
It takes more than just a few porno tapes in a couple of spots to win us over.

[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.060]
It takes something like a really good free meal.

[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.760]
That'll do it.

[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.580]
Here's Kiba's gain.

[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:46.920]
Hello.

[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:47.880]
Hello, Neil.

[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:48.660]
Yes, I am.

[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.680]
Can you clear up something that came up?

[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.720]
I was phoned dropped off as soon as we gave last tape away.

[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.100]
Yes, sir?

[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:56.680]
Can you clear up something that came up during your wake on Phil's show the other day?

[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:57.260]
Yeah, but...

[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.160]
Yeah.

[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.560]
We were all having a contest calling up like saying,

[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.760]
who's been listening to you the longest?

[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.880]
Yeah, and I asked that today, how come I'm not hearing from any of these people?

[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.700]
And like, I've been listening to Neil for ten...

[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.400]
No, I've been listening to fifteen of the same years.

[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:08.620]
Right.

[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:08.760]

[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.140]
There are people listening for twenty-five years.

[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.100]
They've only been here in nineteen.

[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.200]
But they call Phil and will tell them that.

[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.840]
But they won't call and tell me that.

[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.000]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.560]
Well, I'm pretty sure I heard you on your first station.

[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.760]
This was like in 1976.

[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:20.480]
Right.

[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.040]
K-T.

[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.460]
Well, it was in my...

[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.100]
Then I heard somebody calling and saying,

[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.660]
oh, yeah, K-T up there on hundred thirty-fifth in Biscayne.

[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.400]
When I was at K-T, it was over.

[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.080]
Off Alton Road.

[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.600]
It was on Bay Road on Miami Beach.

[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.080]
Off Alton Road behind the Amaco Station there.

[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.360]
In fact, the tower is still there.

[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.060]
And one hundred and thirty-fifth in Biscayne is that Haitian K-T.

[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.040]
Now that new Howard Primer deal at Piece of Crap they got.

[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:43.120]
Now, weren't you on a station where they changed their call letters?

[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:43.540]
Yes.

[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.040]
Like originally it was like WFUN or WFUN?

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.480]
That is correct. WFUN, the old fun,

[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.060]
which used to be the number one rock station down.

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.160]
And they played rock music.

[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.860]
I used to listen on my little AM radio.

[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.440]
And it was brought by Sudbury Broadcasting.

[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.200]
And you became a talk station.

[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:57.520]
Right.

[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.820]
And that was the first time I heard you when they switched from music to talk.

[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.840]
I left K-T as a matter of fact, it's interesting because it was exactly two years.

[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.640]
And March 1st of 78.

[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.980]
We went on a year at WNWS.

[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.720]
And I was there for, uh, God, six years.

[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.260]
And then I was doing nights eight to midnight.

[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.840]
So was, was FUN your first station?

[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.900]
No. K-T was the first station.

[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.940]
Before and I went from there to, well, wasn't FUN?

[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.980]
It was WNWS.

[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.640]
FUN became WNWS.

[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.420]
That's right. They bought it.

[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.220]
They changed the call letters.

[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.120]
Okay. Well, then I wasn't the one.

[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.700]
And then WNZ and then Zeta and then over here.

[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.260]
Well, what do you mean you said you heard K-T?

[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.760]
Well, no. I heard you late.

[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.420]
Well, were you on K-T again?

[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.060]
No, 76 and 77.

[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.460]
No, okay. Well, the first time I heard you was when FUN switched their call letters.

[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.600]
That was the first time I heard you.

[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:43.500]
Well, you must have been living close to a flagristry because, boy, we had so many in the beginning,

[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.300]
the signal problems were just hallucinations.

[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.000]
Always terrible.

[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.020]
I think to that station.

[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.660]
Yeah. But I was in highly, actually.

[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.200]
Uh-huh.

[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.120]
But, uh, well, I'd love to contest, but I'm still glad you made it this long.

[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.400]
Thanks a lot. Happy anniversary.

[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680]
Thank you. See ya.

[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.660]
Yeah. They call a fill.

[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.440]
Oh, yeah. I remember Neil 19.02.

[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.820]
He was really good today.

[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.760]
Well, Calvin Coolidge was a baby. He was great.

[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:02.960]
Yeah.

[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.440]
But they won't call me and tell me that because they're afraid that I don't like them sucking around.

[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.500]
What's wrong with a little sucking around on a special occasion on your birthday, on your anniversary?

[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.360]
What's wrong with a little suction? Huh?

[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.540]
Can't be all bad.

[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.880]
I mean, just every day, see the shows that I can't stand are when people call in day after day.

[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.300]
Oh, yeah. Just the greatest.

[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.960]
Oh, hammer. You're really great, man.

[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.780]
You really know your crap, man. You're really a full of crap.

[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.480]
Oh, God. It's because then it's so obvious that there's just a bunch of ass-lickers

[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.520]
and just want to ingratiate themselves with somebody just so that somebody can validate their

[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.800]
pathetic little useless existence like that punk reg up in Pompo-no.

[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.480]
Oh, why did I even mention that?

[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.720]
149 and W.I.O.D. Wolf Blitzers on there, by the way.

[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.080]
And they're not, look at that. They don't even want to put his ass on.

[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:50.640]
And W.I.O.D. listen longer and you'll get an attitude too.

[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.160]
Take me out to COJ.

[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.860]
Take me out to the time.

[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.540]
Find me some ice cream and white chick melt.

[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:06.240]
We'll know how they call and run, goldman fell, cause it's rude.

[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.320]
Reveal for that hero.

[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.760]
Maybe with the cherries insane.

[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:17.240]
Cause it's one, two, three, set your date in the OJ game.

[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.160]
All right, batter up. Here's the lady in Tamarack. Hello.

[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.100]
Happy anniversary, Neal.

[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.080]
Thank you so much.

[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:26.080]
You have no idea how much we miss you so bad.

[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.340]
We moved to Cleveland a year and a half ago.

[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.940]
And we are here for a week on vacation and listen to you every day.

[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.640]
We miss you. I wish you would be sent to...

[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.560]
You're in Cleveland. You mean you're getting to hear Chuck Meyer and jazz McCay up there on 3W Weeks?

[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.380]
Yeah, I heard his voice. I'm saying, oh my god, that's Chuck Meyer.

[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.280]
I understand they're dying on a vine up there.

[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.720]
Oh, and we get Howard there and he doesn't hold a candle to you.

[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.400]
You have more talent in your pinky toe than Howard has.

[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400]
I know. I know.

[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.320]
I know. I know.

[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:54.400]
I know. I know. What do they do to poor Rick and Suds?

[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.200]
They put him in the morning. They ruin their show.

[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.580]
And then afternoon drive that people could stop on their way home from work and those old things.

[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.160]
Now what my boss?

[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.640]
Well, haven't you heard Phil Henry though?

[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.440]
He was okay. Unfortunately, you know what?

[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.980]
We heard him when he was doing the big joke on you.

[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:09.460]
Yeah.

[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.800]
Which I guess the people in Miami deserve to have that joke played on him.

[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.760]
They do. They deserve whatever they get. That's right.

[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.820]
Well, they'll let them know. They don't appreciate you.

[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.740]
Well, they're all grappling at my feet now. We'll see how long that lasts.

[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.280]
Probably over the weekend they'll forget all about it.

[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.380]
Yeah, about a week in a laugh.

[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.080]
That's right. That's Miami.

[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.480]
But you know, when we moved away, we missed you so bad. If only you could be syndicated.

[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:31.260]
Well, if you could just get all these bastards to spend about a week in Cleveland, man, then they'd appreciate it.

[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.240]
Right. But Cleveland's nice. We like it.

[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:33.820]
Is it really?

[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:34.420]
Yes.

[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.660]
What do you like about it?

[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.940]
I like the change of seasons.

[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.340]
And I like to raise my child there. It's a nice family.

[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:42.500]

[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.940]
They cleaned up a little, I guess. I haven't been in Cleveland in years and years.

[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.200]
Oh, it's really nice. We really like it.

[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:52.140]
There are a lot. We just miss things like you and the beach and family and friends.

[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.560]
And temperatures over 10.

[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.240]
Right.

[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.880]
Okay. Well, have a great time.

[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.680]
Okay, Neil. And can we call you? Were you serious when you said about calling?

[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.340]
Collect next week?

[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.380]
Absolutely. Call us anytime. We'll take the call. We'll pay double for it.

[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.080]
Okay. Great.

[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.380]
Have a great life. We love you.

[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.080]
Bye-bye.

[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.080]
Okay. Here's Miami.

[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.740]
Buenos Diaz. Hello.

[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.820]
Buenos Pada dees.

[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:11.540]
Buenos Atoya.

[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.740]
Yeah, that was a nice call.

[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.640]
Wasn't she sweet?

[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.280]
A very nice lady from Cleveland, that's right.

[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.420]
Who's got to put up with Jazz McKay and Chuck Meyer now.

[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.620]
I was wondering what happened to Chuck Meyer in the morning.

[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.180]
Right. He's up there with Boy Gary in Cleveland. A bad mistake.

[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.300]
When you make a bad mistake once like that, that's really bad.

[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.120]
But when you make it a second time and go up there, then who can you blame?

[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.340]
And like you said, there's no temperature over 10.

[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.640]
Well, happy 20th year.

[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:33.800]
19th.

[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.620]
No, you're starting your 20th.

[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.380]
That's right. This is the beginning of the 20th. That's right.

[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.040]
Happy 20th anniversary, Neil, from the Bag Boys at Publix.

[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.980]
You know, I was going over some old papers here in the office a couple of weeks ago.

[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.440]
And I found an old copy of your WKAT promo picture.

[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.060]
There's you and there's like 18 other.

[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.140]
Yeah, with Irv Shinler and Shirley.

[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.720]
Right. Right. Right.

[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:58.360]
And Craig Worthing and Chris Meyer and Lynn Russell and Jim Alton and Sid Levin.

[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.240]
That's right. I got one of those somewhere.

[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.540]
I'm trying to lose it. Isn't that amazing?

[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.960]
And I have that striped red and white sports jacket on.

[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:07.780]
I think I'm glad.

[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.380]
God. No, it was striped red and white. A candy cane sports jacket.

[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.240]
Why?

[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.180]
One thing about me. I've always been a fashion plate right from the beginning.

[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.840]
I like the way everything matched.

[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.860]
Yeah, it was beautiful.

[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.420]
I wanted to snore for you.

[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.820]
Do you know how much I was making in those days?

[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.240]
Probably what I'm making now.

[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.740]
I started a KT-225 bucks a week.

[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.660]
That's about right.

[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.020]
I was making 200 a week a JNW West Palm.

[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.540]
I came to Miami to the big city. I made 225 a week.

[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.140]
And then the second year, Sid Levin being the big spender.

[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:36.760]
Oh, he is.

[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.700]
275 a week. The only difference being that I went from three hours a day,

[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.280]
from three to six to doing two to six.

[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.980]
Well, they can do it anyway they can.

[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:44.320]
Yeah.

[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.840]
I remember the days when you were doing 930 in the morning. God.

[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:48.380]
Yeah.

[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:49.540]
Isn't that great?

[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.520]
I did a little half hour. You know, it's not much.

[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.740]
Right. And see people say,

[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.960]
when you come in with Rick and Suds,

[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.940]
not really what's the big difference.

[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.180]
When I come in first of all, I'm not under any pressure.

[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.560]
I get here whenever I feel like it.

[01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:58.740]

[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.140]
I'm just sitting there and I just interject a few words.

[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.020]
And they're on the air with the pressure and doing the show.

[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.340]
And I just happen to be here.

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.060]
But there's a big difference between doing that

[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.060]
and having to come in here and be out of the pressure

[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.600]
and doing your own thing for four and a half hours.

[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.080]
Big difference.

[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.980]
None of them have flown the plane.

[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.960]
They just don't get it.

[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:13.400]
That's right.

[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.500]
I wanted a schnorf for one of those porn tapes,

[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:17.380]
but I got beat out.

[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.260]
So I just want to have a little verbal intercourse with you.

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:19.600]
Is that okay?

[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.560]
That was great. Have a great life.

[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.140]
All right.

[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:22.540]
See ya.

[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.300]
Okay.

[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:24.600]
See ya, boy friend.

[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.000]
So Phil, hand reason to be right now.

[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.300]
Don't be looking at that disgusting stuff before you go on here.

[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.980]
I left some other pornographic, including a Shane Tyler's picture,

[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.000]
which you can have with my blessing,

[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.140]
even though it is autographed to me.

[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.080]
Boy, she has got, but you know something that's bad is where all those,

[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.540]
say she needs to go out there and lie on South Beach naked for a few days

[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:44.380]
because she's got all the marks, you know, where she's had the bra on,

[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.620]
and she's tan all around her, but she's got like the white marks.

[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.360]
Oh, geez.

[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.280]
Do something with those dab a little something under her.

[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:51.900]
So you guys are into that.

[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:52.820]
They're into what?

[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:53.500]
White awe.

[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.640]
Oh, I think that looks bad.

[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.100]
Don't you?

[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.120]
That looks bad.

[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.840]
Make it nice and even and smooth.

[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.360]
And the thing too.

[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.520]
Here's Lighthouse Point.

[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:01.800]
Hello.

[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:02.860]
Oh, I love it.

[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.740]
I love it.

[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.400]
I love it.

[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:04.640]
I love it.

[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:05.320]
I love it.

[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.640]
I love it.

[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.180]
I love it.

[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:09.880]
I love it.

[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:11.380]
I love it.

[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.300]
Now, Phil's in there shaking his head.

[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.440]
So you don't, you don't understand the significance of that.

[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.880]
Maybe if I gave you one hint, although I don't think you've been long

[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.680]
and heard long enough to understand.

[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.360]
Mama, Mama, look out now.

[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.180]
You wouldn't get that either.

[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.840]
This is, when I was on KAT, I had Jacques Cousteau on.

[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.320]
It's my guest.

[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:31.900]
The very prestigious Jacques Cousteau on this guy, this Ken Block,

[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.140]
who's now like 35 years old or something, and his wife.

[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.480]
She's also an Ojiropa rocker tour.

[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.980]
They've been cranking talk shows for like 15, 20 years now.

[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.000]
And he used to go, a lot that that that he's still doing

[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:42.640]
it 20 years later.

[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.880]
So anyway, I got Jacques Cousteau on.

[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:47.160]
And Mr. Cousteau, what is it like down there in the depths

[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.500]
in this submarine in the dark?

[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.920]
And this guy calls up and I'm dying for calls because the average

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.420]
age was 100 of our listening audience on KAT, old Jews,

[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:55.900]
and we're dead.

[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.760]
And this guy called Mr. Cousteau.

[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.180]
There's something I've always been meaning to ask you.

[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.160]
Yes, what is it?

[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.380]
A lot that that that that that that that that the mad trumpeter strikes

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.480]
Jacques Cousteau, one of the great moments in South Florida,

[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.920]
and hasn't changed the God damn bit.

[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.480]
So thanks for the memories and how's Rosa Lopez doing?

[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.480]
We were them and say, yeah.

[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.280]
So you guys listened to me so much,

[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.600]
and you remember him and I don't know.

[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.280]
The only radio station that kicks Rush Limbaugh's ass.

[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.640]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.900]
610 W I O D.

[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.700]
Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.780]
Rosa don't like spiders or snakes.

[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.220]
Good afternoon. It's 2 o'clock on Jennifer Rem.

[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.280]

[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.320]
