[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]
Well, I don't know I heard you funny, but you know saying you might do something that's making me laugh or something well. I'll give it a shot

[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.960]
Go ahead

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.280]
You got to hang up first though. I got to hang up. Yeah, no, no, I got another question

[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.680]
Well, wait a minute in other words you want me to play it, but you got other questions. Oh wait for the hell which one you want?

[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180]
Oh wait for the hell yeah, all right now

[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.880]
I heard you talking about Brian Cox didn't have a good game the man led the team and talked to talk about me

[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.200]
Say it again. Let me say it again. Thurmond Thomas ran around him and threw him and up his ass for the entire game for nearly 200 yards

[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.160]
And if that's your idea of a good game then God bless you

[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.780]
Oh my god, he had a good game. He's a good guy. They had a good game. Okay. Get a brain pal

[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.140]
Dis tasteful the dolphins are cursing and man

[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.760]
It's disgraceful cuz Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:11.360]
Words of love they toss and the microphone the dump button just can't seem to be left alone and all of this is because they like saying

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.080]
Oh

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280]
But they play football

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.280]
How did the Patriots kick their ass?

[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.700]
Well

[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.180]
Well, they make it to the Super Bowl

[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.520]
But with an attitude as bad as there

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.720]
Tossing our hopes down the stairs. Oh man

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.940]
Root obnoxious foul and distasteful the dolphins are cursing and man it's disgraceful cuz Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.420]
Yes, they're saying

[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.580]
I

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.080]
Don't even want to hear about the negative stuff we got it done. I mean how are why I don't give a we want a game

[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.620]
I want to hear nothing negative. I want to read no negative paper tomorrow. We finally won a game

[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.400]
That's all that should be said for rate the dolphins want a game for a change none of this negative missed opportunity with all that old bull

[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.760]
I'm tired of punk

[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.180]
Finally we can quit looking at all the damn stations showing the dolphin demise should Jimmy John's replace you all that old bull

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080]
I'm tired of I'm fed up to hear with this

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.620]
Up to here. This is you know is the grace of God, you know, I'm sorry for my for fame language

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.440]
But I'm just happy that we were able to get a win to take some pressure off by no means is this thing over we have to you know

[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.120]
Continue to concentrate and get ready and by the way Brian suck my

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.960]
We've tried and over the counter drugs just don't work

[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.360]
W.I.O.D. Miami Ford Lutterdale use talking entertainment radio

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.440]
610 W.I.O.D.

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.260]
The honey junior

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.480]
The other night was there a fight on the port of July

[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.940]
Now his cousins dead up all it in the head

[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.000]
What happened we don't know

[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.700]
Something fishy smells, but he won't tell

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.020]
So well

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.760]
What did you do?

[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.060]
What did you do?

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.540]
Not so long

[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.220]
He was standing on his folks long and he was crying

[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.600]
Brian

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.360]
Brian

[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.660]
Brian it's hard to understand

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.200]
It was an accident

[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.780]
With two shots lying far too rough

[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.260]
I don't know why your agent crew

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.480]
Claims the cops reports on truth

[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.200]
I want to know some more so tell me what's the score

[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.880]
Brian what did you do?

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.000]
Lexa

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.660]
Don't leave

[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.140]
Or just maybe

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.340]
You're lying

[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.440]
What did you do?

[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.760]
Yes, now he's gone

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.060]
And from this moment on

[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.640]
We're asking Brian

[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.260]
Brian

[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.540]
Brian

[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.540]
Brian

[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.600]
Brian

[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.040]
Brian

[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.800]
Different Brian by the way

[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.760]
You got a clarification

[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.140]
Maybe it's just a bad luck name if you're going to name any of your kids Brian

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.080]
You might want to rethink your position, you know what I'm saying

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.720]
I mean you got your Brian Norcross, huh?

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.660]
He just bailed out of here

[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.660]
And then you got your Brian Cox and you got your Brian Blades

[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.380]
And you got your Brian Andrews

[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.780]
I rest my case

[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.120]
12 away to WOD

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.860]
Happy Tuesday

[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.940]
Happy Hanukkah

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.560]
Mary Christmas

[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.440]
Happy New Year

[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.820]
Etc

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.300]
Etc

[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.700]
And so on

[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.300]
From all your good close personal friends

[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.220]
At 610 WOD

[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.260]
We're obnoxious, disgusting, and we chase everybody the hell away

[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.100]
That's what Ellen says

[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.820]
That's what Ellen says

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.600]
We're disgusting and obnoxious even the most loyal like Bobby and Sandy

[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.740]
And Bonnie and Kendall and her obnoxious very Jewish sister

[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.280]
Even those people are gone

[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.940]
How do you like that?

[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.420]
Hey, it's just the way it goes here

[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.160]
You know I don't want to say this is on friendly town

[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.340]
But you know when Gary Bettland was here for those meetings

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.160]
The Board of Governors and HL meetings in West Palm Beach last week

[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.240]
You know what they told them?

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.840]
Why don't you go back to Canada you Jew bastard?

[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.980]
Here's a big pine key

[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.460]
Hello

[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.220]
Yes sir

[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.860]
Yes I am

[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.260]
I wish you were a good close personal friend

[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.920]
Do you?

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.000]
You must be desperate

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.560]
I don't relate to that

[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.540]
I always like to call but I never get a chance really

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.600]
Because I'm usually working

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.500]
But we are the faithful down here

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.820]
And I'm still campaigning for our toll free number

[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.440]
Yeah right, hold your breath

[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.940]
Take a deep one

[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.480]
Okay

[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.860]
Hey, do you know what ever happened to Jeff Charles?

[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.260]
You're going to start with that crap again

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.320]
When that drug induced phony baloney washed out surfer punk

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.640]
That was on here for about five minutes

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.960]
I don't know and I don't care

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.640]
He was a broadcaster like I'm a brain surgeon

[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.780]
I was just curious

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.700]
No I do not

[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.740]
I don't ever hear his name

[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.060]
Thank God which is why I'm still I've retained a little bit of my sanity

[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.680]
No I don't

[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.340]
Okay

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.220]
And

[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.600]
Jeff Charles

[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.080]
Give me a break

[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.480]
A while back

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.700]
I asked if you'd seen reservoir dogs in your head and had you seen it yet?

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.340]
No I have not

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.800]
Great movie

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.140]
I think I got it on tape

[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.940]
Did you use somebody sent it to me on tape?

[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.620]
Is that the one with river penis?

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.200]
No

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.800]
No

[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.760]
What's that one with river?

[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.920]
Oh that's my favorite, my private Idaho or something like that

[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.760]
Yeah that's a terrible movie

[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.160]
Is it?

[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.080]
Oh it's awful

[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.120]
There's no story

[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.940]
It's just a...

[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.940]
I like avant-garde movies

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.680]
That was horrible

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.120]
But

[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.300]
Did you ever get a chance to see Dolores Claiborne?

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.080]
With what's your name, Kathy Bates?

[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.360]
Another great one

[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.440]
Oh that's on the satellite right now as a matter of fact

[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.920]
I saw the previous four last year

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.760]
If you get a chance I'd like to hear your commentary on that

[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.820]
But mainly reservoir dogs

[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.360]
Mainly

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.860]
Yeah I'd like to

[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.720]
If you liked

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.360]
Clockwork Orange

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.660]
Yeah

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.360]
I would think you liked that one too

[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.520]
It's kind of...

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.780]
Sick

[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.740]
Yeah

[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.400]
That's pain

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.440]
I love it already

[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240]
Okay have a great...

[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.740]
Whatever

[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.800]
Oh I'd like to suck a rat for a CD though

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.960]
Well sounds like the voice of experience

[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.480]
Well

[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.360]
Yes

[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.120]
I'm one of those insipid diehard Paul McCartney fans

[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.220]
Oh how did I know that?

[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.700]
How did I know it?

[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.320]
Here's the family way

[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.780]
Yeah

[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.740]
You got it

[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.480]
Thank you sir

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:22.980]
Wasn't that easy?

[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.620]
You were easy

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.000]
Okay

[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.460]
Listen now

[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.060]
Say goodbye or I'm going to get really upset

[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.520]
Hang on

[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.040]
Thank you

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.800]
You're going to hang on?

[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.200]
Yes

[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.280]
You're going to dummy up now?

[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:32.840]
Yes

[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.320]
Okay

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.220]
Line 2, take care of her, him, take care of it

[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.340]
He wants Paul McCartney there on Line 2

[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.760]
And anybody that's brave enough to ask for Paul McCartney deserves what they get

[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.860]
Paul McCartney

[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.360]
Don't forget those borders, books and music stories baby

[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.500]
We got Carl Springs having Turek Kendall Boka for Lauderdale and other one in Mayfear

[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.360]
And the Grove has also got our best of cassettes and CDs

[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.020]
And even though it's six days till Christmas you can pop right into any borders nearby you

[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.980]
And pick up all the best of rick and suds and yours truly and feel Henry and all that good stuff

[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.820]
Great holiday gifts and great to have for yourself

[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.220]
And the money goes to a great cost center one

[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.760]
We got over 90 grand in the kitty already and we're doing it

[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.820]
We are doing it baby

[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.940]
Let's keep it going, let's keep that momentum

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.400]
All you got to know is Jackie Moe

[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.240]
So how's Jackie Lee doing?

[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.460]
12 minutes past noon at WIOD

[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.860]
Steve Parachuba

[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.460]
Steve Parachuba

[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.680]
Well you know Jim Marien Singh, I'm a teen practice today

[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.620]
I just thought we'd steal a few fine moments of time together

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.360]
Cut it, lay down on my tongue

[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.880]
Well that's a fine idea, don't mind if I do

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.560]
By the way, what is that you're wearing anyway?

[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.760]
You're wearing pasties and a G-string

[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.160]
Well you look just fine

[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.560]
Now why don't you get over here and make me feel like a man

[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.440]
Alright!

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.340]
Now take it easy, manage come down, I'm tender you know

[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.260]
I'm gonna start on this thing and I'm gonna rough out it all year long

[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.920]
I'm down now, manage I told you to take it easy

[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.460]
Now get off of me you bitch

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.060]
You turned round noser, you chucked out

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.880]
Well I've had enough of this, I'm out of here

[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.400]
I love for you will always be

[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.800]
Max Just Scoople

[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.100]
What do you say?

[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.240]
Okay 1217 at WIOD

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.500]
Happy Tuesday from all your good spirit and friends here at WIOD

[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.360]
Many of whom are really into the spirit, heavily I can't imagine which ones

[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.320]
We have an open line and Broward

[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.400]
How do you like that? We got an open line and Broward

[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.260]
God is that get me depressed

[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.360]
5249463

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.640]
So much we in our chief engineer who happens to be a hell of a great guy

[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.520]
Especially the day since he put on my license plate with that screwdriver

[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.580]
So he's got a one of these, what do they call these?

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.300]
What's the shorthand for that? What do they call them?

[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.440]
Those verification things?

[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.420]
I thought you're supposed to

[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.340]
I don't even know what you have

[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.880]
It's a letter from a guy in Finland who heard our signal one night

[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.380]
At 257 his time in the morning which is six hours ahead

[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.320]
He heard passion bones

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.700]
That's called a Yuntary Port

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.340]
No it's a DSX, what is it?

[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.700]
George

[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.860]
What you think I have a class

[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.260]
He's not only a phony spiky, he's a phony engineer too, how do you like that?

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.080]
He's putting down those transmitter readings, he's pulling them out of his ass

[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.240]
He couldn't read one of those meters if you held a gun

[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.340]
Yes, it was a cell report

[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.300]
Like I said

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.120]
What?

[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.920]
QSL, right, that's what I'm looking for, QSL

[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.860]
I only know one word that begins with Q

[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.600]
Oh, two

[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.160]
So anyway, first off, season greetings from Finland close to the Arctic Circle in northern Europe

[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.520]
And he goes on and on and you're at passion bones

[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.380]
And a female speaker says

[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.140]
Tonight we're talking about sex outside your race or religion, you agree with us

[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.320]
We'll get back to the phone line, yada yada yada

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.900]
Then a lady on the other end of the phone line started explaining her views on the subject

[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.900]
257 AM, three minutes later, he lost track of his signal

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.640]
He dropped it, it slipped right out of his hand

[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.560]
Damn it, right in midstream too baby

[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.960]
And the guy's name is Hanu

[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.960]
Nilek, Nileksella

[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.340]
Hanu, that's like Timu

[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.020]
As in house by you, Timu

[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.000]
Those fins, man, I don't know, they got some of them look okay

[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.100]
Like that Koi-fu and Ta-Hanu

[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.360]
Is that all they know from?

[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.660]
Koi-fu

[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.280]
On a Montreal, Canadians

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.800]
Shloy-mi Koi-fu

[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.320]
And Timu, Salani

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.560]
And this is Maharajiyanu

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.260]
Why can't they be more like us? Okay, why can't they be barbaric and more like us Americans?

[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.320]
Here's Sunrise, hello

[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.060]
Hey Nile, good morning

[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.060]
Yes sir

[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.140]
You know, for years you've been saying that there are no living and breathing people down here

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.940]
Very few

[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.220]
And I just realized that it's pretty hard

[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.320]
Yeah, I know, and I just realized that both of the newspapers down here is with you

[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.780]
Yeah

[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.560]
I'm sitting here looking at the sports section of the Philadelphia Inquirer

[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.500]
And the daily news, Oath of Whom, as you know, are published by Nightrider

[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.280]
I'm looking at the coverage of the football and the hockey

[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.700]
One paper had eight reporters covering the Eagles game

[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.100]
Yeah

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.680]
The other had seven, they have two or three reporters covering the flyers game

[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:15.920]
Yeah

[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.360]
They have late scores in here, they don't put the paper to bet it mine up

[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.040]
In other words, they're real newspapers because it's a real city where there are people who speak English and really read a newspaper

[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.500]
Absolutely

[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.180]
Not here

[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.900]
No, you're right there, it's not down here

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:34.080]
And the silent majority of the living and breathing down here don't amount to anything

[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.020]
The papers ought to do away with the sports section, have one page with scores

[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.540]
And have an obituary section down here

[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.460]
Oh, that's in there

[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.340]
Yeah, but I mean make a whole section

[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.960]
It is

[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.000]
The people read it

[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.480]
You didn't check out the last 20 pages

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.340]
I guess not

[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.720]
At any rate, that's what I had to say

[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.080]
Two quick questions

[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.340]
You were trying to get me a telephone number where I can get in touch with Dr. Appkins

[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.900]
I told you one day

[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.180]
Oh, I don't, I can't find it, I don't got it

[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.280]
And one in New York

[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.860]
You only, I got the same number you've got from the book, that's it

[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.140]
Yeah

[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.580]
So I thought maybe you had to place the contact and I'm in closing, sir

[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:09.860]
Yes?

[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.980]
I still think the 40 hours, the best hockey player I've ever seen

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980]
Well, good luck to you

[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.020]
Great, have a great life

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.540]
Thank you

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:15.840]
Wrong

[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.780]
We have an open line two of men, Broward, 5249, 463 and a purple line, 18T wireless, pick it up and pound it

[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.080]
We pay the freight pound IOD

[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.900]
1221 at WIOD

[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.920]
It's another candle Toyota exclusive right now

[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.440]
They'll pay you at least $4,000 for your trade no matter what condition it's in

[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.500]
Who's got this account now by the way, that little short guy that replaced Larry Padwell?

[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.480]
I got news for a little short guy that replaced Larry Padwell

[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.880]
We got some very high priced accounts on his show

[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.100]
And one of them is this account that George is driving that beautiful camera

[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.700]
And if anything happens to what he's going to be really pissed off and take it out on your short little ass

[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.260]
Yeah

[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.120]
So we better get on the stick, okay?

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.060]
Because everybody knows that candle Toyota will give you a 4 grand tour of the purchase of any new 1996 Toyota Prevy

[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:08.380]
A van, 4 runner, Avalon, Super, Tacoma, Camry, L.E. Camry, Wagon, Camry V6, Celica, T100 Pickup, Tacoma, Extra Cab, T100, Extra Cab

[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.980]
Tacoma Pickup, Orlando Cruiser and Stock

[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.540]
And they also know that everybody who buys a new Toyota right now also gets an 18T cellular phone and no extra cost

[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:23.400]
And they also know that they better as always that candle Toyota will be any other price than any other Toyota from any of the dealer advertised or otherwise

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.200]
They know that

[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.820]
Little short guy that replaced Larry Padwell and by the way, little short guy don't buy a house

[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.560]
So get your ass down there to candle Toyota on US1 just south of the day land

[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.800]
Or call him at 1-800-873 Toyota and ask Mark Jacobson if he bought a house

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.180]
I sure hope not for his to say

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.460]
This offer by the way is based on MSRP

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.040]
You already know that and you already know it excludes two cells, Corolla's and you already know it excludes Passeo's right?

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.780]
And you certainly know it's not a conjunction with any other offer

[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.420]
Dan Sula, I f***ing think

[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:58.560]
Oh, 1225 at WYOD so you know it's just amazing this business bears out what I always said right?

[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.160]
Here's a facts, I won't even dignify the one from that Greg

[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.480]
You see you let him on here for a few seconds, this is the problem with you Greg

[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.940]
You won't stop, you won't stop

[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.760]
Quit with the facts already, leave me alone, go get a hobby, stick your butt up your nose

[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.440]
Who do you think this facts is from?

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:23.340]
Okay, one step away from Greg from Boyton Beach, we also just savaged here this morning

[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.180]
Ice, female

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.900]
Bonnie, no, you didn't warm

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]
Sandy, no

[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.900]
Who says that I'm disgusting and obnoxious in the chasing everybody away?

[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.420]
Ellen

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:40.940]
Right

[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.200]
It's a hockey thing

[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.260]
Do you believe the Panthers weren't even rated as contenders and your opinion is there a truth of the baba bada

[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.080]
A fellow fan female Ellen, like I don't know who this is

[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.000]
I rest my, you see what I'm saying?

[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.940]
You can't even chase some of these people away no matter what you say no matter what you do

[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.400]
They won't go away, they won't go away, they won't stop

[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.940]
You can't insult them and she says I'm insulting everybody and chasing them away

[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.340]
How can you insult anybody when you're like this?

[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:11.980]
Ellen

[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.760]
Here's a lady in Miami, hello

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.080]
Hi, how are you doing?

[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:17.500]
Okay

[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.220]
Good, happy holidays to you

[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.920]
And back to you

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.640]
I love your show

[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.440]
Thank you

[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.560]
I'm curious to know why men feel that football is so important

[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.620]
Because they have very tiny penises most of them

[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.740]
No, seriously, that's the truth

[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.520]
Yeah, it's not because the guys are in tights and have tight butts and they run around and feel

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.400]
Well that's a part of it I was going to get to that

[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.700]
I think that's why women watch football

[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.440]
They have very tiny penises also

[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.080]
I don't think we have any

[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.900]
You never know

[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.760]
I know you never know

[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.840]
You never checked out Ann Bishop

[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.800]
Oh, that's bad

[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.040]
That is bad, that was bad

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.500]
That's rank

[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.300]
Now tell me, what do I have to do to make you part with a Frank Sinatra CD?

[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.140]
I don't have any

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.080]
You don't have any

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.680]
Who said I had a Frank Sinatra?

[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.160]
I said I have the sampler that's got one Frank Sinatra cut on it

[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.000]
Hey, that's not bad

[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.720]
Oh, well, okay

[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.980]
Can I have that one?

[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.840]
And it's Frank Sinatra with Cindy Lauper

[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.020]
Oh, I don't know

[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.940]
I don't know about Cindy Lauper

[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.760]
Well, you have to just listen to one channel

[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.220]
It's almost as bad as Paul McCartney

[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.000]
Not quite

[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.860]
And Tom Petty and the heartbreakers and the carpenters and herby Lauper

[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.760]
It's got a bunch of different dread on it

[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.640]
Oh, there you go, I like

[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.660]
The price is right

[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.560]
It's free

[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.140]
Me right

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.780]
There you go

[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.620]
Well, hang on

[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.000]
Thank you

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.120]
Oh, she was very meek

[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.100]
You notice that toward the end?

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.780]
Like, oh, I'm not going to talk myself out of this

[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.400]
Line one, take care of that very fine young lady there, okay?

[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.420]
Toward you, we got some fine women in this audience, man

[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.960]
Everything is just fine

[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.180]
Don't forget that vaguistrip

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.780]
I want those phones ringing off the hook from now till the end of the year

[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.000]
Because we're going to Vegas, come Heller, Highwater, April 18th through the 21st

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.760]
Leaving on the 18th and 9th, 30th and morning from either for Lauderdale or Miami, your choice

[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.860]
There'll be two separate flights

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.260]
We stop in Dallas, then we pick up the same plane in Dallas on the way to Vegas

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.960]
We get there one in the afternoon on Thursday, which means we got almost a whole day on Thursday

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.800]
All day Friday, all day Saturday

[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.060]
Come back on Sunday, leave Vegas at one, get back home to Fort Lauderdale and Miami 10 in the PM

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.800]
Got it? Great

[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.600]
We're staying at the greatest place in Vegas, bar none, and I guarantee you that

[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.180]
There is no contest

[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.900]
The new tower in the MGM Grand

[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.180]
Three nights in Deluxe rooms

[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.260]
It's American Airlines commercial jumbo jets, no more of this charter crap

[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.360]
We're never going to do that again

[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.160]
599 bucks per person for double including tax baggage handling and a bunch of goodies we're throwing in

[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.240]
569 per person for triple, 552 per person for quad

[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.220]
And if you want to check it out call Rocky Ruttenberg again, you got to have 150 dollars down

[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:44.180]
Particate by December 31st and then you got two months to pay the balance by February 1st

[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.380]
There is that one month, well whatever the hell it is

[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:52.420]
Call Rocky and check it out today, get yourself signed on there, let's fill up, we got 200 seats booked on the two planes

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.940]

[00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.640]
In data-broward call 445-7740-445-7740

[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.680]
In Palm Beach, 989-8888

[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.160]
Statewide, it's 1-800-686-1161

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.600]
Rocky at Regal Travel

[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.020]
Is the person you want to talk to and a good time will be head by all come hell or high water

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.820]
I'm telling you if you've been to Vegas already I don't have to say a word unless you're a moron

[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.120]
And if you've never been there let me say a one more time you have no clue as to what life is all about

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.600]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:26.640]
Neil

[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.240]
Yes sir

[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.460]
Why are you so negative?

[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.860]
About what?

[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:30.780]
Generally

[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.240]
Why am I so honest? Is that what you can't deal with?

[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.220]
Well, that's the word you're looking for but you want to make it negative

[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.000]
Why do you listen to the show if I'm so negative?

[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.320]
No, because in the office one of my co-workers has it on and I have it

[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.420]
Of course, you know something I can't imagine being in a situation

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.400]
Where somebody else would be listening that I would be that interested or involved

[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.520]
Even if I was forced to have it in the background that I would wait on hold for a half hour or whatever you've been on hold

[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.400]
To talk to somebody and critique their show I don't get it

[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.120]
That speaks to how bored I am right now

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:07.980]
Evidently

[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.640]
The affection of another person I mean

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.180]
What does that mean?

[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.020]
Why are you writing a book? What do you care about what I'm in if you don't even like the show?

[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.840]
I want to help you on being more positive

[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.340]
I don't need your help at all

[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.580]
Neil, I'm a profession

[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.540]
Let me say it again

[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.440]
This is a radio show

[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.860]
I need your help like I need a luch and cup, you know what that means?

[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.680]
I'm sorry I'm not a Jewish faith

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.680]
Oh, and you're telling me you're in that profession you're like a psychiatrist or psychologist and you're some goi

[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680]
Who the hell are you?

[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.420]
You can see your credibility is right down the toilet already

[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.280]
Neil, speak with me

[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.160]
Nobody goes to a goi issue of psychiatry

[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.020]
Speak with me, don't talk to me, Neil

[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.980]
Speak to you about what?

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.040]
Oh, here we go with Lingo, let me help you right off the phone asshole

[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.720]
Let me help you, oh my god, how sad, how pathetic

[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.400]
This is your automatic callback service

[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.440]
Hmm

[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.760]
1231 at WIOD

[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.200]
Now you know if this is really in some orifice

[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.900]
That some secretary is going to pick up

[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.400]
Northwest aid

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.560]
Northwest aid

[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.000]
Northwest aid what?

[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.140]
Mental health center

[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.240]
Mental health center

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.960]
This is really Northwest aid mental health center?

[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.360]
Yes

[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.100]
We're on the year at WIOD radio

[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.000]
One of your people in there just called here

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.500]
I think he's in need of immediate counseling

[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.240]
Did they give you an extension number?

[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.240]
He said it was a coronal extension, I don't know what that means

[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.140]
No

[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.540]
I think he's looking for one

[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.340]
Okay, one second

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.120]
Okay

[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.120]

[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:08.980]
Sounds like there's gas in the phone line

[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:08.980]

[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:08.980]

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.660]
Sounds like there's gas in the phone line

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.160]
Sounds like there's gas in the phone line

[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.880]
Okay, don't inhale too much pal

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.680]
He's probably busy doing it right now in healing

[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.860]
We have an open line in day at 7519-463-751

[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.380]
When they start talking at Psycho Babbo Lingo man

[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.320]
Then you know what you're dealing with

[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.280]
Even Van Lingo Mungo never talked at Lingo

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.060]
1232 at WIOD

[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.800]
Here's Boka

[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:29.700]
Hello

[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.340]
Inel

[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:30.920]
Yes sir

[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.640]
How you doing?

[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.160]
Okay

[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.680]
Hey, I can't agree with you more about the blind cocks and the

[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.080]
And the boys at the dolphins

[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.880]
I moved here

[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.900]
The boys at the dolphins?

[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.160]
So dolphin boys, you know, whatever

[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.640]
Those guys, that football team

[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.220]
I moved here from San Francisco about four years ago

[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.720]
Yeah, that was a bad movement

[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.300]
But thank God they got a wonderful team, winner-lose

[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.760]
They don't spout this crap

[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.340]
Yeah

[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.280]
How'd you like the game that Jerry Rice had

[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.360]
If he watched the game last night for the 49ers

[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.900]
Who had a hang on by the skin of their teeth

[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.380]
And early blue of three touchdown lead

[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.500]
But still played a great game

[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.800]
How'd you like Jerry Rice?

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.860]
Okay, now there's a human being, there's a guy

[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.460]
He was a spit on anybody

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.820]
And he wasn't getting his ass kicked out of the game

[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.140]
And even though he has mouthed off like I said yesterday

[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.240]
The media when he got frustrated about that big mouth

[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.920]
Deon Sanders

[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.300]
And said we don't need Deon Sanders to win and guess what?

[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.960]
It turns out he was right, wasn't it?

[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.300]
It was and when they got...

[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.020]
And Dallas even with Deon Sanders is struggling

[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.580]
And it's cost him $35 million

[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.460]
A mighty expensive lesson for Jerry Jones to learn by the way

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:30.940]
That's right

[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.760]
And the 49ers have class

[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.840]
That's what they've got

[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.320]
And by the way speaking of very Sanders

[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.080]
Anybody who knows, I mean Deon Sanders

[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.980]
Anybody knows he just got cut by the Giants?

[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.680]
I just thought I would mention that

[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.960]
Just got cut by the baseball Giants

[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.100]
Oh, what a bad break

[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.040]
I'll tell you what

[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.160]
It's a pleasure talking to you and listening to you sir

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.080]
Well listen, I think we all need mental help don't you?

[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.860]
I'm moved here, there's proof of it

[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.940]
I'll make a group appointment

[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.500]
Have a great life pal

[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.740]
We have an open line on the green line

[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.320]
Do you have any warm loving relationships

[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.320]
With anybody tender and soft and sweet?

[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.740]
I got news for a pal

[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.600]
I've had more tender warm loving moments

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.200]
With somebody soft tender and sweet

[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.920]
Then you could ever begin to imagine, okay?

[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:08.620]
Sweetheart

[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.960]
Open line on the green line

[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.100]
1-800-944-9463

[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.140]
Oh, and speaking of soft tender and sweet

[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.140]
Where the hell's the young in a horny?

[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.660]
Thank you for reminding me Doc

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.940]
See, there's some good in everybody

[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.760]
There's a little good right on the inside

[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.680]
Oh, there's Cole

[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.100]
Cole's got that there's a guy that needs some help

[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.000]
He's always pissed off

[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.200]
He wanted to know why there's your answer

[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.320]
Look at it right there where that turned up knows that bitch

[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.240]

The Weather Channel knows

And that's why they called us

[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.500]
No fan-kink weather baves here

610 WIOD

[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.560]
Holy cow, Aaron's coming

[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.740]
We can't stand that solar

[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.560]
We can't stand that solar

[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.120]
Okay, we got it the first time

[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.420]
Take it, you know

[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.100]
Incredible

[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.240]
We need a leader who will get us back on track

[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.280]
Maybe it's time we had a president whose black

[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.140]
I've seen him on TV just up in his soul to close

[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.280]
Boy

[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.640]
I heard his running mate might just be James Earl Jones

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.620]
On the label

[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.700]
Yes

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.780]
Some folks used to close in my day

[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.080]
Say there ain't no way

[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.180]
But the times they changed

[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.080]
Those are next ones could be gay

[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.300]
Boys

[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.960]
A boy of those solar

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.580]
Pulling blinds, blacked out eyes

[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.580]
Twenty-two one at WIOD

[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.880]
Happy Tuesday on your neurotic station

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.180]
610 WIOD

[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.400]
We're needless to say we're all in need of very serious mental help

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.260]
And if I'm in need of help what does that make feel Henry?

[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.680]
Are you positive?

[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.700]
Here's Boka, hello

[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.260]
Hello Neil? Yes sir?

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.400]
Happy holidays

[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.460]
And back to you

[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.760]
Hey I shook your hand over there plantation

[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.720]
And I haven't washed it since

[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.020]
I'll bet you have on your hand

[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.980]
It was the best 60 bucks I've ever spent though

[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.040]
Great, all right

[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.260]
We had a great turnout

[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.300]
That was a big turnout

[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.360]
What all happened over there

[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.940]
I waited if there was a longer line at Disney World

[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.400]
You know what I mean?

[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.460]
The long line

[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.100]
Anyway, listen to the reason I'm calling

[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.780]
You know you talk about Brian Cox

[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.440]
And yesterday you referred to him as on sportsman like on professional

[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.920]
Inhumane a disgraceful jackass

[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.280]
Overgrown childlike asshole

[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.120]
Suck my dick

[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.540]
Yeah

[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.940]
Exactly now what I want you to explain is

[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.960]
Why is it that in hockey

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.480]
That when a fight breaks out in the middle of the action

[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.460]
And interrupts the game

[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.360]
Why is it so big? That's part of the game

[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.220]
It's part of the game

[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.700]
What's that? It's part of the game

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.540]
So why is hockey considered so more violent or just part of the game where

[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.580]
Nobody said it is a lie

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.340]
Nobody said it's more violent, it's just a man's game

[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.600]
It's a real man, even man has said that

[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]
Really? Right

[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.660]
Come on Neil, you can't go

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.260]
That's the only answer you can tell me

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.720]
I bet you're pardoned

[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.900]
That's the only answer you can tell me

[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.900]
I just got to tell you

[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.300]
It's not a man's game

[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.820]
What is it?

[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.460]
What is it?

[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.820]
What is it? A lady's game?

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.860]
You don't consider it unsportsman like an unprofessional one of hockey players does that in the middle of the game?

[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.520]
Does what?

[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.280]
They don't start fighting for no reason

[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.520]
They start fighting because it's a very fast pace

[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.100]
Do you want me to answer the question or not?

[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.040]
My good close personal friend that had such a good time on Saturday

[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.860]
But now wants to bust my balls

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.060]
No, I'm not busting

[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.620]
Why don't you let me answer the question

[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.380]
You might learn something

[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.860]
We have an open line in Broward

[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.840]
524 Jackass, 524 Coxa Hoist

[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.000]
And one on the green line

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.180]
See in hockey they're out there on the ice

[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.980]
They're skating faster and hell they got sticks

[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.240]
You see those big things they got those wooden things

[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.100]
They're called hockey sticks

[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.740]
And they hook each other in a hole and they grab and they trip

[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.740]
And they do some nasty stuff because that's the nature of the game

[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.660]
Now football, yes

[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.660]
It's a contact sport but the fact is

[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.720]
In football they line up, they run a play

[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.660]
It takes about 5 seconds and they go

[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.720]
You know, should they brush themselves off

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.400]
And they go back to the line of scrimmage

[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.600]
And they all hold hands and then the center bends down

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.380]
And a quarterback puts his hands under recess

[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.860]
One of the great things I ever saw

[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.980]
You know how they have those bloopers?

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.480]
One of the greatest sports bloopers I saw the other day

[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.560]
It was a college football team

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.080]
And a quarterback got rea... I guess he was under a lot of pressure

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.740]
The clock was running out, it gets real panicky

[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.920]
He runs up to the line of scrimmage

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.600]
And instead of going under the center

[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.560]
He's like one guy off

[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.180]
He goes up to the right guard and he puts his hands under recess

[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.880]
And the kid like reaches back and swats him away

[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.300]
Like get out of here, you get a little personal now

[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.760]
I'm the right guard

[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.760]
Not in fact that it smells like you were in a little bit

[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.660]
Right guard

[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.520]
He put his hands under the right guards

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:26.960]
As

[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.080]
And let me tell you, football is such a man's sport pal

[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.060]
How come it is when Bernie Kossar is a quarterback

[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.300]
Nobody wants to play center

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.820]
Okay, will you answer me that question?

[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.980]
Nobody wants Bernie's hands under their ass

[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.240]
When you answer that question, then I'll get back to you about hockey

[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.020]
Would you obviously know nothing about

[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.200]
In addition to which there are lots of fights in hockey

[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.220]
With lots of players, even some of the pushies out there

[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.100]
Any guys, once in a while I get into a fight

[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.260]
Because there's some nasty hostel hitting and checking

[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.860]
It's a real brutal sport

[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.660]
Football is a pansy sport

[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.020]
Just like even Defoe says

[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.740]
Of a bunch of men running around in silly tight pants

[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.940]
Grabbing each other's ass

[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.680]
That's football

[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.380]
It's a pansy sport

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.900]
So we don't expect guys running around spitting each other's face

[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.760]
And going out there and getting stupid penalties

[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.160]
And costing their teams the game

[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.300]
Have you got it?

[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.500]
In addition to which there are some of us

[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.020]
Who are real hockey fans like me

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.880]
Who aren't really fond of the hockey players

[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.600]
Who are the goons like Kenny Baumgart

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.060]
And you're on the Maple Leafs and Tide Dummy

[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.500]
Who get a lot of stupid penalties

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.340]
And occasionally cost our teams the game

[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.480]
But I'm not only using one to hear it

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.340]
Because you run some kind of a Jewish filibuster

[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.100]
Here's Miami on a Broward Line

[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.920]
Hello, how you doing today?

[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.060]
Okay sir, Neil

[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.900]
Let's go panthers tonight

[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.020]
All the way

[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.460]
Tonight, who are we playing tonight?

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.500]
Well, this week's gonna be my 14th game of this week

[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.560]
So, and I'm very excited for the panthers

[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.600]
And I want to say one thing

[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.460]
Can I call some people some Jewish guys please?

[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.240]
We have an open line in Broward

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.160]
5249-463-524-W-1

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.520]
They sure know how to get to me, don't they?

[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.220]
They sure know how to butter me up so they can come on here and say

[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.520]
Kill you to do it back

[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.840]
Yeah, they know how to do that, right?

[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.140]
Right, good luck to the panthers

[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.460]
Panthers aren't playing again till Thursday, okay sir

[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.180]
If you would have even been close

[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.580]
If you would have been within 24 hours even

[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.540]
Then I might have said, okay the guys you know nothing about it

[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.820]
It's going to his 14th game just this week

[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.800]
I got a game for you

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.580]
But you're probably playing it already

[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.660]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.100]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.040]
Okay, surely in hostile

[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.680]
Just the way they like me sir

[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.640]
First time

[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.700]
Hostile, miserable and nasty and unrelenting

[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.780]
I hear you, first time caller, long time listener

[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.180]
Great

[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.620]
I just wanted to ask you two questions

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.200]
You wanted to what?

[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.920]
Two questions, one is...

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.720]
You wanted to what?

[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:48.980]
Ask a question

[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.860]
Okay, okay

[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.760]
About the situation with Pat Riley coming back to New York

[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.140]
I have no interest in Pro Basketball, it's a goon sport

[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.280]
I understand but considering the way he left

[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.720]
It would be interesting, would they?

[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.060]
Well, it's kind of like when Denise Pothan goes up and broadcast the game in New York

[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.480]
And they boom out of the broadcast booth because they all hate him like boys

[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.840]
And I would say there's a similarity, yes

[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.620]
Yes, yes, okay, and the other day...

[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.600]
Although I'm not really sure about Pat Riley

[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.640]
And he may be the Mike Keenan of basketball

[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.300]
I'm not sure if he really is all that sharp

[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.520]
Or if he's just an asshole with a big mouth like Mike Keenan

[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.920]
I'm serious, the verdict is out

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.180]
They even hired more police

[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.480]
You know, they get a couple, they get a couple of major injuries on the team right away

[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.680]
They lose every day now, even though I don't follow up

[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.600]
But I do look at the scores, you got to be able to play above your injuries

[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.060]
You know what I'm saying? You can't go into mourning

[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.700]
Yep, you got to watch up for that mourning

[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.040]
Right

[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.920]
Okay, one more, more more question

[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.940]
That's what they call JT Snow in Anaheim, the Angel of the Morning

[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.800]
But anyway, go ahead

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.740]
I'm at home and I'm taking care of my parents

[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.640]
And unfortunately, both of them are pretty ill

[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.220]
My mother has Alzheimer's and my father...

[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.720]
He looks like he has it as well

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]
And he looks like he has it?

[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.840]
Well, I believe he has it

[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.860]
And I was wondering...

[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.060]
Well, how do you look like you have it?

[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.600]
He doesn't look like he has

[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.520]
You know, the beginning with the loss of memory and things like that

[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.440]
Well, I can't remember what the hell happened to you yesterday

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.320]
And I was wondering if there are any social workers out there

[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.580]
I need some help, I mean, I'm really stressed out

[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.260]
And if they would call and I just need some positive feedback on what to do

[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.160]
Because I really don't want to put them in a nursing home or anything like that

[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.920]
And I'm not really getting as much support as I would want to from my brothers

[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.020]
So...

[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.340]
Why not?

[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.920]
I don't know what...

[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.220]
What are they call us and indifferent?

[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.600]
Yeah, call us and indifferent

[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.060]
Everybody's married and has their family

[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.480]
I'm the only one who's home now and with my parents

[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.020]
I'm a matter of fact, I'm not working right now, so...

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.220]
Really?

[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.700]
I'm home and traveling

[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.420]
Sounds like you got the life of Raleigh over there

[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.800]
So what are we going to do for this guy, George?

[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.300]
You want to take his number and maybe that guy from that mental health place

[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.600]
Although I hope somebody more responsible than that calls you back

[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.880]
But, uh, yes, I hope so

[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.000]
George, you'll take your number and we'll try to get you some help

[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.660]
Definitely, I need it

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.260]
Good luck to you, Pa

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.320]
I appreciate that

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.140]
Line 5, take care of that guy

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.880]
See, you think you got troubles out there, huh?

[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.780]
You think you got problems because Brian Cox is an asshole

[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.180]
And you want to sit around and argue with some goofball on the radio

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.500]
That, well, he played a good game, he's a great player

[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.480]
Who cares?

[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.960]
Grow up already, will you?

[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.620]
Grow up, he played a good game

[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.160]
He never stole a freight train

[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.800]
You know something?

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.860]
I don't give a crap, how about that?

[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.520]
Huh? I don't give a crap if he did steal a freight train

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.560]
He's small potatoes

[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.740]
He's like Frankie Pentangely, man

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.880]
He's small potatoes

[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:38.820]
1248

[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.260]
And from what I hear in the locker room, that ain't all that small

[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.640]
That's what Mandit said

[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.520]
You check ass

[00:36:43.520 --> 00:37:00.860]
12 minutes till 1 at WIO, D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.080]
I'd hope we'll wear the crown!

[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.180]
It's my dear!

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.900]
There's no more you're hiding in this!

[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.940]
I'd hate you, mate!

[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.780]
Mike Tyson wanted a fight that would bring him the box!

[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.420]
That's right!

[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.740]
Chris' Diana just wanted to beat up a man!

[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.720]
Any man!

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.120]
I should punch you so hard!

[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.280]
You'll live a shallower!

[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:16.920]
Yes!

[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.920]
You're death-ick!

[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.300]
John King and the Queen present Tyson versus Diana!

[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.760]
Rod and instructor, mama, you share food around with a fox and instructor!

[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.380]
I told you the crown jewels!

[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.300]
I shall take your family jewels!

[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.240]
I hate no fair touch you, Mr. Marble!

[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.760]
Yes, malice in the palace!

[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.040]
Tyson and Dahango put her on her kein in fucking hands!

[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.280]
Friday night on pain-per-view!

[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.940]
It's killing me, I'll tell you that!

[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.460]
1252 at WIOD is we try to get mental help for me, for all of you, for everybody, for George,

[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.540]
who certainly definitely is in desperate need.

[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.720]
We have an open line in day at 7519-463-751-WIOD.

[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.440]
The reason I said that is just stop and think for a second over these last several years.

[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.080]
Just think of all the morons you've heard on the ear!

[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.760]
Just imagine the ones that never got on the ear that George talked to, okay?

[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.920]
Stop and think about that!

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.740]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.380]
First time call it.

[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:13.820]
All right.

[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:20.040]
I was listening to your news break that you had, and I just had something that's supposed

[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:25.540]
to make a comment about that guy that beat the death at two month old baby.

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.940]
Just beyond comprehension, how?

[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.520]
Yes it is.

[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.900]
I hear people calling you all the time talking about this and that.

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.120]
Why doesn't anyone ever talk to you about that?

[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.020]
Because they don't care.

[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.100]
They don't care.

[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.420]
That's outrageous.

[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.880]
They accept it.

[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.600]
See that to me, and I've said this for the last several years now, this to me is the

[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:52.420]
most unacceptable part of American people's behavior, is that they accept anything.

[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.380]
No matter what it is, they just say, oh well, this is horrible, but this is the way it

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.120]
is and what do we do now, what time is hard copy on?

[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.960]
That's the American public.

[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.020]
It's just, you know, I moved down to this day.

[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.640]
We're talking about a country that's got no collective values.

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.320]
We're talking about a country that's got no respect for human life.

[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:14.900]
Well, that's absolutely true, and you hear about it on the news every day, and it's just

[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.680]
a matter of fact.

[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.380]
You hear it, oh well, that's sad, and people go on and don't...

[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.840]
But if the media makes a big thing about it like Jimmy Rice, then all of a sudden the

[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.440]
public acts like the world is coming to an end because, oh my god, a little kid got

[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.320]
butchered up and killed and isn't that really terrible.

[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.460]
Right, I'm trying to try to try to try to call and talk to you the other day.

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.380]
You made the comment about that, about all those people getting their signatures, trying

[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.680]
to get the posters in the federal facilities.

[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.300]
That's going to make a big difference, man.

[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:52.500]
Do something worthwhile, like getting access to the FBI computer system that might be

[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.540]
able to help people find these people.

[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.440]
But what good does it do to stick a poster in a government facility?

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.880]
Well, the FBI doesn't have room for too many of these lost kid reports because they're

[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.740]
too busy with all those files they got on everybody's private sex life, you know.

[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.260]
So they don't have room for the good stuff.

[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.040]
Well, I appreciate you giving me the time to just divorce my opinion.

[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.760]
I just heard it, and I just couldn't believe it.

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.120]
I just, my wife and I just had our baby and it's three months old and I just couldn't

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.760]
comprehend it.

[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.340]
How about the guy in Kendall who just raped the 18 month old baby, his own?

[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.040]
Because he just wanted to experiment.

[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.340]
Is that what he said?

[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:27.760]
Yeah.

[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.020]
He wanted to experiment.

[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.880]
Experiment, unbelievable.

[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.180]
And, yeah, I think we got to experiment with him, like maybe a bullet through the brain

[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.940]
would give him like a real shocking sensation might wake him up.

[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.340]
Well, if we can find where the brain is.

[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.080]
It's just amazing.

[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.720]
And I live different places throughout the United States and Europe and Miami area or

[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.820]
the Fort Lauderdale and Miami area has got to be the armpit of the world.

[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.240]
The greatest barbarians in the history of the human race, this is where they wind up.

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.260]
If you're an asshole, move down here, you'll be right at home.

[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:00.760]
All right.

[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.560]
Thank you.

[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:01.960]
I'm here.

[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:02.780]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.260]
Bye-bye.

[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.400]
That's why I'm staying.

[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.660]
We have an open line at day 7519 463 751 W.I.O.D.

[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.200]
Our center one total is outstanding.

[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.980]
It's 90,059 bucks.

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.540]
We went over another big hurdle there.

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.940]
We got over the 90,000 mark.

[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.720]
You can call center one or order those CDs and cassettes and t-shirts at 5,6,1,0078.

[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.880]
Or you can stop into your borders, music and books and cafes, doors and crawl springs.

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.620]
I have a churra candle, a bokeh of Fort Lauderdale and then coconut grove in Mayfair.

[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.180]
And pick up the same.

[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.040]
Here's Mimey Shores on the Purple Line.

[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.340]
Hello.

[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:35.800]
Hey, man.

[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.300]
How's it going?

[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.020]
Oh, him in.

[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:37.980]
Hey, check this out.

[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:43.040]
Did you see this article that the Post Office put in the herald about what the Postal Workers

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.760]
love and hate?

[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.200]
No.

[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.340]
I don't read the herald.

[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.520]
Well, I don't hate any.

[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.260]
I just jumped out of me, but I hate the Post Office more.

[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.880]
In an effort to help Postal Workers, here are some of the things they love and hate about

[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.560]
the way we package and address our mail.

[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:56.400]
Yeah.

[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.200]
I'll take a few of them real quick.

[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.520]
They love it when we include the correct zip code.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.640]
When we stick with white envelopes, the machines have a tough time reading addresses on the green and red envelopes.

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:08.940]
So to use this card.

[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.520]
Keep that in mind, folks.

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.300]
Lots of red and green envelopes.

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.600]
They let me listen to this.

[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.680]
They love it when we put our mail or things like that.

[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.520]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:18.820]
Wait a minute.

[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.200]
Slow down.

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.620]
Okay.

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.160]
They let me know.

[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.340]
No, wait.

[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.480]
Correct me if I'm wrong.

[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:22.640]
Yeah.

[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.380]
But at holiday time, don't people send cards a lot of times in red and green envelopes.

[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:26.720]
Of course.

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.560]
That's the whole idea.

[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.160]
That's the whole point.

[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.200]
No, don't you ask, old.

[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:30.960]
Please don't do that.

[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:41.760]
They love it when we mail our things in a collection box or better yet, bring it to the nearest mail processing plant, leaving outgoing mail in your mailbox for the letter carrier can delay delivery.

[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.120]
This is actually what it says.

[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.860]
Why is that?

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.000]
I don't know.

[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.320]
Why do they call them letter carriers?

[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:48.920]
Got me.

[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.340]
I thought that was what they're supposed to do.

[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:50.920]
It's pick up the mail.

[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.680]
I had news for it.

[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.160]
Most of the mailmen I know they're carrying something more than letters.

[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.680]
And you don't want to get it.

[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.060]
Trust me.

[00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.520]
I'll give you a couple more.

[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.240]
This is what they hate.

[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.700]
They hate it when we scotch tape stamps to the envelope.

[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.840]
Taped chips up the machines.

[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:06.620]
Use glue.

[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.240]
If you don't have glue, they'll glue for you at the post office.

[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.740]
They hate it.

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.520]
In other words, I'm going to take my mail down.

[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:18.400]
If I have a stamp that's like, doesn't have a lot of muselage on the back, I'm going to take it my letter down to the post office there.

[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.060]
When you put some glue on the back of this.

[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.160]
And you got to wait in the line to do that.

[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]
And they also hate it.

[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.420]
I got an idea.

[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.560]
I got something different we can put on the back of the stamp.

[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.840]
That'll stick pretty good.

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.120]
Yeah, they hate it.

[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.540]
That'll be a real heavy duty way to make your stamp stick.

[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.940]
They hate it when we hide the return address on the back.

[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.060]
Keeping it on the front of the envelope helps ensure the letter gets back to the sender if there's a problem on the delivery yet.

[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.820]
Oh man.

[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.220]
Can you imagine having to flip that baby around in the envelope too?

[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.980]
I give me a break.

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.880]
32 cents to send a letter out and they got all these restrictions because...

[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.180]
I've got to get it over.

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:51.540]
Right.

[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.160]
Got you a bit.

[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160]
It's not like a bunch of excuses to me.

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.100]
Two more quick ones.

[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.340]
Yeah.

[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:01.420]
They hate it when we fail to read all the brochures and posters inside the post office and on the walls.

[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.100]
They give answers to most every mailing question you can come up with.

[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.560]
Read them first then get in line.

[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:07.940]
Right.

[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.520]
And lastly, they hate it when we clog up post office lines.

[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.760]
And if you want to get familiar with your mailman, just stand there in the post office.

[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.460]
Look at those wanted posters on the walls.

[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.300]
Some of those faces will start getting real familiar.

[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.020]
Right.

[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:30.520]
They hate it when we clog up post office lines with tasks that you can carry out at other places all over town, such as buying staff.

[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:30.960]
Oh.

[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.400]
Thank you very much.

[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.880]
Don't go to the counter to buy stamps.

[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.480]
Stick your money in those machines and let it get stuck in there, right?

[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.320]
Or even worse as change get those Susan B. Anthony dollars that nobody will take anywhere.

[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.360]
Get those for changing those stamp machines like we do in plantation.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.100]
Everybody's good with the Canadian pennies.

[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:46.340]
Right.

[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:46.780]
All right.

[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.600]
Hey, I'm out of here.

[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.420]
Have a great life.

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.120]
Okay.

[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.200]
See at the orifice.

[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.880]
We have an open line in the prong.

[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.060]
Whatever it is.

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.100]
Purple line, AT&T wireless pound Iodine.

[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.100]
We got one in Broward 5249463.

[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.660]
Have you noticed the difference today?

[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.840]
I got all those CDs and very, very few people.

[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:09.180]
For some reason, I get the feeling I could be wrong because I definitely do need some serious assistance in mental health, which I'll work on immediately after the show.

[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.900]
But in the meantime, you don't think that some of them are intimidated, do you?

[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.860]
God country and Iodine.

[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.240]
What is this?

[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.900]
Not necessarily in that order.

[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.060]
W-I-O-D, Miami Ford Lutterdale.

[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.220]
Use, talk, and entertainment radio.

[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.260]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.280]
You just hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments.

[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.720]
Like that one to two-hour.

[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.560]
There's no better way to celebrate the holidays that bring family and friends together to enjoy good food.

[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.820]
But over and delging at the dinner table can lead to unpleasant side effects like gas.

[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.760]
Excuse me.

[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.660]
Excuse me.

[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.380]
Oops, sorry.

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.600]
This holiday season, fresh and things up with new Swink-Dermits.

[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.920]
Swink-Dermits, the after-dinners' evositories, that make your farts smell minty fresh.

[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.640]
Hey, I just farted.

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.080]
And it smells great.

[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:57.760]
Thank you.

[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.640]
Could you do it again?

[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.620]
All right.

[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.140]
Ah.

[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.980]
This holiday season, fresh and your farts with Swink-Dermits.

[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.260]
Swink-Dermits, for an enus, your friends will want to get close to you.

[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.360]
That's right, when you fart, your friends will all say, it's a majaya.

[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:11.560]
Ah.

[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.200]
106 at W.O.D.

[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.380]
Look at those brow lines, huh?

[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.220]
Can that be a mistake?

[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.040]
Is that like an apparition or an apparition?

[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.740]
Five, two, four, nine, four, six, three.

[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.600]
They all went dark in brow art.

[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.780]
Real dark.

[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.960]
Even time magazine never saw nothing as dark.

[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.740]
Five, two, four, nine, four, six, three.

[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.280]
Here's, and then of course they want to get married.

[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.000]
Sheeran and Nick want to get married in jail.

[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.760]
We just had on there.

[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.800]
And the priest being another one of those great, loving, wonderful priest.

[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.960]
He says, I can't do it today.

[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.520]
Make an appointment with the warden, bitch.

[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.940]
And they turn to Ronan and says to Nick, and by the way, son, don't forget if I can assist you with your spiritual needs.

[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.320]
Father, oh, too, God.

[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.520]
Right, who are you, kiddin'?

[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:48.820]
Pervert.

[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.020]
Here's a lady in West Palm Beach.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.340]
Hello.

[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.220]
Hi.

[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:52.820]
How you doing?

[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.560]
I just wanted to call it because I love your show.

[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:56.220]
Of course.

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.180]
And I wanted to talk about the golden lab puppy that got killed.

[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.860]
The golden lab puppy that got killed?

[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.960]
Yeah, and the guy was put in jail for it.

[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.800]
Oh, is this the guy that bounced it off the sidewalk and beat it up with a bat or whatever?

[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.420]
Were they a thing?

[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.040]
Yeah.

[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:14.540]
Right.

[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.740]
I just think that is so bad and stuff.

[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.980]
I think how long is he getting in jail for?

[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.000]
He should be in the electric chair right now.

[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.540]
So killing a creature much more valuable than he is.

[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.140]
Yeah.

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.580]
I'm serious.

[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.040]
He should be dead.

[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.640]
I know.

[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:33.460]
Um.

[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.360]
Yeah.

[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.340]
Oh, aren't you going to ask him about Oprah?

[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.700]
Oh, I thought it was a talk show.

[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.980]
Like, like, talk shows, like Oprah's a talk show?

[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.360]
You thought what was a talk show?

[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.000]
This, like, you call it after that?

[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.120]
You just got through saying to me, you love my show.

[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:54.940]
I know, but I have to have to.

[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.180]
How can you love my show if you don't even know what it is?

[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.340]
Well, I was listening to it today.

[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.020]
Yeah.

[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.560]
And I like it.

[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.140]
And I like it.

[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.140]
And I like it.

[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:05.300]
Huh?

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.780]
What do you watch that bitch for?

[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.440]
I don't know.

[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.140]
You have ruined my life.

[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.320]
You just destroyed any faith I had in the human race has just vanished.

[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.420]
I like it.

[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:18.700]

[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.360]
I like it too.

[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:19.800]
What?

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.240]
I like Ricky Lake too.

[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.140]
Ricky Lake.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.620]
Yeah.

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.300]
What do you like about Ricky Lake?

[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:25.820]
Her fat?

[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.960]
Does that blubber turn you on?

[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:28.640]
No.

[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.280]
Those big mounds of oozing yellow fat inside of her pupick.

[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.360]
Does that do something for you?

[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:33.860]
No.

[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.760]
So in other words, you're one of these bimbos that sits around and watches these stupid talking head shows

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.720]
and watches all this contrive crap where people allegedly are screaming at each other and yelling

[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.880]
and getting into all this verbal made up abuses.

[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.700]
Is that what you like?

[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.340]
No.

[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.840]
Then what do you watch it for?

[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.140]
I don't know.

[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.120]
I don't know.

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:49.900]
I don't know.

[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.020]
Let me ask you something.

[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:51.560]
Are you married?

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.420]
No.

[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.260]
Are you planning on getting married?

[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:54.980]
No.

[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.100]
Oh, thank God.

[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.600]
You're not going to raise children are you?

[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.400]
I don't know.

[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.100]
You're not going to reproduce?

[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:02.700]
No.

[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:02.760]
No.

[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.500]
No.

[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.780]
Thank you very much.

[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.740]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.040]
1-800-9, see what I mean?

[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.140]
Force sterilization.

[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.920]
Trace that, call George immediately.

[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.700]
Get up there and like fix her, okay?

[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.400]
Fix it right now before it's too late, before it's broken.

[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.100]
Boy, oh boy, is that pathetic or what?

[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.060]
She called to ask me what was on Oprah tomorrow.

[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.120]
So I hung up and then I went back to the computer.

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.960]
Why would she ask you what's on Oprah?

[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:25.360]
I'll put her last.

[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.760]
Oh, well, of course, in order to find out she'd have to read it someplace, she can't read.

[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:30.620]
And?

[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.720]
I thought it was something you should have handled.

[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.600]
But she loves my show.

[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.700]
She doesn't know what it's all about.

[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:40.880]
She thought it was just a show where people called in and talk about subject matter like golden lab puppies.

[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.700]
You are America.

[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:45.920]
You are America.

[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:46.940]
You are America.

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.260]
You are America.

[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.420]
Sweetheart, you are Miss America.

[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.940]
You are definitive America, right?

[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.940]
You are what's wrong with this country.

[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.300]
Mindless babbling fool.

[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.600]
Who sits there and watches all this problem who's spoon fed, who knows nothing.

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.020]
Nothing, other than what comes spewing out at you over that tube.

[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.440]
Howard Beale was right.

[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:10.700]
Here's Miami.

[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.060]
Hello.

[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.780]
I don't know Neil.

[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:13.340]
I know.

[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:14.080]
Yeah.

[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.260]
What's wrong with her, man?

[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:15.760]
What's she smoke?

[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.860]
She's a dumb bitch.

[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.800]
Well, maybe that's it.

[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.020]
Maybe she's got the good stuff.

[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.920]
He's up in a little bit too much, huh?

[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:21.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.460]
Hey, man, you know, I'm sad.

[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.720]
You're sad about what?

[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.200]
I've been a dolphin fan for 24 years.

[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:27.840]
I'm changing.

[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:28.780]
Changing to what?

[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.000]
Why, because they lost the game?

[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:30.940]
I don't know.

[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.060]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:32.720]
It's a point.

[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.620]
I don't know.

[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.880]
It's a point, man.

[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.360]
Yeah.

[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:36.840]
They don't win a damn game.

[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.940]
Well, good luck to your good luck to your new team.

[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.880]
I hope they win every game.

[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.620]
We have an open line in day 7519-463.

[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.200]
Like I've said before, I didn't drop the dolphins because they win or lose games.

[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:48.640]
Okay.

[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.080]
I've made that very clear.

[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.420]
And people had dropped teams just because they don't win the game.

[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.600]
When you expect them to or hope that you're not a fan,

[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.840]
you're just another phony.

[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.000]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.860]
That seems to be, you know what?

[00:50:58.900 --> 00:50:59.820]
That's catching on it.

[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.000]
I am.

[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:01.780]
I am.

[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:01.780]

[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.720]
Love it after one at W-I-O-D.

[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.680]
That's the American answer to any question, baby.

[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.000]
I am.

[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.020]
What happened to that bitch in here?

[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.900]
Is that, uh, is that card still in here?

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.080]
I don't know.

[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.540]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.960]
This is what I want to happen in my bedroom.

[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.740]
I want that inflatable to float away in a real woman to take her place.

[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.580]
Passion foams, a BMT midnight on News Talk and Entertainment Radio.

[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.640]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.960]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.260]
I don't know.

[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800]
First, there was the club.

[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.640]
The anti-fept device that locks to the steering wheel of your car.

[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:39.980]
Then there was the cap.

[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.740]
The anti-fept device that prevents thieves from taking your airbags.

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.380]
Now there's the ultimate in state of the arc-theth protection.

[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.020]
Introducing the crap.

[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.280]
Two and a half pounds of steaming human excrement that plops neatly

[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.540]
to the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles.

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.560]
Properly installed, the crap detours even though it's determined thief.

[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.400]
Hey, nice car.

[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.060]
They left it door unlocked.

[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.020]
Let's take this for a little spin.

[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.020]
Oh my God, someone took a dump on the front seat.

[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.080]
That is disgusting.

[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.000]
I'm moving on to the next car.

[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.500]
One whiff of the crap.

[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.440]
And thieves will move on to another car that doesn't have a steaming pile

[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.880]
of human excrement on the front seat.

[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.140]
We guarantee it.

[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.660]
Order the crap for your car today.

[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.240]
And anyone who tries to steal your car will be in deep?

[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.620]
Well, you know.

[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.100]
They'll probably get steamed.

[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.640]
I guarantee you that when they open that door.

[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.160]
115 at W-I-O-D.

[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.300]
I know that's what happens to me when I show up at work every morning out back there.

[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.020]
I open the door and I get steamed fast.

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.920]
Here is a West Palm Beach.

[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:32.240]
Hello.

[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.360]
Hello.

[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:33.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:34.820]
Yeah.

[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.820]
In response to the guy that was on there a while ago from Pennsylvania somewhere

[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.200]
about the people down here not being able to read.

[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:42.860]
Yeah.

[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.800]
You know, he was talking about what was it?

[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.780]
Seven reporters covering a football game from one place.

[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:49.760]
Yeah.

[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.980]
Whatever it is.

[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.960]
You know, those people up there must be kind of dumb because it takes that many

[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.700]
reporters to cover a football game.

[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.460]
You know, we only need one down here.

[00:52:58.860 --> 00:52:59.440]
Yeah, sure.

[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.960]
So, you know, what's with these people from up north?

[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.340]
I don't know.

[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.400]
They must all be dumb, you know.

[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.420]
It must be all dumb.

[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.620]
It is.

[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.460]
You know, they talk so bad about Florida and being down here.

[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:09.800]
Yeah.

[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.000]
I-95 in the turn pack.

[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:12.920]
U.S.1.

[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:13.940]
It all runs north.

[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.300]
Yeah.

[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.440]
And so they can take...

[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:15.820]
And south.

[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:16.740]
Yeah.

[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.560]
Well, they can take...

[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.100]
You know, they can take back.

[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:18.680]
We'll look them down.

[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.080]
Take them back with them, you know.

[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:20.420]
Yep.

[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.120]
You know.

[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:22.960]
You know.

[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.440]
We got a nice place down here and we don't need them.

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.240]
Crap it it up.

[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:26.920]
Okay.

[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.240]
And response to him.

[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.120]
Signed or I'm letting you know, let him go back to Pennsylvania where it belonged.

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:34.580]
Okay.

[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.460]
Thank you.

[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:35.860]
Yeah.

[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.120]
Let him go back up the old Hershey Highway to Pennsylvania.

[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.920]
We have an open line on the green line, y'all.

[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.500]
And 1-800-Y'all come back.

[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.860]
1-800-Y'all ride.

[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.800]
Thank God we don't got no nose pickers down here.

[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.240]
They're all over there in Tampa, Temple Terrace and Loots, right?

[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:51.680]
They're not?

[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.120]
Here's Hellendale on the purple line.

[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.420]
Hello.

[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:55.520]
Neil.

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.240]
I'm here to defend and perhaps explain Brian Cox.

[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.140]
You're wasting your time, pal.

[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.180]
No, no, the statement.

[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.960]
You're wasting your time and my time.

[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.440]
Stop taunting the retard.

[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.600]
It's just...

[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.840]
We have an open line on the purple line, pound IOD, one on the green line, 1-800-Y'all.

[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.520]
4-400-Y'all, 4-600-Y'all.

[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.180]
1-800-Y'all, 4-400-Y'all.

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.640]
See this last guy that just called a moment before this guy was on immediately after to prove what you said.

[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:28.120]
We got more stupidity per square inch down here than you'll find almost anywhere in the world from here to Uranus.

[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:28.740]
So I'll tell you that.

[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.600]
Did he say from here to Uranus?

[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.600]
If your car's life is over...

[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.160]
Go see Bendover.

[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.960]
You'll realize what you had was painest when you hop in and ride your

[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:50.140]
reinest. Oh yeah, you've enjoyed driving Mercury. You loved your Saturn. Now come and dig your

[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:56.180]
reinest. Love that new car smell? Nothing smells like your reinest. Dependability? No one has

[00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:02.140]
ever got stuck in your reinest. Take the plunge, now be courageous, bend over and ride your

[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:07.220]
reinest. And if you like a car that holds the road, you couldn't wipe out your reinest

[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:14.300]
if you tried your reinest. Powerful, yet great with gas, need trunk space, rest assured you can

[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:19.160]
pack anything in your reinest. And if your reinest is rear-ended, our well-lover kidded joints

[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:24.960]
will soften the blow. Come to our showroom and pick out your reinest and leave that messy

[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:33.220]
paperwork to us. Check out your reinest. Take the dive line, Greg, blue, gain his bend over and ride your reinest.

[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.220]
I don't even want to hear about the negative stuff. Okay, one 18 at WIOD. That was that

[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.160]
shrink that call before right that said I was so negative. He don't even want to hear about

[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.140]
the negative stuff. Of course, somebody is holding a gun to his head right now and forcing

[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.480]
him to listen to the show for four hours every day. So it can't really be helping too many

[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.200]
of the people down here that need some serious help. No wonder we're not getting much accomplished

[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.100]
okay? Because this guy's being held at gunpoint, forced the list of the show and even call the show

[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:01.900]
and sit there on hold for 40 minutes every day. Speaking of needing help. Yes, that guy. Which

[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.560]
guy? The guy that needed help that I took his number. Yeah. Two very nice ladies with similar

[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.720]
situations or had gone through similar situations called up and took his number and they're going to

[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.460]
talk to him. All right. Thank God. See, see, there are people out there that think that this is nothing

[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.440]
more than a show for assholes. Okay? Well, let me just tell you right now the reason this show is on in this

[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:25.100]
market is because there are a preponderance of assholes in this town and that's why we perform a service.

[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.920]
But once in a while just by accident, just through a miracle, we just slip into a bucket of

[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.040]
stuff and we do something good for somebody like saving all these people's lives with the

[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:39.280]
Atkins diet for which I get zero and return not even a thank you for most of those people like

[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:46.200]
Mitch Lewis, like Mitch Lewis, who tells suds, oh, by the way, I lost 40 pounds in my life is

[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:53.300]
there's worth living now. Mitch Lewis, who don't know his puppet from his rectum exactly. How do you

[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:58.120]
like that? Saved his life. Not slanting, ladies, saved her life and after finally embarrassing her

[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:05.940]
to call after months of begging and pleading, she finally said, thank you. But that's okay. I can handle

[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:14.000]
that once in a great, great while just by osmosis, just through the accident of being alive, we do something

[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.860]
positive for somebody. Okay? Doctor. And by the way, anybody who would go to a goyish or

[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:28.360]
doctor, they need serious. I mean, there are probably some people go to an Italian doctor. Can

[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:34.480]
you imagine going to an Italian doctor who's probably overweight and needs your diet? Yeah, my

[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.500]
doctor's Italian. You got a problem with Italians, huh? You assholes. I've been a like

[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.780]
Italians. 121 at WIO D for

[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:58.800]
you better hide your high friend. The old man is on the

[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:15.900]
way. Come on.

[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.940]
God, if somebody just by some of those Victorments, he'd be a lot of fun at the party. I'll tell you that.

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.220]
Oh, well, sometimes there's like a little afterbirth or at the end of those and you don't want to step on it.

[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:35.460]
126 at WIO D. Happy holidays, man. There's that holiday feeling in here in this joint like just about everybody's

[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:40.140]
getting ready to bail out of here and maybe not come back. If you missed the beginning of the show, I have an

[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:46.180]
award-winning letter from Jack Ely at freehold raceway here that would make hair grow in Uranus. I'm telling you, it was

[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:51.520]
just unbelievable. Talk about there, licking all over you one day and then you look at him

[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.540]
cross that, although it was nothing new. I've been ripping him and asked for months ever since he started bugging me

[00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.420]
and calling the show. I've done everything but tell him, hey, you're a major asshole. Go away. In fact, I think I did

[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:05.860]
tell him and it's still didn't work. But evidently, I got to him, baby, because I got a letter here that I'm going to take

[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:14.780]
home and put in a frame. I'm framing it. Here's a lady mobile in West Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Hi, I just want to tell you that

[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:20.780]
anybody who thinks your show isn't good. They're wrong. You have a fantastic show. Yes, I do. And they listen to it in the

[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:26.160]
Bahamas. My son Philip Russell. He calls me to tell me things that you said in case I don't get you clearly over here.

[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:36.260]
Right. And the guys from Pennsylvania hit I-95 and head north. Don't come back, which is not for you down here.

[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.780]
We're too smart. That's right. Like that lady from Palm Beach to call before. Are they? I don't know lady.

[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:47.440]
Oh, okay. And now and to the Italians, the fat Italian doctor. Yes, get a magnifying glass and appear at

[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:54.260]
Please, find your penis and have a good day. Okay. Thank. Okay. Put her in the truck when that guy heads back to Hershey.

[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.860]
Oh my God. Are they something or else?

[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.920]
My doctor no longer happens to be so fat. And I got news for a sweet heart. I bet his penis is bigger than yours is, huh?

[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.600]
Marginally. She's knocking my doctor. I'm just making a little joke here and they're getting all

[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.820]
Surly. I'm the one that's so negative and hostile, right? My good psycho psycho babbling shrink friend over there at the Northwest Mental Health Center.

[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.140]
Boy, oh boy. We ought to be taking numbers. This man ought to be making house calls.

[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.240]
Of course, I understand he hangs around too long. He's real reluctant to say boy, boy.

[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.940]
Because those people are getting the caught nowadays. Here's Miami. Hello. Yo, yes, sir. What's up, man? I got a con. You made a comment earlier about

[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:50.180]
Marino going about football thing. Now you may come up Marino about he won every game single handed. No, I did not. I said he has won many games single

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:59.760]
Handedly. Yes, but how could you say that when you're easily because it happens to be a fact? Okay, okay. How many how many times has he pulled the

[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:06.160]
dolphins out in the last two minutes of a game with pinpoint passes marching the team downfield? In fact, that one game a couple of weeks ago,

[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.300]
when he even ran with his bad knee and bad ankle and is aching what?

[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:21.380]
Well, every 15 years, what is it run? He doesn't even run. That's my point. The man is a statue. He can't run because he's got bad knees. But the point I'm trying to make to you was even with the bad knees.

[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:29.460]
He ran for the first down in that game and kept the drive going and that often pulled it out. Thanks mostly to him. Well, are you correct? I mean, well, I'm saying,

[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:37.760]
but you don't want to give him credit. Is that what you're saying? He's a bad guy now or what? What's his problem? What I'm saying is that they give too much

[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:45.280]
credit to me and not enough credit to receive with that dive with a bar that takes a big let me tell you something. If I would like to have a hundred dollars in my pocket right now for every

[01:02:45.280 --> 01:03:05.840]
perfect pass he's drawn this year that was dropped, especially by Irving Friar. If you want to tell me, that's right. That's exactly right. What games are you watching? I've seen every game. What about it? What about it? What about it? I remember if you want to tell me the necessities with the one and losing the game. That's the reason we lost the game. He threw one. He threw one. So did Jim Kelly. Both both resulted in points.

[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:19.220]
I mean, how could he miss the guy? Couldn't feel like you thought it was tight? Yeah, and how about the interception? Jim Kelly through right to the guy too? Well, that's what I'm saying. Office can't capital. So in other words, he's not perfect. Is that what you're saying? How about the defense? That's the

[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:32.860]
defense that's been given up. He's overrated. Who would you like to have a quarterback? That's really we got super boring because of the marino and you know, you know, something is probably that great running game that probably is what's going to get us in the super

[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:43.280]
40 42 yards rushing 42 yards rushing Bernie Parmaley couldn't have gone through a through a piece of paper. Okay, what about what about Erwin spikes? We'll be able to play every

[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:50.980]
spike. He's too busy beating up his wife. Erwin spikes. Erwin spikes is the guy who was on an active. Let me say it again. Irving spikes.

[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:57.960]
He's too busy beaten up as white. No, that was not Terry Kirby. So you're absolutely wrong. Your full of crap. I was not Terry Kirby.

[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.520]
It was serving spikes. I'll bet you every dime in your pocket on it. Okay. And multiply times 100. It was serving spikes.

[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.960]
See, you don't know your crap. You just talk about your crap. I see it was it was Terry Kirby. Huh?

[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.840]
What was your inactive? Terry Kirby. Who was inactive?

[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.360]
I mean, Erwin.

[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.200]
Because they put him on the inactive list because he got in trouble with the police for pulling a guy.

[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.220]
They're under registered gunner because he had been beating up his wife and he's a piece of crap. That's why any other questions.

[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:30.200]
You better go learn your crap, Mr. You know, you're crap. You're get him in touch with a bridge tender.

[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:37.820]
You better learn your crap before you start opening up a big mouth. It was it was Terry Kirby beat up Irving spikes his wife.

[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:45.900]
Right. Right. No, it was Warren Moon. I think done it. It was Bobby Cox that done it. The dog done it. It was Brian Blades done it. How do you like that?

[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:53.040]
This business would knock in Dan Marino. See if Dan Marino were black. This guy be all over him like stink on stuff.

[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.300]
But it's the white guys on a team. They're the problem. I'm surprised you didn't bring up that stupid penalty.

[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:06.840]
They got who the hell's that number 93 George? Come on. They got that horrible off-sides penalty that kept that Buffalo drive alive.

[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.180]
That was the turning point in the game. How come nobody's pointing the finger at him? He's a white guy.

[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:19.640]
I can't think of his name and he's probably lucky that we can't. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes. Yes, sir. How are you? Okay.

[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:29.080]
This is Neil. Yes, I am. Okay. I just have one comment about the dolphins. Um, defense every since all pro line back with John offered off.

[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.660]
We tried to defense has been going down. That's right. And we give it up. They give it up 30 and 40.

[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.620]
Given up 30 and 40 points to girls teams like the warlands and the Patriots. They've been given up all these points.

[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:44.800]
In fact, most of those games they played during that stretch. The team against them. We got their high total of points for the whole season. Right.

[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:56.180]
I have a question. Yes, sir. Was Brian Cox. Did was there when offered off of there? No. Oh, that's probably why you asked. Well, I mean, he was, uh, because offered all like two years ago.

[01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:03.900]
I mean, offered all didn't really play. I mean, offered all the last couple of years. He was in. He was mostly out. Right. But when he played, he gave one hundred percent and more. Yes, he did.

[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.420]
He was also also we did not spit on the fans. He did not get in well, but a fist fight to get stupid penalties.

[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:17.040]
Yes, Brian Cox, I like that because they feel that they have to rely on him. But he learned sooner. When he's out of there. Yeah, which will be soon. Yes, sir.

[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:27.720]
So I'm going to show you show. Okay, pal. Thank you. See you. Open line in day 7519463. This whole. This whole dolphin business goes to show you. It's really fascinating.

[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:33.020]
First of all, I keep telling you so many of football game, but you don't want to understand because the some of you it's your whole life, which is very sad.

[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:42.760]
And number two, how many people in this town really watch those games objectively and see what's really happening very, very few.

[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:51.080]
Long before there was any feud with Shula, Brian Cox, anybody else in this radio station or yours truly or feel I'm here anybody else.

[01:06:51.900 --> 01:07:01.160]
Long before that, I was coming on here and be moaning the fact that I would spend all of that money for those 50 yard line seats and go out there and watch a growth test.

[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:14.140]
And embarrassing performance. No pass rush, which you'll notice again this year. There is no pass rush Marina was sacked three or four times by the bills Kelly was sacked how many times the big old none.

[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:23.340]
And most of the time Kelly could have stood back there and written a letter to grandma and then throw in the ball. And only for the fact that he's got that bad arm.

[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:33.800]
Many of the passes he came up short or he just threw poorly. But no pass rush, no pressure whatsoever none and no running game and they can't stop the run.

[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:44.120]
Those are the same three things I've been screaming about for the last five or six years has anything changed? No, no. Some of the faces, some of the names, they don't got Bobby Humphries no more.

[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:55.720]
They don't got Sammy Smith no more. Those two guys who were running where they run into ball or running drugs. They don't not got Cleveland boy Gary anymore because they're for closing on his house and on his ass. Not as uniform.

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:03.260]
It's the same old tired crap, including the coach, especially the coach. That's where it comes from.

[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:14.460]
But so long as there's ass kissers like Jimmy Cephalo and Jim Mandature round he'll love be here for a long time. Okay, as long as there people will uncover up the fact he's a daughtering old man who's lost it. He can't control these guys.

[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:29.660]
They can't make the personnel changes to solve the problems. It's the same same garbage every single year. No running game. They can't stop the runner. Secondary sucks by the way. We don't want to mention that about to well buckley and Jean Atkins.

[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:41.080]
And they can't run the ball. They cannot run the ball. They cannot run the ball. 42 yards of which 16 was by was by Keith buyers. And you notice a couple of plays there.

[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:47.720]
Late in the game when Keith buyers was like exploding making and they don't want to give them the ball. See he was doing a little bit too good. They'll make Bernie Parmilly look bad.

[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.240]
And Terry Kirby. So God forbid. Don't give Keith buyers the ball because he's really too good.

[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.720]
138 but hey what do I know because I'm only watching the same game you are 135 at W. I. O. D.

[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:11.360]
It is the action movie for Christmas in the tradition of films like Wild Bunch and the magnificent seven make up a movie's presence the wise three.

[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:21.900]
Arnold Schwarzenegger sliced a loan and Bruce Willis of a three wise men on a mission to the manger and they'll get there no matter what it takes.

[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.040]
I see the star now I make you see stars.

[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:33.360]
Not a stop action is the wise three make their way through the desert on the mission to end all.

[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.900]
Let's go we can't let the chef's get there first.

[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.540]
I'm a white man.

[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.880]
I'll bet 139 21 till 2 at W. I. O. D. the dumbing of America is nearly complete. Stay tuned standby. Here's dear field beach. Hello.

[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:27.200]
And you sir. Hey how you doing? Okay. Hey listen. I was out of town. I'm a bill span from Buffalo. I live down here. Self well congratulations sir. Nice job. Thanks. Well I was out of town till late last night and I was looking forward to getting all the all the reaction to the game this weekend on the radio. Yeah.

[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:40.080]
But I can't just from listening to you while I was holding I cannot see how anybody could say that this team that dolphins doesn't need a real a real house clean and start with the top. Right.

[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:55.020]
I mean. Marley Marley. V his out coach Don Shule and almost every game they've played head to head especially and of course when people look back and see that Miami has never ever in the history of the two franchises beaten the bills in December when it really counts.

[01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:09.100]
That has to tell you something. It does tell you some and the and even even Jeff Cross of the dolphins said after the game that he knew the Buffalo coaches couldn't believe how easy it was to keep running the same place over and over like that end around the kept running with Steve Tasker.

[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:16.360]
They just kept running it over and over again and almost every time it worked because the dolphins make no adjustments. They go out there like they got mental lock jaw.

[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:34.940]
Exactly and this now and you're saying this this from a coach Marley V who's been I've coached himself on a few big games in his tenure with you know I wouldn't I wouldn't say anybody thinks that he's the greatest field technician not the greatest but when he's up against Shule man it's no contest.

[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:43.420]
Exactly. What you got to tell you something about Shule right there right anyway well listen it's good listening to you I was wondering if you could do me a favor. Yes sir.

[01:11:43.420 --> 01:12:02.240]
I want to send my brother who lives up in Buffalo I'm I'm recording this and I want to send him that song you've been playing the last week or so about the you don't mean to foul mouth dolphins by any chance. Yes. Yes. How did I know have a great life pal that's a great way to play for me I sure will thank me if you say goodbye.

[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.020]
Alright. See you.

[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:38.840]
Just can't seem to be left alone in all of this is because they like saying.

[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:48.040]
Oh but they play football badly.

[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.380]
I love football.

[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.000]
The dolphins are cursing and man it's disgraceful

[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.720]
Cause Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.160]
Suck my ****, lick my ****, **** on you. Yes, they're saying

[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.120]
Suck my ****, lick my ****, mother ****, oh they're saying

[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.940]
Suck my ****, lick my ****, **** on you.

[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.900]
Suck my ****, lick my ****, **** on you.

[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.940]
Mother ****. And by the way, Brian, how's your mama?

[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.220]
143 at W.O.D.

[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.320]
Here's something positive going on tomorrow in the song,

[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.620]
Razz Nolas. Florida Panthers,

[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.260]
Mark Fitzpatrick and Rob Neeter-Marrow are going to be there

[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.480]
from 330 to 5 tomorrow afternoon.

[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.280]
And they invite you to bring an unwrapped toy to donate to toys for

[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.000]
tots in an exchange. You'll get an autograph from Mark Fitzpatrick or

[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.900]
Senator Rob Neeter-Marrow. It says or not both. Okay, I want to clarify

[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.160]
because if you're going to start bugging them both, Rob Neeter-Marrow's

[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.080]
spirit right in the post, okay? It's going to be a to

[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.020]
Sugglers Mills Mall tomorrow 330 to 5 and the autograph signing will

[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.340]
take place in the Blue Dolphins section of the mall. And speaking of

[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.740]
hockey tomorrow is a big hockey day for us. We got Jeff Remmer, the

[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.020]
voice of the Panthers on TV, which isn't saying much. But we got Don

[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.780]
Sherry, we got grapes from hockey night in Canada, from the Boston

[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.980]
Bruins, from the Rochester Amherst front, all that good stuff.

[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.840]
It'll be good. And we might even actually have like a whole

[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.160]
bunch of tickets to give away. Let's find out who's really on top

[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.800]
of stuff. Let's see who brings more freebies tomorrow. Jeff Moss

[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.720]
or Remmer, okay? The pressure is on. Let's see who really

[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.180]
comes through for me. Let's see who our real friend is, George.

[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.500]
Here's the North Miami. Hello. 93. Trace Arms front.

[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.200]
Trace Arms strong. Who with that great offside? Did you see that

[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.200]
place? You hit it right in the head. That was a turn down the turn.

[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.460]
Turning right into the game. It kept the drive alive with the

[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.340]
bills. Nobody even talks about that. And that guy went first down.

[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.320]
That's right. Only it wasn't even read cash and he still went

[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.200]
right down. He was in the other game. The Seattle game. He was first

[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.600]
down in the other game. Seattle. He was in the Seattle game. No.

[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.820]
No. Was it? No. What's what what what game was he was on that day?

[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.580]
He was in the Dallas game. Dallas giant. Dallas and giant.

[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.960]
What a shame that was. Man. Giant. Adam right where they wanted

[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.960]
him. And I just. You can just smell it coming. No. You just knew

[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.280]
that Dallas would wiggle off the hook. They were lucky. He's right.

[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.300]
Yep. And also I've been listening to past couple of days. Where

[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:37.220]
did these people come off? If they were redo. Wasn't around the

[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:42.060]
past 11 years. You know how media. Okay. Let me ask you the last

[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.400]
three years. How would you like to have had Bernie Kozar as the

[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.020]
starting quarterback. Join us wounded ducks. We wouldn't even be

[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.780]
500. That's right. I mean that guy. They would make the Jets look

[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.500]
like super bowl chance. That's what they would be somebody

[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.800]
possibly safe. But man is overrated. Doesn't that go to show you

[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.740]
what are on grateful bunch of bastards there in his town? Absolutely.

[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.560]
Absolutely. I mean with Shula at least you know you appreciate what

[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.900]
he did 20 years ago. But the fact is time is running by. But

[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.960]
Marino is still pulling games out of his ass. He goes out there.

[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.120]
He hurt the guy. He's got balls the size of elephant balls. And

[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.420]
this guy still gets knocked. Oh, it's all Danny's fault. Over

[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:21.100]
the overrated. Open your eyes people. Let's get somebody good like

[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.520]
Mark Ripett in there. Huh? And see if they ever win another game.

[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.680]
Nice talking to you. Good luck to his pal. See you. Yeah. And

[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.800]
again, the problem being that you're not dealing with knowledgeable sports

[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.600]
fans. Whether it's football they claim. Oh, this is football

[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.320]
country. Right. They don't know squat about football. They think

[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.180]
they do. But most of them don't. There may be a handful. Hockey

[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.180]
forget it. They know nothing. Nothing. The only thing they know is

[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.840]
John Fed Bees. Broke. That's that's the one name they know.

[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:58.340]
That's it. It's really sad. What do they know? What do they

[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.140]
know about besides snoring stuff for free? What do they know

[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.340]
about that they know well? And one thing that he's saying

[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:08.940]
well, well, it is Christmas. 147 at W. I. O. D. has your mailbox

[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.820]

worn out box from wall mount to curbside units. The beautiful mailbox

[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.940]

exactly from maintenance female boxes and cast aluminum fancy pedestal boxes

[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.040]

[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:28.800]
610 W I O D getting irritated yet. You my am a football fans are a bunch

[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:41.800]
of douche bags. Oh my god.

[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.000]
Oh my god.

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:13.000]
Oh my god.

[01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:21.530]
Oh now in the office there's a guy named Melvin. He pretends that I am

[01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:29.430]
a fibrous. You'll see how you ready we'll see. Whoa, man. Let's ring until the

[01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:41.710]
wife is at a town. We're on the

[01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:53.550]
high shade and join the parade. We're not talking about women.

[01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:10.530]
We're not talking about women.

[01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:22.470]
Oh, I got you there. Beautiful 153 at W I O D that's still number one

[01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:27.410]
with 82 bullets and foul mouthed offens is like number two just a half a bullet

[01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:32.490]
behind. Here's the mobile in pop it. Oh hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Okay.

[01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:38.310]
First off, panthers are God. Yeah. And I think if they go through to you. I'm telling you,

[01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:43.930]
I love hockey. When dancers first came here to Florida, everybody, you know, they, they, they gave

[01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:47.510]
support whether they were there or at home, you know, they, they did get the

[01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.870]
support not as much as they should have, but they did get support. And now they're

[01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:54.850]
number one. Yeah. The best in the league. No one's come close to them. Yeah.

[01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:59.430]
I think it wants to sell the team. I mean, this guy, this guy doesn't have enough money

[01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:03.610]
there. He needs to. He wants to listen to times their tough man. He only made $102

[01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:07.990]
million in the market in one day last week. I'm saying times are getting really hard.

[01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:12.630]
I mean, this is a team that's number one and knows that they have everybody in Florida

[01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.170]
looking out for them. Cause I mean, we've never really had a number one team in a long

[01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:20.910]
time. Everybody is looking out for them. I mean, everybody is looking out for them.

[01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:25.150]
Hey, I like those two or four or 5,000 empty seats that we have for most of our home

[01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:29.010]
games. We're all looking out for them. Hey, Neil, screw them. I'm talking about us. Yeah.

[01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:32.090]
I mean, you can't do nothing about the people that aren't going to come. What you can do is

[01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:37.210]
try to do everything you can do. Yeah. I give you a lot of respect for that. Now, quick switch.

[01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:41.310]
Yeah. I want to tell all the people that think that damn Marino isn't a good quarterback

[01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:45.030]
just because he doesn't have one good game. This guy's got almost every record that there

[01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:49.650]
is to be gotten and and and and what more do you want? You know what I'm saying? I mean, how

[01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:53.810]
are you going to blame one man for a whole team? Well, he threw an interception. Don't

[01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:57.570]
understand. He's supposed to be perfect. He threw one interception and that's the only

[01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:01.110]
thing they remember. Of course, they don't remember that trace Armstrong jumped off

[01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:04.430]
side and that turned the whole game around. They forget about that. They forget about

[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:08.430]
the fact that Buffalo ran for 208 yards in Thurmond Thomas most of it right through

[01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:12.390]
that great Miami defensive line. They forget all about that. Yeah, but the Marino throws

[01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:16.310]
one interception and right away he's a bum even though Kelly threw a major interception

[01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:19.990]
and they hit a major fumble and they give the dolphins 10 point gift, gift points at the

[01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:23.430]
beginning of the second half. Nobody remembers that either. That's right. Well, yeah, the 10

[01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:27.450]
give points is the only thing that even let that back into the game. Of course, but

[01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:31.210]
this is the dolphins. This is a team that gave Torell Buckley the game ball because he made one

[01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:34.790]
play. That's right. That's it. At the end of the game. And listen, you know, who's an

[01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:38.210]
important play, but how are you going to back everything up on one play at the end of the

[01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:41.750]
game that if they were to play different in the middle of the game, they wouldn't even

[01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:44.190]
add to give the game ball to him. And let me say one other thing about Keith

[01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:48.470]
Vires. I don't know if you remember that after Buffalo went ahead 20 to 13 and

[01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:52.150]
the Marino led that drive down field and Miami came back and tied it up. Do you remember

[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:56.830]
the great catch Marino led him to the outside and Keith Vires comes out of the back

[01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:01.490]
field and goes down and makes that unbelievable over the shoulder catch. That's right. That

[01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:05.630]
was probably the biggest play of that drive. Nobody remembers anything about Keith Vires.

[01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:10.250]
Of course, I don't remember the last drive. How damn Marino got intercepted. How defense

[01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:14.390]
couldn't stop. Well, these fans don't even deserve the dolphins because most of them

[01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:17.730]
don't even understand the game that they're watching. They know nothing. You know, I mean, listen,

[01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:22.930]
they're still hooked on the Buffalo Bill's been at a Super Bowl four times. So Miami

[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:26.370]
should at least go there five because we're better than them. But they get

[01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:30.210]
to understand just because they don't win one game. The whole city, the newspapers,

[01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:33.170]
everybody comes down on them. How does that make them look? You know, how does that

[01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:36.450]
make them feel when they come to practice? What everybody says? Well, the fact is they suck.

[01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:41.950]
They do suck. But they got a bunch of heartless bunch of crybabies. They got about

[01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.970]
a half a dozen guys out there that really put out and they got the rest of them

[01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:48.930]
are a bunch of crybabies, a bunch of spoiled assholes overpaid assholes. That's right.

[01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.770]
They're running from the papers. They use them as excuses. And listen, I like

[01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:57.590]
aggressive players, much as the next person. Yeah. For Brian Cox to punch somebody

[01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:03.130]
because he got past you. You you whip. You couldn't hold him down. I know. Look, I'm

[01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:06.830]
that Brian Cox. A couple of pounds. I thought he was a nice, no guy. Yeah. You know, you're

[01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:10.910]
going to go pull something stupid. I just because you can't maintain the play. You shouldn't

[01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:14.890]
be in themselves. No, he can't maintain his composure. That's a problem. And what are you

[01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:19.550]
getting so excited about? So much exactly. Here's Vokon, a purple line. Hello.

[01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:22.590]
Hey, I didn't want to talk about the dolphins or anything, but the other guy said

[01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:27.630]
Merino doesn't. It's all his fault. But I'm not a dolphin fan or anything. But if

[01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:33.210]
you put the Amorino on San Francisco or Dallas, I don't think they even lose again.

[01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:37.690]
Right. That's right. You know, that is unbelievable. And when another guy said, what are you

[01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:40.990]
talking about? Drop passes. The guy that got all bent out of shape. My God. Irving

[01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:45.730]
friars dropped so many passes right in his hands this year. It's unbelievable. I bet you

[01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.610]
even rock cuts. I never dropped so many balls right in his hands. Merino puts it right in

[01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:54.790]
between the numbers all the time. Exactly. He's not 100 percent all the time, but neither is

[01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:58.790]
Michael Jordan, but everybody's in sort can make mistakes. And of course, I noticed that none

[01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:02.510]
of the local fans were complaining about the fact that Steve Bono started the Kansas City

[01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:06.250]
Gameway. No business even playing that game for one down with the bad arm who couldn't

[01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:09.830]
throw the ball a foot. And though everybody was very happy about that and saying, oh, hi,

[01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:14.130]
we want a great game. We were great. What the hell were they? What game were they watching?

[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:17.450]
I would like to know what were they watching? What's going to happen on Merino or Tars?

[01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:20.730]
You're going to hear a pin drop in Joe Robbie. Yeah. Now let me ask you a question.

[01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:23.930]
Now Bernie's going to be out there. I'm telling you the wounded duck. It's in the mighty

[01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:29.550]
ducks and the wounded duck. It's in the thing is, it's too late. La world. He's person now.

[01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:34.090]
But if you looked at San Francisco, they picked up Mark Trustman who knows the Miami

[01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.510]
Dolphins and they picked up Pete Kyle who knows the Dolphins. Why couldn't the Dolphins

[01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:44.630]
have picked up these two young guys, bring new blood and teach fundamentals of ball

[01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:48.470]
to these guys? Well, you don't understand in Miami. It's against a lot of pickup young guys.

[01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:53.890]
In San Francisco, it's okay. Exactly. That's it. I get 32 o'clock. I want to let

[01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:57.750]
talk about a Corvette real quickly. Yeah. I'm very disappointed. I got my Corvette

[01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:01.010]
two years ago. What are you disappointed about? Because I want to trade it in.

[01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:05.830]
They only want to give me 21,000 on a vehicle worth 40 now. It lost so much on its value.

[01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:10.650]
I'm like, I'm in a position. He did get rid of it now or get rid of it next year when it

[01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:13.170]
really hurt. I never heard of such a thing. I got I'm getting I always get great

[01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:17.210]
trade in my vets. I don't know. I don't know. I better tell me well, it's only worth 21,000.

[01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:21.210]
I was like no chance. No chance. Unless it's a hunger crap. How many miles

[01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:26.250]
are on it? 20,000 miles. They told me because it's a six speed. It's the value. It's

[01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:31.770]
not. It's a six speed. Well, what can I tell you? I got a tropical. That I was

[01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:35.030]
going to see any marino and marooning. Oh, so in other words, you didn't go to

[01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:38.590]
tropical Chevrolet? No. Well, what's that? That was wrong with you, man. Well, I'll

[01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:41.730]
go there. Now I understand why you're getting the bum deal. Will you get over there

[01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:46.270]
and tell Jack Lee, boy, I told him either or else. Jack Lee, right? Jack Lee,

[01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:50.890]
Bo. Jack Lee, Bo. Tell him to either do it right or else. I'll do it after New Year's.

[01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:57.150]
Okay. Take care. Good luck. Oh, boy. No wonder. He went to that Moroni. So anyway,

[01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:01.350]
center one total is 90,000, 59 bucks. We thank your profusely area. But that's really

[01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.930]
helpful to sound. Of course, you're helping yourself out because you're getting some great

[01:27:03.930 --> 01:27:07.850]
stuff on there. Let me tell you, these are the best CDs this year. Even a Rick and

[01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:10.730]
Suds might be worth looking at. I'm not necessarily saying buying, but looking at

[01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:15.210]
and the best of Neil and the unplugged part two and the Phil Henry, which needless to say,

[01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:19.110]
the Phil Henry CD is selling out everywhere. They can't even keep it in stock. That's how great

[01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:23.530]
it is. So head for borders or just head for the border and have a great life. Still,

[01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:30.290]
the only radio station that doesn't suck WIOD. My name is Fort Lauderdale. Use talking

[01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:34.230]
entertainment radio. Six, ten, WIOD.
