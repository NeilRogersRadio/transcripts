there's brow art for you at probably coming from a david Ross's or office

[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.440]
here's hi alia hello hi Neil yes sir

[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.280]
what's my opinion to what you said at the top of the hour about

[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.200]
you're really ranting and raving yes well i have something to say about that

[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.880]
but i don't think you're gonna like what i'm gonna say yes sir okay

[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.700]
i think that i tend to be the type of listener that that you have a lot of

[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.560]
yes and we don't we're not the ones that call in

[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.300]
and i hear you asking for opinions and my thought was that you really don't

[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.600]
need our opinion so i mean it's like so wait wait wait let's slow down this is

[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.460]
interesting so in other words what you're saying is let's take the phone out from

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.260]
10 to 2 and i'll just hit her in ranting rave every day for four hours

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.300]
essentially the people that call in are the jerks and the ones that you make fun of

[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.720]
and that's what makes you so enjoyable i mean people like what i think people

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.600]
like me who have opinions i mean who cares i mean who cares what my opinion is

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.900]
like the sex bitch at night when she takes all these surveys what does she do

[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.920]
with the survey she throws in the garbage and gets a

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.940]
i'm not taking a survey i'm having a discussion

[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.480]
i'm having a discussion i'm asking i'm asking a question and people like

[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.420]
have an opinion sometimes it's something serious sometimes it's something

[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.160]
off the wall and in between that's it that's what i've been doing this for 20

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.240]
years and last 10 years i've been doing it not so serious and with no

[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.080]
guests but nevertheless i mean isn't it possible i mean is the mic

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.640]
tyson fight a real serious topic no at least it's something that happened it was a

[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.160]
major of it and i guarantee on talk shows all around the country they're discussing

[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.540]
it except in this town but you know what what i think is great about your show is the fact that

[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.200]
you just kind of get on in ranting rave and you kind of speak into my uh... you know you're you're

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.500]
you're the conscience of what i feel i mean sometimes i feel like but what are you saying for

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.140]
under one hand you're saying that you want to hear the show because i ranting rave and then the

[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.560]
other hand you say that the colors who are assholes are what you enjoy hearing on the show

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.360]
essentially i mean those are the ones that make it interesting the ones that are boring and have

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.400]
a guy that just called a punk the ten-year-old kid that calls in your your your your show sucks or

[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.220]
whatever that's that's an entertaining call but all k you want to be honest it's something like

[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.820]
that i'll set you off for at least two or three minutes no it didn't i did it send me off for

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.580]
like five seconds and i picked up your call well i don't respond to you suck like i said not

[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.160]
lately and that's the answer and so what what else is new well i did my feeling is you don't you

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.860]
don't need people like us to call the ones who just love you so listen then who do i need to call

[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.180]
just assholes right i think you could do the show so in other words basically what you're saying

[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.380]
is how to do screenless every day just have people calling one after another saying hey you saw

[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:33.360]
going uh first thing i think you need to phone it all you're crazy now you don't i'm going to come

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.840]
in here every day into a four-hour monologue that's essentially what you do no i do not come on in a

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.620]
whole hour with a crazy about ten minutes worth of calls get on in a whole hour right now it's your

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.760]
dreaming okay all right i've been on twenty-one minutes this our okay fifty uh tolla are you there

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.460]
yeah yeah fifteen minutes this hour after the news right yeah how much of a monologue did i do i

[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.660]
came on i played uh a bit or whatever i did i played a record because like it's a threat and then

[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:04.460]
i came on i've been taking calls ever since then true yeah i haven't read that look you got me

[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.020]
there but i i don't know i think the call you i think that you're overriding the calls or the

[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:14.780]
the contribution of the call i think they're overrated but i'm not asking for intellectual calls

[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.920]
because there aren't those kind of people in this town very many of them i'm just asking for somebody

[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.300]
alive that's all that's a start and besides most of the people agree with you like the cops like

[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.400]
their cops implantation i agree they shouldn't lose their their health coverage and their

[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.180]
and you know something you may have hidden i may just come in here and just uh pontificate most

[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.600]
of the four hours every day take an occasional smock okay and also put on a song or two from the

[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.980]
okay there you go okay see you i think this guy has his finger on him man

[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.680]
and i think a lot of you would like to have your finger on it too but he just he just left

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:56.160]
how about a thumb how about your index finger how about your forefinger your thumb and your index finger

[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.300]
okay i rest my case if that isn't the greatest record ever made i discovered that on Zeta when

[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.720]
i was doing a morning show on zeta i discovered i don't mean i discovered that you know what existed

[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.640]
i just discovered that in my opinion that the Alan process uh process uh prospect the Alan

[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.200]
Parsons project and i in your fly flying this guy could be the greatest i just i just i'm obsessed

[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.420]
with that so i just love it i could i could put that on tomorrow from ten until two just

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.460]
interrupt for the commercial break put it on a god damn endless loop that song is just uh it's haunting

[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.700]
i hate when they used that word haunting you know what song they used to describe a haunting it was

[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:42.800]
the police and uh every breath i you take i take we take haunting and see you don't like that record

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.460]
i love that so i love it i love it you don't like the police that's your problem because you're

[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:54.400]
a guy damn anti-semit you know like police oh man every breath you take that is such a grip but

[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:02.880]
it's not like uh not like this this is more haunting huh in fact when you go to the wax museum

[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.440]
you go to the haunted house thing this is what's playing in the background

[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.840]

[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.620]
of fight of course not everybody knew it was not gonna be but that's the point why do they spend

[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.860]
the money then exactly who would pay the money that that i don't feel sorry for any of those

[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.880]
people that was just crazy it's first fight out you know then i'm gonna put them up against anybody

[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.860]
that would be like if i said i got for you this big beautiful diamond ring for ten dollars and

[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.020]
you knew a printer was gonna be paced it was gonna be a pubic zirconia and you gave me ten bucks

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.840]
today's oh gee this ain't for real i had to check out when you knew you were gonna get ripped up

[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.220]
off up front yeah of course but i guess some people there are i don't know they're dreaming or

[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.780]
something yeah i'll forget about the stuff on there i don't know so maybe you can explain this to me

[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.200]
how is it they can tell me i can't put these little tiny earphones on and listen to a radio on my car

[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.600]
but i can have a freaking cell phone glued to my ear going 35 miles from my top

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:24.420]
absolutely right man those people are the worst i have seen the last few months i have seen so

[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.920]
many people getting close to wiped out by some asshole and if you're on the turnpike what they'll

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.520]
do is they'll get in the left hand lane the fast lane and they'll be going along all of us and

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.500]
they'll slow down like they're paying more attention who's maybe they're calm on those nine

[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.160]
seven six numbers you know they're speeding up and slowing down they're paying no attention to the

[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.120]
driving because they're embroiled in some guy then phone conversation outrageous yeah but so

[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.400]
you ever been to a restaurant you're sitting down the guy next to you he starts getting on his phone

[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.660]
he's making telephone calls getting called even even i go out to relax i don't go out to get off

[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.120]
even worse than that how do you like when you go to a ballgame a baseball or a hockey game and some

[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.340]
a hot shot all of a senior and all of a sudden this guy whips his uh asperatus out of his pocket and

[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.920]
he's sitting there at a ballgame yack it away on a phone like mr hot shot yeah i don't know i don't

[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.640]
like it i'm like and get away from things i don't like to bring my problems with me i don't know

[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.120]
what it is let's be more like you're a crack clapped in the unplugged they're like his kid right

[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.120]
out the window but anyway listen don't get discouraged with these people here they're a lot of

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.100]
ever recorded like i said when uh ture garcia died all these people uh oh the 60s the only

[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:53.800]
thing good about the 60s was the music okay that's the only thing good did i mention one other thing

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.720]
which i forget what it was now but whatever it was it wasn't that good but the music in the 60s

[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:50.920]
like these guys are out there like trying to get burned and shot and killed right so they can

[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.040]
to death and he was just doing it so we could collect disability and scam the uh city of plantation

[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.120]

Still doing your radio

[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:28.860]
Survey we're doing a survey but nobody's responding to it because you got to spell it out for me

[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.300]
Got to draw my diaphragm. I don't get it. Okay. Uh, keep the calls. I like it

[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:41.620]
Only speaking for myself of course, but I know it drives you up a wall sometimes, but it then are gaining itself

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.060]
I don't care how

[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.720]
Asking on a our it's just we need volume. We do not ask him for quite if I was asking for quality in his town

[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.900]
I need a shrink. I'm asking for quantity. I don't expect that they're gonna be good. They're gonna have something to say

[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.840]
Yeah, get out of the house once in a while. I realize how we started most of these people are just get with it

[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.220]
That's all right. Yeah

[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:08.100]
Newt Gingrich by report. Yeah, bokeh liberties up in my partner park. There is the at five

[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:15.120]

[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:20.640]
Time for a gigantic evacuation. Yeah. Yeah. Okay pal. Thanks. Have a great life. Bye

[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:32.780]
By the way, the this is very interesting because Jan and Dean had a record called sidewalk surfing and of course

[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:37.940]
Jan Berry was good buddies with Brian Wilson. They used to like sleep on separate sides of the bed for days at a time

[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.460]
together and so anyway

[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.200]
They stole the music from I mean, I guess he gave it to him

[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:50.280]
But I mean if you once upon a time I played them together on a year sidewalk surfing and catch away. It's the same song

[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:16.500]
I

[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:16.500]

[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:21.400]
Okay, you got that are you saying yeah, catch away that uh you're all up keep popping it back and forth all over the place was

[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.280]
Only got one CD deck sidewalk surfing Jan and Dean

[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.220]
You

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:52.060]
But that vice you got a lot of work on those record didn't they all those keep it or nuts in a vice so anyway

[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:59.300]
Guess who wrote sidewalk surfing Brian Wilson and somebody named Christian some good Christian wrote to that song and ripped it off from his original song

[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:05.140]
At a boy Brian. No, what are you stating bed with your teddy bear or a boar of a bear? He stayed in bed with teddy bear all the time

[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.380]
What that's when he was drinking and doing a lot of drugs and wouldn't come out of the house

[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:16.280]
He wasn't drinking and doing a lot of drugs now you're confusing them with Jerry Garcia again. Hello

[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.700]
Hello, yes, is that you? Did you notice how those two songs were exactly the same?

[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.080]
I don't know you don't know

[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.560]
Wait a minute

[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.620]
Yeah, yes something happened to me yesterday. Yeah, I tell

[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.840]
In the bedroom on my head

[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.880]
Dad take me to the hospital really 14

[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:58.200]

[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:06.140]
Okay, and I have to go to the doctor tomorrow for what to see is

[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:15.420]
It isn't infected. Oh, man. That's disgusting and I had to hire a nurse to stay with me. Oh, really? Yeah, how was she?

[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.220]

[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.000]
I know well. I want to keep you in stitches. Yeah, I am I know I am

[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.120]

Thank you. Hang in there. Yeah, okay. How do you like that?

[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.480]
Can you

[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:47.180]
You'll never guess what else is on see this is one of those real late after they were desperate and on welfare

[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.880]
And they had the accident they need the money this best of Jan and Dean. It's called surf city

[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.180]
Which is just a ripoff of all the uh beach boys

[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.320]
What

[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.440]
Well actually that would but Brian Wilson wrote that but that was their song he wrote he did a lot of stuff for Jan and Dean but they're still bankrupt

[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.560]
Here you go. Here's a little ripoff

[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.340]
Jan and Dean see a thing to be

[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:29.820]
Wait for you to do it. You got a touch it's a piece you won't need to get it for money

[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.480]
You're set it on

[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.540]
Can and Dings ding seeing songs that were hit by the beach boys all right

[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.740]
Let's go to Lake Worth. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great. Hey, uh, I wonder that guy brought up the

[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.020]
Casino up in Connecticut. Yeah, is anyone told you that they have a casino now and Windsor Ontario?

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.360]
Yes, they have and that's why the that's why Hazel Park is only racing five nights a week

[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.600]
And that's why their first structure is way down and that's why Kevin Wallace has to drive it Windsor on Sunday nights

[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.560]
To try to make up the money. He's losing that Hazel Park

[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.520]
But can you imagine

[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.960]
Windsor Ontario is straight laces they are they have a casino. Well, what do you mean by that?

[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.700]
They got all kinds of because they got the big one and wait a minute in Montreal

[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:30.280]
You kid me they got a big casino up there. They got them all over Canada. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know that but they do

[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.340]
But I know the people in on terror in Windsor are really you know, they're good people they're

[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.180]
they're

[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.660]
They're everyday people, but they're

[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:42.640]
You know, they have two murders in Windsor Ontario a year right

[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.920]
At once a knife and ones of baseball batters. Yeah, and not all its sons and crap. Well, they murder him gently up there

[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.700]
They feel right

[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.700]
and now I know

[01:04:53.480 --> 01:05:00.520]
Detroit and Michigan was looking at they had they were gonna have a commission check out whether they should have gambling casino

[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.860]
Well as usual see that's what happens when you wait too long somebody gets the gets the jump on you and your dead man

[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.880]
That's what happened. Yeah

[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.900]
One other thing I was growing up. Yeah, long time ago

[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.140]
My dad used to take my sister and I on Sunday nights the guy had his bar clothes and he let his

[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.500]
personal

[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.560]
Customers in and we used to watch a red wing games Sunday night. Yeah when there was able in Zian

[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.940]
At the Olympia right at the Olympia. Yeah, he only was playing right all him good guys

[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:29.840]
Alex Delvecchio

[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.360]
Alex Delvecchio yeah Marcel Pronevol right right and when you play them tapes

[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360]
Say and with the

[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:42.420]
Native announcer it just makes you all hair stand up on the back of my neck because I really used to love listening to people

[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.320]
Bill Hewitt. Yeah, oh, there's nobody like Bill Hewitt right really great

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.160]
And by the way, I mentioned that I had dinner with Brian Murray the other night and the Jeff Rimmer

[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.180]
And we were talking about Bill Hewitt evidently all these people give me these bogus stories

[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:59.960]
He's doing just fine. He's living on some farm up in the northern Ontario and his wife is alive and they're doing great

[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.540]
And whatever all these people keep talking like he's uh some kind of a recluse. We've got a drinking problem there full of crap

[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.140]
Yeah, Brian said that he's doing great. It's what Brian should

[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.860]
As we're Brian should he says Bill Hewitt is doing great. He's okay. It's good news, eh?

[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:14.720]
Yeah

[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.440]
Well, I don't wouldn't it be nice if they could have hockey like they used to though. Yeah hockey's good

[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.880]
But here rid of all these expansion teams except the apathas we need them but to give it to everybody else

[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.940]
Just like the baseball

[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.560]
It's watered down man. It's like life. It's all been watered down. Yeah, they

[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.820]
Used to watch him game zero to zero, but it was really good

[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.520]
You know, it was all good defense and got a plobbering on them

[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:41.360]
But anyway, yeah, see they say baseball is boring. It's not boring. It's just most of these guys who are playing a game today are boring

[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.960]
That's the problem. Oh man

[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.420]
I think of the money they make and I probably could have made a

[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.440]
Four five hundred thousand myself being a bad boy, you know, there you go. Yeah, okay, pal

[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.900]
Okay, thanks me. I'm a real life. Take care of my see you

[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.260]
What the hell happened to my bill you with stuff here? Jesus. I'm

[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:02.160]
Stolen and stalling cuz quite frankly last part of that call wasn't all that well any of it wasn't that it was okay

[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.160]
But uh, what's going on over here?

[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:10.300]
What the hell is going on with this thing man? You talk about people fiddler around

[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.940]
Probably that god damn Jeff the forest. He just poked his head in here for a second or two

[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.240]
He said well was an ice-freebie in Vegas again

[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.280]
I said man you got a rough life default and then he's telling me how much he likes Larry Letterman

[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.120]
Callin' Erases in Atlantic City Larry Letterman

[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.880]
I'd rather hear David Letterman call away than Larry Letterman who makes a mockery of our great sport

[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:34.980]
So anyway

[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.000]

Every Joe Hanson or any McDonald's try to relay it from a lonely

[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.120]
Pick that five-bottom born in sex

[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.340]
I'm a keckman

[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:09.560]
Here he goes. He's got me. Yard

[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.680]
I'm gonna look out of here. Yarder comes out

[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.680]
All the inside is in here and appears to take my sleeve one and nothing

[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.440]
She wants to sell my fine. Yep. Okay 142 at w-i-o-d

[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.500]
They don't come too much better than that. Let's go to Hollywood. Hello

[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.000]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing, sir? Great. This is Neil. I've been listening to you for years

[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.300]
Yeah, I appreciate what you're saying today. How discouraged you get frustrated aggravated

[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.340]
I think it's like it's just depressed

[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.820]
A cytolum roast, but okay absolutely. I understand yeah, let me tell you something

[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.460]
You know that a lot of us out there to listen to you

[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:52.580]
Unfortunately, we have a type of jobs. I only get to call if I get to call me one day a week because it's only the

[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.040]
I'm off

[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:59.040]
At work can't call it's a lot of it out there that are there we're concerned about what's going on like with the police officer

[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.860]
Yeah, things that are taking place there that gentleman that called earlier that said well

[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.000]
He's gonna get disability and it's in that

[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.920]
Neil would like you said the guy put his life on the line

[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.460]
Well wait a minute first of all when a guy says they all those other couple of guys that called sounded like sergeants

[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.660]
I mean at that point you just discard it anyway

[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.660]
What does a sergeant sound like that's the most stupid thing?

[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.380]
I mean, I know what dick sergeant sounded like but he's kind of dead now

[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.360]
But other than that what does a sergeant sound like I don't know Neil. I thought that was the most

[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.400]
He is the guy ever heard

[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.040]
Professional jackass you know, we're so desperate to find good cops

[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.960]
We got the Mark Furman's in the world. We got all these jackasses out there

[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.460]
We just want to harass people and we finally find some good cops who put their ass on the line and nearly get killed

[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.160]
And this guy starts doing his union busting crap. Absolutely. No, you know

[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.400]
Scourging and I know how you feel. You know the idiots out here. They make those kind of comments

[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.720]
Yeah, I'm not a police officer. I work in a restaurant business

[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.320]
Matter-facke I talked to you a long time ago from Boston market. Yeah, and I only get a call like once in a while

[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.440]
But when I heard that I was on my way home and I heard that I got I got really annoyed

[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.120]
And I can appreciate where you're coming from about the attitude and the intellect the people around here

[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.100]
It's incredible

[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:09.480]
But that comment really just got under my skin because these guys whatever they are aren't they're out there putting their life on the line

[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.980]
Yeah, and there's good and bad and everything okay in every field and you know

[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.740]
This guy put his life on the line to try to save two kids and addition to which I lived in plantation now for the last

[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.420]
I don't know seven eight nine years at least and believe me there aren't too many

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.040]
Poverty-stricken people the city of plantations got lots and lots of money

[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.280]
They got a big tax base that they can't take care of these guys then there's something really wrong somewhere

[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.460]
I know, they're when you consider all the money they spend on on crap. Yeah, you know a camera is on middle name

[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.700]
That's right. They spend more money on on crap and then they don't do something. It's really important like this

[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:45.560]
I'm I live in Hollywood, but I can't achieve. I will be in plantation. I will be there good for you because something needs to be done

[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.320]
Okay, pal Neil. Thanks for your time. Thank you. Bye. Bye. See you

[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:50.880]
Uh-oh

[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.560]
You're not allowed to do that

[01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.560]
Didn't you hear the lyrics there?

[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:05.700]
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life. No one of these got no one of them kept him in bed all the time locked up

[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.060]
See you weren't even paying any attention listen to the lyrics

[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.860]
Squirt squirt I rest my case

[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.740]
You never heard Jira Garcia sing any kind of crap like that. That was disgusting

[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.420]
Okay, let's go to a sunrise. Hello

[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.860]
Hello, who's swapping down the deck? Yes, sir

[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:32.280]
Hello, Neil. Yes, I am. Yeah, I just want to first of all agree with the last call. I'm going to be

[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.820]
Even though I live in sunrise and I'm below the age of 50. I'm going to be at the

[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.920]
Good tomorrow great, and I also would like to talk. It's not tomorrow. It's next Wednesday

[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:47.540]
Okay, yeah, I'll go over there by myself, but I like to thank you for the past 15 years

[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.400]
My wife has been trying to get me to go to Las Vegas. Yeah, and I kind of listening to you

[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:57.000]
I just got back and we stayed at the Luxor right and it was amazing

[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.200]
I've never been there before and you're right. You don't have to gamble to have a good time

[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.220]
How is it possible that the people in this state can be so stupid especially ones who have been out there and see now

[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.940]
Graded as how little crime how can walk the streets and they come back say oh, we don't want to have that here

[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.560]
How is it possible? I don't know in fact

[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:21.320]
That's all I kept saying I can't believe it was two o'clock in the morning. Yeah people addressed with all kinds of goals and diamonds and

[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:28.880]
Money won't go over the streets and nobody's even battening night. Yeah, I mean it was it was it was one experience

[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.240]
That was just fantastic and I really have to thank you for it because you know you keep speaking about how

[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.900]
Greater it is there and you really don't have to be a gambler to enjoy it. Yeah, you're right. I mean there was so many things going on

[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:40.560]
It's really

[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.180]
I

[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.400]
Over here, you know, you know, you would have had ten o'clock. They're all on the streets

[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.520]
Over there. It's it was just incredible. I don't really have to tell you about it

[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:56.480]
But for any of your listeners he's right. You do not you cannot believe what it's like to walk around three four o'clock in the morning with the streets full of people

[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.420]
Everybody minding their business. There is so much security around there the streets are so clean for the amount of people that are there

[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:09.140]
The Latinos outrageous. You could just stay in nothing and in the hotel for one day and just

[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:15.700]
Not taking all the sides from just the one hotel. I'm glad you enjoyed it pal. Well, thank you. Have a great day. You too. See you

[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.080]
Oi

[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.560]
I got you there

[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.320]
Squirt Squirt

[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:44.200]
I like that. That's the very original right there. I mean these are all original on this particular CD

[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.220]
But some of them they've poskyed around when they did little fine tuning a little reach channeling

[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.520]
I give me the original okay

[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.140]
Don't try to butcher them up so much when you do these best of collections and you spend 14 or 15 or 12 bucks for a CD

[01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:00.960]
Don't go dittling around okay. Don't go dickin with my music and just leave it the way it was

[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.200]
The ruling stones and something else we played but anyway, we're gonna play them right together

[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.320]
We're gonna play sidewalk surfing by Jan and Dean and

[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:16.680]
Can't you wait by the beach boys? Okay, and a count of when I say one. Okay. Got it ready got your finger on in there three two one

[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.280]
Okay cut it see we're too slow

[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.780]
You're too slow man. I hit it when you said this thing has got a hang time

[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:41.840]
So I should wait I'll wait I'll wait a pause okay three two one

[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.600]
You

[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:55.060]
I can't take it. I can't stand it. Jan and Dean kill him. Too bad about that crash. Here's

[01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:00.580]
a parkland. Hello. Yeah. How was that? Yeah. It was something else. That was pretty close.

[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.880]
Already done to my life. Pretty close. Yeah. I would say. Listen, I would have called

[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.420]
sooner, but I'm on vacation and then the beat on vacation. I'm painting my house. So I've

[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.860]
been listening to you guys about the 630 this morning. Yeah. I'm probably getting to

[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.920]
before the rain care. What I want to say was this guy from Carl Springs when he

[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:24.340]
called up and he had our tamarind stand up. I think what he was trying to tell you. I mean,

[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:31.660]
am I in my eye is that you can sit down and talk about things like I heard you're

[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:37.160]
talking about spoken secures earlier. Yeah. What you're about to. Now to you, you're

[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:42.420]
just being yourself. You're just saying something to my mind. But to me, it was funny.

[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.600]
The way you say it. Yeah. But you can't appreciate it because it's coming from you. I appreciate it.

[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.820]
Well, I'm good. I appreciate this end of the show tremendously. I'm not laying down. I'm

[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:56.180]
lying to the job. I'm fantastic. You don't think about it. Okay. I got more weight in one

[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.900]
in one people in my ass. I got more brains and more weight in there than most of these people

[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:04.240]
put together. Believe me. That's a good mistake about it. And I know it. Okay. So what he

[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.300]
he say is that you really don't need those calls. Yeah. Of course. And then I can see your

[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.820]
point of view to it. You don't want to do all the stuff talk, you know, talk for four

[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:18.240]
hours straight. Of course not. Well, I don't blame you. So anyhow, I mean, then you feel

[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.540]
like you're talking to yourself. Of course. I come in here anyway. Every day. I feel like

[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:26.500]
I'm talking to myself. So what's the difference? It's a good point. Yeah. Okay. But like,

[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:32.100]
you know, with me, I was the only time that I can actually call you up is one of my vacation

[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:37.160]
or not working. You know, you just gave me a great idea. You know, I think tomorrow I'm

[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.640]
going to come in at least in the first hour. I'm going to talk to myself. In other words,

[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.160]
I'm going to do. No, listen, I'm going to do both sides of the conversation. I'm not going

[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.780]
to do it like some fake voice. Like I don't want to mention any other names. I don't,

[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.440]
because I don't do that. And I don't rip off other people's routines. But I'm just going

[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.780]
to talk to myself both sides of conversation. You follow? I think it could be pretty

[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:00.240]
god damn good. And it might just set me a whole new format. I got you to thank for it.

[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:06.160]
Well, I'm going to have, yes. One question though. You know, you're always I, I reckon

[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.220]
so that I think it's great. Because you really have to the show. Yes, they have ever been

[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:14.880]
on your show. Oh no, God forbid. I think I want to know when Rick comes out of show man,

[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.300]
people start impaling themselves. I don't know what it is, but there's just something

[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.960]
about him. Now, plus when you get up that, at that hour in the morning at four o'clock

[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.540]
at the morning to come into a show, you don't want to stick around a minute longer

[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.120]
than you got to. You know what I'm saying? Well, that's true. I'll keep him off here.

[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.540]
Well, I'll keep him off here. I'll take care of him. Have a great day. You too, bye.

[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.280]
I'm going to say it again when Dennis Wilson drowned. There was so much of a greater tragedy

[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.180]
than when Jerry will Jerry Garcia Jerry Wilson Garcia died. I mean, not even a contest.

[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:05.620]
Like this. Did the Grateful Dead ever give America a song like this? That every man, woman

[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:10.800]
and child can sing on the tip of their own thing. My god, it just makes your breathless

[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.600]
and makes you want to live on your upstate.

[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.300]
Dennis, Dennis Wilson.

[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.360]
Yeah, there's sure no Grateful Dead. I'll tell you that. I mean, you know, we can like

[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.620]
different things. I've said that before. We don't all have to like a vanilla ice cream

[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:56.340]
or Jerry Garcia or any other boring stuff like that. But it's just, it just fries my ass

[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:59.260]
that there are people who are, and of course most of them are fried, which is why they

[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:15.060]
like that crap in the first place. See, immediately you say the beach boys, there are

[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.380]
like 6,000 different song titles that rule, you know, in the mentally, the melody runs

[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:29.240]
to your brain. Instant recognition. You say the Grateful Dead is, what do you got? What

[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.380]
is that? Here's Hialia. Hello. I definitely agree with you about the Grateful Dead. It's

[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:38.420]
just a goulash of, I don't know what goulash is a good word for it. Goulash in the goulog.

[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.800]
But I hate to say this to you, but Jan and Dean came out before the beach boys. Yeah, but

[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.540]
you don't understand. Brian Wilson wrote the song. Oh, he did. Brian Wilson wrote the songs

[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.840]
for Jan and Dean. Right. I didn't know that. Yeah, there were good buddies. Jan, very

[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:58.500]
in the Brian Wilson. That's trivia. I did not know. There you go. I mean, Hialia, I'm a

[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.440]
happy. What does that mean? I don't know. I don't know whatever happened to the English

[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.300]
language. I know a typical lecher. How long have you lived there? Well, I've been living

[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.580]
here for 14 years. I own property. And you're just discovering this. There you go.

[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:17.860]
There you go. He's no. Yeah. I go everywhere. And that's what I hear. H is the papel.

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.980]
And I'm totally hope is a dupe. Oh my God. George is getting a sour look on his

[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.020]
post because he figures you're starting to rip Holyos again. It will be a god turn. The

[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.480]
whole of the whole of him is starting to rise. That's the only thing that's right. Oh,

[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.440]
my God. I think we should just have the multiple one time. I'll let him hear Rick and

[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.260]
such 24 hours a day. Okay. They're on their way right now. Have a great day. Let me go.

[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.700]
I still away. Go. Okay. He's just kidding around. What else wrong with you, George? And

[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.380]
one good thing. You know, I very rarely drive the Palm Middle. Once like on a way back

[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.620]
from the airport, from Miami International, that's generally one of the ways to go. And

[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.860]
you drive through highly on the Palm Middle now and you look around. All the signs are

[01:22:53.860 --> 01:23:00.660]
in English. And I think I'll be God damn. The signs are used to be not too many years

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.100]
ago. You drive on a Palm Middle anywhere by Halea. No speak of the English, baby. Everything

[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:09.680]
in Espanol. And now the signs are all in English. Yeah, but this guy seems surprised

[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:15.520]
by it. Oh, he's not surprised. He's just having just making just to have a little conversation.

[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:20.500]
He's slow. He's not slow. He's having a little conversation. No, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.540]
and he's having a real problem with that cheese aroma in Halea because the cheese in

[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:32.220]
the Spain falls mainly. Here's, they're gone on air W I O D. Neil. Yes, I worry about. Okay.

[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:36.160]
Just got back from the great white North last week. Yeah. And I guess who has the book?

[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:44.760]
Remember the big M Frank Mahavali is got what book? He's got the diet book. No way. I'm

[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.740]
sure I had a lot of the hovelets. He's on the Edgens diet. I had lunch with them on

[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:53.060]
the way. Number 27. Frank Mahavali. You got it. You got it. He's got Harrison Mahavali.

[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:56.820]
It's okay. Here we go. He did it. He did it just for the blood pressure. Neil. Yeah. Because

[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.720]
he had a blood pressure problem. How's he doing? He's doing great. He's just getting old and

[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.620]
getting slow. Yeah. I've seen him in some of those exhibitions. Yeah. He's a little

[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.540]
ponchy. He could use the Edgens. He would love to. He loved it because of the blood pressure.

[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.680]
And I told him about you and your blood pressure. Yeah. He said, damn, he says, I'm going

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.200]
to give it a try. Are you serious? Yeah. I just thought I mentioned that. I just got back.

[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.980]
All right. Neil Rogers saves Frank Mahavali's life. He's got. All right. Take care,

[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.040]
Frank. Thanks, Pally. That made my day. He heard the best programming consultant. All I could say
