[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.440]

Now the Neil Rogers show on news talk and entertainment radio 610 W IOD.

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.800]
Hey Neil, this is Randy West and as per our phone conversation I taught

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.540]
to Peter Northy of the day and he tells me your real name is Neil down and he's

[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.220]
still ain't interested.

[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880]
Sometimes I wake up early now turn on my radio.

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.260]
I can't believe what's on the air.

[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.480]
What was that? Who is he? Am I turned to IOD?

[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.020]
What that smell? In the sea some crap called we can't magazine.

[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.560]
I remember not too long ago some guy in day breadline.

[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.580]
He used to play dead or alive.

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120]
Then I think just my ear was the hose.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.540]
Got I made it for the shows.

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.920]
Compared to them though Larry just is cool.

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.560]
For two years or so it seems.

[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.420]
I'm so angry I could scream about a show.

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.620]
A real wet dream Jennifer Rant we can't magazine.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.140]
You hear these guys barely Sunday born.

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.380]
Go back to sleep yes you will.

[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.100]
Let's show good baby up you know her voice can do just that.

[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:55.240]
I'd be early rising Saturday turn around in the show don't take a break I'm gonna

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.380]
I want it down I'm gonna scream wet and wild we can magazine.

[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.620]
Is that enough dead air okay 109 at W.I.D.

[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.600]
How are you doing on this great Tuesday morning.

[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.400]
It's a beautiful day to be alive.

[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.760]
How about those panthers huh?

[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.600]
Uh oh bad news last night again we just can't play overtime.

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.700]
And that big sweet that everybody was raving about he sticks it in there he shoots it's

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.960]
in the net man he gets the third panther goal the only problem is so far I can't play

[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.040]
the defense he'll be all right he'll be great he's a world class player that's what they

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.020]
keep telling us but we just can't do it overtime wouldn't you think that a team that's

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.460]
so well known for clutching grab and playing all that defense would you think that they

[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.520]
could make it through five minutes and get the puck out of their own in three games in

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.480]
one week losing overtime and then how about that frog in air last night were you watching

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.040]

[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.040]
a pap you can and was on mm-hmm they are the most classless the most crude the most disgusting obnoxious

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.660]
people the not just the French Canadians the French in general they are just obnoxious in this guy

[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.140]
you know I mean to be honest with it there really wasn't much of a thing anyway I noticed that

[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.460]
the Hall of Famer and if Paul Kennedy keeps saying Hall of Famer anymore I'm gonna get a hitman

[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.680]
for him but anyway I noticed that Denise Poffen kept trying to make a deal there that

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.420]
Fossberg left the skates and it should have been a charging fellow he never even hit

[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.120]
lower I don't know what all happened maybe lower he crashed into the boards and he fell down

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.580]
like stunner maybe he was putting on an act which is more likely that's what rumors said there was

[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.740]
nothing that happened there hot man was more impressed with the guy with the fingers yeah he thought

[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.560]
he was and then he thought he was they thought they were going to commercial they thought they were

[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.980]
off the air he said oh he's still do they're gonna keep keep the shot on keep it on yeah nice

[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.340]

[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.240]
these people going it's free baby here we go again I made up my mind after I left here yesterday

[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.400]
because rick was telling me that yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of their show

[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.660]
so why should I have expected any different then I heard for yesterday afternoon even with Margaret

[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.980]
on a phone just pleading and excoriating and it just don't do any good because they're dead

[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.120]
but anyway here's thanks to my good close personal friend Jeff Moss at the Panthers

[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.380]
J.J. Kelly's charter bus presents the Panthers express to Tampa and that's a week from the Sunday

[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.980]
that's the Panthers and the lightning and you get a chance to get on that bus and go to Tampa

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.960]
what more could anybody want than that who wants to go to Vegas who wants to go to Europe who wants

[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.000]
to go to hell when you can go to Tampa and I understand by the way that the big concertops that

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.460]
they're involved in over there is the thing about the devil race even the American family association

[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.640]
our good close personal friends who think that all of us should burn in hell and we'll probably

[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.980]
meet them there anyway and they'll find out uh they're obsessed now with the god damn devil

[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.520]
and they're like fighting that as the new name of the baseball see only Tampa Bay only those

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.400]
those pickers over there could screw this thing up they've been screaming and crying oh we got

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.300]
screwed it was the white socks and then it was Seattle everybody was going to give them a

[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.340]
baseball team and it never happened and then we got the marlins and then they really got

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.840]
parked off of course they at least give them credit for wanting they knew was Wayne was an

[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.500]
asshole before we figured it out but nonetheless now they finally get a baseball team just at a time

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.560]
when there is no more major league baseball hey let's expand okay Phoenix and Tampa there's two

[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.120]
great towns you got a baseball team so I have no idea who comes up with these names where how does

[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.980]
that process work does the owner like sit down some day on an acid trip does he drop a couple of

[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.700]
sugar cubes and say okay let me come up with a name and come up with some asshole thing I would

[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.000]
assume I have no idea how that works but nonetheless they came up with two choices the devil

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.020]
raise or the man to raise both of which suck but I'm really praying now I don't know what the latest

[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.780]
is on it but I'm praying that they do stick with the devil raise because all the good born again

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.620]
Christians over there on the west coast are apoplective the devil oh my god it's the work of the devil

[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.300]
next we're gonna have six six six on every jockstrap they're gonna be looking at everybody's

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.540]
pants just to make sure it's been naughty and nice so they're like all worked up about that

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.760]
but anyway getting back to this Panthers expressed the Tampa April 2nd of Panthers in the

[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.840]
lightning 59 bucks per person for the trip for the bus and the tickets I assume right right the

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.420]
price includes round trip luxury bus transportation with restroom and vcr game ticket free soda is

[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:38.020]
available on the bus spaces limited minimum of 35 persons to go minimum of 35 packs is to go what

[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.020]
does that mean can you explain to me why they do everything in like short hand like I'm supposed

[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.640]
to understand this god jeff you're an idiot it leaves 9 a.m. in the morning from the deer field

[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.680]
bokehilton and then 9 30 in the morning from the shirt and design center lunch and rest up on

[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:58.640]
away 230 again I don't get that 230 in the afternoon arrives in the Tampa Bay Thunder dome 330 is

[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.320]
game time depart the Thunder dome 50 minutes after end of the game arrive home 11 in the PM so there's

[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.240]
a way to blow a whole day a week from Sunday and it's 59 bucks per person and doesn't say anything

[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.720]
about it on here where you are content which we don't really care because all we're reading this

[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.400]
for us because we got a couple to give away right we got two tickets which includes your bus trip

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.820]
and two tickets to the lightning Panther game a week from Sunday and free soda is on the bus can't

[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.520]
go wrong with that so that's good they might if you're really nice to them they might along the way

[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.960]
I don't know which route they're going to take but they might stop at seminal bingo or something like

[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.140]
that because they got all those Indians out there on the alligator rally so you probably have a

[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.760]
great time we'll give those away to somebody who asked just the right way that today between now

[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.160]
into soon or maybe not so soon we'll figure it out also speaking trips don't forget our vagus trip

[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.860]
I wonder how we're doing on that you think we might get some information and update on that one

[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.040]

brains have a great time call Bob Lincoln today get the honey junior okay 10 25 at W. I. D.

[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.660]
Now I just passed this long Bob Lincoln just called George said there's only 10 10 seats left it's

[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.860]
only the 21st of March there only 10 seats left on the first plane okay let me give you that

[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.220]
Vegas thing again we're going to get two planes the first one leaves at 6 30 in the evening so

[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.740]
4 1 1 2 1 half 11 get there to Vegas latest eight o'clock maybe earlier than that and the second one

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.180]
is for people who like work late or just they're slow getting their act together like people

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.840]
come to the ball games and that one's going to leave at 9 30 at night so there's only 10 seats left

[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.360]
on the first plane which means we have 150 people solid signed up for that one and if you want to

[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.420]
sign up if you want to get on at earlier plane you better go call them like now today or forget it

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.040]
and the second plane leaves at 9 30 which will be just as great just to get there what one 10 or

[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.180]
11 o'clock at night Vegas time so it should be great even though I don't have all those great

[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.880]
connections out there in Vegas like certain fat cow in town is God but at least we'll be

[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.440]
standing at a great place right in the middle of the strip and having the same beautiful time we

[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.020]
had last year without all the tourists to go along with it now what did Jeff Moss just tell you

[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.420]
about that on the are you going to give me the info because the thing I'm a little bit concerned

[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.460]
about it says minimum of 35 persons to go in other words they have to I assume what that means

[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.320]
is they got to get but is that right they have to get 35 people sign up in order for this thing to fly

[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.720]
okay because I don't want to give something away and then find out that Jeff Moss is yanking my

[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.940]
chain and the bus ain't going to go at all that would be like fraud on his part but not on our part

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.040]
because he says that happens he'll drive you up personally I'm not going oh he'll drive them up

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.620]
all I wouldn't wish that on this audience have to go up there and listen to him probably take his

[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:08.920]
brother along too so anyway here's the toll free number if you want to pay for it of course

[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.500]
I don't imagine too many people are going to call do they find out who we give it away to

[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.860]

[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.680]
conversation or was that your grade A material okay because it laid a big egg on this show

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:10.580]
to open lines they're both in brow art 5249 463 524 we have no interest in your hockey game

[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.940]
the record straight for the hero because most of the people don't read the sector record straight

[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.180]
column and I just noticed this today it was so important it says because of incorrect

[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.680]
information supplied by the South Miami middle community school some sections of Sunday's

[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.080]
neighbors reported that Harry Wayne Casey of Gacy and the Sunshine Band would be an

[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.820]
a talent show at the school on Wednesday Casey will not appear C.L.I.B C.L.E.B what is that George

[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:20.660]
what is C.E.L.I B E E E E E E E C.L.E.B C.L.I.B you don't know he don't know C.L.I.B we'd be doing

[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.820]
it and also do an editing error now here's an important thing I want you all to take very close

[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.940]
note of do do an editing error a story in Mondays Harold incorrectly said that Cuban rights activist

[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:36.460]
Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo joined his wife Gladys Gutiérrez Menoyo and her three children on a trip

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.460]
to Havana Sunday he remained behind in Miami so I don't know why they put that in in a

[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.340]
case maybe somebody wants to get him or something like that but don't do that that would be bad

[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.700]
that would be wrong wouldn't it it would be wrong also I got a facts here that evidently they

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.460]
left behind from Aaron show last night from a hermaphrodite whose name I will not read on

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.080]
here and I'm sure it's the thing is not for real anyway you probably went and took it out of her box

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.680]
I don't get anywhere near her box okay the last thing in the world that I would get close to is

[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:12.520]
Aaron's box you know what I'm saying if somebody waved a magic wand and made me a straight as an

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:20.120]
arrow the last thing I would come even close to under any circumstances would be that lovely bitches box I got

[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.920]
you down here's a lady mobile in pop and oh hello hi Neil yes man oh I'm going to get a phone call

[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.680]
from a friend who's going to tell me I've become a chronic really yeah yeah I just keep calling I don't

[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.780]
even know what what he's like talking about I want to ask for a hockey ticket what what are we talking

[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.000]
about yeah whatever you feel like talking about I'll talk about just so that I can get a chance to

[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.940]
see if you want to get my kid at birthday present at the end of the camp now let's go back

[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.940]
and review this again somebody called you yes another agenda you weren't even listening no no no I

[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.820]
know I just you weren't listening I know no I just turned it on and I'm listening when I said it

[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.960]
though where you were listening we have an open line and Broward 5249 I'm going to be relentless

[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.820]
in brutal more so than usual with these today after what you folks did to all of us yesterday

[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.580]
these Mondays man I'm taking off on Monday I'm going to go out and play golf with some important

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.660]
people on Mondays I'm not coming in this place I'll tell you that right now and I'll also tell you

[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.500]
for public record nobody I said it yesterday and evidently it didn't get through to the right

[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.480]
people nobody is messing with the material that is played on a year on his show unless it's

[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.600]
questionable in terms of FCC that's it that's the only area in which anybody else is going to

[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.300]
make any judgments about stuff that's played on this show between 10 and 2 period end of conversation

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.920]
that's it and if Larry Justice is too thin skinned to have fun poke at him if Aaron summers is too

[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.560]
goddamn thin skin I got you down like everybody else in his place does all the time that it's too bad

[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.440]
then they ought to find another line of endeavor okay it's just a goddamn radio show

[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.900]
but oh everybody is so sensitive now and everybody is uptight today I don't think everybody's

[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.280]
uptight I think just basically one guy's uptight one boy here's a lady mobil in four-later day

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.720]
all hello you know yes ma'am absolutely nobody to listen to on the radio at night not on any

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.900]
station you're not putting it yeah well that's your main claim to fame I think hey since Randy

[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:22.260]
laughed that's the end there's nobody at night yeah and WIID in my book obviously doesn't care

[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.640]
especially losing the women at night and we lost the women at night we don't have any women

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.360]
listening to the station we got like a minus six we owe six women the latest trend

[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.940]
well I don't care for you and if we could find six women and turn their radios on then we'd be

[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.960]
even we'd be it would be a washout well people I talk to like where's Randy now she's still up

[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.380]
and pounding she's still at JNO she's doing it I don't know what the deal is though I guess a

[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.240]
Buldell filled in for her last week I would assume that she was on vacation he's back this week

[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:57.040]
I would assume any chance of her ever coming back no why would she come back here she she told

[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:05.420]
them the stick it she high-tailed it on her she told them the stick it yeah well have a great day

[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.440]
yeah thank you see yeah we have an open line and day

[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:21.360]
open line and then oh we don't in Broward 5249 463 524 it's free we wanted where's the Panther

[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.340]
Patrol how come we're not getting some good conversation about that the Svensson that Magnus

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.840]
Svensson last night who scored he shoots he scores what a goal by Magnus but he can't play defense

[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.980]
yet because he's got to get familiar with the NHL and with how to spear guys in the gut like a good

[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.040]
sweet nor you know like all Sam you'll send those really good Swedes know how to do he's got to

[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.600]
get to lay at the land and play a little bit of defense but that guy that called before his right

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.520]
Fitsy did not play did not distinguish himself last night but nonetheless I mean when you're

[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.000]
in sudden that's over time and you've outplayed the great Quebec Nordique right on their home ice

[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.900]
you got the frogs booing and flipping the bird everybody in frustration and exasperation

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.620]
and then you just and I'm sitting there just don't blow it please don't blow it play oh they blew

[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:09.520]
it you know don't do it too late it's in the net very disconcerting and look at that we have

[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.040]
an open line in Broward I can't believe can you believe that that is truly frightening to me to a

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:21.980]
I just can't even I'm speechless 5249 463 by the way CNN showed their latest poll the question

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:30.280]
they asked is there is there a chance is there a chance that the charges against OJ might be true

[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.820]
that was the way they phrased the question is there a chance that they might be true okay 66

[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:44.900]
percent of the white people in the poll said yes they said yeah might be true 24% of the African

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:53.020]
American people who were pulled said yes that means 76% of the African American people who were

[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.940]
surveyed in this poll said there is no chance that he might be guilty killed the cold how do you

[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:03.260]
like that then they also asked did you think that detective Mark Ferman planted the bloody glove

[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.600]
okay did detective Ferman plant the bloody glove is it a setup 18% of the white

[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:20.100]
respondent said yes 58% of the black respondent said yes so thank God that this ain't turning into a

[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:26.620]
racial thing anyway I mean how is it possibly so blind of the truth I mean is it really that possible

[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.740]
to be that stupid to say that there is no chance that there's no chance that the charges might be

[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.460]
true they got his blood they got the a knife cut on his finger they got the most stupid

[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.380]
alibis the most ridiculous lacking credibility defense witnesses all of whom are laughing stock

[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.160]
he was sleeping he was taken a nap he was playing golf he was batting it around he was here he was

[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:56.740]
there he was out there on a highway in a bronca with $10,000 in a passport 76% of the African

[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.820]
American respondents in this poll said there is no chance that the charges might be true the

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:10.800]
turnage lose and the 34% of the white respondents who said there's no chance 20% of them go to

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.340]
plantation high they were in here that morning couple of weeks ago good group but very slow 1036

[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.660]
somebody on the purple line dropped off so if you want those hockey tickets we might give him away

[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.760]
to somebody on cellular one but I doubted pound IOD here's the mobile and pound beat hello

[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:48.280]
what's the deal yes sir oh pretty good game last night wait I thought we played a damn good game last

[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.840]
night for a team that's not too fast we look pretty fast last year we you know they finally

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.540]
decided to play some offense this past week and even though we keep blowing these games and

[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.380]
overtime we're scoring some goals Billy Lindsay starting to look pretty good oh they're sticking

[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:08.180]
to puck in the net I like this guy woolly Jason really is awesome he's playing great he had one

[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.820]
tremendous scoring chance I remember that he went right in on the rush there with the I forget

[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.160]
who was with and he had a tremendous shot a good scoring chance this team is starting to fall

[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.400]
in the shape now the only problem is they're losing all the games we're losing all the ties yeah

[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.940]
you know we're not pulling I mean you're like wins but you know even if you have a tie it just

[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.400]
we we can't even hang in there for a tie that's three points we flushed down the toilet this past

[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.320]
week three good games especially the game against the flyers in a game last night played really

[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.580]
outstanding and even Buffalo we outplayed him I thought two to one and I came we up play to

[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.320]
my back and we at three points down the toilet keep that in mind when it comes playoff time if we

[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.680]
miss out again like we did last year by one or two points into the playoffs that's right

[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.980]
if we would have had those ties yep I also wanted to talk to you about and how about those

[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:56.180]
conradiens man eight to four the flyers keep their eyes once again they beat him seven nothing

[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.400]
the time before that in Montreal and now they beat him eight to four as the La Clare and

[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.240]
Renberg and Lidros Lange goes crazy again not totally nuts yeah I wanted to talk about the

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.440]
senior citizen drivers about that accident over on the cause waiting the other night yes

[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.560]
and stuff and you know obviously teenagers are the number one but senior citizens are number two

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.900]
and since they only drive you know point four hours a week that puts them right up at the top

what are you smiling about George you said hey I said hey see a open line in day 751 WOD 1 and

[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:18.060]
Broward 5249 463 on a really neat Tuesday man this is the way we like to toy with the audience

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.040]
just to play with it speaking of that here's a facts that was left in here on the table that says

[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.080]
hello Aaron I am a hermaphrod now first of all it says I'm hermaphroditic am I pronouncing that

[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:38.160]
correctly I am a hermaphrod dieted dietie what is it I'm wearing some dides I'm hermaphroditic and

[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.440]
I like to have sex with myself quite frankly sometimes while I am in the process it gets stuck if

[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.160]
you know what I mean I know that this probably sounds like a joke but it is true and I don't know

[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.960]
where else to turn I'm too embarrassed to talk to any sexual therapists or doctors about the

[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.180]
situation no one knows except for my immediate family and my best friend I would be eternally

[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:05.840]
grateful if you would address this topic over the year between 10 and 11 p.m. tonight thank you so

[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.400]
very much I have no one else to turn to desperately yours and it is signed with the name but it

[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.660]
forget that ps I would call you myself but I am too embarrassed to actually speak to you a hermaphrodite

[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.420]
now what's the easiest advice you can give to him right go f yourself I guess would be it

[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.040]
I'll always have a little problem there so we're getting some people who are like bringing out

[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.220]
their deepest darkest they're slinging it out they're dragging it out and that's a really good

[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.160]
thing that's what we don't want to do is get their inner problems and work it out let's do boca

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.520]
hello well Neil yes hey how you doing today pretty good sir hey listen I got a good question for

[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.920]
I work at a gas station here yeah if the frogs can reproduce in space why can't they work the god damn

[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.620]
pumps very good point I don't know yeah I can't figure it out I still think space is the best

[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.760]
place for them to reproduce I think the space is the best place for anybody who watched that game

[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.320]
last night and saw the aberrant behavior of those frogs in Quebec all believe that guy who's my point

[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.520]
oh my god hey listen we were talking the other day about a pucks going straight through the net

[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:09.220]
I was watching the game it was either two or three days ago and sure enough the guys slapped a shot

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.760]
ripped right through the net right play kept going yeah whole nine jarg hey listen up what do you

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.720]
mean play kept going they kept playing you know because they didn't know if the puck had actually

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.220]
gone in what game was that I can't remember now I can't remember for the life of me and uh but

[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.220]
the play went on and went on and then after they uh you know because everybody knew what had

[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.620]
happened but they couldn't tell then they they pulled the clock back they gave them the goal and

[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.660]
they had a penalty after the play and the penalty stood also that the puck did that was the

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.180]
Pittsburgh game that was Pittsburgh and Ottawa that's right that's right puck didn't go through the net

[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.660]
yeah it did it to right through the net no it did not I saw the get watch the whole game well maybe

[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:51.860]
it was a different game that because the rep was tie in tie in the net after the after the play

[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:57.280]
oh I saw that too that was in uh that was in the Bruins New Jersey game I think I saw them tie in

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.860]
the uh back of the twine yeah I didn't I didn't see that goal if the no the Pittsburgh game that

[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:07.240]
that's another one that the uh there was about six and a half minutes left and Ottawa scored and

[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.020]
the red light never came on and the referee uh didn't call it a goal and they had a rep they had

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.500]
to redo the video replay like about three minutes later and sure enough the puck did cross over

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.720]
line and then reg it like yanked it back out of there but it was a goal and then they had to go

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.540]
back to the point where it was uh what's instead a three and a half minutes left it was back to six

[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.460]
and a half minutes left and Steven still got the penalty for Pittsburgh it's a lot of time Sunday oh

[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.580]
Saint Louis and Annaheim somebody called said that was the game the puck went through the net that

[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.820]
was it yeah hey listen to my last one I came forward to two but Saint Louis got beat by the

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.260]
Kings last night five three I thought I mentioned that for late score yes my girlfriend and I would

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.260]

[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.560]

[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.300]

[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.560]
song in a dance see if you had a pulled if you'd have been a good liar if you just said oh I think

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.940]
it was in the Ottawa but not with them in Ottawa it was in the Quebec somebody game but I was

[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.380]
watching the Pittsburgh Ottawa game you should have known that so I knew you're wrong immediately if

[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.420]
not sooner because Doug McCloud told me and why was Doug McCloud doing that game again on television

[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.040]
and Mike laying to an on radio but quite frankly Doug McCloud ain't that bad I don't want to say

[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.580]
that he's better than some announcers I can think of like Chris Moore but 1047 at W I O D

[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.680]
talking about how the crowds and the sporting events really are apathetic I was watching uh

[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:34.020]
the bulls game on Sunday with Michael Jordan's reappearance yeah we had like some gigantic a 30

[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:40.120]
five-year 36 year something like that it was like a sellout the the arena 16,000 something and

[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:46.160]
it was it did go into overtime and I was watching and they lost yeah well but as the camera went

[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.820]
down to the end uh people were just streaming out with two and three minutes left and it was a

[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:57.460]
tie ball game and this is like the big game of Michael Jordan coming back ridiculous also what does

[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.140]
that mean just you know people don't care that is it they want to get out of the park maybe

[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.560]
those people are all planning on moving to Florida that's what we do it here they want to get

[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.420]
out to the parking lot right and get down out of there I can't blame them for once to fight all

[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.400]
that stupid traffic anyway yeah but you get at least for a game like that you just at least

[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.880]
they can see how it ends I mean well that's sports fans in America they're losing interest fast they

[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.020]
realize that they've been had they've been ripped off and are just they're getting tired of it and uh

[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:26.080]
what we have up here in Palm Beach County of course is the uh the blaze who is a good team there

[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.660]
for a minor league or whatever they are they are a pretty good team and you know the Westbound

[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:35.180]
Motor Tourium what is it like four or five thousand seats they can't put two thousand in there

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.840]
all right when they're playing another you know Lakeland I think it's supposed to be another really

[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:45.480]
good team and uh we went a couple weeks ago and it's like maybe maybe two thousand people at the

[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.140]
very most in there and it's like six and eight dollar seats yeah and they can't even fill that

[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.560]
well what are you complaining about in Hartford's got a national hockey league team they do like seven

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.120]
eight thousand people a game and about a thousand of those never show up anyway it's unbelievable you

[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.340]
can sit wherever the hell you want in Hartford by a two dollar seat and sit right there on the glass

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.140]
and I got an old spy report for you yes remember when you were in the uh plantation

[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:15.620]
fashion mall with the center one thing sure do and Matt was standing over George and his wife

[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.520]
had Matt pinned against the glass they had him pinned right up against the wall you remember that

[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.080]
and George's wife keeps calling here every day saying when is the when we're going to hit the

[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.920]
mad again I know now that I was in I know nobody ever gave you the full story on that I was in

[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.660]
earshot of the whole conversation yeah and Matt was showing a lot of interest in like

[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.560]
wanted to be a trainee or a a board up trainee or he just was showing a lot of interest in being

[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.340]
this I'm going to miss him training in the studio and yeah no George was uh George was

[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.380]
directing him the right way telling him to you know somewhere the hell is he I don't know but

[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.460]
I I've heard you like say the George is trying to scoop him and uh he was uh George is trying to

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:57.860]
help you out I'm sure of it George is uh George was interfering on behalf of his wife okay don't

[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.500]
ever kid yourself he's not trying to get anybody in here that I might just sit and look at you know

[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:07.980]
and if that's the case where is he I don't know where's Matt he was where's Kevin with a maple leaf

[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:13.400]
with the Felix pot van jersey where's Steven from plantation where are all these uh fine specimens

[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.940]
of the human race they're all gone it's all just life is just a big tease that's all

[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.080]
and have a great day we have an open line in day seven five one the green lines the passion lines

[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.560]
but it's a good thing he did call remind me about Matt because when we need to have our 85

[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.700]
interns for the summer here hanging around and uh getting school credit for just hanging around

[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.040]
here and eating a lot of free food Matt certainly is at the top of our list isn't he George

[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.740]
if you say so don't uh don't give me that crap okay your wife might actually uh put that

[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:48.060]
tongue away for a couple of days if you brought Matt in I love that tongue yeah bet so does she here's

[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:54.040]
Hollywood hello first time core all right great um I always say you're talking about garden

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.380]
stake park and uh my brothers of all eight are really yeah must not be too busy

[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.360]
yeah they are going bankrupt oh that's sad it's such a beauty have you ever been there of course

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:09.200]
what a beautiful track yeah uh and they're dying over there yeah they are how can you prefer a harness

[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.880]
race in the thoroughbred race i always have i just uh it's to me it's more exciting there there's not

[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.540]
all this long long time in between races i mean you you have to take a pillow when you go to the

[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:25.300]
thoroughbred you could take a nap seriously it's just too much time in between right and then they run

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.980]
for a minute and ten seconds and guess what you had another half hour let me ask you another thing uh

[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:35.660]
if all the drivers were black and harness racing would you still follow it no no you know that's

[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:41.720]
an interesting question if all the drivers were black would I still go to the uh to the track

[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.840]
probably i guess so and there is a white team in the NBA that's good they're probably in the

[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.980]
championship this year to see an extent they start three white guys a lot of time they start three white

[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:56.320]
guys yeah and damn what is the second best player in the team and he's great they're big freaky guys

[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.940]
though they they all the guys in the NBA looked like they're from outer outer space or something

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.200]
i just i can't relate to that so there's nothing to look at for you Neil oh that's true that's

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.520]
you that now you're getting out of it if we had some Latin guys on there then i would start

[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.760]
watching the NBA now you got it those Latin guys are too short that's the problem you guys are

[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.820]
gonna have to start eating your vitamins baby and a lot of cereal or something because you're too short

[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.700]
okay so see if you can grow it a little all right it's been a great day pali yeah he's got a good

[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:29.360]
point there i know now why is that do do do do do do the heat have like a lot of latins that i bet

[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.320]
they do now the panthers we got some i wouldn't say we have a tremendous uh Latin crowd at the

[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.320]
panther game some thanks to me mostly the ones who are in a closet pretend they don't listen to the show

[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.000]
but they really do and they discovered hockey is great and they have a lot of fights and they like that

[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.820]
but as far as latins at basketball games maybe we can hear from somebody goes to the heat game

[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.300]
all the way did ask a heat question yesterday no matter what i asked yesterday might as well

[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.100]
been talking to myself but that would be interesting to find out if there's a lot of spit i mean

[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:03.400]
latins who come to the heat games because i still hear that man they are in a coma and what's

[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.620]
all this business about we had another call on rick and suds this morning about women using the

[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:15.760]
men's restroom at the arena what is that all about squirt squirt god yes because the lines are

[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.880]
jet now let's face it okay just stop and think about it let's say there's 14,000 people in their

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:28.500]
unearbred which is you know give or take i would say of the 14,000 10,000 would be male okay

[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.860]
4,000 women guys bring their girlfriends their wives then there's Ellen and genie and of course

[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.900]
though they hang out in the men's room i know that those two and the same with the blade run a girl

[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:43.440]
in jannit they hang out in the men's room they hang out in the showers downstairs but so if

[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.980]
there's 4,000 women now is there a lack of the number of women's rooms why does this seem to be the

[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.100]
big problem at every sports facility for years they all bitched about the orange bowl not

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.900]
enough places to go pee not enough for toilets the toilets were it looked like a toilet they smell like

[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.960]
and now every now we got the same thing at the arena there are women because in between periods

[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.220]
if you wait to go take a leak and i always if there's like about a minute and a half two minutes

[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.780]
left and i got to really go i make a run and there's no problem but if you wait until the end of

[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:15.260]
the period man they're lined up 20 30 deep at the urinal and there's a few guys in there too

[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:24.980]

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.240]
Say

[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.240]

[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.240]

[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:49.060]
That night when she turned off all the lights, there's no place where she could hide.

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.260]
Oh no, OJ was gonna get hurt.

[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.820]
OJ went out to kill her.

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.840]
OJ went out to kill her.

[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.980]
OJ went out to kill her.

[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.760]
That night one day the jury's gonna set free OJ.

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.480]
We're all we know he's gonna head your way.

[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.340]
Oh yes, and OJ's gonna get ya.

[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.960]
It's true, OJ is gonna come at the time.

[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:31.960]

[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:31.960]

[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.260]
And that who get away with that want to do.

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.980]
Oh yes, OJ is gonna get ya.

[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.320]
OJ is gonna get you, OJ is gonna get you.

[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:56.780]
OJ is gonna get you, OJ is gonna get you one night.

[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.200]
Move and use it as the tape

[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:10.400]
Shake it

[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.640]
I'm going to get you.

[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.920]
Oh, she's going to get you.

[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:45.020]
Oh, she's going to get you tonight.

[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.780]
OK, 11 away to W.I.D.

[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.380]
We'll be O.J. in it a little bit later on today.

[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.760]
By the way, bad news for O.J. fans Friday.

[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.000]
No juice.

[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.220]
No court on Friday.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.400]
I guess the judges got like a golf game or something going on.

[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:00.860]
No court on Friday.

[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.340]
Here's a mobile in Dania.

[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:02.640]
Hello.

[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.340]
Neil.

[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:03.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.100]
First time caller.

[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:05.700]
All right.

[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.840]
Hey, my name is Bert.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.560]
Yes, Bert.

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.780]
Uh, compliments to the best talk show host on a damn radio, man.

[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.200]
You're the best.

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:13.720]
I am.

[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.260]
Listen, uh, been listening to you since 91.

[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.840]
I'm a stuntman and I was doing a movie.

[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.900]
Uh, that's a stuntman.

[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:21.380]
Yeah.

[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.600]
And I was doing, uh, underlies the Black Jack Savage in Miami.

[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.660]
And I want to compliment you on all your commentary on the Persian War.

[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.940]
I loved it.

[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.440]
Every time, uh, all of us, we listen to you constantly.

[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.020]
All the stunt guys on the show.

[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:36.360]

[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.800]
Mo, we were pretty good on the golf world too.

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.300]
I thought we were kind of on top of that one too.

[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.780]
Yeah, but, uh, I'm living down the keys now.

[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.020]
And I've listened to you every time I get up this way.

[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.700]
And I've never tried calling.

[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.980]
And it's a pleasure.

[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:48.840]
Well, thanks a pile.

[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.700]
Most compliments for you.

[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.480]
And you have a great day.

[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.520]
I shall see you.

[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:51.720]
Bye.

[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.020]
Bye.

[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.840]
Yeah.

[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.120]
And I was also good when we covered that little contra Thompson Salon.

[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.420]
I was pretty accurate on top of that.

[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.860]
We have an open line in day.

[00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.280]
75.

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.900]
There is no more Salon.

[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.560]
Anybody know where Sri Lanka is?

[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.760]
What is wrong with it?

[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.300]
You know, something I could go off on a tear, but I won't do it.

[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:13.040]
Because even in the old days, when I was on KAT, I remember Lin Russell got to be the PD

[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.560]
because Sid Levin took a shine.

[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.080]
She had a nice ass or something like that.

[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.340]
So he made her the program director after, um, well.

[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.940]
So anyway, uh, she became the PD and one I went there one day I said, and not that I was asking.

[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.820]
Because I don't ask program directors even going back way back then.

[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.820]
I was making $225 a week.

[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.280]
I didn't ask them permission for what material I was going to do on the show.

[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.240]
That's like kindergarten.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.180]
Okay.

[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.180]
That only program directors were on some kind of a psychotic power trip.

[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.200]
Get into things like that.

[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.500]
You know, I mean, I can understand if you're dealing with a bunch of shmeckles who need to be led by the nose.

[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.680]
But we don't need that here.

[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.340]
Most of the people on the air, except for some of the weekend and nighttime people.

[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.820]
Our professional broadcasters.

[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.900]
But anyway, so I said, I'm going to do a whole week of shows on education.

[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.160]
And she looked at me and said.

[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]
I'm a little slow today.

[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.840]
She looked at me and said, oh, why?

[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.600]
She was, that was Lin Russell.

[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.120]
Now of headline news, big TV star.

[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.920]
And I'm making much money.

[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.720]
Now she's nice.

[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.200]
She's all right.

[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.980]
She mellowed out since she and Sid were tight.

[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.160]
But anyway, and I said, uh, because I think it's a very important topic.

[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:14.660]
We were top.

[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.480]
We were, uh, issue oriented radio.

[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.500]
And she looked at me like, oh, gee, that's, uh, boring.

[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.380]
And here we are 20 years later.

[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.820]
And it's still boring.

[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.860]
And it's, uh, like 100 times worse than it was then.

[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:33.380]
I mean, you asked somebody for every, every time they put that thing in a paper about how they asked like you of M students.

[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.640]
Of course, that's a bad example because they're mostly dummies anyway.

[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.060]
But they ask college students.

[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:37.980]
They give them a map.

[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:44.100]
And they ask them, okay, point out the area on the map that you live in.

[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.960]
And a whole bunch of them can't do it.

[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.320]
There's that thing dangling down there.

[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.220]
I mean, it's so obvious.

[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.580]
It's like hanging out of their pants.

[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.820]
It's dangling right and they can't find Florida.

[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.240]
They don't know where it is.

[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.160]
Guys from New York.

[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.760]
I mean, there's long islands sitting out there like in the Atlantic Ocean.

[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.180]
It makes it kind of pretty obvious where New York is.

[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.120]
If you got, you know what I'm saying?

[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.840]
Where's New York on the map?

[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.760]
I don't know.

[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.320]
They point to like where Minnesota is.

[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:08.280]
Duluth.

[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.340]
I mean, I don't understand how anybody can accept this.

[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.800]
How do it be possible for people to be so stupid and so inarticulate and so God damn it,

[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.120]
literate.

[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.380]
How is that possible?

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.140]
It's frightening and nobody cares.

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.600]
They didn't care then and they don't care now.

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.900]
This is the greatest curse in this country.

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.380]
These are the dumbest freaking people on the face of the earth, our Americans.

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.800]
And it's not because they're bad people.

[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.980]
It's because nobody cares about education.

[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.320]
Well, they can tell you all kinds of crap like about OJ who was on the witness stand yesterday.

[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.240]
How many inside edition shows Kato Kaelin's been on?

[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.760]
They can tell you all this other crap.

[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.760]
OJ's daddy was a drag queen.

[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.660]
He was.

[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:56.640]
By the way, the WABC slams the Yankees with a $10 million suit over the rights fees.

[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.700]
I'm sure you've heard about this.

[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.120]
I'm big inside radio information.

[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.860]
WABC says the replacement players sham competitions have created a breach of contract.

[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.580]
And when you're paying $5 million a year in rights fees, you want the real thing.

[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.340]
When you pay for it, you want the real thing, not some make believe thing, not something made out of plastic.

[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:23.020]
Yankees flagship WABC is still carrying the preseason games, but tells the court virtually no advertisers will touch them with an ugly stick.

[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:28.080]
Also points out the team has cut ticket prices to fans by 50%.

[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.080]
But New York Times says MSG network is in the same jam.

[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.380]
Can't get a break on its $44 million dollar a year rights fees.

[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.340]
Word is also WABC's demanding monetary damages.

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.200]
WABC and George Steinbrenner have had a stormy relation on and off for years.

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]
They've been losing money.

[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.980]
It said as the first rights related lawsuit, but maybe not the last.

[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.420]
When will WQAM Sue Wayne, Heizanga?

[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.980]
That'll be the day when they get the balls to sue anybody.

[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.420]
You know what?

[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.000]
A bunch of pans he's over there.

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.500]
And hey, nice going, Joe and Dave.

[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.040]
I know it's make believe ballroom ball games.

[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.900]
1114 at WIOD.

[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.400]
610 WIOD.

[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.120]
The station your mother's afraid to listen to.

[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.000]
Another dick in the White House?

[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.580]
In the 50s, Robert Young made people laugh and father knows best.

[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.920]
Now, this great series is back, starring a few Catholic priests who like it young,

[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.580]
in the return of father knows best.

[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.360]
Step into the confession or believe.

[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.360]
I don't know, father. This makes to 47th time I've been in there this week.

[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.580]
Oh, Billy, you want to be a good Catholic, don't you?

[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.700]
Yeah, but does everybody get a spanking?

[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.420]
Father knows best.

[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.520]
It's the Vatican's best kept secret.

[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.040]
And you've got a private seat for all the fun.

[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.160]
Just enter the rectory from the rear.

[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:42.120]
All right, Billy boy. It's time for your flute lesson.

[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.500]
But father, your flute has only one hole and it doesn't make any noise.

[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.580]
Oh, it will, Billy. It will.

[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.680]
Father knows best.

[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.780]
Once you've seen this new sitcom, you'll wonder why you've never heard about it.

[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.560]
Let me introduce you to St. Peter.

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.600]
Father knows best.

[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.760]
Going to church may not seem very entertaining, but there really is something funny going on here.

[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.300]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.400]
Wasn't the Robert Young in Father knows best, I think so.

[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.520]
It's 1117 at W.I.O.D.

[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.320]
Here's, uh, what is that? Salina Kansas.

[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.860]
Bill, how you doing, man?

[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.940]
What the hell is that?

[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.780]
Even with the hell is that?

[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.500]
What is Salina Kansas? What is it?

[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.620]
It's a place on I-70.

[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.980]
It's halfway in between the state.

[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.660]
Between a what?

[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.620]
It's halfway in between the state of Kansas.

[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.780]
Between the state of Kansas and a dark place.

[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:37.460]
It's like right in the middle of the state.

[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.760]
Yeah, and it's like, you know, halfway between the edges.

[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.900]
It's like inhabited by five people and they all live at the, you know, the dark place.

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.980]
What you'd be doing there is the obvious question. What are you doing there?

[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.520]
I'm coming on the right all the way from Seattle.

[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.040]
From Seattle?

[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.200]
How long's that gonna take you about a week?

[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.720]
No, in fact, we've got here in two days.

[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.580]
So it's probably be like another two more days.

[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.500]
Oh, that's not bad.

[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:07.760]
No, we're just having a good time and, you know, listen to your show and just letting you know we're on our way back.

[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.340]
Well, hallelujah, and guess what? Nothing's changed here.

[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:10.880]
Huh?

[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.580]
Same old stuff going on here.

[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.300]
Hey, what's the deal about the, uh, the Tokyo thing?

[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.100]
I caught a little bit of that.

[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.380]
There's some kind of a terrorist deal.

[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.540]
No, it's just some leftover gas from Hiroshima.

[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.560]
It's just delayed reaction.

[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.520]
All right, Neil.

[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.460]
Have a good trip, Ali.

[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.820]
I'll talk to you when I get back.

[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.060]
All right. Have a safe one.

[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:31.640]
Later.

[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.980]
Bye. And a trip too.

[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:38.560]
Yeah, they're just a little delayed reaction gas coming out of, you know, in fact, what we did is we dropped a time relief on them.

[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.960]
Is what we did. They didn't realize it.

[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.080]
That'll get even when those little slighty-eyed guys, oh, sorry, Judge Edo.

[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.380]
Sorry about that.

[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.360]
Those Chinese guys can sure play ping pong, can't they?

[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.500]
See, that's another thing.

[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.500]
When you come across like those make-believe sports stations on there, like when you guys used to have sports channel,

[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.420]
which they took it away from most of you, because you don't have a satellite dish and you got cable and you got screwed again.

[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:04.920]
But during the off hours, even on ESPN, where they got 24 hours a day to fill, they got the four hours of programming, you know,

[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.460]
and they put all this other crap on there.

[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.620]
When they got a ping pong tournament on there, do you watch that?

[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.480]
What is that the noise I'm hearing by the way?

[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.380]
Where is that leaking from?

[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.960]
Is that the phone pot again?

[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.240]
Boy, there's something really filthy in our pot. Better weed it out.

[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.520]
No, but seriously, when you watch a bunch of Chinese guys play in ping pong,

[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.780]
would Chinese people play, you know, we have never had a Chinese call around this show.

[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:29.400]
Have we?

[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.100]
Once.

[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.540]
No. Japanese.

[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.220]
No, what's a Chinese person?

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.460]
A Chinese. What should we never have? Have we never had a Japanese call this show?

[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.460]
No Koreans.

[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.860]
We don't have any Koreans living here, do we?

[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.520]
For sure we do.

[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.160]
We do. How about Thai? Do we have any Thai wanis?

[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:45.700]
Thai one on?

[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.440]
No, that would be a good thing for us to do today in between all these people sucking around for these hockey tickets,

[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.080]
which I know just lately, most of them are not even voicing their time asking, which is a good idea.

[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.800]
Now I'll give them a voice soon, maybe.

[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.440]
But what we need a jab to call in here would be good.

[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.700]
But seriously, do you think Chinese people watch ping pong because other Chinese people are playing with it?

[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:05.500]
Huh?

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.860]
It's like, porno movies.

[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.000]
Do you want to see Chinese people doing it?

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.740]
I guess depends on what they look like.

[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.300]
Make me feel better about myself.

[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.700]
Seriously, would you watch a movie with, I mean, unless you had really good vision?

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.560]
Now some Chinese women are very well-endowed.

[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.640]
Some Chinese women are voluptuous, and some Chinese guys are very, very good-looking.

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.240]
A lot of them, but not well-endowed.

[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.040]
Not a trust me.

[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.160]
I mean, like, oh, here's Boko on the purple line.

[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:38.440]
Hello.

[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.760]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.340]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.740]
I got four topics to real fast to hit you on.

[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.620]
Okay, number one.

[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.060]
Rodriguez, I'm the coach of FIU now.

[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:46.940]
Stanisth, Latin.

[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:47.760]
Pretty cool, huh?

[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:48.280]
Yeah.

[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.300]
He's pretty good.

[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.080]
He's a strong coach.

[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.740]
Maybe FIU will make it back to the NIPs until UCLA again gets killed.

[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.620]
Great, and lose by 45 points again.

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.000]
Number two, I'm sitting in the barber shop this morning,

[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.940]
and someone fans through the barber shop,

[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.640]
but Michael Jordan's calling it quits,

[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.640]
and he doesn't got what it takes.

[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.200]
Is that true?

[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.180]
You're doing anything about it?

[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.400]
Yeah.

[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.980]
He usually, you know, he liked to say it wasn't the quitter,

[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.280]
but he played and he figured it...

[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.900]
You know, he came out there with his pants on back,

[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.160]
when he figured that was a bad omen.

[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.800]
So, he thought one game was enough.

[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.080]
Not that it was a publicity stunt.

[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.480]
He's out.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.280]
Unbelievable.

[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.120]
Number three.

[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.100]
I lost the game.

[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.460]
I know you're a food lover.

[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.640]
I got this great new restaurant in Coral Springs.

[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.000]
Yes.

[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.380]
Hobo's Ficht joint.

[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.040]
Real good breakfast.

[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.500]
Home-o's Ficht joint.

[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.380]
Home-o's.

[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:27.980]
Hobo's.

[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.460]
Home-o's Hobo's.

[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.120]
Okay.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.880]
Great stuff.

[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.400]
Got a lot of bottom feeders hanging out in there.

[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:32.620]
Yes?

[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:33.580]
Thanks a lot, Pat.

[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.320]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.320]
We have an open line on the Purple Line,

[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.620]
pound IOD, and we also have one on the Passion Line,

[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.380]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.660]
Now, what do we got?

[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:46.560]
We got the Panthers are playing at Buffalo on Friday.

[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.300]
They're playing at Montreal, I believe, tomorrow.

[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.040]
Oh, man.

[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.940]
Montreal never loses at home.

[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.820]
They go on a road to get Wallaplug last night,

[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.460]
eight to four by the flyers.

[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.480]
Can you imagine what those frogs in Montreal are going through

[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.020]
right now?

[00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.080]
They want joctin merrys.

[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.520]
They want the entire front office.

[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.580]
They want to fry their ass right on the ice,

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.520]
and I don't blame them.

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.920]
What a trade that was.

[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.220]
Mark Recky.

[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.860]
I mean, he's a nice little guy.

[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:09.360]
He's okay.

[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.380]
Never stole a freight train.

[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.220]
He don't look too bad.

[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.280]
He's, you know, he's a goi.

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.100]
But he's not like the end of the world.

[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.660]
It's not like Pavel Burry or Eric Lindross

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.780]
or something like Superstar.

[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.620]
It's a guy.

[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.100]
And they give away three outstanding young players.

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.420]
And now, since they made that trade

[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.720]
Philadelphia's in first place,

[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.500]
they're like six points in first place.

[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.520]
They're beating the crap out of regular bases out of the conidians

[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.100]
who cannot win a game on the road,

[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.340]
who can't steal a game on the road,

[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.200]
but they win at home.

[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.580]
They only lost once at home all year long.

[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.640]
And the Panthers, we got to go in there tomorrow night

[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.100]
with those guys.

[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:40.900]
They're more frogs.

[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.680]
Not bad enough we got frogs legs last night.

[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.900]
Now we got to go in there tomorrow.

[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.700]
And by the way, you notice one thing about hockey players.

[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.960]
These guys aren't pussies.

[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.440]
These guys aren't a bunch of guys that just because they're friends

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.260]
with each other.

[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.020]
Last night in the first period,

[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.940]
Rimmer is telling us that Joe Sackick and Mike Huff,

[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.260]
or good old buddies when they were young in school

[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:00.900]
or whatever together,

[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.000]
and they went out to dinner the night before,

[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.180]
because the team got there the afternoon before, like Sunday.

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.360]
And they go out to dinner Sunday night.

[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.060]
Right in the first period,

[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.400]
Mike Huff reaches out his stick

[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.260]
and high sticks Joe Sackick right in the push,

[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.620]
opens up a nice big cut and gets a four minute high-sticking double-minor.

[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.560]
Atta boy, Mike!

[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.300]
All right!

[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.960]
Don't let friendships stand in a way of a good high-stick.

[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.740]
Hi.

[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.060]
It's 11-24 at WIOD.

[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.560]
Hi, this is Erin Somers.

[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.620]
Tonight we're going down memory lane,

[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.800]
because we're going to be talking about the time

[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.800]
that we lost our opportunity.

[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.860]
Passion phones with Erin Somers,

[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.380]
weeknights, eight till midnight,

[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.580]
on news, talk, and entertainment radio.

[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.800]
6-10, W-I-O-D.

[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.960]
6-10, WIOD.

[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:48.920]
Don't wait now.

[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.700]
We need a designated driver.

[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.160]
Okay, 11-26 at WIOD.

[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.200]
Two open lines at date.

[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.180]
What is that all about at 7519-463?

[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.920]
You ought to see the really nice puff piece

[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.160]
that Nick Lawrence sent here.

[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.360]
Must be looking for a job, huh?

[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.300]
From the light bulb.

[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:03.840]
Remember, Nick?

[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.460]
The aroma lingers on, baby.

[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.000]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.140]
751 WIOD.

[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.560]
Don't forget if you want to actually pay and go on this bus trip,

[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.560]
because you're not going to win it anyway.

[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.160]
Most of you.

[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.080]
I'll accept one.

[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:14.500]
Here.

[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.340]
You can call the toll free number,

[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.700]
1-800-395-5287.

[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.080]
It's the JJ Kelly Charter Bus.

[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.980]
JJ Kelly, those are the folks that bring us

[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.500]
that great scoreboard all the time during the A Panther Games,

[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.980]
which quite frankly, many nights,

[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.500]
that's all I'm paying any attention to.

[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.300]
I don't want to say when Leafs are playing.

[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.420]
Not that I don't pay attention to our Panthers,

[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.780]
but some nights up until recently,

[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.160]
there wasn't too much to pay attention to.

[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.020]
Now we're playing good, and we lose every night.

[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.320]
The Panthers expressed a Tampa a week from Sunday,

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.240]
April 2nd to see the Panthers in a lightning play

[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.440]
in the beautiful Thunderdome.

[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.900]
It's a pretty interesting place if you've never been there.

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.240]
It's just bring a pillow to sit on.

[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.340]
Not that the seats are uncomfortable,

[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.120]
it's just you have to be able to look over the head of the person

[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.340]
sitting right in front of you,

[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.500]
because they're not like a slanted well.

[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.200]
Maybe the Oriental could help them out over there.

[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.300]
They don't know how to slant it right.

[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.820]
$59 per person if you want to pay for it,

[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.000]
then it includes round trip, luxury bus transportation,

[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:02.940]
with restroom.

[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.180]
They got a VCR on a bus.

[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.620]
You can watch all your favorite pornoes,

[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.240]
whatever they're going to show.

[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.580]
Game ticket free soda is available on the bus,

[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.040]
but space is limited.

[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.720]
So call that number and to hop on the bus and go to Tampa,

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.980]
and get some enthusiasm for the lightning over there.

[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.240]
Jeff Moss asked me, he said,

[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:16.920]
you want to go over there?

[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:17.660]
I said, no way.

[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.080]
Call 1-800-395-5287.

[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.340]
No, it's not that I didn't want to go.

[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.200]
It's just that I felt we wanted to give these away

[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.540]
to some of our isolisters out there,

[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.440]
if we can find a couple.

[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.720]
But I've already been over there.

[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.820]
I was there two years ago.

[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.880]
I went sitting on, actually,

[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.880]
it was not at the Thunderdome,

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.140]
because they didn't have the Thunderdome.

[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.220]
I was at that cow palace they had in Brandon,

[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.000]
where the lightning played their first season,

[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.900]
and I saw the Leafs beat the Leaves and Crap out of them twice that year.

[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:40.420]
That was good.

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.260]
I mean, beat the Leaves and then last year,

[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.900]
we went over twice, saw the Leafs beat them,

[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.420]
and then that early game, when the Panthers beat them,

[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.540]
was it one nothing or two nothing,

[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.800]
that first, that was the record-breaking game,

[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.900]
where they had 29,000 in some odd,

[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.220]
and they all were odd in the Thunderdome.

[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.640]
They pack them in there, man.

[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.320]
It's a bizarre bunch, but they sure pack them.

[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.940]
Here's the Lady in Homestead.

[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:01.220]
Hello.

[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.360]
Hi, Neil.

[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.200]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.200]
I think your show is great,

[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.200]
because you give people the opportunity to say what they feel.

[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:06.760]
Sometimes.

[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:07.720]
All right.

[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.520]
But anyway, this has a little to do,

[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.120]
well, have a little to do with the LJK.

[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.620]
Now, very fast, I was going to say that in LA,

[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.280]
when King got a beaten from the Crops out in LA,

[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.080]
and King who was Afro-American,

[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.520]
I was ready to crucify the Crops, and you know.

[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.500]
Kill the Coles.

[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.560]
Find them guilty the whole bit, right?

[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.520]
Renginal Denny, when he got that beaten,

[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.200]
it left him half dead, right?

[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.900]
Nothing was done about that,

[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.500]
but yet the Afro-Americans looted that,

[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.100]
their LA, and they burned places,

[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.020]
and did the whole bit.

[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.820]
But Reginald Denny, well forget about that, right?

[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.820]
Susan Smith, who was white,

[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.440]
and she murdered her children by throwing them in the lake.

[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.880]
Well, I wanted to do the same thing to her.

[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.260]
I'm white, okay?

[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.340]
And I, this is the stuff.

[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360]
You want to do what, throwing the lake?

[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:56.700]
Yeah.

[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.120]
Okay.

[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.460]
I want to hear it get, you sound good.

[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:58.500]
You sound good.

[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.380]
All right.

[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.700]
But we will feel bad about it.

[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.420]
We'll stay around for about 45 minutes in the field,

[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.580]
bad and watch your guys,

[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.920]
for what the bubbles come up, yeah?

[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:06.820]
What I'm trying to say is,

[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.400]
no matter what ratio, okay?

[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:08.860]
Yeah.

[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.700]
It shouldn't make a difference.

[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.940]
The Afro-Americans blame us for being prejudice,

[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.020]
but it doesn't look that way, okay?

[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.040]
O.J.

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.500]
Look, you can't keep living in the past.

[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.460]
That's the bottom line.

[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.520]
You can't keep pointing back,

[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.280]
and it's like when David Berkowitz,

[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.560]
the discovery was the son of Sam,

[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.460]
and killed all those women,

[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.400]
they didn't say, well,

[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.020]
the Jews have been persecuted long enough,

[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.340]
and David Berkowitz is Jewish.

[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.720]
I mean, what is that?

[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.740]
You can't keep using race or religion

[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.440]
or any other thing as an excuse for like a,

[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.120]
I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer,

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.920]
and nobody said, oh, here's another poor gay guy

[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.780]
that's being persecuted,

[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.280]
just because he killed a bunch of guys,

[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.960]
and has a bunch of bodies and his refrigerator.

[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.960]
You know, it's just a lame, it's really lame.

[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.640]
O.J. murdered his wife,

[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.280]
took his children's mother away from them.

[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.000]
Now, those children,

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]
a half Afro-Americans, okay?

[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:52.700]
Which half?

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.720]
What do you mean one half?

[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:55.480]
Yeah?

[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.580]
Well, you know what I'm saying.

[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.980]
But anyway, I just don't understand it.

[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.540]
I don't understand how 76% of them

[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.020]
could say that he is innocent.

[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.540]
Well, they did.

[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.080]
Yeah.

[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.340]
They said that, not only in it,

[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.820]
they said there is no chance that he committed the crime.

[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.680]
He's so freaking guilty, it's pathetic.

[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.000]
And he's gonna walk.

[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.740]
And he's giving us all the finger.

[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:14.100]
How do you like?

[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.820]
You notice how he's laughing when he stood in front of the,

[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.540]
he came over to the jury and he's smirked and laugh,

[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.240]
and he said, hey, take a look at this finger.

[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.760]
He's doing a Brian Constantine now.

[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.980]
The smirk's on his face.

[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.400]
Exactly.

[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.060]
You want to punch his lights out, it's so good.

[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:24.520]
There you go.

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.140]
Well, we'll give you a chance to drop the pillow

[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.120]
and the gas chamber, okay?

[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.320]
But, you know, the sad part,

[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.240]
I'm gonna hang up now,

[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.740]
but the sad part is that we all know he's gonna walk.

[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:33.780]
There you go.

[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:34.400]
All right.

[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.220]
Well, you gotta walk before you sit down in the gas chamber.

[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]
Have a great day.

[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.560]
All right.

[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.140]
Hang in there.

[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.180]
Open line, what a hum on that thing, huh?

[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:41.860]
Wow.

[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.840]
And that Carl Douglas, you know,

[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.480]
you notice how they,

[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.860]
since he made all those mistakes,

[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:47.820]
those big boners,

[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.180]
they haven't been letting him do much of anything,

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.880]
except sit there and look kind of dazed most of the time.

[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.080]
Huh?

[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.700]
And what is the story with those lips?

[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.760]
Do you notice how he's got blue lips?

[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.240]
I better ask Dr. Dunn about that.

[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.680]
He looks like he's been rimming frosty this snowman.

[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.060]
He's got really,

[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.960]
okay, let's go to West Palm Beach.

[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.220]
Hello.

[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.320]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:10.840]
Pretty good.

[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.720]
I'll throw three or four things out so quick.

[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.220]
Okay.

[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.680]
Number one, you're talking about the kids not knowing where New York was.

[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.180]
Yeah.

[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.320]
About, there's only 20% of this select group of high school

[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.440]
or college kids they asked.

[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.100]
They didn't know who even dropped the ball in Japan.

[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.180]
They all, they know the me,

[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:23.820]
the most political in Japan.

[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.820]
Who dropped the ball in Japan?

[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.300]
I think probably the Sony people

[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.620]
when Michael Jackson got in trouble.

[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.000]
Maybe they put it down the subway, too.

[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.360]
Yeah.

[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.620]
Listen, how?

[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.000]
They got a lot of people over there.

[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.040]
So there's some gas on the subway over there.

[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:34.720]
I mean, what if they're,

[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.640]
and then they had a threat,

[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.100]
all these copycat guys,

[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.240]
and they had a threat of some gas in New York, you know?

[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.360]
Now gas mass prices,

[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.640]
the stock prices went up 100 times.

[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.400]
There was 30, 100 times as much as usual.

[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.640]
In Japan, yeah, that's true.

[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.860]
That is absolutely correct.

[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:48.760]
That's unbelievable.

[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:49.280]
Yeah.

[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.460]
See, everything is done.

[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.120]
Everything is done.

[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.440]
Mark Obit and Terry Kerr.

[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.860]
Terry Kerr is the kid from California, ain't he?

[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.580]
It's not a kid.

[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.660]
Well, you know, it's a grizzled old man.

[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.220]
Is he really?

[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.180]
Well, he's not an old man.

[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.140]
I thought he was about 35.

[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:03.580]
Yeah.

[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.300]
But he looks about 55.

[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.760]
Like I was driving on the...

[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.700]
Mark Obin will show him his backside

[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.760]
in every one of those races.

[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.460]
Mark Obin is the best out there out there.

[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:11.840]
I'll tell you that.

[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.700]
I love Kevin Wallace,

[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.720]
but I'm going to be honest with you.

[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.400]
I mean, Mark Obin is phenomenal.

[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.540]
He's great.

[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:17.600]
Okay.

[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.200]
He is.

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:18.780]
I'm Tonya.

[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.060]
All right, well, I will see what happens.

[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.220]
Listen, I was going to throw a hockey story at you.

[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.700]
And how about, let me see it again.

[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.740]
Were you there last Wednesday?

[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.640]
No, I didn't go last Wednesday.

[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.660]
Well, let me just tell you again,

[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.500]
I want to mention it.

[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.380]
I want to mention it for the third time.

[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.960]
Well, all he has to see gives two assists

[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.840]
on his victory to Gary Mills, okay?

[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.300]
Two of the races, he never won in a million years,

[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.180]
but that's another story.

[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:37.520]
Go ahead.

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.600]
Is that one, Gary Mills,

[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.660]
we're in second with that 30 or 40 to one shot?

[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]
That's sad on the outside

[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.160]
and locked Gregory in all the way around

[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.080]
in that last race when they were like four points apart.

[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.100]
You bet your sweet butt.

[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:46.400]
Yeah.

[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.520]
I saw that.

[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.580]
And in the first race in the showdown,

[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.160]
when he left with that rat,

[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:52.660]
what else is it, Amy,

[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.620]
that piece of crap that never left the gate in his life

[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.060]
on the rail?

[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.480]
And he parked Gregory out the first quarter, 27 and four

[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.020]
with a horse that never had gates beat before in his life.

[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.860]
Good old Gary Mills gets an assist on there,

[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.500]
give him 500 of the thousand wally.

[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.040]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:05.280]
Really?

[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.840]
I was going through a hockey story actually quick.

[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.180]
Believe it or not,

[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.620]
before the Rangers got sort of good,

[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.560]
the Ranger fans used to be like the cup fans.

[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.220]
They would spend like 30 or 40 years

[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.500]
and they didn't have a chip on their shoulder.

[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.380]
And I went to one of the greatest games they ever had.

[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.260]
Do you remember their goalie, Jocelyn?

[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.720]
Of course.

[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:21.960]
Any Jocelyn was one.

[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.400]
Fast steady.

[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.380]
Yeah.

[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:23.880]
Now, that was a lot of fun.

[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.660]
He was loved in New York.

[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.040]
Not fat, Eddie, fast, Eddie.

[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.780]
Not fast, Eddie.

[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.340]
Not fat, Eddie.

[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.720]
That was gumboorzly was fat.

[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.360]
That's right.

[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:29.980]
I didn't think he was so fat.

[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:30.620]
Steve Leder.

[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.040]
When they treated him to the Detroit Red Wings,

[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.560]
the next game, the Rangers played,

[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.460]
it was in the next game,

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.220]
it was in the second game,

[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.000]
the Red Wings came to play,

[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.100]
the Rangers are massacred.

[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.700]
Now, why didn't he look at me when I said that?

[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.780]
You're fat, and I'm fat.

[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.200]
What's wrong with being fat, Steve?

[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.580]
What did he give me an exasperated look on that for?

[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.480]
You're fat.

[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.120]
Loose some weight, Steve.

[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.100]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:51.680]
Okay.

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.920]
In any case, when they came back and played

[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.260]
a massacred squadron,

[01:04:59.540 --> 01:04:59.980]
Eddie, you're talking about it.

[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.100]
What are you talking about?

[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.580]
You're usually, like, fairly lucid today,

[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.100]
you're just dionami.

[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.360]
No, I'm not dionami.

[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.600]
I'm trying to state this call with some spurious material.

[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.020]
Let me face my hockey story.

[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:11.860]
What is it?

[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.860]
Eddie, the first game against the ring,

[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:14.980]
was back against the Rangers,

[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.060]
a massacred squadron,

[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.240]
he shut him out, one nothing.

[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.600]
They cried when crazy.

[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.680]
They were all yelling Eddie.

[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.720]
I don't think he was crying.

[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.300]
He was pulling the ring.

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:23.300]

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:23.300]

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:23.300]

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.580]
What do you mean against the Rangers?

[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.820]
He was playing for the Rangers.

[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.240]
No, no, no.

[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.660]
It was his first game for the Red Wings.

[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.660]
They traded him during the middle of the game.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.580]
I don't remember that.

[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.300]
I don't remember that.

[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:31.840]
No, remember that?

[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.060]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.460]
But his first game as a Red Wings,

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.280]
he played against the Rangers and shut them out,

[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.760]
and the crowd came with steady ovation.

[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.040]
He came out of the ice, was crying,

[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.900]
and took fouls like no tomorrow,

[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.940]
when the greatest hockey story is there is.

[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.440]
What do you mean it's one of the greatest?

[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.800]
There was no story at all.

[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.900]
That wasn't a great story.

[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.500]
That was terrible.

[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800]
Why it's wrong with it?

[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.780]
There was there was no nothing.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.780]
The show, the crowd had loved form,

[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.560]
and they even know he was playing for another team.

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.120]
They came out and they cheered for the Rangers.

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.460]
Well, how about those fans in Indiana?

[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.860]
They gave a sitting ovation to Michael Jordan the other day

[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.200]
on Sunday when they beat NBC hyped that thing up real big,

[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.800]
and everybody got sucked into watching.

[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.900]
Including me, I first around, I went to K2O

[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.260]
to get the real clear picture there on a big satellite

[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.740]
on a big dish, and I tuned it in.

[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.840]
I watched all the pregame hype,

[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.720]
and I watched about five minutes of the game itself,

[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.380]
and then I got on my phone and said,

[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.320]
it was the same thing, except there was no hype in this thing.

[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:17.900]
Nobody came out of this thing.

[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.140]
Well, it wasn't the same thing because the fans in Indiana were kind of like non-plus.

[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.620]
They said, hey, screw you, Michael Jordan.

[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.080]
We came here to see the Pacers beat your ass, and they did.

[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.080]
Okay, okay.

[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.260]
They did, because he was seven from 28 from the floor.

[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.400]
They gave away the game.

[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.020]
They played him 43 minutes, and the guy hasn't played in a year.

[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.460]
How do you like that?

[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.540]
Phil Jackson should be crucified in Chicago.

[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.220]
They should hang his ass from across.

[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.120]
Well, 43 minutes was a little bit.

[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.920]
Maybe no more than 30 minutes, you should have got.

[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:42.660]
Topps.

[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.460]
Anyway, let me ask you.

[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.720]
Seven out of 28 from the floor.

[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.240]
You could make seven out of 28.

[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.080]
With your eyes,climaxaire, blindfolded, you could do it.

[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.940]
Listen, man, it's about close.

[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.280]
Bob Pusier could do it, even with that bad speech defect,

[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.660]
he could go out there and do it right now.

[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.320]
Okay.

[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.600]
How close is Tampa Bay to Tampa Bay?

[01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.540]
Downs.

[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.040]
Far.

[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.620]
It's in St. Pete.

[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:01.440]
Oh, really?

[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.360]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:06.360]
We have an open line in Broward, 524, and went on the passion line.

[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.280]
Boy, that was a great story.

[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.780]
He had about Eddie Jackman, wasn't it?

[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:09.740]
I guess he had to be there.

[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.740]
It's 1136 at WIOD.

[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.040]
And WIOD.

[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.600]
We hired the best programming consultants in the business,

[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.260]
and then told them to go to hell.

[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.040]
What do you guys think about this penis thing?

[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.480]
You suffer from constipation?

[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.920]
Boy, I see you're in jail.

[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.780]
There's nothing worse than feeling constipated.

[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.660]
But why should you also have to watch your money go down the drain?

[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.720]
So to speak.

[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:30.640]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.740]
You gotta help me.

[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:34.940]
Now there's a product for your bathroom that is made just for constipated people.

[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.400]
Hurry!

[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.620]
Tell me what it is!

[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.520]
New six flushes, bathroom ball cleaner.

[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.580]
Six flushes is a lot less powerful than 2,000 flushes.

[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.280]
But since you're constipated, why pay more for flushes?

[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.120]
You won't be using.

[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.400]
Six flushes is only 25 cents.

[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.060]
This is how you're gonna help me?

[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.860]
Yes, you'll save fistfuls of cash.

[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.360]
Your product is absolutely worthless.

[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.340]
Six flushes from the makers of 2,000 day vitamin tablets.

[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.680]
The ones with no potency.

[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.020]
Okay, it's 1139-21 till noon at WIOD.

[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:02.660]
We have an open line.

[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.700]
Two of them we got a pair on the green lines.

[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.940]
And in the next 20 minutes, we're gonna be giving away that thing.

[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.640]
In the next 20 minutes, we're gonna give away that pair.

[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.240]
Because we don't wanna milk this past noon.

[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.860]
We got the OJ crap coming up later.

[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.800]
And I'm sure we got a lot of very important calls.

[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.140]
After yesterday's experience here, it's obvious to me that you can never,

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.680]
you know, that woman called me before she had a bad hum on the phone.

[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.260]
And she wanted to say her piece.

[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.340]
And she at least responded to something that I said,

[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.280]
which happens very, very infrequently.

[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.160]
Because most people are too much of their pussycats, man.

[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.140]
There are too much of a whim to respond, especially if they disagree.

[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.920]
Because if they agree, first of all, they assume that I'll think that they're just fine.

[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.340]
They're just sucking around, which they probably are.

[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.080]
And if they disagree, they think that I'll probably make them really look bad

[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.800]
and hang up and browbeat and terrorize them.

[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.820]
Oh, and here he is again on CNN in a company.

[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.580]
One more time for Tracy and Judy or whatever is his wife's name, Kennedy.

[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.740]
Former Simpson juror.

[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:55.620]
Last night, I'm flipping along on the all over the dog.

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:58.900]
Because I'm watching the Panther game and I'm watching the Hartford game.

[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.920]
And so I flip over on a cable to see something, what are in it.

[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.740]
And I'm going to have to be on CNN.

[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.140]
Guess who's on CNN?

[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.560]
Our good close to low-me $50 buddy.

[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.000]
And who's he got on there?

[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.040]
He's got Tracy Kennedy and his wife are on there.

[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.440]
Now, how long can it be before we get the movie, the book, the short story,

[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.760]
the long story, the tall story, the phony story, the real story, and everything else?

[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.300]
The tabloid show interviews.

[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.500]
He's everywhere.

[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:26.880]
Tracy Kennedy.

[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.200]
What's his claim to fame?

[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.200]
He got thrown off the guy named Simpson jury.

[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.340]
He's a star now.

[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320]
He's a star because he got tossed out of there.

[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.000]
Because they believed he was writing a book.

[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.980]
And there's some other stuff probably going on that we didn't know about yet.

[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.980]
But now he's a superstar.

[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:41.980]
I rest my case.

[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.680]
Here's Pembroke Pines.

[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.000]
Hello.

[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.340]
Neil.

[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:45.720]
Yes.

[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.540]
Okay, I got a couple of things to respond.

[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.700]
I can have a jab call.

[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:49.400]
You're my ex.

[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.260]
Sister-in-law.

[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.380]
She's a big time jab.

[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:51.920]
Is she?

[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:52.980]
I can't stand that bitch.

[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.500]
I'm not talking about a Jewish princess.

[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.640]
I'm talking about a real jab.

[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.700]
I'm just playing with you.

[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.720]
I want to talk to you about the pants.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.320]
Can't feel it yet.

[01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.560]
Yes?

[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:00.380]
Okay.

[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.960]
What do you think about the...

[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.260]
I know we got two good goalies.

[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:03.780]
Yeah.

[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.720]
But I think that...

[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.780]
I know I don't know if you agree with this or not.

[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.240]
But why?

[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.380]
Well, let's find out.

[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:10.700]
Okay.

[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.440]
I understand you've got to give Bies a rest or a few days.

[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.160]
But don't you think that can break any kind of momentum?

[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.720]
I'm just going to give the example.

[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.700]
I am a Panther fan.

[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.540]
But like how they had Richter playing all season last year for the Rangers.

[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.360]
He can basically said he's not going to pull him out.

[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.340]
Even when he had a couple of bad games.

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.420]
Don't you think that's...

[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:29.520]
What do you think about it?

[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.140]
He didn't pull him out.

[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.220]
He pulled him out in the middle of some games and put Helian in the middle of the game.

[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.640]
Well, the last year the majority of games, he let him...

[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.400]
He played most of the games.

[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.320]
He was the goalie.

[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:37.620]
Right.

[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.200]
He was the number one goalie, of course.

[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.220]
And I understand when they play every other day and it's not too many back-to-back games.

[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.340]
But do you think that that could be hurt and I mean putting pitch Patrick in?

[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.780]
I think that one guy only plays every very, very infrequently.

[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.800]
He can be rusty.

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.880]
I think if it's Patrick, it's better than when we saw the last couple of starts he made.

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.080]

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.340]
And I think it's...

[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.400]
I think it's unfair to...

[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:57.640]
What?

[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.180]
I thought the game last time was a great...

[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.360]
He didn't play a great game.

[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.060]
He pulled it out.

[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]
He's stuck a joint out.

[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.480]
The team played a great game.

[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.440]
The team played great game.

[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.700]
What I'm saying to you is that you usually go with a hot hand and Neilson...

[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.480]
See, when you're going to start getting me going to Roger Neilson,

[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.300]
I would like to get a hit squad.

[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.920]
I'd like to pay them off to just do away with this man.

[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.760]
He is the biggest impediment to every team that he's ever coached.

[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.720]
He's a piece of crap.

[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:19.840]
He's hard-headed.

[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.840]
But the price was right, right?

[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.180]
He's just an absolute piece of garbage and everybody hates him like poison.

[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.940]
And I know, and I know this last night,

[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.120]
talk about Frosty, the snowman.

[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.400]
I noticed Rimmer was sucking around so heavy duty

[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.080]
with his close personal friend Brian Murray.

[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.540]
And he's saying on the telecast,

[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.420]
oh gee, I'm starting to really like a lot of things

[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.740]
that the front office has done here.

[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.200]
A lot of these moves and they got Swenson and Yadi, Yadi.

[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.580]
I mean, you've got to remember that he's real tight,

[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.180]
close personal buddies with Brian Murray to go back to their days

[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.000]
and wash them together.

[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.740]
Come on, Rimmer, quit sucking around so heavy duty, baby.

[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.760]
What else are you going to see?

[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.780]
You've got a bathroom no way.

[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:50.260]
I got a bathroom.

[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.180]
No, but I mean, but I mean,

[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.820]
the suction was so heavy man I was holding onto my seat.

[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.860]
Of course, anyway, before one other thing.

[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.520]
Like this call, yeah.

[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.120]
I have another theory on the arena for Latins.

[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:00.580]
Yes.

[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.720]
Well, it's in Dave County.

[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.040]
It's maybe by like, by default.

[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.620]
Maybe they just find it by off of 95.

[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.040]
Say it again.

[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.800]
They find it, the arena by default.

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.600]
I mean, they're there.

[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.680]
Maybe they're there. They're not.

[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.960]
They're not true hockey fans.

[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.500]
Oh, the Latins have come to the game.

[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.040]
I mean, majority of them are there because it's like a happening.

[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.100]
How do you know that?

[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.240]
What about the Anglos right there?

[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.880]
Yeah, most of them are there by default too.

[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.140]
They're probably giving the ticket.

[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:25.700]
Yeah.

[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.000]
You hear them talking in the crowd.

[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.580]
What do I think?

[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.500]
I mean, they come there 15 games.

[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.140]
Read the book.

[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.100]
They give out the pamphlets for Christ.

[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.900]
Okay, we're going to be giving a pamphlet out in a second.

[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.660]
We have an open line of Broward 524.

[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.580]
Here's a fact that says it's from Kim.

[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.200]
I mean, why do they cross this out?

[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:45.840]
I guess it's Kim.

[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.360]
I'm a 25 year old Korean college student who attends the University of Miami.

[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.780]
Nothing's perfect, Kim.

[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.460]
However, I am not your typical Korean.

[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.520]
Wait till you hear this, George.

[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.880]
I'm 5'8", 157 pounds.

[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.320]
And unlike most Asians, my penis is 8 inches cut.

[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.360]
Circumspec and circumscribed and circumcised.

[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:06.920]
How do you like that?

[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.060]
I'm also a chronic listener.

[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.780]
I listen every day but cannot call.

[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.880]
I love men and I really think you would love me.

[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.740]
And yes, there is a furl...

[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.820]
Oh, so this is a faggot.

[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.480]
Oh, that's where this is a Korean fag.

[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.360]
You know, in Korea, I think they still shoot them for that, don't they?

[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.860]
At least in North Korea, I'm positive.

[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.700]
At least you get hung.

[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.000]
Maybe that's how he got to be.

[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.640]
So anyways, as I love men, I think you really would love me.

[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.420]
And yes, there's a fairly large Asian population here in South Florida,

[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.480]
especially in the Gables in South Miami.

[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.120]
I love you, Neil, and I love Luis Miguel.

[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.680]
Can you play Ahmedica?

[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.880]
Maybe I might just play that now as a matter of fact,

[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.380]
still giving those stupid tickets away.

[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:46.500]
Huh?

[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.760]
She certainly sounds good to me.

[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:54.160]
Because that's what we need to do is build a foundation on our nation with Luis Miguel.

[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.900]
We have an open line at day 7519-463.

[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.660]
One on the green lines, there's that Gloria Allred.

[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.060]
She was the big hot shot attorney for that kid from Michael Jackson for about five minutes.

[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.200]
Then she said, I don't think so.

[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.040]
The money's not good enough.

[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.180]
And a kid in this family are getting all the money and I'm not.

[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.320]
So she's out of that.

[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.180]
Now she's the attorney for the Brown family.

[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.000]
Is that who she represents?

[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:14.840]
You don't know?

[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.060]
Now let me ask you something.

[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.140]
I can understand asking a lot of questions like uniform numbers on the Tampa Bay Lightning.

[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.440]
But let's, I mean, how could you...

[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.280]
I'm trying to tune this out as much as possible.

[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.000]
Why is that?

[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.020]
Because it's like telling you how live.

[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:29.640]

[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:34.120]
I mean if you ignore this, that would be like ignoring our program director.

[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.160]
It's the same kind of concept.

[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:37.500]
Inanity.

[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.080]
Here's for Lauderdale on the purple line.

[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:40.360]
Hello.

[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.860]
How are you doing, Neil?

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:42.560]
Fuck one here.

[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.040]
Okay.

[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:44.900]
I need your expert.

[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.540]
I need your expert.

[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.040]
Excuse me.

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.620]
I said, puck face here.

[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:48.560]
Thank you.

[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:48.980]
Yes.

[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:49.840]
I need your expert.

[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.420]
No, that's for me.

[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.080]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.140]
I need your expert opinion on something.

[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:53.520]
Yes.

[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.040]
Do you think the cancer has a chance to make the playoffs?

[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:56.420]
Yes.

[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.380]
Improvement to all the other teams?

[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.700]
Well, yeah, but they can't keep losing all these overtime games.

[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.620]
They're playing better.

[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:05.940]
I must, I must, I'm astonished how good they're playing the last four games now.

[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.400]
But they're just, they're just, they're just choking in the clutch.

[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.020]
They're choking it.

[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.340]
Puffs rolling the wrong way, but we'll get those bounces later in the year.

[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.020]
Yeah, right.

[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:15.360]
Sure.

[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.560]
What are we played already?

[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.420]
20, uh, seven, 28 games is only 20 games left.

[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.060]
Yeah, to see the last week's schedule, that's what makes me nauseated.

[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:24.880]
Yeah, we got to play on the road.

[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.800]
We got to play at Pittsburgh.

[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.880]
We got to play at the Rangers.

[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.360]
I think the night before that we got a lot of tough road games right there at the end.

[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.220]
Back to back.

[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.020]
Yeah, so we better start getting those points right now, like I said, and have a great day, pal.

[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:39.240]
We have an open line on the purple line, pound IOD, and one in brown, at five, two, four, nine, four, six, three.

[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.680]
And when we come back, we're going to get away that nice bus trip for those tickets to Tampa to see lighting in the Panthers.

[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.380]
And then afternoon, we're going to die again.

[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.200]
And then you'll hear for an hour today.

[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.120]
Hey, listen, I got a lot of good comment about that yesterday.

[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.400]
They enjoyed it.

[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.340]
16 W I O D.

[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.660]
If we're talking too loud, you're too old.

[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:04.500]
W A Y N E S U C K S.

[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.840]
Okay, let's not be to run a bush here.

[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.140]
1151 at W I O D.

[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.320]
Okay, who's number 93 for the Tampa Bay Lightning George? Quick, Gully, Duran.

[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.120]
What do they call that thing before it comes out of the cocoon?

[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.600]
What thing, the moth?

[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.120]
Yeah.

[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.280]
The larvae?

[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:21.860]
The caterpillar?

[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:22.960]
Right, what do they call it?

[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:24.980]
The pupa?

[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.620]
There you go. All right, let's hear it for George. He gets the ticket.

[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.100]
Oh!

[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.540]
Duran, pupa.

[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.920]
Number 93 in gold and I'd for the lightning.

[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.060]
That's just a little joke.

[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.420]
Okay, let's go to, uh, he'd go.

[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.760]
He'd probably go over there. It's free.

[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.240]
Get to drink all that free soda on the bus.

[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.920]
You could probably time it just in time. You could have a little breakfast with alcohol seen in fat rich.

[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:44.800]
Is there any free food?

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.940]
Here, no. Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:48.700]
Hello.

[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.220]
He won't go. There's no free food. Yes.

[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.040]
Yeah, no.

[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:51.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.280]
Yeah, I want to make comment about what you said yesterday in reference to not going to a basketball game because

[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.820]
they're all black, please.

[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.140]
Right.

[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.760]
What if I'm a black male?

[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:06.060]
What if I didn't listen to talk radio because they're no black talk radio show?

[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.420]
I've been listening to you, Rick, feel for about a year and a half now.

[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.060]
Yeah, but see on a talk show, we talk about things that are like of general interest to most people I would assume.

[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:16.680]
You don't understand?

[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.400]
Yes, but it's still entertainment.

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:18.800]
Right.

[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.460]
Right. So if you don't want to go because they're black.

[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.320]
Let me ask you this.

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.660]
If you would you go to, let's say you were invited to a party.

[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.300]
Okay, there were like a hundred people at the party.

[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:27.900]
Uh-huh.

[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.400]
And 99 of them were white.

[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.020]
You were going to be the only black person at the party.

[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:31.460]
Would you go?

[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:32.980]
If the entertainment said, yeah.

[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.280]
I'll see you're more adventurous than I am.

[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:36.960]
Oh, okay.

[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:37.600]
Oh, that's it.

[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.920]
I guess you're more adventurous than I am.

[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.340]
I'm just not, I don't know.

[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.940]
I just feel it's not for me.

[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.080]
But, but you're, you're, you're missing the boat.

[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.340]
I mean, you, you watch all the, uh, the hoopla around Michael Jordan, but then you only watch two minutes at a game.

[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.380]
No, I was, I was, I watched more than that.

[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.300]
In other words, I watched the first few minutes then I got a treadmill for a half hour.

[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.280]
Then I, I came back and watched more of it, but I sure didn't watch the whole game.

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:58.780]
Okay.

[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.160]
I just want to see how he was playing.

[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.840]
And I saw him miss a lot of shots and take some bad shots.

[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.720]
And I thought basically he caused them the game.

[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:05.420]
Okay.

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.260]
And as far as that lady who was going to put food and smith in the lake,

[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.660]
yeah, she'll hold it down out, P in the lake.

[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.200]
Okay.

[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.140]
See ya.

[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:12.540]
Bye.

[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.280]
Okay.

[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.680]
All right. Here's the guy that wants to do a little number.

[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.160]
Gorge Gorge.

[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:16.980]
I'll make a rickie lake.

[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.840]
In fact, isn't that the topic on the, uh, passion bones tonight?

[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.720]
Is something about that?

[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.340]
Something about the shower, power showers.

[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:23.980]
What's your manage?

[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.160]
We have an open line.

[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:25.700]
It's in date.

[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.100]
7519-463-751.

[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.240]
I don't know, Maggi.

[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.220]
I just can't, uh, maybe that is a fact thing.

[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:31.780]
I don't know.

[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.120]
Although there are a lot of black guys who, uh, look good to me.

[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.400]
I mean, it's got another duo with the athletes are good looking or bad looking.

[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.320]
And like I said, hockey players most, well, no, there are some pretty good looking hockey players.

[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:44.060]
But how the hell can you tell they all got helmets on there, you know?

[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.860]
And it got in the uniform that there were.

[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.220]
There's certainly nothing sexual about the outfit that,

[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.180]
hi, they're way like 50 pounds of equipment out there.

[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.220]
They got like jocks under their jock.

[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.660]
Oh, and what game was it I was watching the other night where the goalie got hit right,

[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.660]
like that squirrel.

[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.460]
Remember that squirrel in Chicago that was crossing the street on Larry Lujek's show?

[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.360]
And the nearly lost his nuts.

[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.400]
But it was the Bruins game, I think, a couple of nights ago.

[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.680]
The Bruins were playing New Jersey and lost it over time as it turned out.

[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.000]
But that turned out, that was a hell of a game.

[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.580]
But, uh, Blaine Locker, that kid that plays for the Bruins in goal, he took a shot.

[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.700]
And man, he just, you could see where it hit him, you know, like down beneath the, uh,

[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.220]
between the pads low in a certain spot.

[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:26.460]
And he just went down to the ice like he had been hit by a ton of bricks.

[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.000]
Like somebody had whacked him.

[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.660]
And Derek Sanderson and Fred Qsig both were like kind of a guest.

[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.900]
And in fact, I think Fred could almost feel it, which he hasn't done that in years.

[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.020]
Here is a plantation. Hello.

[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:38.920]
How are you doing now?

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:39.540]
Pretty good.

[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.420]
First time call a little nervous, though.

[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.520]
But nevertheless, yes.

[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.340]
Okay, anyway, I'd like to say, I used to be a crazy Ranger fan.

[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.640]
And I really turned now.

[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.080]
I'm a crazy Panther fan.

[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:48.340]
Yeah.

[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.960]
I'd love going down to the atmosphere in the, you know, the arena is great.

[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:52.560]
It is.

[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.580]
And unfortunately, yeah, well, you know, it's exciting.

[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.040]
I take my 16 year old.

[01:19:56.140 --> 01:20:00.400]
We go, um, I only have one complaint, uh, the parking there.

[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:03.920]
When I went the other night, we went to see the Buffalo, we made a loss and overtime.

[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:04.280]
Right.

[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.140]
Uh, there's supposed to be official parking there with a guy stands there for $8.

[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.400]
And he says the, the, you'd lot of secure.

[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:10.940]
Right.

[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.140]
Well, anyway, I put paid the $8. I got my ticket. I parked back there.

[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:19.800]
Here's these kids saying basketball and drinking beer and the bottles roll over the floor.

[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.960]
And I said, what the heck is going on here? You know, a little bit, a little bit concerned about leaving my car there.

[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:28.400]
Well, you're supposed to give each kid like five bucks to watch your car. Don't you understand that?

[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.120]
Don't you think $8,000 is enough?

[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.840]
No, that, that's just to get in there.

[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.000]
But then afterward you give each kid five bucks to watch it.

[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:34.760]
Well, I didn't know that.

[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.420]
And then when you get back, you might have like a couple of tires left.

[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.980]
Yeah, that was the only thing that concerned me.

[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:39.960]
Well, I lived in Detroit.

[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.760]
I used to go to Tiger Stadium, which is on Michigan Avenue downtown.

[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.040]
A very, very bad neighborhood, which Detroit has many.

[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.240]
And nonetheless, you would park down right near the stadium and one of the side streets.

[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.080]
And a kid would come over and say, dollar to watch your car, Mr.

[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.500]
And of course, you knew damn well. You'd better give him a dollar or the car wouldn't be there.

[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.520]
And when you got back, they still would break in, but they wouldn't do as bad of a job.

[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.260]
If you didn't give him anything, the car would be trashed.

[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.240]
Well, anyway, as I said, that's great there. You turn me on to the panthers.

[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.860]
And my kid loves it. And you know, we go down there.

[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:13.040]
The only thing is, as I said, is the parking and the traffic getting home on 95 to plantation in the evening.

[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.020]
Because they closed them northbound lanes.

[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.360]
Yeah, but for another four bucks, if you want to valet parkman, 12 bucks you get out of there.

[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.280]
If you could, if I could tell you how fast we get out of there, it's frightening.

[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:23.940]
Well, another four bucks.

[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.660]
Maybe next time I'll save us some money.

[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.740]
Just try it one time.

[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.820]
How about Tampa Bay?

[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:30.800]
Okay.

[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:31.840]
Okay, thanks.

[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.560]
You're surprised, aren't you?

[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.620]
I really am. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.220]
Because you sound like, how old are you?

[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.140]
I'm, I'll be 48, April.

[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.080]
See, here's the guys almost as old as I am in this audience.

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.920]
He's going to wait until he gets some young guy in here.

[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.140]
Sounds pretty exciting.

[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.480]
And he's going to give it to him.

[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.740]
I'm giving it away to another old fart.

[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.500]
Hang on, pal. Hang on.

[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.500]
I hope you enjoy it.

[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:49.760]
Thank you, pal.

[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.520]
I hope we win, too.

[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.180]
Yeah, I hope so.

[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.840]
Okay. And watch out for that pupa.

[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.100]
Guys on six.

[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.460]
Take care of him. He's a good guy there.

[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.360]
Let's give it to him.

[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.320]
Okay. Makes me look better.

[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.920]
Since your last announcement, we now have only five seats left on the first flight.

[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.580]
Says Bob Lincoln on our Vegas deal.

[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.620]
And watch these lines go out, too, by the way.

[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.800]
They're going to hang up fast now that we gave away our thing.

[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.180]
By the way, thanks to Jeff Moss for being so nice to us for finally caring.

[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:13.660]
I mean, after all, we've only given him $50 million in free publicity for the Panthers.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.780]
And now they turn around and do one nice thing for us.

[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:16.760]
Thanks, Jeff. It's about time.

[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.500]
And by the way, get ready your brother, please.

[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.580]
Also want to give you the upgrade prices for the Imperial Palace.

[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.980]
Okay. Oh, you stayed in a suite with a love tub last year?

[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.320]
George. Yes, I did.

[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.140]
Well, how did what was that?

[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.920]
What was that all about?

[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.000]
I didn't know about that.

[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.780]
You and your wife stayed in the love tub?

[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:36.300]
Used it to.

[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.740]
I'll bet you did.

[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.320]
But that was before she had the tongue. She don't need you anymore.

[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.140]
Just the tub and the tongue.

[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.420]
$520 per person if you want the love tub.

[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.940]
Now, is there more than one suite like that that's got the love tub?

[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.400]
And the love and bring your own little love vote.

[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:56.020]
And then a one bedroom king suite, $555 per person.

[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.280]
Plus, Mr. Fat has the nerve to charge $600.

[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.580]
Now, see, Mr. Fat.

[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.200]
That's Mr. Fat is Fat Rich.

[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.440]
So Bob Lincoln, if you're going to try to be one of the crowd and know whose name is to start throwing around here,

[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.120]
don't go pick it on Fat Rich, okay?

[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.460]
Because he's doing your computer, I believe.

[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.800]
And he's also getting the freebie.

[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.560]
So leave him alone.

[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.100]
If you want to attack him for his behavior at the track,

[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:15.880]
that's the only thing to attack him for.

[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.500]
Other than that, he's okay, sometimes.

[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.500]
But anyway, one bedroom king suite, $550 per person.

[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.880]
Fat Hank charges $600 for the other out of the way.

[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.480]
Oh, no, that's right.

[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:25.960]
Look at that.

[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.040]
You can get a suite for less than he's charging just for like your ordinary regular room at that Hilton over there,

[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.140]
which is way the hell out of the way.

[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.480]
So we can tell you how many connections he's got.

[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.220]
He can tell you what a big hot shot he is.

[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.520]
But the bottom line is we still got the best trip to Vegas.

[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.000]
And quite frankly, the first plane is just about full anyway.

[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.320]
We only got five seats left on that first thing.

[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.960]
You're better call right now, baby.

[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.480]
If you want to go on at 6.30 p.m. flight, June 15th,

[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.340]
leaving on a Thursday evening, three glorious nights and days,

[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:54.060]
plunging our brains, having a great time in Vegas at the Imperial Palace Hotel.

[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.060]
Call Bob Lincoln right now before it's too late.

[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.860]
Then of course, there will be a second flight, another 160 seats.

[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.880]
I have no idea how many of those are left, but probably quite a few.

[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.640]
Because most people want to go on the early one.

[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:09.540]
947-605-0 is the date number 947-605-0.

[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:14.340]
And toll free from anywhere 1-800-233-7264.

[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.580]
A lot of superstars will be along on a trip this time.

[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.960]
Phil, the bug band's going to be gone.

[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.120]
Ellen and Genie are going to be going.

[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:20.900]
How do you like that?

[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.140]
The two of them are going to be going.

[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.420]
Tonya is sharing all those stories about their two young boyfriends they met there last year.

[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.760]
Those ladies have got more stories about their boyfriends.

[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.560]
About their 25, their 20, their 15 year old boyfriends that they met out on a trip last year.

[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.820]
That they're doing something with in their mind anyway.

[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.900]
So, and who else do we know is going?

[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:37.780]
That's somebody famous.

[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.600]
Oh, and you'll never believe this.

[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.760]
Would it be embarrassing if somebody found out that Jeff Rimmerin is wife-fieril?

[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.680]
Went on that trip, they're not going.

[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.320]
See, I just made sure of that.

[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.100]
No, we'd love to have them along, but it would be kind of embarrassing for Hank.

[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.620]
But boy, it sure would piss off Zagaki, wouldn't it?

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.680]
The only radio station that kicks Rush Limbaugh's ass.

[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.940]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.420]
610 W I O D.

[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.220]
Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.500]
Skip the fish, eat the meat.

[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.440]
Good afternoon at 12 o'clock on Jennifer Rem.

[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.440]
610 W I O D news.
