[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]
Oh that no matter how much you spent others Joe Zagaki. Oh God

[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.540]
How could anybody put his push on TV, you know

[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.460]
At a boy Kurt look at that Kurt Abbott alright just over his glove

[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.040]
It looks like a triple to me to Marlon's kick their ass tend to two they're unbeatable at home

[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.840]
So anyway, what was I just saying?

[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.860]
30 day guarantee. Oh, yeah about 30 day guarantees on crap because most of us are like even at god damn juice

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.480]
I bought from that phony juicy man on TV on an infomercial. I think that was like about a two or three hundred dollar item

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.400]
Used it once it broke and stuck it in the goddamn closet. I got it right now anybody want it

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.660]
In the same way that stupid pasta maker that goddamn Ron Popeel thing which it does work

[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.820]
I mean if you want like you know if you like eating shoelaces with the pasta sauce really weak

[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.140]
And he used it a couple of times and then it goes into goddamn covered somewhere around the trash

[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.120]
Because they know that almost everybody is too lazy and they're not gonna save the box

[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.560]
They're not gonna pack it all up. They're not gonna send it back

[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.940]
It just ain't gonna happen very very rare. They got all the statistics on it. They know

[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.520]
So when you get crappy service or when you have problem like the thing on the plane with all little kids

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.560]
You don't sit down or write a letter say hey by the way

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.020]
I'm you know

[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.540]
I may not be one of your medallion level members that flies 80 million miles a year

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.960]
But I happen to be a frequent flyer fly a lot of miles spend a lot of goddamn money with your bankrupt airline

[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.400]
How about you know butching up a little bit?

[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.200]
For example, I stayed in a hotel this weekend in Boston that I stay at fairly often

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.080]
Not a cheap hotel pretty expensive as a matter of fact put me in a room the size of a broom closet

[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.580]
And I'm not exaggerating man. I thought I was out of the closet this weekend

[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.180]
I felt like I'd gone back in small tiny

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.540]
Now they haven't their computers. They know how often you stay there

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.580]
They know if you're regular or not and they you know

[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.820]
So if I were smart I'd call them up like today when I get home and say hey you want me to stay there again?

[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.740]
No more posted stamp size room because you know there's no way in the world that they're sold out

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.060]
You know you punch the elevator no problem the old up and down. It's right there in a second

[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.100]
That place is empty and they stick in a goddamn place for a 180 bucks a night

[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.280]
You could seriously you could stick up room in a TV and that's about it

[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.600]
Here's West Kendall. Hello

[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.840]
West Kendall

[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.800]
Okay, good listen my girlfriend and I got back from Vegas. Yeah, four nights five days. Yeah, it was incredible

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.760]
Where'd you stay?

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.400]
Yeah, and it was hadn't been there in 17 years. Oh my god. Oh, man. That city is you haven't been there in 17 years

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.120]
You didn't recognize almost anything exactly correct

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.400]
But listen, some things didn't change the people were were nice. They were no snops no horn honking

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.220]
And I don't know what it is with this town, but what can I tell you?

[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.180]
Did you see the thing that they're doing downtown on Fremont Street by the way? No, we didn't go downtown

[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.380]
Well, it's not done yet, but in December

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.180]
They're gonna have the whole thing done what they're doing is they're closing the Fremont Street and Tarely

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.780]
And they're making it like a big walking mall and enclosed and they're gonna have all these light shows at night

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.940]
It's gonna be phenomenal. They're really butching up the downtown

[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.780]
You know, there's so much to do in that city. I mean we could have stayed two weeks and done different things

[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.340]
And one thing that I noticed we went into several different hotels and each hotel has has a different atmosphere

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060]
You know everything for I mean a little bit of something different for everybody

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.100]
But I mean, oh this town desperately needs a town like Vegas. Please. Yeah hold your breath pal

[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.480]
Yeah, but anyway take it easy pal and thanks for all the good suggestions

[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.280]
Okay, hang on tight. Bye. See you

[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.220]
Just hang on tape baby wait another two three hundred years. We'll get it down here man

[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.680]
The Indians they're doing it. They're sticking and all kinds of stuff where the hell was it?

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.580]
What was I reading about some place where I think it's in Massachusetts that I was reading in the globe yesterday

[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.340]
they want to put in all the permuchels are trying to get like

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.940]
I forget how many like 500 to a thousand slot machines put in because

[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.580]
They want to compete with the Indian gambling thing that they got going and I think that they're going to get it too

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.240]
Because they want the Indians want to keep them happy and keep them shut up and keep selling a pedaling all their crap and they're bingo under casinos and their

[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.140]
stale cigarettes

[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.200]
But not here baby not here because this continues to be a real place

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.620]
The date lines all open five two four and a brow we got two of those open seven five one and date all three of them

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.280]
In other words, we're dying over here now

Two and a half hours though not too bad for a Monday not too bad on a Monday when the kids are all going out to the

But i'm believe that women they shouldn't be in the army or anything like that. Yeah, I mean it's ridiculous

[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.700]
I mean they should have stopped it when they went to the police academy and and

[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.380]
Crap like that. Yeah

[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.980]

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:40.400]
Okay, great day your phone it blows a whole phone system blows. I say let's blow up the goddamn phone system and start from scratch

We got four green lines. We got the seven on the uh a pink line there looking out for the lavender lines are loose

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.500]
They're on the loose baby to loose lot trex

[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.400]
You know what i mean

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.680]
Boy in shooting released girl star starts house fire burn detective critical

[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:24.340]
Pilot pull from ocean other than that it's just another god damn damn paradise the one thing that

[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.420]
Nobody has talked about including anything else is the fact that there was one little posse just because i go away for the weekend

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.660]
You think i'm missing what's going on wrong what day was this this is oh it's yesterday's yesterday's sun sentinel buried

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.300]
This should be a big story but of course because it's something positive we don't want to weigh you know

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.520]
Let's not get too carried away

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.720]
Arena search comes full circle incentive leads heat and panthers back to downtown Miami and it looks like

[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.340]
Arteele junior of the metro commission who generally is an asshole, but in this case we love him

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.760]
He says they may be able to raise 80 million dollars in public financing and

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.980]
They may vote on the issue the commission at least by September 14 and maybe we're gonna build a new arena downtown

[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.180]
Which is what i suggested weeks ago that you know

[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.920]
They got all that land right around the goddamn present one you know buy up a few blocks all that slum down there

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:16.820]
Territon build a nice brand new beautiful arena take the present one tear that down build a fantastic nice modern parking garage and you got a place

[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.500]
You got a place

[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.360]
So that's a little bit of positive news because other than that those panthers will be long gone after the season if we don't get that done

[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.460]
They'll be like Ernie Harwell would say long gone make no mistake about it

[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.840]
And by the way

[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.460]
Oh, and also i wanted to correct see you can say anything these people never recall you on it

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.920]
I said sit for an end is unfried. He wasn't pitching anymore

[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.020]
He's five and one with a fillies with that fat ass. I can't believe that did you know sit for an end is was still pitching

[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.300]
Oh my god the only problem is the uh mr

[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.060]
He missed a turn of rotation because he's got a strained back again

[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.360]
You notice how he's always got back problems because he can't stand up straight supporting that that ass

[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.680]

[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.220]

She's on the 30 and sick and fast

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.800]
Nobody cares about that like I said Bobby Cox war in moon mark fits Patrick

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.700]
Just a whole bunch of jocks out there. They beat the crap out of their women

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.700]
And that's just the way it's supposed to be and if you women don't like it too bad

[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.400]
I mean, what kind of crap is that and these people were supposed to admire them and pay for their autograph

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.860]
Irving spikes you slime ball you piece of crap

[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.920]
Gonna be a long year for those dolphins you mark my words. It's gonna be a long

[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.340]
frustrating tumultuous year

[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.980]
And I don't want to mention any particular names

[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.680]
But somebody's gonna wish that he would have hung it up

[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.540]
Tandered the keys of the kingdom right over to Jimmy there and let him have all those problems baby because it just ain't worth it

[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.700]
Got a lot of queer calls here today. I don't know what this is of course if you only we know there's only like a 10

[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.720]
Faggot's in the world and I'm one of them

[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.740]
Is that what Bob Dull said in Bob Dorn and let's see that's two more Faggot's in the museum

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.320]
He lives on queer street

[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.840]
Or Danny, I think. Oh, there's round on queer street. You're a Faggot Danny

[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.960]
He has a house and garden. I would love to see what happens

[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:47.020]
Hases toes and pets is monkey women's clothes make him look real funky

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.320]
He has a whiz whiz and knows what to do

[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.040]
All right

[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.100]
Don't you

[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:03.480]

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.060]
He lives on queer street

[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.960]
Here at Thor were all the creatures meet

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.900]
I wonder what they're doing is there

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.440]
He said he likes to just find

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.800]
If you know Julie like I know

[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.000]
La la la la

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.880]
He lives on queer street

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.840]
Linger the rath done queer street

[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.980]
He had the house and uh, so that leads me to ask the musical question where the house Louie Oliver when we need him

[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.800]
And he is on queer street right now. Here's Miami on our bad line. Hello

[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.400]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.940]
I'm talking about somebody who should have hung it up long time ago somebody who's over the hill

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.940]
Um you ever seen

[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.560]
Shula and yourself in Samar

[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.800]
Oh, yeah great call

[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.060]
Brilliant, but you're a listen pal. That's all that counts the prices right in your list

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.600]
How did I know that's where that was going?

[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.400]
Open line of day see that's your typical dolphin fan there right there man can't cope with it can't deal with it

[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:27.760]
751 W.I.O.D. and Dana of course they're in basically shell shock right now because they lost three out of four to girls teams in a preseason

[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.680]
And they know they've been talking a big game

[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.740]
And they still got three thousand unsolved tickets for the goddamn Jets game

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.680]
Wouldn't it be embarrassing if the jet

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.780]
If the jet fans outnumbered the dolphin fans like it that giant scheme two seasons ago

[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.300]
That would be real embarrassing wouldn't it? I kind of think so

[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.600]
In addition to which guess what pala check looks real good every Thursday

[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.420]
1244 at W.I.O.D. have you had a snap lately? Have you had a good cold one in your hand?

[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:59.440]
Somebody to choose from you wouldn't believe it. It's like a goddamn smorgasbord of beverages real brudized teas fruit drinks

[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.660]
Fruit juices some fantastic flavors of the sodas all kinds of great to like the snap up for all you superjokes

[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.220]
Who we're gonna need to cool off after you get pissed off when a Jets upset the dolphins on Sunday

[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.040]
It's gonna be an embarrassing thing man

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.180]
And if Snapple isn't making the flavor you want like right this minute

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.840]
They're probably working on in the laboratory right as we speak no preservatives no additives no crap no artificial anything

[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.200]
Just made from the best stuff on earth. That's the a snaple model man

[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:27.220]
And that's why Snapple is big coast to coast all over the goddamn world pick it up where finer beverages are sold

[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:27.420]
Get

[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:42.120]
610 W.I.O.D. what's a bloody glove between friends after 21 years at 16 albums the grandaddy's a punk rock are trading in their leather coats for flannel pajamas

[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:54.960]

[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.440]

[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.500]
I want some happy yoga please

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.820]
Rock and roll nursing home the guitar gilded goodbye from the pioneers of punk it rocks so hard

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.060]
It'll make you have to sit down

[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.240]

Here's poppin. Oh, hello. Hello. Neil. Yes. Did you see Bob greasy on Saturday night, man?

[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:07.000]

[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.660]
Round spots. Yeah, I figured you'd be in spots. I'd bake in spots because you're such a dolphin closet fan. Yeah, right

Even a smell you can't get past here's West bokeh. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.380]
What one great point about the Brian Wilson program last night

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:54.120]
It's a statement against drugs. I mean, here's a man who was on top of his profession. I was hearing Garcia doing by the way

[00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:00.000]
Right, and you know all the you know, Andrew Odom took an ad out and lose favorite saying that you know, pet sound

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.380]
What do you mean he's alive? He was on top. He was the best. What do you mean he's alive? Look at him. He's a shell. You know, he's a show. What do you say he's alive?

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.020]

[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:46.140]
Now knowing the Patriots kick ass and they sold out unlike the dolphins every game sold out every game and the whole season

[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.040]
They're probably gonna sell out next year before this year right over. That's right and uh through Rosehouse

[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.480]
Does he like look for trouble?

Yucking it up like it's a big joke. Well, you know brine. He's got to play football

[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.520]
He's got other priorities besides his done. Cousin that he shot

[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.660]
And Irving, you know, I'm sure he's very distraught. We'll have to find out what the what it's all about what the bitch done

[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.440]
Yeah, Drew you're a hell of a class guy. Maybe there's another another god damn prostitute

[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.140]
Just pouring the money off all these guys

[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.760]
He don't give a crap what the hell he do as long as they don't jeopardize the contract so we keep getting his god damn cut

[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.960]
That's all he wants just give me my god damn share and keep your nose clean. That's the whole deal with Drew Rosenhouse

[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.300]
Two open lines and Broward five two four nine four six three. Here's a mobile and four lauderdale. Hello

That's about Drew Rosenhouse. Yeah, he gets his ball play is by

[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.460]
Taking practically no percentage on their signing bonus

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.180]
But his father invests all the means that they get from the ball players

[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.220]
And his father has gone into bankruptcy has been in bankruptcy

[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.680]
So I'd like somebody managing your money that's been in back. But he cannot manage his own great. Where do I sign up

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.080]
Go ahead. I say where do I sign up?

[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.100]
Just call Drew. Okay

[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.720]
Thanks for the good news pal, but this is a factor. You can check that out. I'll check it out

[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.800]

Hey, no, hey, no, I've been looking for you for years. You're great

[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.240]
And I not the limits. I grew up in this area. Sarah is really dead. Yeah, I've been all over the country

Traveled a lot to a lot of extensive travel in Europe. Yeah

[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.660]
How come I can't hear this call Georgia? Is there a special reason why I can't?

[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.240]
I'll cause the phone line sucked George said because our engineering departments busy plan the pivot man downstairs

[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.860]
But have a great day pal. See lost the call the guy just disappeared

[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.560]
He feels bad. He feels like it was a wasted goddamn effort the guy sucking all over my goddamn body a great caller

[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.360]
A good guy and he's gone. Why? Because the phone system here blows because every goddamn phone line is worse than the other one

[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.540]
And Steve Ziggler is down there sticking his goddamn aspiratis in the mitchwings uh business

[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.460]

And nero green is wondering around a building with food in this push that a boy Bobby. You're really doing it baby

[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.200]
You don't have to worry about that new building. We'll just turn this one into a parking lot in about six months

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.900]
Open line and Broward 5249463524 wiod

[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.920]
So how about that new arena?

[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.480]
Let's get something going in his town

[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:35.380]
You sound negative neon you're sounding yeah right. I'm negative. Okay. I'm just sitting here telling it the way it is

[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:41.660]
begging and pleading and praying that something good happens that we get struck by a miracle lightning bolt from up above that's gonna do something good

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.640]
Here's dear field on the purple line. Hello. Hi, how you doing Neil? Okay, sir

[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.280]
You're a pretty smart guy. Can you explain to me what the logic is of

[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.020]
Channel 4 switching with channel 6 with their lousy signal

[00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:01.260]
It had to do with some kind of a deal at the whoever the hell it is that owns channel 4 made with whoever it is that owns channel 6

[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:08.540]
They purchased a station in Philly and part of the agreement on the deal was that CBS was gonna get channel

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:16.460]
Switch on channel 6 here that they would get the facility of channel 4 that has a much better signal in exchange for which channel 4 winds up on 6

[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.460]
We'll have it a crappy signal I would there was part of their deal

[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.540]
So it's just they're like an appendage see what I'm saying. They're an appendage to the deal in Philadelphia

[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:30.860]
It's really strange something that they've done in just wait till channel 6 gets on for and people will actually be able to see Dave game

[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.160]
Then there's gonna be rights in the streets in this town

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.100]
The interesting thing is channel 6 just improve their signal about two weeks ago

[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.620]
And you can actually get channels

[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.720]
Six in the south bomb beach county area. They did it. Yeah

[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.880]
The signal is the same as it was right after the hurricane when they were using the antenna a little bit further north

[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.400]
Yeah, when they had to switch back to home. Well, are you talking about that? Are you talking over the air on cable?

[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.000]
I'm talking about over the air really on channel 6 you can now get it

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.040]
It the picture sometimes is a little bit grainy

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.580]
Thank you, but yeah, but we don't want they've game to be grainy

[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.780]
We want it to be clear and vivid and massive man

[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.100]
Well, it's not it's not perfect

[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.940]
But it's awful lot better than what it used to be and you can actually see it and hear it now

[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.660]
And want to be a shame that Brian norcross and Tony segredo with the silly suspenders are gonna have to be on at much

[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.080]
You know that inferior signal won't that be bad? Well, you can know you still get the sound real well

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.380]
It's a picture's a bit grainy and you can get it now

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:29.300]
I mean it just happened about five six days ago, huh, and now you know maybe it has something maybe it has something to do with it

[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.860]
I wouldn't be surprised isn't that happening like on September 10th

[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.560]
Yeah, so that much

[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:41.440]
Apparently wasn't gonna let them boost their power. Yeah, so now the question is did they because of his deal allow them to boost their power?

[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.320]
Probably somebody paid them off you know the FCC yeah possible. Okay pal

[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.080]
Every thanks to the information and have a great day

[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:53.400]
Yeah, I think it's happening on September the 10th they've been promising they've been threatening it and it's gonna be real confusing and in five minutes

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.520]
You'll be used to it'll be the same old crap, okay

[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.580]
You'll have Jenny Jones and you'll have Montel and you'll have Sally Jessie and you'll have Carlos

[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:06.660]
Shava is junior Schwartz whatever that guy's name is Perez and you'll have what's the broads name the blonde? The huliet

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.500]
Christina

[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.740]
Christina you'll have that bitch in the film maybe if he don't go out of business because NBC is they're dropping him off

[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.140]
WNBC in New York or whatever they hell affiliate he was on there dropping the down a show and you'll have her

[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.500]
Although when you'll have Sally Jessie and did I say Montel and you'll have

[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.340]
Murray Pupik they'll all be on there, okay with all the couples that make believe screaming and yelling and all the domestic

[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.040]
And we're worried that Irving spites beat up his wife, huh?

[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.440]
Maybe he was watching the goddamn Richard Bay show me that's that's probably what sent him off

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.980]
He was watching one of those goddamn TV shows. He was watching Jenny Jones

[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.420]
It's a that looks like a good idea that'll shut the bitch up

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.800]
And he just gave her a little what for okay put his hands around her neck

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.440]
He were a little struggling to knock through down the grounds to get out of here, okay?

[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.800]
I got it. I got football on my mind all those Drew Rothenhalth Boeth. We got football on our mind. We don't got time for this crap

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.360]

Open line and never trust a man that paints his fingernails with a bunch of soda little you know what I'm saying

[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:29.060]
In fact, he probably's got a gang going over there at the pizza loft that goddamn Jeff Cohen wouldn't surprise me if they have their own gang over there

[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.800]
Wouldn't that be great if they have pizza lock gang jackets and outfits, huh? We could make a million selling that crap

[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.200]
Open line and date 751 one and Broward two on the green lines the women of course are long gone long gone

[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.500]
What do you say and Victor come on? What is it spit it out?

[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.460]
He's whispering again Victor. That's unusual. How did a man who whispers ever make that much money? He must be a crook

[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.180]
Victor must have been a crook too because nobody who whispers makes that much money

[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.060]
Do they here's the mobile in four lotterdale hello? Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, you a big sports center fan

I do a sports center sports center in spn very rarely wow rarely

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.880]
I can't I can't start my day without that show in the morning

[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.320]
You want to know why I hate sports center on ESPN? Why that well first of all when you say in the morning

[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.180]
That means you're watching the tape from the night before but number two the fact is that instead of giving it

[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.860]
They have a morning show. Well, you'll listen to me. Okay. What they do on ESPN, which I hate ah

[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.540]
Is they'll give you a couple of

[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.300]
Highlights from an American League baseball game right two or three games

[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.660]
Then they'll go off at a some other guy to like women's tennis or something am I right? Yeah, you're right

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.080]
That's good. It kind of breaks up. No, it's not good

[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.880]
I don't want to have to sit through golf and women's tennis and god damn hurling and stuff to get the rest of the scores

[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.740]
Right when I want those scores fast

[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.280]
I switch on headline news real quick

[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.980]
I get them all on the bottom of the screen and then I go back to the weather channel or whatever

[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.300]
Well, the thing is those guys on that show are just really talented that you know what I'm saying

[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.420]
Out of the local guys on here are terrible and just the way they present the

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.720]
Sport that it's I'm gonna tell you who really makes me sick on ESPN radio that they have on QM on a weekend

[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.860]
Is it Tony Bruno is that the guy's name who I think he's got a feather up his ass this guy

[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.340]
He's always ah, haha

[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.000]
And a guy that's with him there, and there there's nothing funny going on

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.900]
There's nothing even remotely amusing and he's playing rim shots and all I think ESPN radio is going away of QM

[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.360]
They're trying to do entertainment because they realize that nobody wants to your all sports radio all the time right right

[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.120]
Okay, thanks for the call can I listen to that I got you down song. Can you listen to it?

[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.060]

[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.420]
They got to sell it out by four o'clock on Thursday in order to lift the blackout on TV

[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.740]
If it's not sold out shame on this town. It's bogus baby

[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.420]

[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:40.760]
Neuro is fiddling with it baby. He's fiddling. All right. When's my green star baby? Let's do it

[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.560]
Let's put this thing down to about a point two on a weekend and then the dolphins can bail us on

[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.700]
By the way, do you see QA M in his last trend at night with the Marlin baseball for all three months had a two share

[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.700]
with Marlin baseball

[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.420]
If I was the Marlins man, I'd be a little bit suspect about that guide

[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:02.460]
They make believe radio station at their games Iran because that's and especially when you consider that the TV broadcast

[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:11.420]
They're so bad that many many people turn on Joangel and Dave O'Brien and turn the sound on on J Randolph and Yuri Carter for obvious reasons and in spite of that they got it too

[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.800]
Here's highly a hello

[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.520]
Hello, yes, sir. Oh listen Neil. I just wanted to call him the first time caller to you show yes, sir

[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:25.540]
And when you started talking about Shula, I could understand where you're coming from really because

[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.200]
You know, not Shula at one time, you know, I had

[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:37.180]
A relative in my family that was very young and she wanted a signature from

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.980]
Number 13, you know the quarterback. Yeah, Danny was his name right. Yeah, well, you know, I'm talking

[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:50.820]
I'm not really a dolphin fan myself. Okay, so basically what happened is that when I got around the

[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.920]
In the area where where Danny was standing. Yeah, where he could see me. Yeah, I threw him a shirt

[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.560]
You know for him to sign it and he looked at me and he started walking over toward a shirt

[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.860]
Shula stood there looked right at me and pointed at him and give him a no signal to go away from the shirt

[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:15.280]
And I thought that was pretty low of a person that you know that everybody so pumped up on yeah, so I really want to thank you very much

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.360]
for

[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.380]
Holding to your morals and everything else my moral show. Yeah

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:26.640]
I love your questions. Okay. Thanks coach. Okay. Have a great day. I'm sticking to my morals, baby. That's it

[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:33.140]
Whatever the hell that means I'm sticking it, baby right now because they don't come any more moralistic than done Shula

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.580]
He's Mr. Hatchot, you know, love coming at it. It's just it's stupidity is what it is

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:44.000]
They just can't wake up and smell reality. That's all these people are living in the past you go out there to the stadium before the game

[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.760]
They're showing highlights. Here's greasy throwing a warfield. That's not here's Larry Zaki's breaking away Zonkers at the 30

[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.980]
He's a you know who cares? That's ancient history. Don't give me ancient history

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:01.340]
You're just easier was once pretty god damn good too. That's what they say in Rome, but he's not feeling too good these days. Okay

[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:03.560]
God

[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.500]

There was Peter Niro is that who we were thinking of yeah, that must be it. He was the pianist

[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.400]
Let's go to a mobile in my I think he had one a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi

[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.980]
Over the weekend. I was listening to a sports show. Yeah, and the guy on the radio man a really good point

[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.720]
It doesn't matter how many number one draft picks you have on the dolphins

[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.040]
If you're not going to utilize their talent and use them in the same scheme

[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.020]
You're never going to have a better team like Oliver Doddy has about as much

[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.580]
You know the guy just they do the same plays over and over

[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.040]
Yeah, and they got all this talent and I guarantee you I don't care what anybody says Gary Stevens

[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.460]
I don't care how good Bernie Parmolius which he happens to be very good right

[00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.800]
I don't care how great he is

[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.740]
Gary Stevens will always go away from the running game

[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.540]
They'll never stick with a running game. They'll try it in the first half and even if it works good enough for like when they had higgy

[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.300]
There'd be times he'd be good in the first half and then the second half all of a sudden it's damn
