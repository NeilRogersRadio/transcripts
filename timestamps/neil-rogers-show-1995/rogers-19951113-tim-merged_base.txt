Okay, 1025 at W-I-O-D. Look at that phone there, baby. What's happening in

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.200]
Broward? The usual amelaes there in Broward. This phone should be lit up air

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.920]
be light on the board and then we should have people like standing online like

[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.740]
taking a number today at the bakery. One open line in day at 751 W-I-O-D. All

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.660]
of Broward. Look at that. 5249-463. I guess that shows where their

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.840]
allegiance is are in Broward, right? Here is a Hollywood on a purple line. Hello.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.660]
Neil. Yes sir. Welcome home. Yeah. Hi, Frank Cox. Is it Jake? There's a rumor

[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.060]
going around. Wow. Yeah. Isn't it wild to go anywhere? Well, I know, you know,

[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.260]
Phil was making a point that when a guy comes on the air and when he says to

[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.680]
another man, you know, what are you going to think about that? I think

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.320]
Phil's got a good point there, Rachel. Hey, well, that's how I went to Vegas.

[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.380]
That is like paradise. It is. And then you come back here and you find out

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.640]
place doesn't have a rhyme or reason. They don't have a clue of what's going on.

[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.200]
Yeah. And you should have seen, you know, I get we came back through Houston and

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.700]
the flight from Houston to Fort Lauderdale. If you could have seen the sea of

[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.420]
blue here, no matter where you're coming from, the flight to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.280]
There's like 80 people with walkers and canes crawling under hands at the

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.960]
exact thing. That's what it's all about. Oh my god. We just came back from

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.360]
San Francisco and went over to Lake Tahoe when we got back here. Get back to

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.860]
we flew into Miami and the mate. Yeah. There's people actually speak English

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.960]
in the country. I mean, the the MGM Grand, which have been in there, you know,

[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.760]
I was there the day it opened a couple of years ago, but I've never stayed there

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.220]
before. Right. The rooms are so fantastic. They have so many elevators. You never

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.440]
waited more than 15 seconds for an elevator, even as big. They got 5,000

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.180]
rooms in that place. The food is sensational. There's like 80 million tables.

[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.060]
The sports book is gigantic. They got 50 billion slot machines. I mean, that

[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.020]
and the people in there are like almost all living and breathing millions of

[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.960]
young people, old people in between, but they're all like, you know, happening

[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.180]
people having a great time. It's frightening. It's good because they they

[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.160]
are targeting young families, but they're doing a lot with the they have that

[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.000]
amusement park. Right. That's right. Families out there. It's really amazing.

[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.940]
An amazing town. But I say what you're right. They say they try to

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.640]
shut people in to go down to the downtown. Oh, 10 times. Oh, forget it. That

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.040]
place. I didn't I didn't see anybody caching anything in that joint and it's

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.980]
just real dingy and grungy and all the dregs of human. That's terrible. If you

[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.540]
look at as as Vegas started in North Vegas and it worked its way down. It

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.480]
looks like a big animal that's pooped on its way down south. Yeah. Or crap is

[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.700]
left up there. They should just go bulldoze all over. I think that's up north.

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.280]
I think that's north though. Yeah. Right. North Vegas. Yeah. It worked its way

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.740]
down from the old time. You can see what was left like relics back there. Oh, you

[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.180]
mean downtown is what the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, would you win? How much you

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.580]
win? $1,000? Now what? $500. But I was losing over a thousand up until Saturday

[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.860]
and then I made a big comeback in one 500. My friend John went over a thousand.

[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.360]
So we had a good time. Oh, great. Well, nice to have you back. Thanks, pal.

[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.660]
Thank you. Have a great life. Two open line to purple line. AT&T wireless line.

[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.740]
pound IOD of one on the green line. 1 800 944. What are we going to do about this

[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.440]
Rachel Alexander? What are we going to do by Brian Cox? What are we going to do

[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.760]
by Don Schule? I mean, you can I know there's still six and four years a long

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.060]
way to go. How about those cowboy? God, Elvis. Grub back. That was unbelievable.

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.060]
That was unbelievable. You know, I watched some of that yesterday when I got back

[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.320]
and I'm looking at that and I'm thinking, what what is this all about? Well,

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.920]
Aikman got hurt early in the game. Okay, that's a good excuse. What was that all

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.140]
about? Elvis grew back couldn't hit the wide side of a barn from two feet away

[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.560]
with a guy named Cum Quad. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. And there up

[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.880]
before you know it, like 24 to zip and it was no contest, no contest. Also, I

[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.520]
got to get a couple of spy reports. We got to find out about that tape that

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.120]
Randy taped that we played on Friday. Oh, you were here, right? And and and what

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.180]
about it? Was there any rhyme or reason for playing it? I mean, was it entertaining?

[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.420]
Was it it sucked? Okay. And then about that smokers, I don't even know what that

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.520]
show is that smokers thing that's on Sunday night, which there's a memo on the

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.380]
door there about all the response we got. What what is that show? Did you hear any of it?

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.020]
No. So we'll get a spy report. Maybe if anybody heard it, I doubt it. Here's a

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.700]
mobile in deer field. Hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Okay. This one, let you know,

[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.740]
we went to the hockey game with the police at the hockey game Friday night. Right.

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.000]
Get a blast Friday night. Saturday night. Saturday night. Very exciting.

[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.380]
Biggest proud of the year. I see that's because Rick Riley was there.

[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.200]
Hey, we had a great time. Very action packed. I've got her hooked. So we'll be going a lot more.

[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.240]
Better go a lot while you can. Yeah. We went to that also. And I just low.

[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.800]
And Danny, Danny can win a game when he breaks the record. I just got to use the choke might.

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.780]
Yeah, they're all excited about him breaking these individual records. I think that most

[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.340]
of the fans would gladly trade all of his individual records for even like getting in the

[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.140]
Super Bowl again would be good. Just get there to get killed. Yeah. Just let us get there.

[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.940]
Anyway, I'm out of material. Neil. Okay. Take care. Get a new phone. Open line of

[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.300]
Broward 5249463524WID. So the Panthers really been kicking ass. They won six in a row.

[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.220]
They got the 2626 points. They're 13 and four. They've got 26 points. And the sad part of it is

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.280]
that they're on their way somewhere. Maybe the Nashville. Maybe do who knows where.

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.980]
I was going to say on their way to San Jose. And I'm sure the fans there would gladly swap

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.240]
because the sharks couldn't get arrested in the panty rate in Fort Lauderdale. But the bottom

[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.120]
line is now with sports. And I told you it's all over. I hate to tell you that, but it's all over.

[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.780]
Every day now you open up the paper. A butt Adams is threatening to move. He's moving Houston

[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.540]
in two years. The Oilers to Nashville. And the Astros are going to national less. They have like

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.760]
five billion people there are game next season. And all of a sudden the crap and art models going

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.380]
to Baltimore. And Winnipeg is moving out of the

[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:52.660]
musical teams now. How the hell are you going to have any loyalty? Then this is a situation created by

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.400]
the owners and the players in the regions with all these big salaries. And all of a sudden they got

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.160]
out of control. They were losing their ass because of their own stupidity. And we're supposed to

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.180]
suffer for it. You think there's been a rebellion against sports this past year would mainly the

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.040]
baseball thing. You just wait. Man, you ain't seen nothing yet. You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.320]
Here's a good name for a song. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. All right. I have

[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.160]
no one to smoke this last night wanting to listen to Dr. Demandto. And I pay you a little

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.100]
list. That's the name of the show. Smoke this. Yeah, really. I thought that's what Brian said to

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.940]
a Phil Henry. Smoke this. Well, the reason why it's like it was all about the cigar trap.

[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.900]
Who wants to share that? It's a show about cigars. Yeah. I mean, I like smoking cigars,

[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.680]
but I don't know what there is to hear about. I mean, they were talking about how you roll it,

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.660]
how you tell about the moisture and all this crap. Are you sure they were talking about cigars?

[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.500]
Yeah, sir. Yeah. And I just wish they would just keep that crap off the air. How to roll

[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.880]
cigars. That should be I'd like WQBA or something on some Julio station. Yeah. They begin to roll

[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.460]
in cigars, the Julio's. Well, it's like I rather hear like tapes of you and the best of Neil,

[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.560]
the best of Phil or even. You'll be able to hear plenty of tapes of me pretty soon when I go

[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.320]
on vacation. There's plenty of tapes coming. All right. And just to make it even happier,

[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.520]
the best to fill this afternoon from two to six. Cool. Already. Thanks. Okay. Thanks for the report.

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.140]
Okay. It's another words of show stuff. I didn't say that. See, they're going to get all

[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.080]
of them out of shape. He didn't even hear the show and he's ripping it. I'm not ripping anything.

[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.660]
I just looking for some spy report. Maybe a lot of people loved it. The only thing is stop and

[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.860]
think about this. Oh, I see. Just as I said that George put a cigar in his purse. Now he's not

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.700]
going to smoke it, of course, because smoking is not allowed in the building. Any more than I'm

[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.200]
smoking it when I got my hand right now. But what percentage of people do you think smokes cigars?

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800]
Small, but that's the latest trend. But they have only 10% of women.

[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.100]
No, actually, women are smoking those little ones now. They like having something small in their mouth.

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.900]
But anyway, I'll pass. But anyway, I'll pick yours. Yeah. No, seriously, what percentage of people

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.180]
really do think are cigar smokers, no matter how trendy it might be? Now 10% of more that talking

[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.260]
about women. Okay, sorry. He gets very upset. Here's, then we just do Hollywood or my dream.

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.680]
And now you're too busy playing with that cigar. Here's Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.480]
Wait a minute. Do you smoke cigars? Sometimes. Oh, okay. There you go. Keep a

[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.800]
pull on this. I got you down. If it looks like a duck and plays like a duck, it must be Brian.

[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.580]
Yeah. So when I suck my duck, right? Exactly. Have an idea. Okay, thanks. Yeah, everybody's

[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.940]
real upset for you with Brian Cox. Okay. And of course, they're trying desperately. I'm sure this

[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.180]
is something he had stuff over there. QA. I'm looking to get some publicity and try to drum up some

[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.120]
support. I punched over to them like for 10 seconds this morning. Must have been right at nine o'clock.

[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.220]
And the kids they've got on the year not only sound like they're 10 years old, but now they sound

[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.840]
like they're on a helium super saber. I just don't understand it. They sound like 10 year olds

[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.580]
on helium. And that's Q. I. M. And they think they got a goddamn radio station over there.

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.920]
And we got a guy doing a hockey games. Who's doing. What is that? Chris Moore on drugs or something.

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.420]
Well, what is that all about? So Brian, you can keep trying all you want, baby, but you're on the

[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.360]
losing side on the field off the field everywhere just like the dolphins, man. Okay. So when Shula packs

[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.740]
up and leaves down, he can stick you in his big suitcase and take. I'm sure a lot of people would agree.

[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:37.460]
Okay. Take you right along with him. Take your stupid ugly ass right along with him. Here's the

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.080]
but I'm just only one problem. Well, this is the guy you're looking for, George. This is the

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.200]
guy that drove all the way down here. Did not get the tickets because George might tell him what I

[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.540]
got. Yeah, don't go away at the end. All right. I'll just go ahead. You're going to embarrass me on the

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.900]
air. See you now. Oh, wait a minute. Do you hear that? Oh, this guy, he's, listen, we're going to

[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.500]
more than make up for you. You're going to register for the tragic trip. We're going to give you

[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.000]
tickets to another game. We're going to give you meals at the pizza lot. We're going to make up for

[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.580]
it 10 times over because George is a butt plug. That's cool. How do you like that? Right. And I apologize

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.320]
profusely for George being such an asshole and forgetting to leave your tickets. Yeah, I was

[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.800]
going to go all the way down here from Boynton Beach and George forgot to leave him his tickets.

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.840]
It's all night working, everything. Nice. But I just wanted to call you and let you know

[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.120]
that's what happened. So also when you do come down to get your other stuff with Jaguarity,

[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.220]
we'll be here. We're going to tie George up, put him in a corner and let you beat him about 20

[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.100]
times over the head with the two by four. How's that? That's a two by four. Will a hockey stick?

[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.060]
I don't work. Okay, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Okay, we'll make up to you.

[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.760]
There's a guy named who you were looking for. Okay, see, and he called me. He didn't call you.

[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.700]
We called me because he knew that I would take care of it. He knew if he called you, you'd make an

[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:46.260]
excuse. We have an open line in Broward 5249 463 524 WIOD. Boy, you go out of town for a couple

[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.220]
of days just for a long weekend and you come back, man, and the spit hits the fan. It's incredible.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.340]
And here's this Rachel Alexander writing this almost tearful column about poor Brian Cahnk

[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.300]
who's making millions of dollars and going out there and making a jackass out of himself,

[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.060]
getting a lot of stupid penalties and which he has consistently, by the way, since he's been on

[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.000]
the team in spite of all the talk about what a great linebackery is and all the great plays that

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.020]
he almost makes, but he goes out there and makes a jackass and a pull out himself over and over

[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.520]
and over again. So, my ****, but Rachel's on his side because I guess you don't like Phil.

[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.460]
Now, didn't Andy Cal bring that bitch in here that day? That was the day that I was out there in

[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.560]
the hallways screaming and yelling with Steve Nichol in the hall. And that was the day that Andy,

[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.620]
this is his good close buddy, Rachel Alexander. Better know his brandy to some of her close personal

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.260]
friends. And she allegedly loves my show and she loves Phil and Yadda Yadda. They all give you

[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.700]
that song and dance to your face. But, boy, when I get a chance to give you a good shot right in the

[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.960]
back, man, where it hurts the most, there's Rachel right on it, right on top of it. 1037 at WIOD,

[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.020]
equipment. The EVS will soon be replaced with the emergency alert system. The EAS will provide

[00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:00.160]
timely emergency warnings. This station serves a Miami Fort Lauderdale area. This concludes this

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:06.540]
emergency broadcast system test. The opinion expressed by the host guests or callers on WIOD

[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.680]
Any questions? If the most controversial topic on Capitol Hill and later today, you'll hear

[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.600]
the debate live on Seaspan. I still can't believe my Republican brothers are supporting a bunch

[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:47.020]
of home-ones. Mr. Helm, that's HMO. Not HOMO. Oh, can I change my vote? Yes,

[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.540]
the confusing debate over healthcare continues and you'll hear it live later today on Seaspan.

[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.960]
Okay, 1042 at WIOD and let's smoke right along here, shall we? Because smoking cigars is in.

[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.180]
cigarettes are bad, they'll kill you, but smoking cigars is in. Just ask us, we'll tell you.

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.460]
Here's Miami. Hello. How's it going, Neil? Great. Yeah, good vacation. It's nice to hear.

[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.300]
It was not a vacation. It was just a preview to vibe vacation. This was just a three-day

[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.300]
vacation. I was just warming up for vacation. That's good. Listen, by the way, do you smoke cigars?

[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.300]
Not personally. My dad did. Okay. Wait, he did? Now he's dead? Now he's dead. Oh, see what I mean?

[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.140]
Okay, well, listen, since you were going Friday, you must have missed sports talk and

[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.980]
Mandatchgay's D-fo or anything like I've never heard. Mandatchgay's D-fo or RIP?

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.880]
Chastisement. Now this was before Michigan beat Purdue 5 and nothing. Exactly.

[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.080]
In front of 103,000 people at Ann Arbor against the Girl School and squeaked by a 5-nothing on Saturday.

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.780]
And after Monday, when he said to D-fo that he didn't want to talk about it, he didn't want to,

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840]
it was done. The whole thing, you know, the scenario with Brian Talks in the room where they,

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.560]
you know, they, I got to hear about this. I have to hear all the details on this.

[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:10.240]
Oh, okay, this is the unbelievable. Mandatchg starts to show with real nice Joe Villalata too.

[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.100]
He's ready to go on. As always. Right, exactly. So Mandatchgay goes now, wait a minute.

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.640]
And I want to get this straight. What side are you on?

[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:25.120]
You're on, wait a minute. What side is he on? Exactly. What side are you on? Are you on, are you on,

[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.400]
are you on the side of the dolphins? Are you on, are you on WIOD's position side?

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.480]
Oh my God. WIOD's position side on a station that rips the management more than any station

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.700]
in the history of broadcasting. And WIOD has got a position.

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.080]
Well, so then D-fo tries to calm him down. But Mandatchgay goes, no, stop kissing my ass.

[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.520]
Look, my ass. Stop kissing my ass. Stop kissing my ass and start.

[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.240]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, stop the floor play. Yeah. And then he says,

[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.400]
right down to it. Exactly. And then he says, you know, what does WIOD stand for?

[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.540]
And immediately in my head, I hear Center One, AIDS research. I mean, you know, helping people with

[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.580]
aid, helping the homeless in previous years. And that's what I'm thinking. And he's going,

[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.740]
what does WIOD stand for? Nothing. What does that mean?

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.960]
Don't ask me. I mean, I guess he's trying to insult the, I mean, he's trying to say, you know,

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.540]
because because WIOD would be so low to play with a thing and brittle.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.920]
We're playing with a thing. And so I guess this cost is ego. Yeah. Exactly.

[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.420]
So in other words, Mandatchgay has had a brine cox's ass. Is that what you're telling me?

[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.380]
Basically unbelievable. Yeah. And it got really, and it got nasty.

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.540]
Yeah. And what does D-fo say? D-fo said, well, I know you're the biggest, you know, you and I both,

[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.640]
he goes on the biggest fans of Phil Hendry and what he does. He goes, don't bring personalities into this.

[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.720]
Really? Says Mandatch. Don't bring personality to this. And he was really, yeah.

[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.100]
He was, he was livid. I love it. Yeah. I love it. God, I give anything to hear that.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.500]
So the Don Chulashow started and then, you know, that comms, Mandatch, that comms.

[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.640]
Yeah, they started getting that tongue out again. Waxing it up. Exactly.

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.940]
Incredible. Unbelievable. Well, I just want to tell you about that.

[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.000]
And thanks for the good news. I'm sure we'll hear lots more.

[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.100]
Hey, yeah, please do. Well, I wonder what side he's on. Yeah.

[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.460]
He's on the dolphin ass-looking side is the side that he's on.

[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.060]
Well, you know what I don't understand. I wonder how much the dolphins are paying him.

[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.460]
Last time I checked, he gets his paycheck from this place.

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.540]
He's a lot of these two. Yeah, exactly. I mean, uh, I mean, where is this who is,

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.260]
do his, do his real loyalty flight? Not with this place.

[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.780]
Yeah. Or the, or the plate, the, the team he used to play on.

[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.320]
Right. That's it. You know, and another thing, I'm going to tell you one thing.

[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.800]
This is an inside story. Yeah. I know personally the coach has threatened him

[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.680]
that if he comes down on IOD side and on any of these issues,

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.260]
uh, locker room is off limits. Then I have to be in a more, no more showering with the guy.

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.480]
No more showering. That's too bad. I tell you what I'm going to hear.

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.720]
Now you're hitting the man where it really hurts.

[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.960]
Exactly. What I don't understand about Brian Cox is the most important,

[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.320]
most pivotal people in history have not been beyond being used about.

[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.640]
Right. He's a public figure and not only that, but he goes out of his way to make

[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.620]
himself a public figure more than anybody on the dolphins except maybe Marino.

[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.700]
This guy is in the news all the time. He's sticking his finger to the fan.

[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.760]
He's in Buffalo. He's controversial. He's a maniac.

[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.380]
And, uh, and all of a sudden he's beyond criticism.

[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.340]
Exactly. Well, he needs to grow. See, he thinks he's talking about racism.

[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.160]
It's not the color of his skin. It's the thickness of it. That's the problem.

[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.460]
Two thin skin. That's the problem. Brian. It's not the dark skin.

[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.780]
It's the thin skin. Exactly. Here's a thin skin with a pig skin. That's the problem.

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.860]
Well, anyways, uh, well, thanks for the report. You did a great job.

[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.820]
No problem. You'll take it. I have a great life later.

[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.460]
Oh my God. One of the greatest contrutoms in the history of the human race.

[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.780]
Even Frank Wright would be impressed if he were alive.

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.160]
He's dead. We have an open line in date.

[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.840]
751. Who's Frank Wright?

[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.740]
Yeah, he used to wear the silly hats with Chelsea Candy on the horse racing stuff.

[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.140]
With all of the options up there, I was a single radio station.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.960]
I heard the title of the back. You do everything you have.

[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.740]
You go wherever you need to.

[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.540]
And you do it every day.

[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.840]
Help us news.

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.900]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.220]
610 WIOG.

[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.320]
I'm going to start on this film and I'm going to wrap it all year long.

[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:15.580]
Hello.

[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.780]
Hopefully, boring to show.

[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.720]
You believe in truth and advertising?

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.280]
Yes, sir. You do.

[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.080]
Okay.

[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.100]
Don't you think we as a station have been perpetrating a fraud?

[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.880]
Don't you think that they be a guy's climber there?

[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.840]
He's getting a little too far.

[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.640]
I think so.

[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.000]
No question.

[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.540]
I think it's way over the line.

[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.120]
And I and you should be embarrassed.

[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.420]
People sucking around for the work at our station.

[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.900]
Hello, I'm a bear.

[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.580]
I mean, you know, I'm a big film Henry.

[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.660]
So much as you are.

[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.920]
Now, don't start personalities.

[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.040]
I come from a do or do not.

[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.020]
I'm a binary world.

[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.080]
Like it would like to be right.

[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.800]
I'm not wrong.

[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.880]
And I find you on the side of the infidel.

[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.120]
You know, you handled it as well as it could be.

[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.160]
You know, you're going to have no fun or enough.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.780]
Don't bother.

[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.460]
I'm not bothering you.

[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.160]
I agree with you to this extent.

[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.960]
You are a humiliated.

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.180]
Okay.

[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:07.720]
You're all right.

[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.320]
You're right about that.

[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.380]
I'm not talking about you.

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.740]
You don't want it for that.

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.400]
I'm all right.

[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.920]
And then you've got lining the guy.

[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.760]
There's no winning time.

[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.040]
There I mean, you got you.

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.220]
You got your analogies and I'm going to lose this war.

[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.780]
But you would have to agree that the Iprank cops

[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.260]
was going to express himself and is this satisfaction with what was going on with WIOD.

[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.740]
That was not the appropriate forum or the method.

[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.420]
I've got to apologize to the Mark remarks.

[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.220]
The remarks he apologized for.

[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.700]
But I know the wellspring from which those remarks come.

[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:37.600]
Okay.

[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.180]
There you go.

[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.780]
It is out of frustration.

[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.220]
Coming up for the unhappiness.

[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.880]
Not having what an asshole.

[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.820]
The fight back.

[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.520]
What a sickle.

[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.700]
He's got one now.

[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.520]
He's going to start in the favor.

[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.460]
And hopefully this thing will go away.

[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.140]
I think actually Barry Jackson said it right.

[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.340]
Time to get a new thing to jump on.

[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.640]
And let me ask you this.

[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.960]
Bigger question.

[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.060]
Where do we stand?

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.180]
There's a relationship with the Miami Dolphins important to us.

[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:05.980]
I would say so.

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.500]
It is the property of the Miami Dolphins.

[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.720]
We are the flagship stations of Miami Dolphins.

[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.300]
What would be great?

[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.000]
Not that you have to kiss up.

[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.100]
Not that you have to suck.

[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.040]
So why do you keep doing it?

[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.460]
You suck up.

[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.860]
Why do you keep sucking up your mind?

[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:24.020]
But you don't put the franchise and everybody associated with the in play all day

[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.400]
every day and kick it around.

[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.260]
It's nothing wrong with criticism if it's valid.

[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.100]
I think I understand for nothing.

[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.760]
I went a little too far.

[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.740]
This station stands for nothing.

[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.500]
So what about that?

[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.820]
It stands for you and me.

[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.560]
We're going to have a good time on the program tonight.

[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.320]
That's why we're here.

[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.100]
Oh my god.

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.300]
Just unbelievable.

[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.760]
Unbelievable.

[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.500]
Unbelievable.

[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.020]

[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.420]
Is that in Crable or what?

[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:50.600]
Huh?

[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.860]
This station stands for nothing.

[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.240]
And you got to take your sides.

[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.500]
You know, and of course, even though they're paying the paycheck, I'm not saying

[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.500]
be a shield for anybody.

[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.800]
That's why I tell you exactly the way it is.

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.360]
These people are a bunch of gray robbers here.

[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:01.960]
They're just brutal.

[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.100]
But on the other hand, they do sign my paycheck.

[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.520]
So if I have to choose between them and a guy that I'm sticking dolphins,

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.320]
you saw what a tough choice that was.

[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.880]
Dolphins don't put any money in my pocket on the contrary.

[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.220]
It took a lot out for four or five years there and gave me back a bunch of mediocre games.

[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.760]
Week after week after week plus lack of sense of humor.

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.760]
A lack of having any kind of a cohesive brain.

[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.780]
And then that one Mandage had me on at show a couple of times.

[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.520]
And then you notice the last time I was in a round table with him at

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.300]
Suckhole, Erica, what's it read?

[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.340]
And I used to turn the brains down and I said,

[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.880]
demanded, I think your views are a little bit skewed here.

[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.040]
Too many showers with the coach.

[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.140]
That's the last time I was ever on that show.

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.640]
You can go to the bike on that.

[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.020]
Because in Mandage's world, you have to, if you're going to be involved in any way with his dolphins.

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.100]
Which I guess you don't realize he's not the tight end anymore.

[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.840]
He don't wear no uniform, although he does wear a jock strap during the broadcast.

[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.480]
That's why his voice gets so goddamn high.

[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.300]
You jacked out.

[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.940]
But I'm telling you, this guy don't understand it.

[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.560]
He's not part of the dolphins anymore.

[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.280]
He has no objectivity whatsoever.

[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.340]
And to have a man stand there with a live microphone in his face and say,

[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.040]
stroke my **** and then to defend it and try to cover up for it and try to rationalize it like,

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.800]
well, he understands everything that's behind that.

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.300]
Right.

[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.820]
Here's an overpaid big jock who if he weren't playing a football,

[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.800]
might be driving a goddamn tractor out there if he was lucky.

[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.360]
Okay.

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.560]
A big overpaid jock with no sense in humor taking himself much too seriously,

[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.840]
just like the coach and the whole organization, by the way.

[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.000]
And this guy comes down on his side, even when he stood there right in his face and put his

[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.760]
ass on the line.

[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.980]
stroke my **** exactly.

[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]
What a finalist piece of turd you are, Mr. Mandage, okay.

[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.320]
And deep down there, of course, being like, well, well, well, let me say,

[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.120]
yeah, well, yeah, well, yeah, well, yeah.

[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:44.880]
Unbelievable.

[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.720]
Man, what a what a match made in heaven.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.240]
That is two up and lines at day 7519 463 751 W.

[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.220]
I would do one on a green line wanted to see.

[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.440]
And again, what man, it's totally ignores is how did this thing all start?

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.640]
How did the thing all start?

[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.840]
It started a year ago this past summer when fielded his first Brian Cox thing,

[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.660]
which was funny as hell, just like it always is.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.860]
And Brian being the big star that he is with like a spoiled child didn't have any sense

[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.560]
of humor about that and decided he was going to tell all his good buddies on the dolphins.

[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.680]
And he tells them what to do and instruct them in life.

[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.300]
Since evidently they can't make up their own god damn mind.

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.180]
Oh, don't go in none of those shows shine IOD even though it is the dolphin station.

[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.680]
Rick and Suds go over there for the dolphin player breakfast before the season this year.

[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.260]
Nobody comes and talks to him because again, Brian Cox told him to stay away.

[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.040]
And Jim Mandage is concerned about the relationship between W.

[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.120]
I would be in the Miami Dolphins.

[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.140]
I think he's got the thing upside down, baby.

[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.320]
I think you got it as backwards, Mandage.

[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.540]
You got Brian's ass in your **** push is what your problem is.

[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.020]
You're not playing the good one of those.

[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.260]
I'm not playing the good one of those.

[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.100]
So you like that better?

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.680]
Yes.

[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.140]
Okay.

[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.900]
Two open lines at day 7519463.

[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.720]
I think it's about time some of you started coming down on the right side too,

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.220]
which is a side of truth and reality.

[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.780]
Not the side of IOD or the dolphins are Brian Cox.

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.060]
Just objectivity.

[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:02.400]
Okay.

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.060]
Anybody who doesn't have a sense of humor.

[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:05.720]
And of course, it's not.

[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.100]
And then the other episode of ERA GOAL AS SOME MERE

[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.300]
was when Phil did the thing on Shula.

[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.420]
Another hysterical piece about the fact that Shula is not over there on the

[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:14.900]
sideline.

[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.100]
He's up mingling with a crowd in the skybox.

[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.020]
He's having a couple of drinks and Shula.

[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.620]
Who did Shula call the rip and ass?

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.100]
He called his intermediary his lackey.

[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.340]
Old number 88.

[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.160]
His lackey.

[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.560]
He should be Jim lackey.

[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.280]
Not Jim Mandage called him to cut him an ass.

[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.020]
Oh, yeah, we got to cut this off because the brain's them is pissed off.

[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.460]
Well, two goddamn bad.

[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.200]
There's another guy can't take any criticism.

[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.500]
Who's getting paid.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.280]
Who's made millions of dollars off a stupid goddamn game of football.

[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.280]
And this guy, if he's criticized even just a little bit,

[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.480]
if somebody gets their nose out of joint just a little bit with him right away,

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.360]
he's pissed off.

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.000]
And the criticism was mean and it was cruel and it was uncalled for.

[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.720]
Yeah, you're just like all the others, baby.

[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.120]
You're a goddamn football coach.

[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.460]
Okay.

[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.600]
So get with the program and by the way, your team sucks.

[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.420]
Here's a mobile invoker.

[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.700]
Hello.

[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.460]
The dolphins make me sick.

[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:02.880]

[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:03.860]
I'll eat.

[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.360]
I'll eat.

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.620]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.600]
Now, there's a real sport and a real coach.

[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.740]
It's even Mandage said those are real men.

[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.040]
Not a bunch of overgrowth spoil sports, a bunch of pansies.

[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.740]
Where we tend to get a hang the other have to go running to locker room.

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.780]
Open line of days, 751, 9463, 751, W.

[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.780]
This station stands for nothing.

[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.720]
This station stands for something that you haven't got managed and that's balls.

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.160]
This station's got the balls to go on and say a lot of outrageous things.

[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.920]
And to criticize a lot of very popular people when they deserve to be criticized

[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.820]
and to do whatever the hell it takes to make people think it'd be a little bit provocative.

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.180]
This guy's about as provocative as a turd in the goddamn punch bowl.

[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.600]
That's not provocative.

[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:51.060]
He is always the show always the yes man always kissing the ass.

[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.540]
Anybody that wears that uniform and let me say it again.

[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.920]
The best example of that was this goddamn freaks the event and bill when he wasn't

[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.060]
before he came to the dolphins.

[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.520]
And I'll never forget that I was in the car out of weekend listening to sports talk one night

[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.160]
and he's going on a great length.

[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.240]
The caller says well what do you think?

[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.280]
Should they sign Steve M and then he said oh this guy is a case.

[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.280]
He's like a obvious steroid case and he's saying things that in my opinion talk about lawsuits

[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.220]
are actionable.

[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.360]
He's just he's speculating that this guy's done more steroids than Carter's got pills.

[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.500]
Makes Jose Cansoco look like a piker.

[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.320]
And no that's not the kind of guy you want because he's fragile as a china doll

[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.660]
and the first time there's a hit out there.

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.840]
His legs are going to just break like like a china doll and steroids making your bones brittle

[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.800]
and he's going on and then they sign them on the team and right away he's sucking his ass.

[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.520]
How do you like that?

[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.580]
He's sucking the big one.

[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.160]
Yes!

[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:38.900]
Yes!

[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.620]
The only radio station that doesn't suck.

[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.100]
610 WIOD Miami Ford Lauderdale.

[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.380]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.580]
He kept that.

[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.840]
610 WIOD.

[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.860]
Fadell fire in Miami.

[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.440]
Good morning.

[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.020]
At 11 o'clock I'm Terry Griffin.

[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.700]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.940]
610 WIOD brought to you by South Florida Ford.

[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.060]
It's 73 right now in South Florida.

[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.420]
Next news at noon.

[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.540]
Bulletin's at once.

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.500]
I'm Terry Griffin.

[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.420]
News talk and entertainment radio.

[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.360]
610 WIOD.

[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.920]
I don't know if it's just doubling a little bit.

[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.680]
We're all nervous because we're under a lot of pressure.

[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.300]
Mandage has just threatened to take over the radio station to blow up the building.

[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.360]
If we don't come back and you know say it like it ain't.

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]
Anyway it's 11 o'clock.

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.660]
I've noticed by the way speaking of the dolphins that there are games.

[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.660]
A lot of games this season where they've given up gigantic numbers of points

[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.560]
to teams that ordinarily cannot score.

[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.360]
Have you noticed that?

[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.980]
Like the New England Patriots who have had a wolf full time of scoring points all

[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.640]
season long and despite having blood so.

[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.180]
And 34 points sounds like I held a lot of points to me.

[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.140]
But I don't want to dwell on that.

[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.440]
It's not just Hank Goldberg.

[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.820]
It's a hippo polymer.

[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.140]
Any more than I have to other than the rest of the show today and probably the rest of the week.

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.420]
This Mandage thing is just so absolutely incredible.

[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.060]
And also with this Rachel Alexander with this twisted story.

[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.720]
I think you better get your history right sweetheart and find out the origins of this real thing.

[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.840]
She does make reference to the fact that last summer.

[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.640]
Phil was doing the thing on Brian Cox.

[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.060]
She doesn't make any reference to the thing about Shula.

[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.840]
And the fact that Mandage was the intermediary they were acting on behalf of his

[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.920]
close personal buddy.

[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.020]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.040]
Okay and I hate to say this.

[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.980]
I hate to say it but I'll say it anyway.

[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.060]
At least Joe Rose.

[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.020]
The guy with the bad with the big gap in his teeth there that should never be on TV.

[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.860]
At least Joe Rose is another former dolphin player by the way.

[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.160]
Not exactly in the caliber of Mandage.

[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.800]
Well both Marge and

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.840]
but anyway Joe Rose at least he goes on here and he's not a Shula.

[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.540]
He rips Shula and asks when he deserves it.

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.480]
And we got a guy.

[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.960]
We got the X Dolphin here who I once upon a time thought it got some balls

[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.160]
unless when it counts.

[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.520]
Okay.

[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.860]
I thought this guy had a real pair and it turns out he does but they're like babies.

[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.400]
They're like ball bearings is what this man has for balls.

[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.120]
How do you like that?

[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.060]
And it does have a bearing on what's going on here man.

[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.520]
We're not going to show for the dolphin just because with the dolphin station we never have except him.

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.200]
Even Mr. Weaver.

[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.640]
Even Mr. Weaver man.

[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.300]
All they had to do was like think about making a bad play and right away he turned on him like a rat

[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.620]
which I'm not saying we have to do.

[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.000]
But you'll recall those days I'm sure those of you veterans who suffered through that

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.180]
and probably wish you were still suffering from it because guess what we got now.

[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.340]
Like I said guess what we got now is what I said.

[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.100]
There you go.

[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.100]
Okay we have an open line on the 18th wireless to purple line pound IOD one on a green line on this

[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.240]
cathartic Monday we're going to give it out of our systems.

[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.960]
It's more than just a guy damn ballgame.

[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.240]
It's a whole philosophy of life evidently.

[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.100]
This man that's and DFO you know see DFO's problem is he's too nice of a guy you know

[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.780]
he's just the old corny a guy you know you don't expect guys from the earth to be corny

[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.200]
but DFO is he's got more corny and ten minutes than you'll find in the whole state of Iowa.

[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.800]
But that's just the way he is and he's not a confrontational guy so in mandates just out of

[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.880]
the blue turned on him like a rat like a cornered rat I guess he just didn't know how to do

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.980]
except extend that tongue.

[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.860]
A lot of people extending a lot of tongues these days here's a mobile on the alley hello.

[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:04.620]
Hello Neil yes sir never called you before listening since before the bird yes Neil the thing is

[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.840]
yeah Brian Cox is an apple he has got the worst attitude of any ball player I've ever seen.

[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.540]
I think I think that we can unanimously agree except for mandates Brian Cox is an asshole I think

[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.300]
we can agree with that.

[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.740]
So my **** yeah and the thing is is I don't believe he's an asset to the team and I think Phil

[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.640]
Henry is a genius.

[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:30.320]
Yes he is and I have one thing is that if that's what it comes down to my choosing between Phil Henry

[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.820]
and Brian Cox that's a no-brainer you know what I'm saying.

[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.400]
And it's not even a contest.

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.340]
Yeah but let me say something for let me say something on tape later.

[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:39.860]
Yeah.

[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:41.520]
Unbelievable.

[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.280]
It is.

[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.160]
Bye.

[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.540]
Okay pal see the audience they got there are priorities right they know what the else going on

[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.760]
because they've been following this thing for like a year and a half now they've seen the origins of

[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.640]
it and if you're going to be in a public spotlight if you're going to be in the public eye

[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.620]
and you don't have a sense of humor then you've got a real problem but I think today we can

[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.840]
maybe there will be a couple of suck holes out there but I think it's almost the

[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.700]
anonymous we can agree that Brian Cox is.

[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.260]
At all.

[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:05.720]
Exactly.

[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.860]
And now of course Brian's going to have to go speaking to schools tell a little kids oh my

[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.700]
kids are all upset and I'm not an asshole.

[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.600]
Well how do you prove that?

[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.040]
How do you prove it?

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.140]
I mean he went around speaking to kids to prove that he wasn't out of control in a maniac or

[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.740]
ludic whatever they were calling him in the media.

[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.700]
So now he's going to go I have to run around a school first tell the kids that he's not a

[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.020]
homo and number two that he's not an asshole.

[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.020]
How do you do that?

[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.880]
Because quite frankly I know that if I'm a jock after a ball game even if it was a tough game

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.440]
or a good game or whatever and that was after a win that was after they won the goddamn game

[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.020]
and I talked to a guy who supposedly a friend of mine and a show for me all the time and I look

[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.480]
him in the face and I say I'm an asshole.

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:47.720]
Agreed?

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.420]
Agreed?

[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:48.680]
Yes.

[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.400]
Okay.

[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.760]
So we can all be in agreement right?

[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:52.320]
Yes.

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.480]
Here is for Lauderdale hello.

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.780]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.180]
Okay.

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:56.820]
Welcome back.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.700]
Thank you so much.

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.240]
It's a pretty vacation.

[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.060]
Yeah it was great.

[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.260]
I got a baby little too.

[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:00.820]
Oh yeah.

[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.080]
It's always better when you win yes?

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.060]
A little mini uh you had a little one?

[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.360]
A jingle.

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:04.840]
Okay.

[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.120]
Ryan Cox.

[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.460]
Ryan Cox.

[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:16.060]
He made me ill to life throw up some chunks with a suck my duck and give manage the bone.

[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.500]
Please go back home and make your boyfriend moan.

[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:19.860]
Oh!

[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.780]
All right.

[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.700]
Thank you.

[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.200]
So yeah.

[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.040]
Okay that was your words doing a voice.

Every time somebody scores a goal they throw rats out under the eye.

[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.200]
So let's do that for the dolphins.

[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:40.820]
Get them going.

[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.560]
Every time they score a touchdown we'll throw an F&G of Brian Cox out on the field.

[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.620]
What kind of like a rat?

[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.140]
It's kind of an insult to rats.

[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.240]
And then when they score you'd say hey, throw out your Brian.

[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.440]
Because I'm not going to say what you think I'm going to say.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.980]
Rick and I, 6 to 10 am on News Talk at Intercanement Radio, 610-W-I-O-D.

[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.520]
Look at the **** on that blonde man.

[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.240]
11-13 to W-I-O-D.

[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.200]
Why did I just play that?

[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.820]
I'll tell you why.

[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.180]
Because here's a man we just got through here hearing them say like 20 minutes ago

[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.660]
about he lives in a world where there's blacks and whites and no shades of gray

[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.480]
where everything is either right or wrong.

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.700]
Which of course is a crocker crap.

[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.260]
But nevertheless didn't he just say that?

[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.580]
That's something is either right or wrong and that if there are like seven words

[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.480]
that you're not allowed by the FCC to say on the air that even if you're a

[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.720]
jockey still can't say it on the air.

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.180]
Look at the **** on that blonde man.

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.620]
Right there from W-I-O-D radio about two years ago.

[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.260]
Right on Sports Talk, okay?

[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.780]
You see, man, it's you don't practice what you preach, baby.

[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.120]
You're a goddamn hypocrite and you try any way out of the sun to rationalize

[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.640]
your ass sucking performance when it comes to Don Shula, Dan Merino,

[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.840]
or anybody who wears that goddamn dolphin uniform.

[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.500]
The assistant coaches who are ineptes the day is long.

[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.180]
Oh yeah, but I don't know anything about it.

[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:47.920]
He's the expert.

[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.880]
You see, when you're too close to a situation, you have no objectivity.

[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.760]
You can't be the expert.

[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.140]
You're right in the middle of it.

[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.820]
When you're right there in the locker room, dropping at so pleating,

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.460]
oh, here, here, let me pick it up for you, okay?

[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.440]
Then you got a little bit of a problem being objective.

[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.940]
You can't see the forest for the knees.

[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.340]
Huh? Isn't that our new slogan out in the locker room?

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.060]
You can't see the forest for the knees.

[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:09.960]
The knees?

[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.340]
How'd she get in a bus?

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.580]
Here's Boka. Hello.

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.360]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.960]
Okay, sir.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.160]
You have a nice vacation.

[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.380]
It wasn't a vacation.

[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.800]
I just went for a three-day weekend.

[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.320]
Don't keep saying vacation because I have a vacation coming up

[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.420]
and then everybody's going to say another vacation already.

[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.780]
Okay, I got two fiery ports for you.

[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.820]
Wasn't it a holiday Friday?

[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.340]
It was Veterans.

[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.080]
Brandy's Tate were pitiful.

[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.740]
I had to turn a channel.

[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.240]
Really?

[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.640]
Yeah, they were pretty bad.

[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.320]
Pretty lame.

[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.100]
And I got another one for you.

[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.420]
Is Hank Goldberg, the number one rated pop show host

[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.840]
in the two to six slot?

[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.000]
No, he is absolutely not.

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.940]
Well, that's what they're claiming on QAM.

[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.400]
They said that all.

[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.300]
Yeah, one in one demographic.

[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.060]
Well, you know, so what they're looking,

[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.680]
they can say they're number one in pigmies.

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.600]
Nobody with a brain believes any of that crap.

[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:55.820]
Right.

[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.140]
I think they know the problem with frying top.

[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:58.600]
Yeah.

[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.280]
It's called steroid rage.

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.060]
What do you know what it is?

[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.520]
Too much steroid.

[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.340]
You're the one that said that.

[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.060]
Maybe Steve Emman came in a town and loaned him some.

[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.480]
See, see to me if there was anything

[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.160]
that was actionable concerning sports

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.500]
that's ever been set on the station.

[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.300]
It was managed ripping into Emman about steroids

[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.880]
when he was only guessing.

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.800]
Now, he could be correct.

[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.060]
I don't know for sure, but that to me seems actionable.

[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:18.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.400]
10-4.

[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:19.800]
Right.

[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.700]
I hear you.

[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.900]
Hey, buddy, the panthers are looking really good.

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.740]
They're kicking in.

[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:23.820]

[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.300]
He's doing it.

[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.120]
He is doing it.

[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.880]
They're right next to Orac.

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.420]
They are doing it.

[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.120]
Of course, tomorrow night, I'm going to have a little bit

[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.500]
of a problem because it's the one who visit

[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.640]
by my Toronto Maple Leafs in the town every year.

[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.740]
And I will be wearing my Maple Leafs jacket

[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.800]
and my blue and white.

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.820]
And you know something if you don't like it too bad, okay?

[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.200]
I'll try to be quiet.

[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.840]
I'll try to suppress my emotions

[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.020]
and not make too much of a jackass out of myself.

[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.300]
But when you've been a fan of a team for 37 years,

[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.720]
you don't just, and especially,

[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.780]
you don't give it up for a team

[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.080]
that's going to be leaving any minute.

[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.520]
As much as I love my panthers and I do,

[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.940]
and yes, I will be there at the Vancouver Game Thursday night.

[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.440]
But tomorrow night, it's, you know,

[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.220]
you'll have to excuse me, okay?

[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.640]
Here's the bokeh on eight.

[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:00.980]
Hello.

[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:01.640]
Dale.

[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.740]
How you doing?

[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:03.860]
What is it?

[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:04.440]
How you doing?

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.240]
I did good.

[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.160]
I got what you're saying.

[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.560]
How you doing?

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.440]
I got a CDS.

[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.240]
I actually had it in bulk.

[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.260]
I bought this book.

[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.400]
It's what?

[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.120]
There's no CD in my borders book.

[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:13.660]
Not yet.

[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.880]
Opening any day, though,

[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.040]
and for a lot of day, I bought it.

[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.740]
It's up, but you'll see these in there.

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.040]
Not on the six-hundreds, you see these in there.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.440]
They're not?

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.040]
Nope.

[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:20.560]
Why not?

[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.560]
I have no idea.

[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.980]
They didn't have everything to hurry you.

[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.140]
I'll tell you what you're doing.

[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:24.400]
You too?

[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.100]
Are you crappin' me?

[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.620]
I'm sure.

[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.580]
I've heard of borders in my little screen there, I suppose.

[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.860]
I had a question.

[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.180]
I'll just be first brought on a data.

[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:31.960]
Yes, I am.

[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.760]
At the end of the day, the product said,

[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.420]
if you don't listen to some show,

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.640]
you don't know the ICK word, the CUC said.

[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:39.640]
Yeah.

[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.820]
If you don't listen to the show, you don't know Dick.

[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.100]
Well, that's probably the PD over there.

[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.400]
I couldn't get the flip after the...

[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.580]
Because it depends on usage.

[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.240]
If you can say spotted dick,

[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.400]
which you got and know something about,

[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:50.840]
are you British?

[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:51.240]
Yep.

[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.540]
Well, you know spotted dick.

[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.140]
That's true.

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.620]
Probably a lot of guys that over-

[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.060]
haven't launched,

[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.580]
are gonna have you having that today.

[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:57.760]
Okay.

[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.000]
All right, deal.

[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:58.560]
Okay.

[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.520]
Of course, let me dish back.

[00:40:59.680 --> 00:40:59.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.420]
I'll move.

[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.160]
I'll map me.

[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:01.680]
Get her up.

[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.420]
You'll find her's back.

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.120]
Okay, tata.

[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.060]
We have an open line.

[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.020]
Is that what they have for lunch?

[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.040]
Or is the Adolphin Training Headquarters spotted dick?

[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.160]
Maybe.

[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:10.840]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.480]
You know something.

[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.560]
It just dawns on me.

[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.260]
Maybe we must understood that.

[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.020]
Maybe Brian was offering a manage,

[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.280]
a little snack.

[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.160]
So, my d-

[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:19.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:21.640]
Huh?

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.180]
Didn't Adolphin's play?

[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.880]
No, they've played in Japan one.

[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.860]
Here, I'm wondering if they ever played

[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.260]
an exhibitionist game in England.

[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:28.940]
We'll figure it out.

[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.480]
Here's Miami.

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:30.880]
Hello.

[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.400]
What does he, as yes, sir?

[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.520]
What about those dolphins now?

[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.240]
They're doing it.

[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.520]
Yeah, you're uh...

[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.820]
They're doing it with great regularity.

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.840]
Your page has finally got those dolphins.

[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:41.280]
Yep.

[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640]
Well, see when we play a girls team, we have a chance of winning.

[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.220]
Yeah, I want to see them calling now and talk about the dolphins.

[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.080]
Yeah, give me crap about Drew Bledsohn

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.580]
about how they don't have any receivers.

[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.280]
Brisbane made what help when I was catch there.

[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.100]
And how about that deflection catch the coach caught

[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.380]
for the touchdown, the Enzo.

[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.640]
That looked pretty good to me.

[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.160]
And Curtis Martin running like a maniac.

[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.480]
They looked okay to me yesterday.

[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.180]
They're coming along.

[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.520]
What about that girl, Marino?

[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.120]
Yep.

[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.320]
Breaking all the records and all the...

[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.140]
Oops, there goes the ball.

[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.120]
One thing, I just started the act and the diet.

[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:06.540]
Yeah.

[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.820]
And I can't eat no eggs.

[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.820]
What do I eat for breakfast?

[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.260]
It's just a thing.

[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.400]
What do you mean you can't eat no eggs?

[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:10.960]
You can eat...

[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.380]
I'm allergic to it.

[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:11.920]
Oh, I see.

[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:12.920]
How about bacon?

[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.600]
How about ham?

[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.440]
Okay.

[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.460]
How about like a breakfast steak?

[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.640]
How about sausages?

[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.860]
Okay, and our sausage, uh...

[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.520]
You can't get the one with sugar in it though, right?

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.980]
Yeah, you just...

[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.680]
Forget about the sugar.

[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.020]
If it's got the...

[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.920]
No nitrates and if it's got like very little sugar,

[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.700]
don't worry about it.

[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.400]
Okay.

[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.560]
You got to check the carb grams.

[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.820]
That's the only thing you need to worry about

[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.540]
is carbohydrates.

[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:31.660]
Okay, now.

[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.080]
Okay.

[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.560]
And closing.

[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.100]
Do you spag?

[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.320]
High zinger.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:35.880]
Okay.

[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.420]
Okay.

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.400]
See ya.

[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.260]
Dean and Colwayne and douchebag, did he?

[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:39.920]
My God.

[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.740]
All these owners, man, all you sports owners, kiss our ass.

[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.120]
We're in High Linger.

[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.040]
If you were a sports fan, how'd you like to be looking at Houston right now?

[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.500]
They're getting the double whammy.

[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.760]
The Astros were leaving.

[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040]
And the oilers were leaving.

[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.240]
In fact, the oilers were leaving.

[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.200]
They should pack them in sandwich.

[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.000]
They're good riddance.

[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.580]
Oh, and then part of the deal with the oilers is

[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.620]
that one of the things that they work on,

[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.500]
and also with the Astros,

[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.320]
they want a new stadium by the end of the century,

[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.800]
which is like in five years or less.

[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.060]
They got the Astro dome, which granted was built back in the 60s,

[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.640]
but it was the first dome stadium.

[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.600]
And still a pretty dang good shape.

[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.160]
But this is the new deal.

[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.480]
Now, either built me new stadium.

[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.080]
I'm going to pick up my goodies and leave.

[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.000]
Well, see ya.

[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.080]
Huh?

[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.240]
I think the sports fans, all 10 of us left in America

[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.540]
because people are getting pretty goddamn

[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.960]
disgusted paying this big money.

[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.420]
All to get together and send a message to all these owners.

[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.040]
See ya.

[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:33.740]
Yeah.

[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.280]
I like that.

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.820]
Why do I get to go to a Cleveland now?

[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.300]
See ya.

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.460]
What is...

[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.140]
See ya.

[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.720]
Is that the same one that's on here or not?

[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.060]
Wait a minute.

[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.180]
See ya.

[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:43.940]
Oh, it is.

[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.300]
Because it's got that little extra thing on it,

[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.060]
which I don't think the other one.

[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.680]
One moment, please.

[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.240]
Okay, I'm just checking my goods here.

[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.900]
How's he doing, by the way?

[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.560]
How's his prostate?

[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.180]
See ya, okay?

[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.780]
We don't know.

[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.880]
And what, wait a minute.

[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.700]
What do you mean we don't know?

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.760]
Hasn't he called in to see how we don't?

[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.040]
See how we don't tell him?

[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.560]
You heard it was not a tumor?

[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:03.700]
What is it?

[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.380]
An infection.

[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.680]
It was just an infection?

[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.500]
See ya, buddy.

[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.040]
And I was feeling so sorry for him.

[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.040]
Now let's start ripping him again.

[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.560]
Okay, we have an open line in day at 751.

[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.320]
Are you serious?

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:15.920]
That's the rumor.

[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.360]
Oh, the rumor is, Jazmique does not have a big tumor on his prostate.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.640]
It's just an infection.

[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.260]
I wonder where a guy like that would get an infection.

[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.500]
Here is probably on his prostate.

[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.380]
Here's Miami Beach.

[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:26.680]
Hello.

[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.600]
Uh, Neil.

[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.820]
Good morning.

[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.420]
Welcome home.

[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:29.800]
Thanks.

[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.020]
Yeah, you already heard it.

[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.340]
Grantee Roads was pathetic.

[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:32.880]
Yeah.

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.380]
Thank you, Danielle.

[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.260]
Neil, I'm calling specifically about Phil Henry.

[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.760]
I know you think he's a genius, sir.

[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.400]
No, I don't think.

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.420]
Now, didn't you call me once before with the same comments?

[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.080]
No, sir.

[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:41.380]
Never.

[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:41.900]
Okay.

[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.140]
Never did this first time I've called him.

[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.340]
Okay.

[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.760]
I'm going to see you for 20 years.

[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.600]
Because anybody that starts messing with Phil Henry is going to have to step over my body.

[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.060]
I'll tell you that.

[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.420]
Well, this is my problem.

[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:56.820]
My problem is is that my, my wife's grandmother called him a week ago in the afternoon.

[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.520]
What is she calling?

[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.800]
Call him to speak to him on the telephone.

[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.060]
Yeah.

[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:05.260]
Phil had my wife's grandmother on the floor dialing the telephoto.

[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.540]
Oh, I love it.

[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.120]
With her nose.

[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.160]
She was the moron, huh?

[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.660]
Yeah, but the problem is that Neil is beautiful up to a point.

[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.820]
The problem is the lady had a heart attack.

[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:14.160]
Yeah.

[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.040]
While she was on the floor, I went her telephone with her nose.

[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.960]
This was your mother-in-law?

[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.380]
My wife's grandmother.

[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.880]
Oh, your wife's grandmother?

[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.000]
Why didn't she be having a party then?

[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.200]
All right.

[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.460]
Have a nice life.

[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:26.900]
Okay.

[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.340]
Boy, that was weak, huh?

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.040]
That was really lame.

[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.540]
Who's that guy?

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.300]
Was that one the writers for the Sun Sentinel?

[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.660]
I was probably Ray Wretched.

[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.480]
We have an open line in date, 7519,

[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.140]
for us, that was so lame, Paula.

[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.040]
It was so weak.

[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.720]
See, that's the sense of humor that people out there.

[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.340]
When you find somebody with a real sense of humor like Phil Henry,

[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.500]
you should cherish him and cuddle him and suck his ass instead of like

[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.740]
ripping him like this Rachel bitch at the Sun Sentinel.

[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.860]
Wouldn't know a good radio show if they stuffed the whole guide damn radio up her butt.

[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.180]
You're a simpleton Rachel, okay?

[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.700]
Another one at one of Andy's friends.

[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.480]
What does that tell you?

[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.300]
I'm sorry, Randy.

[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:57.880]
I don't mean you.

[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.820]
Andy Cald.

[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.660]
What a his friends.

[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.080]
That answers it all to me.

[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.400]
1122 at WIOD, when you consider auto security, think about this.

[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.920]
Over 90% of the stolen cars found with low jack also had alarm systems.

[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.280]
Some of them even had factory alarm systems.

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.740]
But these cars were stolen and had to be found using low jack,

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.080]
the stolen vehicle recovery system.

[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:18.820]
Because guess what?

[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.040]
The alarms didn't get them back.

[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.160]
Don't rely on half a security system.

[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.020]
A factory alarm is great.

[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.400]
It's a good start to protect your car from your writers or amateur thieves.

[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.640]
But no factory alarm can defeat the dedicated professional thieves

[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.940]
who strip your car for parts.

[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.740]
They know how to get it.

[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.240]
So to beat the pros, you've got to add low jacks, stolen vehicle recovery device

[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.400]
to your alarm system for total security.

[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.820]
When you visit your new or used car dealer, ask about low jacks free,

[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.680]
car alarm offer.

[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.800]
Low jack will help make sure your car is fully protected from the amateurs

[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.480]
and the professionals alike.

[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.820]
So get the low down on low jack on participating auto dealers in software,

[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.960]
which is just about all of them.

[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.480]
Our call is toll free number and they'll help set you up with low jack

[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.560]
in the car you're driving now.

[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.640]
1-800-53-LO-JACK.

[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.480]
1-800-535-6522 for low jacks,

[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.740]
the stolen vehicle recovery system that gives you peace of mind.

[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:03.300]
And guess what?

[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:03.980]
It works.

[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.680]
And kick your way to the Super Bowl with noor lights

[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.940]
and news talk and entertainment radio.

[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.240]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.960]
Hey, Neil, this is Randy West.

[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.200]
And if you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy,

[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.420]
you should try girls.

[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.400]
You haven't already seen jumping over her fence,

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.380]
snooping down the trees.

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.460]
Don't get too close to her.

[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.720]
You might catch your disease.

[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.820]
You said you wished you'd marry or to kill her.

[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.000]
Why don't you just make up your fake mind?

[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:14.780]

[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:19.140]
You'll fall your wrist and whip them down a cril's hub.

[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.880]
See her behind.

[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.980]
Stoking Madonna, dying to get her love.

[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.660]
For your husband, cut her from the stume of sex.

[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:33.480]
Oh.

[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.220]
OK, love with 28 at WI-D, where we stand for something.

[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.900]
We'll figure out what it is.

[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.220]
We stand for being like irreverent.

[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:49.640]
How's that?

[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.140]
There's a good word we're irreverent.

[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.680]
And we don't have no sacred cows here.

[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.460]
Even if they do wear a goddamn jockstrap.

[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.220]
How do you like that, man?

[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.500]
And by the way, five nothing against the girls' school.

[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.960]
And Michigan right there in that armoured front of a hundred

[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.180]
and three thousand people.

[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.880]
Against Purdue.

[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.040]
Even Bob Greasy, no word for Purdue anymore.

[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.320]
That's how bad they are, OK?

[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:11.960]
Unbelievable.

[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:12.780]
Five nothing.

[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.900]
Michigan State, by the way, pounded Indiana right there in Indiana.

[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.340]
I just thought I would mention that.

[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.560]
The same Michigan State team that beat up on Michigan

[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.460]
the week before, I just thought I would mention that too.

[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.120]
And came from behind twice in the late stages

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.680]
and kicked their ass in East Lansing.

[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.660]
So I think that's what's causing them to go through this period.

[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.420]
Maybe needs to pull the string.

[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.380]
Here's a pompano.

[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:31.660]
Hello.

[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.560]
Hey, Dale.

[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.660]
Yeah, those dolphins suck.

[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:35.260]
Yeah.

[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.040]
How about you ever watch the Shula Show?

[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]
Yeah, but if they win next weekend,

[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.000]
somebody will be calling and saying,

[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.020]
hey, how about those dolphins?

[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:40.860]
Superbowl, baby.

[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.300]
Right.

[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.000]
You're all I do not watch the Shula show under penalty of death.

[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.380]
Uh, watch it for a minute.

[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.580]
Watch Shula's hands, man.

[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.440]
They shake like hell.

[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.060]
And somebody was telling me he's becoming like Howard Cossel, Jr.

[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.040]
I think on IOD from now on instead of shoes, we call him shake.

[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.100]
I like it.

[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.440]
You know, shoes and shakes.

[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.220]
We're calling shakes.

[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.060]
I'm Shula.

[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.280]
I'm f***ing.

[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:58.800]
Oh.

[00:49:59.340 --> 00:49:59.780]
I like it.

[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.520]
How about, um, what happens to these players like Eric Green

[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.960]
and uh, Antmen and M.

[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.760]
They, they, they, they're great.

[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.340]
Ray Armstrong.

[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.920]
Then they get to the dolphins and they suck.

[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.180]
Yeah, how about Tarell Buckley?

[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.300]
Although he wasn't great in Green Bay.

[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.020]
They boot his ass out of there and uh, dolphins didn't learn their lesson.

[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.380]
Yeah, well, you're watching the dolphins secondary, man.

[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.380]
You can't complain about their play because they don't.

[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.340]
They can, they call JB Brown, JB Burns.

[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:18.680]
Yep.

[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.120]
Toast.

[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.320]
How about, uh, play on it?

[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.480]
It's another 20 harder.

[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:21.940]
Oh, did he?

[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.060]
I didn't see that.

[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.460]
I might see the game because I was old.

[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.600]
And again, it was only going to be 18 yarder, but uh, Brian Cox jumped off side.

[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.820]
So it's a 10 yard penalty.

[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.960]
10 yard penalty for left side.

[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.180]
Yeah, for off side.

[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.720]
How do you get a 10 yard penalty for off side?

[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.400]
Whatever it was.

[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:35.880]
Five yards.

[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:36.080]
Yeah.

[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.240]
So five yards back.

[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.940]
So then he also threw a summit down there before they haven't got a 15.

[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.500]
He says he always does that, though.

[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:41.900]
Yeah.

[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.500]
You know, they just don't usually catch it.

[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.420]
And I got a bigger ass lichter than Mandage.

[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:45.680]
Yeah.

[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:45.820]
Yeah.

[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:46.600]
Sofilo.

[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.320]
Oh my god.

[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.340]
Yeah, but he's got a lot of practice.

[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:49.760]
Yeah.

[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.220]
From my enclosing.

[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:51.520]
Yeah.

[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:51.920]
Mandage.

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:52.980]
You suck old.

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:53.540]
Okay.

[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.000]
I like that.

[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.420]
A little more enthusiasm the next time.

[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.700]
I'm not going to do it myself because that would be bad.

[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.080]
And then he might take it personal, which I don't really care because he, uh,

[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.140]
he's an ass-licker man.

[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.800]
Mandage is a professional ass-licker.

[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.300]
I read this guy.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.600]
I mean, I knew he was a homer, not a homo, a homer.

[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.300]
But I didn't realize just the extent to which it goes.

[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.360]
I mean, this transcends.

[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.060]
It's like most of these jocks, especially in football, more so than any other sport.

[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.540]
To them, that's the beginning and end.

[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.440]
In other words, their whole existence, like Shula is football.

[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.200]
Can you imagine sitting down and talking to Don Shula about the assassination of Yitzhak

[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.280]
Rabin for a couple of minutes?

[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.040]
Can you imagine that?

[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.120]
He wouldn't know Yitzhak Rabin from Marvel, even.

[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.180]
Oh, and another Jewish guy.

[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:34.900]
Yeah, I know him.

[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:35.100]

[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.660]
Seriously, stop and think about that for a minute.

[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.640]
Hey, Johnny D.

[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.040]
How you doing?

[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.300]
By the way, they say hi at KISS.

[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.280]
They want to give you a big one.

[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.140]
Yeah.

[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.460]
By the way, Johnny D.

[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.920]
Nolan's got a message for all the people over at WQAM and KISS.

[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.960]
I don't know if we can say it on the ear or not.

[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.640]
I think he was saying.

[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.280]
Fuck my ****.

[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:51.740]
There it was.

[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:58.700]
We have an open line on the Green Line, 1-800-944-9463-1849-444-WYOD.

[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.360]
Do you ever see Johnny and the Alfred the Chipmunk together, by the way?

[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.860]
Here's a homestead on a purple line.

[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.140]
Hello.

[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.620]
Homestead on that purple line.

[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.280]
I got that radio blasting in the back.

[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.640]
Man, oh man, just imagine the hours of 300-training there getting.

[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.580]
Okay, up your ass.

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.680]
Open line on the purple line, pond IOD.

[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.220]
Let's do for Lauderdale.

[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.480]
Hello.

[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:18.340]
Hello, Neil.

[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:18.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.700]
I heard the Randy Road show on Friday.

[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.340]
It was a little surprising tuning into here.

[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.900]
The Neil Rogers, the best of hearing a Randy Road's last show.

[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:28.780]
The worst of, yeah.

[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.340]
Okay.

[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.640]
And I don't see what it's saying.

[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.800]
Don't ask me what it's all about.

[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.300]
This was another Steve Nicol production.

[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:34.960]
Don't ask me.

[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.260]
Well, what they were trying to do was

[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.960]
during the promos and the rejoin.

[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.080]
You know, you had Mr.

[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.520]
Mr. Big D. Boy saying, you know,

[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:46.380]
this is the show where Randy Road's lost it on the air.

[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:46.780]
Yeah.

[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.420]
And she didn't do anything.

[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.300]
All she was going to say,

[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.360]
I'm sick of this place.

[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.340]
I hate these people.

[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.460]
I'm quitting on Monday and I'm just saying goodbye tonight.

[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.540]
So they were trying to make her look bad

[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.700]
and she made this place look bad.

[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.860]
Yeah, they were trying to look like

[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.740]
like another Alex Bennett thing

[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:00.960]
where he just went crazy on the air.

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.840]
And all she said was this place sucks.

[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.060]
I hate the management.

[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:04.380]
Right.

[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.560]
When I quit on Monday, they won't let me come back

[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.700]
and say goodbye tonight.

[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:08.540]
Right.

[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.460]
Everything right so far.

[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:09.760]

[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.840]
And so I don't know where they get off thinking that, you know,

[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.120]
this is going to make Randy look crazy or something.

[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.720]
Maybe this was our way of apologizing,

[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.660]
giving her a chance, you know,

[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.420]
getting a little bit of apology.

[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:19.780]
And it was pretty.

[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.600]
The funny thing was her last show,

[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.180]
which is what?

[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.940]
You're in a hand to go.

[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.260]
Right.

[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.280]
She's telling everyone I've got these offers

[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.260]
from here and these offers from there.

[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.800]
And I've got a whole thing lined up

[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.500]
and where is she now?

[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.240]
Tano.

[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.000]
West Palm Beach.

[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:31.400]
Wow.

[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.140]
Okay.

[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.600]
Yeah, at least at least she's not here.

[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.040]
And that even if it was only JNO,

[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.780]
she's not here.

[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:38.460]
And that jacket.

[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.240]
It was called about Phil Hendry.

[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:40.600]
Yeah.

[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.860]
He called he'll let me.

[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:42.000]
Check that.

[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.420]
He called Phil Hendry last week.

[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.420]
With the same with his mother last time.

[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.120]
Oh, give me a little.

[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.140]
My mother had a heart attack.

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.240]
Another one of these old parts

[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.860]
who wishes that Vaudeville were still around

[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.480]
so he could be doing a thing over there on the beach.

[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.900]
You know, I mean, this guy's an asshole.

[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:54.520]
Phil is God.

[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:55.760]
Probably hangs out with Mandage.

[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.440]
Okay, pal.

[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:56.820]
Bye.

[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:57.340]
See ya.

[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.360]
Yeah, Phil is God.

[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.720]
Okay, see, I know this comes

[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.600]
as a very revolutionary concept.

[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.780]
I want to tell you something.

[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.120]
And I want you to listen very closely.

[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.700]
And this is something that disturbs me greatly

[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.520]
about consultants and about a lot of program directors,

[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.480]
a lot of people in radio and television.

[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.820]
You can sit down and you can listen to something.

[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.820]
If you have any kind of knowledge,

[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.660]
any kind of understanding of the industry.

[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.500]
And you can listen to somebody.

[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.600]
And you know, there's some people that are like borderline

[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.560]
and you might waver and somebody might think,

[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.840]
or because they like the person personally,

[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.600]
they might think, yeah, I want to, they'll be okay.

[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.740]
But if somebody is outstanding,

[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.360]
you can tell.

[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.780]
You can hear it.

[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.220]
You don't have to have somebody come along and say,

[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.020]
well, I'm going to, I'm going to give you a big song

[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.120]
and a dance and a dissect their whole act.

[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.060]
You don't need that.

[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.140]
If somebody's good, you know it.

[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.180]
Phil Henry isn't good.

[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.560]
Phil Henry is great.

[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.640]
And I'm not just saying this on,

[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.600]
because he's on his station,

[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.600]
because we've had Dickie Farkel on his station.

[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.940]
We've had Delary Justice on his station.

[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.960]
We had Drew Michaels on his station.

[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.960]
We had Joy Reynolds on his station.

[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.520]
We've had so many losers on his state that's unbelievable.

[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.820]
And I never came on here and said,

[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.260]
oh, man, that Dickie Farkel, he's going to be great at night.

[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.980]
Did I ever say that?

[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:11.660]
Of course not.

[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.080]
I told you, he sucked and he did and he still does.

[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.340]
He's another one up there in Palm Beach.

[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.340]
But Phil Henry is a rare talent.

[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.460]
You have to search long.
