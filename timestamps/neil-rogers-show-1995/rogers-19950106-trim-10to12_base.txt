Now, the Neil Rogers Show, a New's Talking Entertainment Radio, 610 WIOD.

[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.580]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.900]
Today's fast-paced world holds its share of headache.

[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.060]
Hey, there's a thumbprint on this report.

[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.820]
Do it again.

[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.800]
Got a problem?

[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.060]
No, sir.

[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.420]
And under some pressure, huh?

[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.660]
Yeah, I feel like my head's going to explode and aspirin doesn't do anything.

[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.800]
Oh, here, take some 5U Profe.

[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.860]
I have your Profe.

[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120]
Well, I'll try anything.

[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.340]
Oh, and dirty rotten stuff.

[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.560]
I pulled up.

[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.480]
Don't think he's talking to.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.180]
I gotta make that little...do his own...report.

[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.960]
Feel better?

[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.060]
Yeah, what's the inner of your Profe?

[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200]
Well, nothing we can admit to you on the radio except our secret ingredients, screw them

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.440]
all.

[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.020]
Which eliminates any inhibitions you might have about saying what's on your mind.

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.860]
Oh, here comes your boss.

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.700]
Look, I want this report done, even if you have to work through your lunch hour, okay?

[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.140]
Listen, numb nuts.

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.560]
Why don't you get off your...and do some work around here?

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460]
Well, I see you take ibuprofe.

[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.800]
Yeah.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.660]
And I take it too.

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200]
You lazy piece of...

[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.520]
Oh, nice gentle...the cop here.

[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.320]
I do Profe.

[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.040]
You only use fucking derailleur.

[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.060]
Okay, FN A, man.

[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.000]
It's 10-07 at W-I-D.

[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.820]
Is everybody happy?

[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.880]
Is everybody happy?

[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.540]
Yes!

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.520]
God, they're a little slow on it today, but once they get it out, that's what Aaron said.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.280]
Aaron Summers starts Monday night, eight to midnight, the one with a great ass.

[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.340]
And Steve Dick a lot of no, because it takes one.

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700]
So anyway, we got 87,403 for center one, and we got all kinds of stuff coming up.

[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000]
Tuesday, we're going to be at Pizza Troll from five to nine, loft, Troll.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.340]
Oh, and guess what, George?

[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.280]
We have lunch coming today.

[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.260]
You don't even know about it.

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.860]
Yes, I do, I heard.

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.180]
Oh, and lunch yesterday, man.

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.560]
That place is about to be three.

[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.280]
I've never had any food there ever.

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.620]
Well, Jason gave him the number and the contact.

[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.800]
If George's daughter is girlfriend down the street has got a headache, then the least

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.900]
that you can do is feed me.

[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.000]
I said, okay, what do you want?

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.800]
He had, oh no.

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.820]
So I said, how about that great antica pri across the street, right?

[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.920]
Were all the other 85 restaurants that go out of business?

[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.580]
And the only sad part of it is I don't that we're going to be able to do anything for them.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.780]
It's a really great, I mean, the food, I don't know about inside, I haven't been in

[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.360]
there, but I mean, as far as the food, everybody in North Bay Village ought to be on their hands

[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.620]
and knees crawling over there right now for lunch.

[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.260]
It is tremendous.

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.260]
We had rigatoni, ala, antica pri, anticoist tremendous and stuffed mushrooms and delicious

[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.320]
soups and it was great.

[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.480]
And today we got rigatonis is bringing.

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.720]
Now, did you get to put your order in with the trouser trauma or not?

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340]
I just said, bring more of the same hilly heats, anything.

[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.100]
That's what Crystal said.

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.480]
And now that we're paying 32 cents for a stamp, take a look at this.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.460]
Take a look at these two.

[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.380]
Rick is still in the clean up his crap.

[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.620]
Clean up your act.

[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.720]
Look at this.

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.580]
Look at the addresses.

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.700]
North West 39th place in sunrise.

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.200]
I don't live anywhere near that.

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.960]
Here's one, Northwest 31st place in sunrise.

[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.140]
I get mail now that's for people like aren't even in the same city, not even the same anywhere.

[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.420]
Like a couple of miles away, maybe, same zip code or at least part of the same zip code.

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.100]
For 32 cents a stamp, we're getting this tremendous service now.

[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.840]
Then I'm out there getting my mail before I had a chance to look at it and see that most

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.680]
of it was for other people I never heard of and who will never probably get this.

[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.480]
I wonder if there's anything good in there because it says forwarding an address correction

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.960]
requested.

[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.300]
And I felt it's not a credit card.

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.820]
I always feel to see if there's like plastic in there because then that's a good deal.

[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.320]
But yeah, what's wrong with that?

[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.560]
But a lot of times when it says forwarding address correction requested, it's a check.

[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.420]
Couldn't it be?

[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.440]
Should I open them?

[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.560]
Would you open them?

[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.900]
It was in my mailbox, right?

[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.800]
It's my here, take these granny glasses and get them out of here and stick them up somebody's

[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.020]
butt.

[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.000]
Give the old dick a little tickle.

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.020]
But anyway, let's have a great weekend and come back, please.

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.660]
So what do we got in here?

[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.700]
It's a, oh, these are bills.

[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.940]
Oh, from a credit agency, statement of account.

[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.500]
I'm doing these people in ice favor today.

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.980]
Look at that.

[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.740]
Previous statement.

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.320]
This is overdue, baby.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.300]
Passed to 135, 66.

[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.620]
George will take care of this.

[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.460]
Huh?

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.120]
Why don't we just take care of this for these people and never even know what happened?

[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.540]
They'll think Santa came a little bit late.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.920]
Santa ever come late?

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.520]
Squirt, squirt.

[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.880]
Well, better late than ever.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.040]
So in other words, I guess the other one also is probably overdue.

[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.760]
Just because it's got somebody else's name on it, if it's in your box, it's your property,

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.500]
at least as long as it's in your box.

[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.180]
Let's see.

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.520]
This one.

[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.300]
Oh, look at this.

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.840]
Now what is this deal?

[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.280]
This one.

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.600]
Oh, this is not a, oh yeah.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.080]
Here's one.

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.880]
Another deadbeat.

[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.520]
$246 past due.

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.240]
Past due.

[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.940]
Past due.

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.180]
I should read their names on here.

[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.600]
Should I?

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.680]
And really embarrass the crap out of these people.

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.540]
But I'm not going to do that.

[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.460]
I'm just tossing the crap in a waste basket.

[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.820]
So there you go again.

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.560]
There's the postal service at work.

[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.840]
I just, I don't want you to feel bad.

[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.800]
We're just into the new year.

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.240]
But they just goost us.

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.540]
And then my neighbor, my new neighbor across the street, she was walking her dog

[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.940]
through the day when I went out there to get the mail.

[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.360]
And she's telling me that her birthday was a few days ago.

[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.800]
Her mother every year on her birthday for many years now sends a record with a $50 bill

[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.140]
in it.

[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.780]
Well guess what?

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.820]
She gets the envelope late, by the way.

[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.900]
She gets the envelope and it's been ripped on the edges and the $50 bill, guess what?

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.380]
It's out.

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.680]
Well obviously her mom is finally wise up.

[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.640]
That's always a good scam.

[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.460]
Say, you mean that 50 wasn't in there?

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.860]
When you send it, you just kind of like rip it along the edges yourself and you make it

[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.700]
look like it fell out.

[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.520]
No, seriously.

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.160]
So in other words, the postal carrier is even though we're now paying the extra $30 to

[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.640]
a $0.3.

[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.540]
So it's, you know, so they can make all that big bucks or whatever it is they're making.

[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.140]
They still can't make enough money that they aren't going to steal crap.

[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.460]
So shame on you.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.620]
Where is our sunshine when we need a man?

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.460]
Wrong addresses.

[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.840]
And there was a thing on the paper yesterday about in Europe, they get mail twice a day.

[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.160]
Now I hate to break the news to you because I am an old fart.

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.880]
I can remember when we used to get mail twice a day.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.040]
There used to be a morning delivery about 10 in the morning and then about the two, three

[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.000]
in the afternoon, guess what?

[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.940]
Another delivery.

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.220]
Two deliveries on the same day.

[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.000]
Now the one delivery, you're lucky if by $5.530 it shows up at all.

[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.540]
Pretty soon you're going to have to get up in the middle of the night and go out and say,

[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.680]
I'm going to go check see if the mail's here yet because they're busy.

[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.880]
And if you like in Paris, it said in this article yesterday, you mail it in the morning

[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.920]
and that same afternoon very often, more often than not.

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.760]
The same afternoon it's delivered.

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.700]
Now that's not, we're not talking about Paris and Turkey.

[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.120]
We're talking about a city of millions of people and yet somehow they can do it.

[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.560]
Parle v. crappy.

[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.280]
Huh?

[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.960]
Pretty crappy if you ask me.

[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.720]
And I know we have a lot of postal workers who listen to this show, including my friend

[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.040]
who used to be my mail.

[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.100]
I don't know what ever happened to him.

[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.900]
Who was getting ready to turn the show off a couple of years ago and made a point of

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.440]
coming to my door.

[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.400]
Rick, did you turn it off yet or what?

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.860]
Yeah, we were ready to turn it off.

[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.040]
It was getting kind of pondry.

[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.700]
We were getting, we were had our finger on it.

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.240]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.420]
A lot of those postal workers have their fingers on it.

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.980]
Believe me.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.480]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.980]
But you know, it's not, don't take it personally, even though it's intended that way, but it's

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.060]
just one of these things that we're getting really parked off about the crappy service and

[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.880]
constantly increasing rates.

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.700]
But I'm sure that newt will take care of it.

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.920]
Okay?

[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.160]
They're straightening everything out by Monday.

[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.660]
Every problem in America will be solved by the fascist pigs because we'll all probably

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.420]
be locked up somewhere.

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.140]
So let's see.

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.900]
We got pizza loft on the fifth on the, whatever the date is this Tuesday, the 10th, 5 to 9

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.220]
p.m.

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.660]
I'll be there.

[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.440]
We'll have all of our stuff.

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.760]
I bet your rush shows up and he probably is dating Jose that night.

[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.220]
And then on the 14th, we're all going to be a Phil and Rick and Suds and I at Peaches.

[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.560]
And I'll be with Phil at Peaches Music and Video on Sunrise Boulevard Fort Lauderdale.

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.480]
That's the original Peaches.

[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.180]
We'll have all our CDs, cassettes and t-shirts.

[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.360]
One to 3 p.m.

[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.080]
On the 14th.

[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.080]
And on that same day at the Fountains on South University driving plantation, Rick and

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.460]
Suds will be doing everything one to three.

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.660]
And then on the 21st of this month at the Coral Square Mall in Coral Springs, I'll be

[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.760]
doing my thing up there.

[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.580]
And Rick and Suds will be at Cutler Ridge Mall.

[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.260]
Now, well, it says time and mall location to be denounced.

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.260]
Still, we haven't decided yet.

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.020]
And like I said, Rick and Suds will be at Cutler Ridge Mall on the 21st and Phil will be

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.020]
at the Miami International Mall speaking a variety of tongues as usual.

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.100]
So that we still have a way to go.

[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.640]
I want to tell you one thing right now.

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.460]
By Monday, when I come in here Monday morning and the Queen Bee gets up on a chair and puts

[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.220]
the new grease mark up on it board, I want it over 90,000.

[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.080]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.680]
So a lot of these foot draggers who haven't been out to Peaches yet or called that toll-free

[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.320]
number and don't need to dime one yet or got any CD or cassette or any other guy did,

[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.960]
let's do it this weekend, okay?

[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.680]
Let's do it this weekend and cut the crap.

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.920]
This is a real embarrassing thing that we don't have like two, three hundred thousand dollars

[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.880]
in there, even if we're raising it for like for me.

[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.460]
For whatever the hell it is, let's get with it.

[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.680]
Anyway, 10 or 4 and of course we got the big games this weekend.

[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.980]
Everybody's in Georgia's like hyperventilating about the big games.

[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.480]
Also we're hyperventilating about that great new schedule.

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.540]
Now you do know the new schedule from Monday, don't you?

[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.960]
Huh?

[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.140]
For like nights and overnight and neither does anybody else.

[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.280]
See you must have a real psychotic day yesterday.

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.660]
You picked a good day not to be here.

[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.480]
Although any day, but seriously you picked a real good, a psychotic day which during the

[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.520]
break I'll tell you a great story.

[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.060]
But anyway, yeah, so like I've been saying that we had a new show after Aaron Summer,

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.720]
she starts Monday of course, eight to midnight with the phone sex.

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.240]
And then from midnight to two, we were going to have a new show.

[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.060]
That's what I was told by our eye darting program director.

[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.400]
You ever see guys whose eyes dart around like a ferret real nervously?

[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.400]
But anyway, that's what he told me, Steve Dickily said that we were going to have like

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.620]
a new show midnight to do and they were shoving what's their name, Don and Dick at two to

[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.180]
five in the morning.

[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.400]
They were shoving Dick and Don.

[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.900]
And now I find out that the new show from midnight to two ain't going to happen, but I don't

[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.880]
know what's going to happen.

[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.880]
I believe Don and Micah moving back to midnight to three and the best of Neil, there's still

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.520]
milk and ease tapes from three to, I don't know.

[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.020]
But I guess we'll all have to listen Monday night and find out together.

[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.880]
1016 at WIOD.

[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.380]
WIOD.

[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.280]
Three mature modulation.

[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.420]
Well, all right.

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.520]
Sports fans.

[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.860]
You from Disney.

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.600]
It's the enchanting story.

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.180]
The story of a vicious Chicago gangster and his cartoon gavers.

[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.100]
It's the heartwarming Al Cabone.

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.880]
I hold, I hold, let's make the legal goal.

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.720]
Run prostitution numbers to I hold.

[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.660]
Yes, it's Al Cabone on an incredible ride through the criminal underworld with his singing

[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.380]
Tommy gun.

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.140]
I'm going on a hit.

[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.200]
Gonna shoot some dumbed wits.

[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.960]
Al Cabone.

[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.080]
It's the whole story from those wild bootlegging days to his conviction for income tax evasion.

[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.320]
Looks like I'm guilty.

[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.980]
Dissing my day.

[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.720]
Looks like scoffies are going away.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.280]
And the whole family will shed a tear as Al rots in his sing-sing cells.

[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:36.680]
Someday parole will come even though I am low life scum.

[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.260]
Al Cabone from Walt Disney.

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.920]
And coming soon a real family favorite.

[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.880]
Manson.

[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.740]
Yeah, it's going to be a blast.

[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.280]
Neon God.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.560]
By the way, when Aaron Summer starts with passion phones on Monday night from 8 to midnight,

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.900]
Jocelyn Elders was inquiring along with many others.

[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.180]
Mastervation will be discussed, but will not be permitted during those hours between 8

[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.520]
midnight.

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.000]
Just wanted you to know that ahead of time.

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.440]
So we got the big games tomorrow.

[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.860]
These Steelers will beat the crap out of the Browns tomorrow.

[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.280]
I hate to break the news to you on that because a lot of people are hoping the Browns win because

[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.980]
then if the dolphins went on Sunday, the game will be here and then my tickets will have

[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.600]
some value.

[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.020]
But I'm afraid that these Steelers will mop up the field.

[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.260]
They're a three-revers with the Browns and Vity Testive or E tomorrow.

[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.860]
That's just my I don't make predictions, but that's my prediction that the Browns will

[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.360]
kick the ass.

[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.600]
Speaking of football, by the way, and of course on Sunday will have like 85 hours of pre-game

[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.180]
for play.

[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.400]
The bad news is of course, and I don't want to dwell on this, even though I have people

[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.380]
I know who keep insisting, oh, no matter what they say, there will be a season.

[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.900]
The board of governors rhymes with manure, our meeting tomorrow morning, the National

[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.720]
Hockey League, and I think at that point it will be audio's, their regost because they're

[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.260]
rejecting the players' unions latest proposal and they're unhappy and they say, put to you

[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.120]
and it sits over.

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.600]
Anyway, there's a survey.

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.440]
Now what is this from?

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.100]
This is from somewhere.

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.280]
We always get this stuff.

[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.340]
It's from some damn business journal, some Florida business journal.

[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.860]
Study says dolphin fans just so so.

[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.200]
Denver has the best fans.

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.300]
LA Raiders have the worst.

[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.920]
It says, forget last Saturday, sell out at Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.880]
Miami, dolphin fans are just lukewarm and it comes to supporting their team.

[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.360]
Not me.

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.060]
Not me.

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.080]
That's the, in fact, I heard Phil say the other day and I think he's got a point.

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.980]
If you lend tangible support, if you buy tickets, then you're a fan.

[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.340]
Even if you go and you don't want for the team to win, if you lend your, if you go out

[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.100]
and buy team paraphernalia, if you pay for parking, if you buy your own tickets like I

[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.760]
have for five years, then you're like supporting the team.

[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.060]
Even if you don't give a crap about them or you hit them like poison or if the coach is

[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.040]
just a brainstem.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.400]
It said the conclusion of a just completed an analization of attendance.

[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.400]
Dolphin fans ranked number 16.

[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.320]
Mighty low, I would say like way down here in the middle, submittal of the pack.

[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.320]
The index was compiled by South Florida business journal 3 research effort by its parent company

[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.440]
in Charlton, North Carolina, American city business, urinals.

[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.620]
The analization which gives extra points to fans who consistently showed up to watch losers

[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.160]
play year after year ranks.

[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.620]
The Denver Broncos is having the most loyal fans.

[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.860]
Denver was followed by four old NFL teams.

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.260]
The Browns, the Giants, the Packers and the Eagles.

[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.800]
Oh yeah, you go to see the Eagles, you must be a serious fan.

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.380]
The least the fickle fans were the Bears.

[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.360]
Attendance fluctuated only 6% between the best and most annual attendance between 85 and

[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.500]
94, excluding the 87 strike.

[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.660]
The most fickle fans, this I love, man, this I absolutely love.

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.460]
I'll give you 28 guesses and the first 500 don't count.

[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.200]
Guess which team has the most fickle fans?

[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260]
Buffalo blows and soda the bill.

[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:49.660]
Oh, Buffalo bills attendance fluctuated 52.1% during that same period of time.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.980]
And of course, all of us remember with great joy and vigor that last Buffalo home game

[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.900]
when he still had a chance to be in the playoffs by the way, but got their asses whipped

[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.380]
soundly.

[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.820]
It was a beautiful thing when he stands appeared to be very, very, very sparsely populated.

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.800]
The winningest team and the coldest fans, Green Bay average, 10, 28 point.

[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.700]
Yes, see that's the thing.

[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.880]
The fans here got a good excuse because the weather is so cold here during these football

[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.280]
months.

[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.340]
That's probably a good reason why a lot of them stay away.

[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.740]
Or maybe they're just second-terred of all the mediocrity.

[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.940]
Maybe they're tired of Wayne.

[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.100]
Maybe they're tired of Shula.

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.820]
Maybe they're just a bunch of front-running phonies, which is probably the truth.

[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.720]
And what's wrong with that?

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.180]
Well, now what do you mean just listening?

[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.720]
What is that?

[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.560]
Hello?

[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.060]
Why do you have just listening on there in this line?

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.700]
I didn't think we could be that cheesy.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.100]
What is it?

[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.020]
What is it?

[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.540]
I was just listening.

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.080]
What do you mean you're just listening?

[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.420]
I have nothing to contribute.

[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.220]
I'm sorry, Neil.

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.340]
But what do you mean you're just listening?

[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.660]
You're going to tie up the line all day to listen to the show?

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.160]
No, I told them.

[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.620]
As soon as you didn't have any more room to just dump me.

[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.440]
Okay.

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.740]
Well, at least he was cooperative with that and I just did.

[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.440]
I can't believe that.

[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.880]
I thought we actually had a couple of calls under when we have a couple, but nothing

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.220]
to do exciting here because it's a very dead time right now.

[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.420]
Now I could tell you about a lot of things in this place, but you don't want to get depressed.

[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.660]
But that's another story for another day.

[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.580]
Is Old Mikey would say and look what they did for him.

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.960]
Let's go to a lady in Miami.

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.380]
Hello.

[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.000]
I'm a gentleman.

[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.480]
Neil.

[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.840]
Eh?

[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.540]
This is a tiny Hannah Ruby.

[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.060]
Listen to me.

[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.220]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.080]
Yeah.

[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.260]
Have you got a chance?

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.820]
Oh, oh.

[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.860]
Hey, listen.

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.560]
If you...

[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:27.660]
Ah!

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.300]
Listen.

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.140]
If you...

[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.400]
Ah!

[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:30.400]

[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.080]
Can't I talk to the guy who was just listening before?

[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:32.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:33.840]
I really had a problem.

[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.860]
What do you want, Ruby?

[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:35.900]
Yes.

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.820]
I like you to hear.

[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.380]
Listen.

[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.940]
I like you.

[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.520]
I like you to hear the Chris Baker show last night.

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.940]
The Chris Baker show is...

[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:43.980]
You have to be careful.

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.680]
When I see everybody say goodbye to him.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.220]
What is it?

[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.520]
Everybody say goodbye to him.

[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.580]
Why is he not going to be on tonight?

[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.740]
I thought tonight was his last show.

[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.560]
Yeah, last night was his last show.

[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.200]
What's up?

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:54.620]
What's up?

[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.820]
What do you mean, please hear it?

[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.920]
Please hear the tape.

[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.340]
Why?

[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.220]
Because it's very funny.

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.120]
If you get a chance...

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.440]
If he was funny before last night, maybe he'd still have a show.

[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.860]
But here was a very hilarious last night.

[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.400]
Ruby, don't you understand?

[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.600]
I have better things to do.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.780]
Like, pick my nose and listen to tapes of old shows on this radio station.

[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.640]
Don't you get that?

[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.540]
I'm sorry.

[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.380]
And see, the reason he's going off is because you were listening to his show.

[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.220]
Oh.

[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.120]
That's the reason he's not going to be here on the...

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.180]
Well, um...

[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:24.580]
That's it.

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.700]
Yes, but thank you very much, sir.

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.360]
Thank you, Ruby.

[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:27.960]
Bye.

[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.000]
Okay.

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.960]
Yeah, yeah, okay.

[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.140]
Good call.

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.360]
Best of the day so far.

[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.700]
The only one of the days so far.

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.700]
So, how are we doing so far?

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.120]
Pretty good.

[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.080]
Sounds pretty good to me.

[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.420]
Sounds like a real winner today.

[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.860]
By the way, I found a great new...

[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:48.160]
Not a new, but an old Luis Miguel song that I'd kind of like skipped over in the past that I'm going to play 45 times today.

[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.880]
Another obsession, a Luis Miguel obsession.

[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.800]
Speaking of that, by the way, Monday on the young and the horny, for those of you who have to wait all weekend to find out,

[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.640]
Monday on the young and the horny Nick goes over to see Sharon again.

[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.720]
After they had...

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.560]
Today, you'll find that they kind of meet in school.

[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.820]
Well, they're not really in school, but they're like hanging out at school.

[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.740]
Because Sharon, unbeknownst to Nick, is going there like a...

[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.140]
Transfer.

[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.900]
She wants out.

[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.580]
She's going to go somewhere and maybe even have a baby.

[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.240]
But anyway, so she's there, and of course he's there, because he's going to go off to college.

[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.340]
He's going to graduate early.

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.840]
And they just run into each other and he embraces her and they give each other a big, big kiss.

[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:21.720]
A lot of tongue.

[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.940]
And that's...

[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.220]
That's...

[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.040]
You're going to see that today.

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.200]
But on Monday, goes over to her house.

[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.000]
And she goes into a big song and a dance about...

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.660]
Well, she can't go anywhere with him and she doesn't want to go out with him.

[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.100]
And by babani's getting McSignals and he's getting bent out of shape.

[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.660]
And you know...

[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.780]
So she just storms out and he...

[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.840]
Slams the door like pretending that he left and then he comes back in.

[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.960]
And she's bursted into tears and she comes back into that little...

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.000]
Whatever that cubicle that's supposed to be their apartment.

[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.840]
And she's got the mascaras running and she's been squirting more than Jack all over the face.

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.500]
And he looks at her like, oh my god.

[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.780]
Well, I guess now the Chris Baker is not here anymore.

[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.640]
Can we play that like four or five hundred times today?

[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.580]
And where the hell is that?

[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.700]
You know, is there some special reason why we have this thing where...

[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.460]
Because everybody steals everybody's stuff anyway.

[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.980]
Why do we have to have two separate things?

[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.560]
Oh my god.

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.240]
There you go.

[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.620]
But not only once.

[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.300]
Oh my god.

[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.560]
Oh my god.

[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.900]
Okay, there you go. Now I feel better. I feel more at home like Chris is still here.

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.380]
So what have we got on tonight?

[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.440]
The Chris Baker's last show was last night.

[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.640]
Oh, and don't tell me Steve Patterson, please.

[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.760]
Don't say those two disgusting, grotesque, unmentionable words.

[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.720]
Steve Patterson.

[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.140]
I couldn't handle it.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.400]
Here's Davey. Hello.

[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.540]
Hello.

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:33.760]
Hi, Neil.

[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.360]
Listen, I got a little story for you about Alan Dresner.

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.300]
Oh, it's the Alan Dresner show. I forgot about that.

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.020]
What is this?

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.120]
Yeah, it's written yesterday and I heard about it.

[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.220]
Everybody in this audience knows Alan Dresner.

[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.000]
They can't find him, but everybody knows him.

[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.820]
This isn't a good story.

[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.600]
What are you going to rip him?

[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.320]
What is this going to be some kind of a slanderous thing now?

[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.020]
Yes, it is.

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.940]
Well, we're not going to put that on here. Get out of here.

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.880]
Yes, it is.

[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.660]
Call it up to...

[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.280]
Nobody in this audience knows Alan Dresner from Alan Sherman.

[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.360]
Okay, and he's dead.

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.820]
Let's get some people out here and put a little bit of meat on the table here today.

[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.320]
Let's sink our teeth into the reality of the world.

[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.920]
What about these abortion clinics?

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.660]
What about the Warren Bosnia?

[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.880]
What about the God-day and Republican Congress?

[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.540]
What about Newt Kingrich's mother?

[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.200]
Do you know Tom Snyder was starting that late, late, late, late, late, late show Monday night after Letterman?

[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.000]
And guess who his first guest is going to be?

[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.320]
You're going to puke when he hears this.

[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.640]
I'll give you 85 guesses and I just told you.

[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:25.860]
Newt?

[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.160]
Newt Kingrich's mother.

[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.060]
She's hot.

[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.440]
Bitch.

[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.980]
I mean, what you talk about just neurotic repetition?

[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.240]
Who the hell wants to see Newt Kingrich's mother at two o'clock in a God-day morning?

[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.840]
Why not have Christie Brinkley on there at two o'clock in the morning?

[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.440]
How about David Brinkley at two in the morning?

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.980]
If he can keep that one eye open long enough?

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.740]
Who the hell wants to see God-day and fascist pig, fat face, hypocritical Newt Kingrich's mother,

[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.960]
at two o'clock in the morning?

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.120]
That Tom Snyder, man, what a sense of humor he's got.

[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.760]
Oh, what a sense of humor.

[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.900]
The Santa Claus of late night television.

[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.660]
Kind of a sour push, too, you know, when you come right down to it.

[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.680]
1029 at WIOD.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.660]
When the dolphins arrive in San Diego Friday,

[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.000]
we'll be there waiting for the whole live from the Gas Lamp District.

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.700]
Devo and Volkambra are 610 WIOD.

[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.160]
And that's just part of Friday's lineup.

[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.620]
While Sports Talk 16 is live from San Diego,

[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:28.620]
we'll also be live at Shulas All-Star Cafe in Miami Lakes with former dolphin Jim Kick.

[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.440]
Hey, it's a big game weekend.

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.280]
So we're thinking big.

[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.140]
Jim Kick live at Shulas.

[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.560]
Looked up with Devo and Volkambra live in San Diego.

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.260]
Friday night at 6 on News Talk and Entertainment Radio.

[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.920]
610 WIOD.

[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.940]
Where the seven words you can't say on radio are down to two.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.140]
Suck it in and hold it.

[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.920]
Tommy Lee Jones turned critics heads as Ty Cobb.

[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.220]
But his history forgotten Cobb's outcast cousin,

[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.840]
the funniest baseball player of all time.

[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.620]
Bob Hope stars as Corn Cobb.

[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.420]
Seven vending stretch.

[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.800]
Hold on as this baseball and aerobics class.

[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.420]
Corn Cobb.

[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.480]
A man who knew more about punchlines than Baselok.

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.160]
Don't let coach ask me why I hit that foul pop up.

[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.720]
And I told him because I couldn't fit the chicken in their toaster.

[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.540]
Corn Cobb.

[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.460]
It's the Zigg field of dreams.

[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:23.940]
Sacrifice.

[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.040]
Hey, I gave it to you off.

[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:32.240]
And the day Baselok said goodbye to Corn Cobb is a day no one will ever forget.

[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.300]
Today I consider myself the funniest man in Baselok.

[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.200]
Corn Cobb.

[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.540]
Rated R for...

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.880]
Orlando, do you hear that?

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.040]
That was definitely his tongue.

[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.320]
I can smell that anywhere.

[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.040]
1032 at WIDA.

[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.580]
I do want to say this.

[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.520]
I have renewed respect this morning for old number 88.

[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.320]
I know that he has his moments.

[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.780]
We get a little upset when he gets a little bit too carried away.

[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.220]
Although he is Mr. Adolphin broadcast.

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.520]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.860]
But last night I'm catching a little bit of his sports talk show.

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.200]
And sure enough, here is a man whose all of a sudden I guess maybe he lost him for a while.

[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.720]
I'm sure he was losing all those football games.

[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.360]
But he must have found that old big pair that he was so famous for.

[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.820]
Wasn't he famous for a big well-emidium pair?

[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.900]
And had him sewn back on a La John Bobbitt style.

[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.980]
Because last night he was going on about the Give as Turkey's on U of M.

[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.520]
And what a bunch of assholes they are in their behavior is totally unacceptable.

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.520]
It's got no place on a football field.

[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.980]
And of course the front running Cain's fan.

[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.340]
Well, that's just a Cain's.

[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.120]
That's their way.

[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.060]
And he's just really ripping him and ass.

[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.340]
Adaboy, my dog.

[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:38.960]
Yes!

[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:39.700]
Yes!

[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.600]
Here is a man who's not afraid.

[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.880]
See, you know, you can come on here and kiss up to what you think is going to be the popular thing to say.

[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.680]
Which there are a lot of people on here who do that by the way, who just are professional ass suckers.

[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.380]
And oh yeah, they're the greatest and whatever they think the majority of the people out there want you to say.

[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.740]
Make you very popular.

[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.840]
You see, if you don't have some people pissed off then you're not doing anything worthwhile.

[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.000]
I guarantee you that right now.

[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.300]
If everybody agrees, if everybody loves you then you're doing nothing right.

[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.300]
Now here she is, somebody who nobody thinks she's doing anything right and she's proud of it.

[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.260]
Especially Bob Green thinks she couldn't do anything right and she's delighted with that because just aggravating him is what she lives for.

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.340]
And I'll give her several high marks for that.

[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.900]
Let's see how high she can stand on the old chair.

[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.240]
I'm not going to be happy with what?

[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:26.820]
The new total?

[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.300]
Well, it was 87,403.

[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.220]
What is it?

[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:31.860]
405?

[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.100]
Well, what is this include?

[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.860]
Today's peaches?

[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.980]
I understand that.

[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.320]
What do you mean I'm not going to be happy?

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.460]
I'm not expecting much.

[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.420]
You mean from Capture Glory?

[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.320]
Tell him to leave us alone already.

[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.480]
He's a great guy but he is so neurotic for Christ's Exy out of work here.

[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.000]
It is very messy in here.

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.000]
That's because Rick just left.

[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.300]
87,485 is our total.

[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.360]
That's okay by Monday we'll have 90 grand.

[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.780]
When you call over at peaches, when you call Joe, I guarantee we'll have 90 grand.

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.020]
Joe is the best.

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.700]
He knows his crap.

[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.380]
We love you Joe.

[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.440]
Over at peaches.

[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:06.940]
We love you.

[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.820]
Even though you're a little surly at times you're a hell of a guy.

[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.820]
So anyway, that's not too bad.

[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.500]
We'll have 90 by the weekend and then we got all these other big events going.

[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.240]
We're going to get to 100 if we have to get the last 10 from Wayne Heisenga himself.

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.040]
We're going to get to 100 grand.

[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.940]
We'll all know why.

[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.140]
Here's sunrise on a purple line.

[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.420]
Hello?

[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:23.940]
Howdy.

[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.480]
Howdy.

[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.340]
Partner?

[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.400]
I was kind of wanted to comment on that postal thing.

[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.200]
The same problem has happened in our location and I called and complained about it.

[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:42.320]
They told me that they have installed some new, they're testing a new automated system that sorts the mail.

[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.300]
Oh, it's working great.

[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.120]
Yeah, and then puts it into trades for them.

[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.420]
And now the guys who, you know, these postal guys used to start their own mail and then take it out.

[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.500]
Well now the trades have come to them.

[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.780]
They leave an hour later.

[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.280]
That's why we're getting our mail much later.

[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.700]
And so they're not sorting and the machine is screwing up bad.

[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.740]
It's, you know, it's up in the open parts.

[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.020]
It was what they told me.

[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.600]
Well, that's great.

[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.420]
That means that we spend the extra three cents on every letter, which is millions and millions and millions of dollars,

[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.280]
so they can buy these new machines to screw up everybody's mail and you can get everybody else's bills.

[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.860]
That's great.

[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.500]
And then of course what you have to wonder is who's getting your mail.

[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.040]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.540]
In other words, if I'm getting all these other people's mail that aren't even living my area, who's getting my bills?

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.380]
Well one day, and then probably in about a week, I'll be getting letters anyway.

[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.540]
And your pass, dude, those letters always show up.

[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.620]
Your pass, dude, how come we didn't get your check yet?

[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.120]
What it was, it was worth it.

[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:35.460]

[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:35.880]
That's what it was worth.

[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.380]
One day I found about six envelopes that belong to me on the ground down the block.

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:42.880]
Yeah.

[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:53.900]
Now that must not have been a myth or, or maybe it was, but it had about $4,000 of, you know, receipt checks.

[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.600]
Oh nice.

[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.640]
They were coming to us.

[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.160]
You just wonder now where are they going to rent to the county when the machine's starting.

[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:01.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.200]
Anyway, just point of interest.

[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.540]
Well we'll keep our fly on it for next couple of weeks and see what a great job they're doing for you.

[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.120]
And you notice how it's simultaneous with the rate increase too.

[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.360]
And then I'm talking about that.

[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.480]
Just like sticking it right in there and twisting it a little bit.

[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.400]
And when you call, they just leave the, they just, you know, if you want to get in and, you know, and complain about it.

[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.220]
And they haven't tried to do something about it.

[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.840]
They just leave the phone off the hook so they can't get through.

[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.720]
Yeah, they're busy on a break right now.

[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:24.980]
I'm not a bride.

[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.060]
Don't be bothering them.

[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.880]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:27.880]
See ya.

[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.460]
I say, uh, federal express is always a good way to go.

[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.360]
Yeah, no, seriously, if you have anything important, they're great.

[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.080]
FedEx, that's the only way to fly.

[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.740]
I tell you that right now, the mail service blows.

[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.860]
Why don't we open up our own goddamn mail service?

[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.320]
Huh?

[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.520]
That sure is how beats being here with these people.

[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.840]
1037 at WIOD or Nickel and Dimes station.

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.840]
Pressed by the host, Guest or Callers on WIOD.

[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.060]

Dasnick, everything is so big.

[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.080]
I like it.

[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.720]
I like it.

[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.280]
Me too.

[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.520]
1040 at WIOD.

[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.600]
Happy Friday to it's gonna be a big, big football field weekend.

[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.880]
And probably a lot of the women out there, the, uh, the couch potatoes are out there watching their football

[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.360]
and the women are getting really pissed off.

[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.720]
Although it seemed to me, this would give them a lot of time to go out and screw around on the side.

[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.200]
Sure does.

[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.020]
And go to them all with their, uh, you know, other, uh, with their lady friends and boyfriends and, uh, whoever else they're hanging out with.

[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.020]
And leave hubby sitting there with his 25, six packs and, uh, watching a ball game.

[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.560]
That's where it's, uh, that's what it's all about.

[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.100]
Sure is what?

[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.980]
Freeze up a lot of women this time of year.

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.680]
Does it?

[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.720]
Oh, that's where you were yesterday, huh?

[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.360]
So how's your daughter's girlfriend down the street that had the head cold?

[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.200]
It's my daughter.

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.920]
Your daughter, what? Is she very sick?

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:43.960]
She's very sick.

[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.940]
What do you mean, very sick?

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.540]
My wife was afraid that my husband and men and gideists,

[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.320]
what is just a fireman and gideists?

[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:49.980]
No, it's not.

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.880]
But that's what my wife was afraid that she had.

[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.040]
In other words, she thought it was something very deadly serious, but it's not.

[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:55.680]
It's not.

[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.560]
A lot of it's not.

[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.420]
Like I said, it could have been bad, but it's not.

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.360]
Let's do Pemberpines.

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.700]
What happened to Pemberpines?

[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.300]
It was just about to punch up Pemberpines and they're going, you know, if you people are in a hurry today, I don't have time for you, okay?

[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.800]
I don't have time to do a dittle around with people who are in a, too big of a hurry for me.

[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.680]
We have two open lines that we have nothing here is basically what we got.

[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.680]
Two open lines in days, 751, two and Broward, 524 and a green line, 1-800.

[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.500]
We got three stick and calls on the board.

[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.060]
It's 10-40 in the morning here already.

[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.420]
Because we're not giving away anymore of those CDs that you locked away and let's keep them there wherever you locked them until at least Monday.

[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.220]
Oh my God, I'm sitting in here these people on Rick's show this morning.

[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.820]
Oh, are you still giving away washer and dryer?

[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.240]
Are you still giving away wheels of world of, oh, go away.

[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:47.480]
Oh my God, you would think that we were giving away something that was worth something for crying out loud.

[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:54.620]
And let me say it again, if by some miracle and it would take that, if Pittsburgh loses to the Browns tomorrow and the dolphins beat San Diego,

[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.100]
which I think they got a pretty good shot at that on Sunday, if both of those things happen in the AFC Championship game is here next week,

[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.900]
I still have in a very special spot those 250 yard line seats.

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.680]
And by the way, the schoolteach, you ain't getting them, by the way.

[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.980]
Can you believe that? There's a message here for me to call the schoolteach, the one that she and her father sit next to me at the games when I used to go.

[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:22.940]
And I know what it's about because I already heard from the fat man from Mr. Yanta that Jeff moved her seats and they've been shuttled over to another side.

[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.320]
Hey, that's your problem, honey. I like you. You and your dad, you're okay. You're nice. You reformed. You've a butched up a little bit.

[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.800]
A nice Jewish family there or whatever they are. But hey, I got enough problems in my own. I can't worry that I'm sure that's what she wants.

[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.040]
Is to give me a go on a year and start screaming in the oven. I can't fight everybody else battles for me.

[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:49.160]
And I'm talking about because I'd be niggled and pennied and snorted to death in this joint. Here's a mobile in Boka. Hello.

[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:55.800]
Good morning. Yes, sir. That last caller made the comment of a fabulous service. We're not getting from the postal service.

[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:01.940]
They suck. You tell me about it. He also mentioned Oakland Park Boulevard. I give you a name in there. Joe and Leoni.

[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:07.880]
I went around around a lot about the man. It wasn't being delivered to my place. You went round and round with Joanne. Leoni.

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.200]
Yeah, I told her flat out. There's two reasons why I'm talking about. Sounds Italian to me. Don't mess with those Italians. You better watch it.

[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.360]
All one myself. Well, you know what I'm talking about. I thought I said there's two reasons I'm moving out of the Lord or Hill.

[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:23.380]
Yeah, and the lousy service I'm getting here. All right. The top of the list. All right. I live up Margate now.

[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.520]
And I tell you my man was on time. It's perfect. I'm moving to Margate. In fact, I bet you in Margate,

[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.220]
they probably don't have all the repressive ordinances like we do in the acres where every time you fart, you got to get a permit.

[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.760]
Well, if they do, they haven't made me aware of it yet. There you go. I say let's start promoting Margate a great place to live.

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.480]
Yeah, where the median age is 200. They don't bother me. They shuffle along. And I do my thing.

[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.440]
There's something to be said for that. Then of course in the supermarket, you just run him over with your shopping cart.

[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.180]
You just do it. I'll be there this afternoon. Do I pick up that excellent? Have you stopped a great one? Good move, pal. Thanks.

[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.280]
There's a smart man. He got there a lot of water. Hill and he moved to Margate. No way to run, no way to hide.

[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.680]
That's what Martha and the Van Della said. And then a bunch of other people who covered that song.

[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:09.500]
Anyway, I'm sure that there are a lot of people who think that I'm going to discuss this story about the Pizzeria, which I know is Gary Stein.

[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:16.620]
You know, you people are so predictable at the newspapers here, especially Gary Stein and at Ray Wrecked Wrecked.

[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:26.220]
You know, such parochial yokels. Can't we just pretend to be like a city, which we're not, but wouldn't it be nice if we like lived in what we could call a city?

[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:33.460]
A little bit a little more maturity, a little bit more instead of the scrap. Oh, they're picking on us. It's only the perception of all these bodies lying here.

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.160]
Always the same old crap. And now there's this story about the Pizzeria, big Louise speaking of Italian, big Louise.

[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:48.020]
And here's another big article. Seems big cheese took on Pizzeria, badty, oddty, oddty about Doug Danzig and about its event data.

[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.960]
And they're like trying to bust down his Pizzeria, big Louise because there are a lot and too many people in there.

[00:32:53.280 --> 00:33:01.160]
And the ordinance says there were only like 22 people in there and they got too many people in there. And they say that they were concerned about the safety, which you know is a bunch of crap and it's event data.

[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:08.060]
And the whole thing boils down to guess whose Pizzeria it is, George. I'll give you 685,000 guesses.

[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:17.940]
Wayne? No. Bill Lirio. Now do you think I'm going to go on the, yeah, right? It's got his hand over his push. I would too.

[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:30.420]
That was the local section, the local section of the Sun Central right there. You know, Bill Lirio, I'm so sick and tired all this crap just everybody's out to get him at big Louise.

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.680]
Best of you all in the city. Oh, I'm sorry. That was Louise in the Bronx. Well, maybe there's a connection between big Louise and Louise in the Bronx.

[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:44.980]
And right away, Gary Stein. Of course, it is a dead time. There's nothing else going on. I mean, we just got the, you know, the Super Bowl coming up in a couple of weeks right here in town.

[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:52.600]
Got millions of things going on here. He's right about stupid pizza crap again. By the way, speaking of pizza, what times are lunch coming? Do we know from a trouser troutman?

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:00.020]
We don't know what time it's coming. Here's the lady in Carroll City. Hello. Hi, happy New Year. Happy New Year.

[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:16.860]
I'm talking about pizza. Do you remember Alvis? Do you remember what? Alvis. What the hell is that? Alvis, pizza, rhea, and pepper pines. No. No, you used to be a customer of ours. No. Well, you mean across the street from where are you still living? Right.

[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:26.160]
And you're, are you still there? Yeah, we're still there. We're still going strong. Great. That's like by publics. Yeah, right. Your name came up the other day.

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:42.380]
I was talking to my former boss and we were talking about Henry. And he just discovered Phil Henry's program and what a good show. And he enjoyed it. And I said, oh, I listened to him and Neil Rogers every day. He said, Oh, Neil Rogers. He used to be a former customer of ours when he lived across the street.

[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:53.540]
You bet. And he told me about how he said, I never saw him. He said, my customers start coming in and telling me they heard about me on the radio. That's right. And he said, one day Neil came in to pick up an order.

[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:06.140]
And I thanked him a lot for the free publicity. He said, and I had a hell of a time taking up his check. He said, he wouldn't even let me buy a pizza after all the free publicity. That's right. I don't like being a free loader. It's embarrassing. Makes you feel slimy. I know.

[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:16.300]
But he went on and on and on. And we're just good customers. I mean, good. Yeah, they have good pizza. I'm sure they still do as right across from our used to live in Villa's Lake. They're on tap street. Non-taft and hiatus.

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:25.900]
Right. We're still the same place. Yeah, still the same good food. Anyway, stop picking on a post office. My son works for the post office.

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:35.920]
I didn't say your son's a bad guy, although he might be. I don't know. But I'm just saying the post office blows. He just worked seven days a week, 12 hours a day to get your mail out. Now you're picking on him.

[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:44.480]
Don't you remember? Don't you remember? Because you got to be his old as I am or pretty close to your older nine. Then don't you remember when we used to get mail delivered twice a day?

[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:53.060]
And the mail man walked. He took. He got there. I was right. I forgot about that. We didn't have mail boxes out by the road. He used to walk right up to your house.

[00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:04.620]
This is back home in Pennsylvania. He didn't have one of those little scooters to ride around in one of those little mail cards. He used to walk. He used to slip that big thing on his back. He used to come twice a day.

[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:17.820]
Yeah, for three cents he used to come twice a day. He was shining a bunch of guys like that. Even Lisa was she knew guys like that who would come twice for three cents a day.

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:28.200]
Both were the days. Eight cents for the bus. You can't live in the past. You can't turn it back. Although I think now that we have this new deal in Washington, they're going to turn the clock back about 200 years.

[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:37.080]
Oh, yeah, all the kids are going to go to the orphanage. That's right. And we're all going to go to camp and it'll be for free. And you have a great weekend. Okay, you too. Bye bye. Go Dolphin.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:46.140]
Okay, go dolphins. Right. Let's go. Fins man. Where's that thing? Come on. Let's get out of bad wagon here. Let's really build up the dolphins here and pretend that I'm a big B.

[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.760]
That's enough. That's enough. Too much. Anyway, it's 1049. And let's take your call from a lady and Miami Lakes on the purple line. Hello.

[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:12.100]
Hi, my name is. Great. Listen to some gossip about the new blockbuster, Miami Lakes. Yes. By the way, before you do that, there's a blockbuster right by the sawgrass now that they built.

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:19.800]
They kind of like sneaked it in there by the by the by the. No, by the gas station. There's an ex on station or share a share of our station.

[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:34.680]
They sneak there like in behind there between right in front of the sawgrass mills mall and the sunrise boulevard. They kind of like sneaked it in like in the middle of the night. One day it wasn't there the next morning. I'm driving a work and there's a blockbuster blockbuster music. What? Anyway, you were saying.

[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:50.300]
The type of spillage video store there. They took blockbuster and the gram companies to court. Yeah, he's got a hundred thousand dollars in escrow and he got a reprieve. He's going to be able to stay there for six more months. Yeah, the blockbuster says while he's there, they're not paying rent to the gram companies.

[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:57.520]
The gram companies offers. Cypress village like 50 grand to move out of there. They said no way they're going to fight blockbuster.

[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:27.500]
Well, good for them. Maybe they can get some pointers from Bill Iroh. Look what it did for him. Maybe they can sell pizza on the side too. Maybe they can have the original zip pizza. Maybe they can have the face of Wayne on a pizza. People are always seeing the Virgin Mary and Jesus on a pizza. Maybe we can have old zit face on a pie. Call it the zip pie. Have a great weekend. Thank you. Bye bye. Thanks for the good news. Not everybody's going to roll over and lay down dead for Wayne. And by the way, come Tuesday. We have a couple of days we're investigating certain things that have happened here very recently, which I'm sure.

[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:56.960]
You got a good idea what I'm talking about come Tuesday. Once I finally get some answers. If I do and I'm pretty damn sure I will because I'm pretty pissed off about all of this. But anyway, then the stuff is going to hit the fan because remember what I said several months ago if anything mysterious, if anything bad happens, forget about what it appears to be. Just look at old crater face. That's what it's all about because this is the way these people work. Squash everybody. Even the eight billion dollars sisters will ain't going to work. But just keep that in mind as we discuss some of these other things as we will.

[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:11.520]
How's that phone line coming 10 51 at W I O D 16 W I O D more fun than waxing your bikini line. Look at this. I just noticed a note here. I had seen this inside radio thing. Here's a note from a nickel Steve Dickel.

[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:22.140]
Neal that this happened if not something go after inside radio. See if he had any clue what was going on here. I don't expect him to be listening all the time because he does have that door closed in there. It's probably busy.

[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:34.680]
But it says Paxon Zeta drops classic rock for mainstream a or this is inside radio which goes to a radio stations all over the country on facts. It says that's today when but Paxon's Mime station finishes its eight is a to music stun.

[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:44.360]
Now this was yesterday. Meanwhile, there's a soap opera building cross town talent talker Neil Rogers accuses the dumped Ron and Ron morning team of using their on air

[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:55.620]
revelation about Ron D as wife having a to gain sympathy and stave off cancellation of the show suggesting they're trying to exploit the aids issue Ron and round of pronounced themselves devastated by what they claim was a sudden termination.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:03.460]
Paxon PD Neal Mercky says it was all about Lausy ratings and Bob a bond casted over this et cetera. Well, of course it happened. We had that on the year two weeks ago.

[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:12.680]
That people in the business all over the place who had known about this thing for months about a round a as wife having aids that it was not a big secret that was pretty well known in the industry.

[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:23.940]
They knew about it for more than a month over at Zeta and the timing of it according to a lot of people and that's I believe that I believe that this was in a desperate attempt to try to elicit a lot of support to rally the troops around.

[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:37.380]
And I think it stinks and that's my opinion whether anybody likes it or not I think that to exploit somebody's illness no matter what illness it is to try to like get brownie points and try to like hang on to a station that's bad could be wrong but I don't think so.

[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:52.180]
And as far as nickel dime is concerned get get busy in there do something where's that new schedule where's the new lineup for next week nickel dime come on let's let's put out a lineup so we know we can start promoting what's going to be on the year although if it's done in Mike let's let's not here is for a lot of day.

[00:40:52.180 --> 00:41:04.360]
Hello new yes sir it is so great that you decided to stop giving away that free crap man I am so tired of those people calling you up and sucking around yeah it's just beautiful.

[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:14.180]
Why did you call me for sir to suck around to see if you place blue jack stuff oh what yeah no see he's upset because people because he wants to suck around all I by the way

[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:32.440]
but another fact yesterday from that boy Greg putts even after the one I read on the year which I see if I see it's got his name on it just toss it now just absolutely you hopeless take up part cheesy go out and get some what all of these to call those things that they used to sell they were illegal punch boards.

[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:42.540]
Wait before you were born jurors they had punch boards and they had like all these little holes in them and they were like am I it was it was an illegal thing was a gambling thing go on sell some punch board go on and check

[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:51.000]
everybody's mailbox and make sure that the mail is coming to the right house that would be a good public service Greg do something constructive we have an open line in date 751 we have one in a

[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.040]
brown or five to four and one on the purple line at pound I.O.D. and you notice that no matter how I've tried I've tried all week long because I believe it's

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.020]
something that's very very very serious even though a lot of people take it cavalierly and most people don't want to talk about it the thing with the

[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:13.760]
jive as behavior in sports especially on a football field and not only but especially at university of Miami and like I said the here

[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:20.900]
and I was shocked I was so pleased that I'm not I'm not the only person that's got the balls to come on and talk about how unacceptable and

[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:28.420]
embarrassing and grotesque and disgusting that behavior is and the jive and around the dance and around and like you know there was one

[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.520]
really good call he at least on sports talk see a couple of people will talk about that but I miss you all they wanted

[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.360]
something for free but somebody made a very good point that is when you're going to go out there and behave like that as

[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.460]
you know that's unacceptable is you better win every game and because you're talking to trash and you're not you're not

[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.720]
carrying the cash you're blowing the big one and that's why they're on their hands and knees and tears when it's all

[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:57.500]
over when to get the rascals the joke is pathetic but hey like Phil says it's college ball it's little league man I've been trying to tell people

[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:04.260]
is done that for years all of those kids wake up and get with the program and elevate this community beyond a little league

[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.160]
place it's bush league it always has been and probably always will be can't we be a city can we be a real

[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.240]
place oh it's the what's the expression they always used that they love to use

And I mean, we're here all the time through the faces

[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.420]
They ran into some guy half full

[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.700]
Signs, lines, way up in a sign

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.000]
Buying up a silly program in my mind

[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.660]
Do this, don't do that, we are they the signs

[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.580]
Oh hey now, Mr. Cashew Reach

[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.340]
You can't approach well on people's debris

[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.340]
You should talk to your tired ass geek

[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.820]
What we ain't supposed to be queer

[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.620]
Dreaming, feeling lonely

[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:06.560]
And the wings says you've got the high-level chip cause to ramp up the air

[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.500]
I know I already have

[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.960]
I hope you do this, won't you do that

[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.500]
And the wings is everybody welcome

[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.080]
Come in watch my things play

[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.820]
I'm sorry boy, you suck, he's right

[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.560]
Now I don't have a penny

[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.000]
Oh I got my whole free will

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.780]
Can't hate my whole boy high

[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.640]
You won't see a load of doubt for me

[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.000]
Get out to see piece of shot

[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.080]
Sign, sign, way up in a sign

[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.420]
Buying up a silly program in my mind

[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.360]
Do you piece of shot, you piece of sign

[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.480]
You hurt

[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.760]
1109 and WID, the signs are everywhere

[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.620]
Man they all look like a big twist and cross hanging over America

[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.440]
As a matter of fact, next time you go to a ball game

[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.140]
To the racetracked any sporting event

[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.480]
You're going to notice that what used to be the stars and stripes

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.460]
Is a giant swastika because that's where we're going now

[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.760]
In a case you missed it on 11 o'clock news

[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.820]
The fewer over Josh Lennelder's, Joyce Lennel and whatever to hell her name is

[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.380]
Doesn't quit

[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.860]
Now there's an outcry at the University of Arkansas

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.260]
Medical Sciences School where she went to teach after Clinton and Fire

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.640]
To a surgeon general because she had the audacity to tell it the way it is

[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.900]
Conservative state law makers in Arkansas say her views on abortion

[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.760]
Drug legislation and gay rights make her unfit for the med school

[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.680]
And at least want to suggesting that he and his colleagues might try to block the school's funding

[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.900]
If she gets a job

[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.400]
So we don't like what you say you can't work, you can't breathe, you can't live

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.660]
We taught the truth in the back about masturbation

[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.100]
They should not be told lies

[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.000]
But you know hair is going to grow on their hands

[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.140]
They're going to go crazy, they're going to go blind

[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.820]
We shouldn't lie until we're going about the bomb

[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.180]
You mean they're not?

[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.800]
What do you got to think about this penis thing?

[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:09.760]
Oh my god

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.880]
So anyway that's the latest as we continue

[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.520]
I mean they've only been in the like couple of days

[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.820]
They don't even have their ass warm on a CD even though they've been working 24 hours

[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.320]
Today just like the Nazis were back in the beginning of Nazi Germany

[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.740]
Like rewriting the entire constitution and kind of like taking apart

[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.740]
And little things like the Billorite stuff like that

[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.300]
We have an open line in Broward 5249463524 SIG HIL

[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.580]
And let's go to a mobile in Miami, hello?

[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.000]
Neil!

[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.260]
How you doing sir?

[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.120]
It's really great

[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.620]
Good, good, listen my son's only a year old and he's already playing with it

[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:40.960]
Really?

[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.160]
Oh yeah, I mean he's on, he's on I would hope

[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:43.880]
I would hope so

[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.320]
That's good

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.500]
Human beings only going to do it, make some feel good

[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.080]
There you go

[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.000]
Don't tell a conservators that though

[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.840]
Listen first of all I don't think I'm going to get my voice back before the game

[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.780]
It's only going to get worse

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.560]
But has anybody called and told you yet about Wayne Jr. in the paper?

[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.240]
No

[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.780]
Okay, about his boat that was stolen and to get it back he offered two super-bulk tickets

[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.620]
It's on the front page of the local section of the hero

[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.120]
Oh the hero, I don't read the hero down to penalty of death but I might make a set of five

[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.820]
Find the copy, it's great, but guess what seats he offered?

[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.980]
No bleed in the end zone

[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.860]
Oh now you don't expect good seats just to get his boat back to it

[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.100]
I would a little bit carried away

[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.940]
It was a 31-foot cabin cruiser and you know how quick they got it back after they offered to take it to our

[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:30.320]
Yeah, I'll tell you what, listen if anybody out there who stole Wayne Jr.'s boat

[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.480]
He's got that boat, it's a 31-foot cabin cruiser

[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:33.700]
Right

[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.100]
I'll give you my two seats right on a 50-yard line

[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.240]
How do you like that?

[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.120]
So bring it right by here, just zip it down the bay

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.580]
Just, well, doc, right out here, be on till two o'clock

[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.440]
And I'll head on home and you can have the tickets, you got them right here in the building

[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.260]
That's an awesome deal

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:46.780]
All right

[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.080]
Hey, go dolphin thanks

[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.360]
Thanks

[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:48.700]
See ya

[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.800]
Okay, we can put him to shame, I mean what a piker

[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.960]
Oh, I'll give you a couple of nosebleeds, he's might even get a little oxygen for you

[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.380]
If the coach don't use it all up first

[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.840]
Here is a shocking thing, I mean this makes Joyce Lynn Jocelyn pale in a win significance

[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.580]
Andrew Greeley as an going West young man, or was that Horace Greeley

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:10.120]
Father Reverend Andrew Greeley, who's always writing this stuff that gets the Catholic hierarchy very very upset

[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.700]
The sexually oriented father says that Catholics really like sex

[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.340]
That's right, Catholics are doing it more than anybody else according to you

[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.680]
According to the Reverend Andrew Greeley

[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.320]
More than two-thirds of Catholics engage in sex at least once a week, not necessarily with their mate

[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.040]
Compared to 56% of non-Catholics, how do you like that?

[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.220]
A big difference there, I don't know how big he didn't draw a map

[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:38.140]
Among older persons half of Catholics, age 55 and older reported having sex at least once a week compared to only 40% of others

[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:42.400]
Catholics also score higher on sexual playfulness scales

[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.380]
For example, 30% of... oh man

[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.280]
The Pope is going to be foaming at the mouth when he hears about this

[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.980]
There's going to be a lot of these guys, one and a half come the altiboy's, haven't been paying attention to this

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.820]
They also score higher on the sexual playfulness scales, for example, 30% of Catholics say

[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:05.680]
They have purchased erotic undergarments, either often or sometimes compared to 20% of non-Catholics

[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.260]
Even single Catholics are more sexually active than non-Catholics Greeley said

[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:15.920]
Just a third of single Catholic adults reported being chased during last year, anybody been chasing you?

[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.120]
Compared to 43% of single Protestants

[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.140]
Choose, of course, only do it when the credit cards get revoked

[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.060]
But I mean, that goes on to a big thing

[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.180]
This is in the herald of today's matter, pact on page 6f

[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.560]
Appropriately enough, huh?

[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.260]
Page 6f as in father, under the religion side

[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.040]
What's that guy to do with religion, man?

[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.440]
What does that guy do? This is disgusting. See, this is the impact of people like Joyce Lynn again

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.140]
Now we even got these damn renegade priests writing about sex

[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.060]
Pretty soon they're going to be having it

[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:48.940]
Then we'll really all be going to hell again

[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.180]
Father O too, guy

[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:50.940]
Exactly

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.500]
Let's do a lady in Miami, hello

[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.300]
Hi Neil

[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:54.860]
How you doing?

[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.500]
Good, how are you?

[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.180]
Are you Catholic?

[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.540]
No, okay

[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.840]
So a Catholic boyfriend

[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.280]
Are you a Catholic boyfriend?

[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:00.640]
Yes, I am

[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.640]
Is he like doing it a lot?

[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.140]
Um, I take the fifth

[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.960]
No, come on, a lot

[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.500]
I'll take the fifth

[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.400]
In other words, only once in a great while

[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.260]
No

[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.740]
Only once in a hour

[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:12.980]
Only once in a week

[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:13.840]
Sexual drive

[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.300]
Okay

[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.200]
Very healthy apathy

[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.220]
He knows how to drive it, right?

[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:17.780]

[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:24.080]
Listen, did you hear that Rick Sanchez, you know how he would sometimes go guess lecture at FIU?

[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.600]
And the paper yesterday, the herald, I know you don't read it, he's going to have his own class

[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.740]
Yeah, I heard Phil talking about that yesterday

[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.320]
They had the guy from Channel 7 on

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:37.880]
And he's going to be teaching people how to make cocktails after you hit guys in your car after you do a little head and run

[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.520]
He's going to teach him how you slide away from the cops, how you sweet talk them and go home and have a couple of cocktails

[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.980]
Yeah, I thought that was good

[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.020]
It's going to be cute, yeah

[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.800]
I went to the Orange Bowl

[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.320]
Yeah

[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.100]
Game

[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.520]
And I'm a UM fan

[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.080]
But I graduated from University of Texas

[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.840]
So, they're first in my heart but I'm so far away that it's hard

[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:04.060]
Anyways, fourth quarter, the end of the third quarter and we still had the lead

[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.020]
And some jerks behind us as soon as they hit the fourth quarter

[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.900]
Everybody puts their fingers up for four

[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:13.160]
And he's like, we got it, this is it, we're home free, we won the game

[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.120]
They're home free, all right

[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.660]
Yeah, and I'm just going, oh no, you know, there's no way we're home free

[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.780]
Besides the fact that I knew we were going to blow it anyways

[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:23.500]
I mean, even after, we're still 17 to 9, what were you, I was 17?

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:24.240]
No, 24

[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.340]
No, but we're still 17

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.880]
It was 17 to 9, even after they had first a goal on the four

[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.780]
And Osborne said in that stupid pass plan, first down a gut intercepted

[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.140]
I know

[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.200]
And it was still 17 and I'm I'm going to hit the ball back

[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.460]
I know, it was sick, real sick

[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.100]
I don't know if you remember, I called you about my dog being on Prozac

[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:42.700]
Yeah

[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.420]
Do you remember that?

[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:43.940]
Yes I do

[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.560]
She's off

[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.460]
She's off the Prozac and let me tell you she has much more of her personality back

[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:53.120]
So maybe we should think about getting the governor off it

[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.720]
I was just going to say, you beat me to the punch, I was going to say if you keep giving it long enough, she's going to turn into a she-coon

[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:02.020]
No, I'm telling you, if you might have, if I did, she might have

[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.400]
Because the governor, if he runs again, he's going to go after the she-coon vote in the next election

[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.440]
That's true

[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.540]
I'm telling you, that's what got him over the top this year

[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.180]
Yeah, wow

[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.020]
Was that heavy-coon vote

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.200]
All right, Neil, that's all out of material

[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.020]
Have a great weekend

[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.680]
See ya, bye-bye

[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.140]
Open line and date 751, 1 and Broward, 524, W-I-O-D

[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.260]
Catholics really like sex, they really do

[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.280]
All right

[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.540]
All the Catholics are going to be calling on a passion phone

[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:31.020]
They're going to be having passion with their phone when Aaron comes on Aaron Nobra on Monday night

[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.200]
Neon God

[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.020]
Anyway, it's 11-16 at W-I-O-D, it's Friday, you bastards, that's right

[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.320]
6-10 W-I-O-D

[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:41.440]
For better reception, take off your clothes and raise your antenna

[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:49.880]
This is the show of tomorrow with new rehearsals

[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.480]
This is the show of the show

[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.600]
Do you know what it is?

[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.620]
Politicians have put orphanages back in the mood

[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.040]
And that's why we're putting them back on Broadway

[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.220]
In the camp near the head, written by their little decons, Newt Gengri

[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.700]
Please, Newt, please now have some more

[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.060]
It's political twist

[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.980]
Won't pay anything for kids, not anything

[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:18.120]
Your well-fed free ride is through

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:23.620]
Political twist, the story of one man with clouds and millions without

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:26.780]
Take them all away from their bothers

[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.600]
Boys town as well as should go

[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.560]
Here's what people are saying about political twist

[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.240]
I miss my baby

[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.340]
Mama, where are you?

[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.800]
Who's don't give a hoot?

[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.640]
He's trying to ho-shot

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.620]
Political twist, it's the musical for the 90s, the 1790s

[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.240]
It's 11-20 at W-I-O-D, there's an open line in day 751

[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:54.420]
And at Purple Line, now I'm starting to get a little bit pissed

[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:55.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.540]
Because that Purple Line is our only link to the people in the...

[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.200]
All those little mini-vans out there

[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.800]
People who are driving those little mini buses, they ought to every one of them be off the road

[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.540]
This thing in Dade County with these so-called...

[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.060]
And they're all Haitian drivers too

[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.200]
I don't want to say that Haitians can't drive but they can't

[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.620]
But I mean, where do they find these people that are driving these beat up old mini buses?

[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.220]
This is public transportation?

[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:21.760]
Like I said, in a major city, would you have a thing like this?

[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.440]
Would these rickety old smelly diesel-puking oil burning pieces of crap

[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.860]
With guys who just got off a banana boat who wouldn't know a driver's license if you stuck it up their ass

[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:33.140]
Which is probably where they found it

[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.200]
Mini bus, yeah man!

[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.720]
Just let me weave all over from one lane to the other

[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.840]
I've got to drop a few people off here like in the middle of the road

[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.640]
So get out of my way you ugly face, you very nice

[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.500]
Pound I-O-D on a cellular one line

[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.640]
If that don't start ringing pretty soon, we're...

[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.280]
That's just gonna be it, kiss the death, Wayne's put us out of business

[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.280]
Here's Margate, hello

[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.760]
Yes, Neil

[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.300]
Yes sir

[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.880]
Look, I'm the manager of restaurant in Coral Springs

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.380]
Yes

[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:01.700]
And I'm an avid dolphin fan, I know you're not really fond of the dolphins

[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.220]
Right, that's correct

[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.960]
How come you don't like them so much?

[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.900]
Listen, I don't want to... do you listen to this show?

[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:08.580]
Yes I do

[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.820]
Then why do I have to repeat everything about what I've just... I've gone over it a million times

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.880]
I see it's...

[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:12.980]
Is there all fat swabs?

[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:13.640]
What?

[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.200]
Because you say they're all fat swabs?

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.180]
What does it have to do with what they look like?

[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.440]
What does that have to do with it?

[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.380]
I don't know

[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.740]
I don't like their attitude, I don't like their shoe-lite, I don't like Wayne

[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:25.540]
I don't like the ambiance of the whole team

[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.640]
I don't like their attitude toward this radio station

[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.500]
I don't like the way they stiff everybody all the time

[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.540]
I just add Brian Cox makes me nauseous

[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.500]
I have they really stiffed you before

[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.520]
But do you mean if they stiffed us?

[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.020]
I mean, I have they really like said they'd be on your show and they didn't

[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.040]
All the time, not on this show but on this station

[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.520]
I don't have guests on this show but they've done it on sports talk

[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.500]
Over and over, more often than not

[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:49.480]
Since Brian Cox decided that since he just happens to have a show on QAM

[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.140]
that we're going to stick it to the IOD

[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.680]
Plus the fact that he's just without a sense of humor

[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.900]
They're just a bunch of spoiled assholes is what they are for the most part

[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.080]
And I don't like them

[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.300]
If somebody's going to stick it to me, what am I going to do to go and support them?

[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.140]
Well, if you need any help getting rid of those tickets, Neil

[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:06.740]
What?

[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.460]
If you need any help getting rid of those tickets

[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.220]
Get outta here

[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.020]
What, and see there's what I just rest my case

[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.580]
If I need any help, I won't need any help and you won't be getting them

[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.780]
That's for sure, okay pal?

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.460]
If I need any help, the guy's bringing the yacht right over here now

[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.000]
Wayne has in good juniors yacht is in the bay behind the station right now

[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.900]
I hope Rick Sanchez keeps his greasy hands off it please

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.060]
It's just been polished and waxed and the boat too

[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.740]
And I got my two tickets and the guy who brings that yacht is the guy who's going to get him

[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.040]
And you ain't going to see him

[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.460]
Got a guy to go through this verbal foreplay

[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]
How come you don't like him?

[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.020]
Everybody who listens knows the story

[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.580]
I'm not going to go support their pretended support

[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.680]
A bunch of guys with a crappy attitude who want to like you

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.760]
They have no sense of humor from the coach, the Brian Cox

[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.140]
To a lot of his teammates out there

[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.080]
There's a few good guys out there, Danny, Danny is great

[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.700]
You're never going to get me to knock Dan Moreno

[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.100]
Even if he don't ever show up on our show, I don't care about that

[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.460]
He's great, one of the all-time greats

[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.420]
One of the greatest players I ever put on a jockstrap

[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.760]
Takes a lot of abuse from people who expect him to be perfect and win every game

[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.000]
But that's Miami of course

[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.160]
Oh, the university lost a couple of football games

[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.660]
This guy is for all, geez, poor baby

[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.620]
I can just see it Michigan State

[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:20.580]
I can see on one of the great institutions in this land

[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.740]
I can just see they lose a couple of games which they lose several every year

[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.060]
And nobody is all I've concerned about

[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.540]
I can just see them running around

[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.200]
Oh, the sky is falling off

[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.640]
We better like, we better all lock ourselves in our rooms this weekend

[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.200]
And just beat ourselves with chains

[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.340]
Well now these people are going to grow up already

[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:44.980]
And the thing in the paper this morning says Dennis Erickson's on his way to Seattle

[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.000]
It's just about a done deal

[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.660]
If he's got even a small brain in his head left after drinking all that milk

[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.940]
If he's got a small one, I mean brain

[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:55.620]
He'll be on his way to San Jose which is not far from Seattle soon

[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.540]
Because I don't know the guy personally

[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.840]
The people in our sports department including DFO they tell me he's a good guy

[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.760]
Although I still think he's a prisoner of the program

[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.280]
He hasn't, he's had no control over what's going on over there

[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.120]
It's out of his hands, it's beyond his control

[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.420]
This whole ambiance of this barbaric crap

[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.080]
Whatever you call it that they're doing over there

[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.040]
And he'll get out here because the guy comes in here he had the audacity to lose a couple of games

[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.000]
Oh, he's out

[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.040]
It's getting worse than Notre Dame

[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.800]
All new people out there who always take on a shot at Notre Dame which believe me

[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.120]
Nobody hates them more than I do

[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.920]
They're obnoxious, Lou Holt should only croco wicked death

[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.740]
In fact, the kid that carries his cord around beyond him about a wrap it around his neck

[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.200]
I pay admission to see that

[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.740]
Hang him up there right next to Tiffany a couple of notches higher

[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.580]
But I mean everybody's always pointed the finger at them

[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.300]
All-member Terry Brennan, oh he lost a couple of games, you're out Terry

[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.920]
This is a good religious institution, praise the Lord

[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.680]
Let's do a 50 minute benediction because we're holier than everybody else

[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.580]
And I have a lot of sex like all the other good Catholics

[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.340]
Father

[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.420]
But everybody's pointing at them, what about right here?

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.160]
It's becoming obsession, it's like neurotic

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.560]
Oh they lost the game in the orange ball, who wise you know what are we gonna do?

[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.700]
What are we gonna do?

[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.720]
Like Al Martino, I think Don Corleone needs to come in and slap him around the push a little bit like he didn't a godfather

[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.620]
Act like a man, that's what you can do

[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.620]
We'll send Tom Hagen to California or to horse heads in New York

[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.880]
He'll take care of things for you, then you won't lose no more football game, then they will fear you

[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.900]
But in the meantime cut the crap

[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.560]
Anyway, where are we going? We're going to a mobile and crawl spring, hello?

[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.220]
Brian Cox, Sucks and Bokers

[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.020]
Yeah, here's a lady in Bokers, hello

[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.820]
Hi Neil, yes ma'am

[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.780]
Okay, I think Russian limbaugh is a Republican demon

[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.720]
And I certainly pray he doesn't spread his semen

[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.740]
For if he does in the world over, there'll be dolls and thurms and gingrichs and clovers

[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.860]
So I say to him, you're the right of the right

[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.460]
You know who the teacher is, that's that chronic woman

[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.460]
We have an open line in Brett, you know who that is?

[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.780]
That's someone from Locca Hatchy or wherever the hell she's from? You know that you wouldn't know that voice?

[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.660]
Oh come on

[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.420]
Open line at Broward, 524, what on the green line?

[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.660]
1-800-944-9463

[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.160]
Don't be saying disgusting things on the air like Newt gingrich, okay?

[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.140]
Do you hear what she said?

[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.080]
And then to make it even worse, she compounded it with doll

[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.680]
Here's Miami shores, hello

[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.220]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:17.620]
Okay

[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.820]
You know and I know that in 86 when the hurricanes went out to the fiesta ball

[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.020]
Probably the most talented hurricane team that choked

[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:26.500]
Yeah

[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.660]
Had they won that game?

[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.840]
The Teagues would be the uniform of the day today

[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.180]
But not only the hurricane and the rest of the country

[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.060]
We put the bottom line in

[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.160]
Wrong, wrong

[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.480]
If that's the case then how come since they won four national championships?

[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:40.700]
Right

[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.440]
How come that all the other teams aren't out there jivest and doing the same?

[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.860]
You think that Joe Patrano is going to allow that to happen?

[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.100]
Oh no, not any cl- not not any cl-

[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.200]
Anybody with any cl-

[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.680]
Do you think Lou Holtz is much as I dislike him?

[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.220]
Do you think they're going to let that go on at Notre Dame?

[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.040]
No, but what I'm trying to say is that the hurricane's

[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.020]
But the bottom line is Erickson is a prisoner and if they win

[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.520]
But don't try to extend it to everybody else

[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.420]
Because the coach he's the one that's supposed to be in charge

[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.080]
And the inmates are running the asylum in that particular institution over there

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.680]
Which is one of the reasons that all this fraud and all these pelgrants and all this scandal

[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.660]
And again they're not alone, I mean that's going on everywhere

[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.220]
But the fact is this is why that's all gotten out of control

[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.260]
Is because they have this obsession with winning and winning and winning

[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.780]
And every, you know, Ted foot who's a turdburger but nonetheless a few years ago

[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.780]
He says, oh well you know we have to get back to academics at the University of Miami

[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.700]
And everybody's saying get out of here, even mad at you saying here's a guy

[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.600]
Don't want to shower with the guys, he doesn't understand what it's all about

[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.180]
See that's the problem with America is the dummy that's part of the dumbing of America

[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.800]
Is that being a junk is more important than having a brain

[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.380]
I agree with you, here's another example

[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.260]
And it takes no talent and no intellect to go out there and do that step and fetch it routine

[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:50.400]
And I'm going to tell you and I know I know this for a fact that most people who are listening to me right now

[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.900]
And all weeks since I've been talking agree with me but they don't have the balls to say it

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.460]
I think you're right, I think you're going to be a moron

[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:01.600]
If black people aren't embarrassed by the behavior of those black athletes then there's something wrong with them

[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.180]
I agree with you, here's another example, University of Michigan

[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:09.840]
If you look at the basketball team with that Fab5 with the long shorts they basically ran that asylum

[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.560]
That coach Bill Fisher pretty much didn't know what was going on

[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.440]
Yeah but he's 200 years old

[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.300]
Who Fisher?

[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:16.700]
Yeah

[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.520]
He took over for the other guy who got fired on Arizona

[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.060]
Which guy, who follows the University of Michigan basketball?

[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.300]
Anyway, which one was the old guy the one that looked like he was in a coma on the sideline?

[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.260]
It looked like John Wooden plus a hundred years

[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.480]
Yeah, he's gone

[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.420]
Two things that really hurt me as far as the celebration

[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:41.920]
One is when now the big thing in the NFL in fact is you slow down at the 15 year line and you walk into the end zone

[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.340]
Oh yeah

[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.800]
If that isn't a show up, if that isn't the most ridiculous thing to do

[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.120]
Yeah but let me ask you something, do white guys do that?

[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.140]
On a whole no, no, I agree with you, they do not do that

[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:55.880]
Why is it acceptable for black athletes to be doing all these and Dion Sanders to be doing his gyve as crap?

[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.160]
And of course when the kids see that they're trying to emulate that behavior like it's acceptable

[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.160]
And white guys for some reason don't do that

[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.340]
Even the guy the other day brought up Mark Gastono

[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.600]
Mark Gastono did, I mean he was an asshole and he used to jump up and down and stuff

[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.140]
But he wasn't doing the kind of stuff we're talking about

[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.680]
Right, no, he was just an idiot jumping up and jumping his head and going nuts

[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.200]
He was just a self-aggrandizing asshole

[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:23.860]
Right, I guess because the announcers I think are afraid to be labeled racist and afraid to say that it's ridiculous behavior

[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:29.720]
On a whole, most of them, I can't call Burke who for instance says it's exciting and they should be playing for a fight

[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:34.760]
He's such a sharel, he kisses everybody's ass whether it's you a van or the dolphins

[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.480]
He wouldn't have the balls to give his real opinion

[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.760]
I guarantee you he doesn't really believe that, not a chance of a billion

[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.300]
Well, in closing Hank, if they did that in baseball, they do do it in baseball

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.900]
Bobby Barnes showed up Bob Gibson like he does by looking at the ball

[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.100]
And you're a baseball, big baseball fan, his head will be handed to him in the next act that

[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.680]
No question about him, am I right or wrong?

[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.820]
Absolutely correct sir

[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.500]
Have a great weekend

[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:57.920]
Okay

[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.760]
Open line in two of them in dates, 7519463

[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.600]
Hey, stupid, just calm down Hank, you'll be alright

[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:11.100]
So anyway, the hockey season, it looks like it's definitely off, it's the sixth of January

[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.200]
They're having their holding their final meet, the board of governors tomorrow morning

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.380]
And it's said, said, said, you know

[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.820]
But you know something will survive without it, even though I'm pissed off

[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.420]
I'm pissed off, like Bradcock, I'm real pissed off, but I'll survive without it

[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:29.900]
And it'll kind of like if this is what it took with baseball and hockey to bring reality back and put sports in perspective

[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.060]
And salaries back in perspective and stop all of this bull crap or at least slow away down

[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.620]
Well, maybe it was worth it

[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:42.680]
But in the meantime, of course the baseball owners are saying, well, we're getting ready, we're trying out our first amateur-hour ball players here

[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:50.780]
We're getting a, give me a break if they really believe, if they really believe that you folks are stupid enough to pay big bucks to go out there

[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:56.280]
To sit in these, in these just absolutely sweltering heat and humidity in the middle of summertime

[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.200]
To watch a bunch of goofball juveniles playing baseball

[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.400]
Oh, I'm sorry, that's the Marlins, that's right

[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.180]
Lament 32 at WIOD

[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.320]
Sixteen WIOD

[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.580]
The only good Canadians are still in Montreal

[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:12.600]
Oh my god, if you play Hank Goldberg again, I'm gonna fucking throw up

[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.140]
Hank is God, I love Hank, I'm having a GFF with Hank

[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:21.480]
Hi, I'm fitness guru Susan Powder, it's the time of year everyone's rise to get in shape

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.600]
It's also called Influcies

[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:31.360]
And now with my new video, Copper Obex, you can use those gut-wrenching co-op stances to lose your gut habit

[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.080]
I don't have a cold

[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080]
No problem, here

[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.880]
Oh, fine

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.500]
You see when you order Copper Obex, you get my exciting new video

[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.580]
And a lot of used clean-up

[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.240]
You like, huh, huh, huh, huh

[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.600]
And three, and four

[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:49.040]
Wow, Copper Obex is a great way to get your heart pumping and your nose running

[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.060]
I can't breathe

[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.340]
I was sucking up your was

[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.100]
Oh, okay

[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.540]
And two, and three

[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.000]
I had feel of the birds

[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.500]
You have in thighs right?

[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.840]
I'm going by nostrils

[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.880]
And Copper Obex, catch the fever to the dead

[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.100]
Oh, what a

[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.420]
Suck it in and hold it

[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.560]
1134, WI-D, Phil Henry, a 2 this afternoon

[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.700]
And of course Phil, be out on the road, I assume, between 5 and 6 won't he?

[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.280]
Where are they going today? Do we have any idea? We don't?

[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.180]
Well, let's not get too carried away, and how about that schedule for Monday night?

[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.120]
Okay, I know I'm starting to get a little bit pushing now, just calm down, mind your own business

[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.480]
Yeah, but let's go to Sunrise, hello

[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.220]
Hello there

[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:26.740]
Yes sir

[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.920]
Good, good to hear it

[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.040]
Ryan Rond's off down here, do you know if there are still on up in Tampa?

[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:34.720]
Yes, they are

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.080]
They're on a Tampa or Lando, and the only place they went off is Jacksonville and Miami

[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:39.740]
And Miami

[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.140]
Yep

[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.400]
Okay, and did I hear yesterday coming on a...

[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.040]
Is it Costa?

[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.560]
Did the players don't play as well for Costa?

[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:56.200]
I said that there are very strong rumors from people who are in a position to know that the black players that there's a racial rift on a U of M football team

[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.740]
And the rumor has it that black players because what's the other kids the other quarterback?

[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.060]
Rond, Rond, Rond

[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:07.400]
They don't want to play for... they don't want Costa to be quarterbacked and the team has a result that have been a lot of drop passes

[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.920]
And they don't pass block and they don't like him

[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.260]
Right

[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.220]
Which if that's true of course is scandalous

[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.380]
Yeah, and I was watching that game and you said that it kind of makes sense, but that's so hard to believe that they would do that

[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.020]
Yeah, I just lose the game

[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.040]
Yeah, because I sure don't think they want to lose the game

[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.200]
But on the other hand, maybe they want to get Collins in there in a second half if Costa got took enough punishment

[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.140]
I mean, he was on his ass every play in the game

[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.700]
Yeah, I can't remember one play even on running plays where he wasn't just getting brutalized

[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.720]
He used, yep

[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.580]
But what can you do?

[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.840]
And now I'm beginning to understand why he's got this habit of always opening his mouth after the game and pointing fingers

[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.460]
Because he's the guy gets blamed all the time and they're laying down for him

[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.760]
I mean, they're just not doing anything

[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.820]
Yeah, they're laughing back there

[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:47.160]
Yep

[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.500]
And, uh, stop and I think they're gonna do it

[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:51.960]
Yeah

[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.940]
Going to Super Bowl

[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.560]
Good, and they're gonna win?

[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.580]
Going to Super Bowl

[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:58.600]
Going to Super Bowl, that'll be ugly, but hey, at least they'll be there, right?

[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.260]
That's right

[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.120]
It'll be ugly, but just all sleep on that day

[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.200]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:02.480]
Bye

[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.580]
Okay, Dolphin Super Bowl, here we go

[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:08.900]
My Dolphin's, baby

[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:12.920]
Right?

[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:14.500]
What's the, um...

[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.720]
You're landed for us, gonna have some fun

[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.600]
You've turned

[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.740]
Gonna move the ball on everyone

[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.340]
Well, the pass and chance don't stand a chance

[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.420]
We need some help

[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.700]
Gaston will never do a single back dance

[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.720]
We need some help

[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.920]
Gonna shut you down to a big zero

[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.400]
We need some help

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.380]
Go, you Dolphin's, go fish, go

[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.440]
We need some help

[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.380]
Go, you Dolphin's, go fish, go fish, go fish, go fish

[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:48.380]

[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.840]
It's, uh, 1137, at WIOD

[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.140]
That could be the all time right there

[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.520]
And I'm sure the coach show with his great sense of humor

[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.820]
I'm sure he understands it's all just in good clean fun

[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.220]
We have an open line in dead, of course he's now Catholic

[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.420]
Open line in dead, 7519-463-751-WIOD

[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.900]
Let's do a Hollywood, shall we?

[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:07.720]
Hollywood

[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.300]
Hello?

[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.320]
Hollywood is gone?

[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.500]
Like I said, Hollywood's a little late

[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:15.580]
Yes

[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.220]
That was good

[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.800]
That was excellent sir, nice ever

[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.000]
Wait, yeah, yeah

[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.800]
Okay, and he just stuck the phone up his ass

[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.280]
Good to get rid of those hemorrhoids man, it works like a charm

[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.720]
Open line in Broward now, 524-9463

[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.020]
Here's the lady in Miami, hello

[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:31.680]
Hello?

[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.300]
Yes?

[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.500]
Yeah, hi, how are you?

[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.020]
Okay

[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.820]
Why have you got your radio up?

[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:38.740]
Why?

[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.500]
Yes

[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.180]
I'm sorry

[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.860]
Because now you're going to get all confused and it's going to make everybody very upset including me

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.820]
That's true

[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.020]
Yeah, so speak to me and forget about the radio

[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:47.800]
Okay

[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.960]
What can I do for you?

[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.980]
So, what are you doing?

[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.340]
Doing great, how are you doing?

[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:53.400]
Fine

[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.620]
What is the purpose of your call?

[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:59.520]
Did you call to speak to me about something to offer your opinion, your analization of the world affairs?

[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.280]
What is it?

[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.200]
What do you want?

[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.280]
Sorry

[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.580]
Sorry for what?

[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:06.840]
Nevermind

[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.860]
What did you want?

[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.580]
You called for a reason, spit it out

[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.120]
Even Dr. Ruth says, when did you spit it out?

[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:12.960]
Come on, you can do it

[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.000]
I want to give you the courage to be a reason

[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.200]
I called for a reason

[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.420]
Okay, well what is it?

[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.700]
Well, do you know that lady, what's her name?

[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.320]
Oh, is this a woman?

[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.260]
Is this a woman?

[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:28.260]

[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.520]
It is a woman, an adult woman

[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.120]
Yes

[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.400]
Right, okay

[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.700]
I just want to make sure

[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.320]
Because you sound, you're getting a little spastic

[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.160]
Susan powder with the right

[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.600]
With the Katie Lang haircut, yes?

[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.380]
Yes, I mean...

[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:41.820]
What about her?

[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:42.920]
No

[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.620]
What about her? Say it, just say it

[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.440]
This is a man, she hung up

[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.040]
And on Monday she won't be able to say it anymore because New King rich is passing along over the weekend

[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.280]
Whatever she was going to say about Susan powder, pull a powder, forget it

[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.540]
Boy, you talk about sad

[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.960]
This is just, it's just a phone conversation

[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.740]
What are these people also on nervous about?

[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.760]
Oh, why would never call him, I'm intimidated

[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.840]
Would stop being such woosey as man, God

[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.860]
It's like that woman at day in a homestead, I thought she was going to have a stroke underfoot

[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:14.540]
Yeah

[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.420]
Like what's her name this morning that called Ruby?

[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.820]
Yeah, you, yeah

[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.580]
I love Ruby though, she's a nice lady but just don't call the show, please

[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.880]
Look what you did to Chris Baker, call him once, he's off the air

[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.700]
Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.260]
That was good

[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.020]
That was great

[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:36.360]
I did everything in my power to try to drag her out and get her because I know she didn't just call the dittle around

[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.980]
She wanted to say something, she just didn't have the balls

[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.740]
You know she picked up the phone, she dealt with her friend

[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:41.820]
She was a lady with no balls

[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.140]
She held on for 20 minutes

[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.300]
Right, and then she just couldn't spit it out

[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.440]
She was about it

[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.760]
Boy, what about Susan powder?

[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:49.780]
Stanky bitch

[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.480]
But anyway

[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.400]
The darn Shula card is the funniest thing

[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:53.920]
It is

[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.820]
Dunshula, I f***ing know

[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.560]
It's the best

[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.920]
And then afterwards when he says, thanks honey, then I really like it

[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.220]
Yeah

[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:10.580]
Alright, as bad as the, uh, jiminage call was, the interception return

[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.300]
That is the funniest thing

[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.220]
I thought you just said the darn Shula thing was the funniest thing

[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.580]
How can you be like two funniest things?

[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.660]
It's like having the 85 best Mexican restaurants in town, they can't all be the best

[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.180]
They're both good, the purpose of my call

[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.560]
The one thing that I've never...

[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.920]
It wasn't Susan powder, wasn't it?

[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.080]
No

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.100]
I f***ed it out my mind with the orange bowl

[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.620]
Was the kid at the end and the brastic guy that scored the two touchdowns towards the end

[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:39.940]
Yeah, after he scored, he laid the ball down

[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:40.180]
Right

[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.520]
And, oh they weren't doing any of that crap

[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.120]
Tom Osborne is, in fact you'll notice that even though they did dunk him with the gatorade there at the end of the game

[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.540]
Very reserved and, uh, no nonsense, they don't play that crap

[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.140]
That's right, and there's sports people in this town that defend that, uh, and I don't feel the same

[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.480]
It's indefensible and inexcusable and unacceptable, especially at a collegiate level

[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:02.740]
Yeah

[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.500]
It's not acceptable, these are just a bunch of kids

[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.820]
That's all they have no business going out there and acting like a bunch of jivas goofballs

[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.540]
That's not what people pay their money to see and if they do in Miami

[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.300]
Then there's something wrong with this town and with that university and I think there is

[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.140]
Well, it's something desperately wrong

[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.420]
It's barely a cut above high school football

[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.540]
I mean, I watched almost every bowl game I saw Alabama pull the game out there

[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.340]
It was an exciting game there, the citrus bowl

[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.860]
They said a barker through the touchdown pass there at the end of a very exciting game they came from behind

[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.220]
I didn't see any of that going on in that game

[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:32.500]
Yeah

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.520]
Any of it, I watched the, uh, the ducks and Penn State

[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.920]
I didn't see any of that crap going on in that game

[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.700]
There were like 575 million yards off and just by the ducks in that game

[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.920]
There were a very exciting game, didn't see any of that

[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.340]
You can have excitement, you can have great plays

[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.060]
You don't, that, that crap is unacceptable

[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.760]
Well, I think Eric's in that of there if he's, if he's smart, he's gonna be gone

[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.320]
And he, well, I don't know if he's smarter or not, but if he's gotta have a brain, he's out

[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.360]
Well, he could, if he's got even a small brain stem like Shula left, he's out

[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.080]
Listen, he could stick around for another 10 years and be, and be one of the best, you know, all time win

[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.200]
And take a lot of abuse

[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.880]
Yeah, or take a lot of abuse

[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.000]
Yeah, well, look at a guy like paternal, I don't like paternal, but you look at a guy like him

[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.900]
And he's been there a million years and he's won a billion games

[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:17.120]
And they don't give him any crap, I mean, they treat him like, uh, the king of the universe up there

[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.040]
Well, he's suing the, he's suing UM to reimburse him for the legal bills for that forte suit

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.420]
And which was just in the paper today and you're not, you know, you're not gonna sue your university if you're planning on sticking around

[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.420]
Yeah, that's a good point

[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.160]
And, uh, anyway, so he, I guess he got, he's gone

[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.560]
Yes, and he says that paper today it says kiss him goodbye

[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:43.480]
And he, and he got Edwin Poe last week to write that, you know, he was definitely sticking around for, for one point here

[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.380]
When somebody says I'm definitely sticking around, it's like when an owner says I'm giving you a photo confidence

[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.760]
That means have a nice life, goodbye start packing

[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.140]
Yeah, we'll have a good week in there

[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:51.840]
And you too, thanks

[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.980]
So yeah, open line and brown, 5249463524 WIOD 1144

[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:04.860]
And you know, 610 WIOD reminds you, friends don't let friends listen to anyone else

[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.320]
It's Friday, you bastard

[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.560]
Susan Powder, you know her as the loud bald headed impovercial queen

[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.780]
With a bikini wax job

[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:17.100]
Okay, okay, I was fat, but my ex husband is a jerk

[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:21.600]
Now she's back with a new self-help tape that helps you deal with the jerks of the 90s

[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.060]
You gotta eat, you gotta breathe, you gotta swell

[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.620]
Come on, you gotta start the obscenities

[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.340]
Excuse me, wait, hold on

[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:32.060]
But I need to say is you gotta start the f***ing obscenities

[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.860]
Susan's been through it all and she knows how to deal with it

[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.640]
Every morning I wake up, look in the mirror and say

[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.680]
Who the hell's gonna f*** with me today

[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.720]
She's just like you, but she's making a lot more money

[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.740]
I'm just a housewife who figured it out

[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:51.180]
If you shave your f***ing head, wear tight f***ing clothes and get 8750 for a video

[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.760]
You'll make a f***ing lot of money

[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.820]
Learn how to deal with life in the 90s with Susan Powder's newest video, start the obscenities

[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.240]
What the f*** happened to my hair?

[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.760]
Available wherever stupid ass f***ing ass like you by f***ing like this

[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.360]
Okay, I think we answered that lady's question

[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.180]
1147 at WIOD, let's go to Boka

[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.780]
By the way, the food is here from Rigatonis

[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.160]
I just thought I would mention that for those of you who like to eat on the air

[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.700]
Which we haven't done too much of lately, but yesterday and today two days in a row

[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:17.460]
But this looks well worth it at half the price

[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.740]
At five times the price, Angel Hair Pasta and Italian Sausage

[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.020]
We got Rigatoni, 4G's Rigatoni, we got Big Ziti

[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.340]
Am I right? Am I guessing good?

[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.380]
I can smell it all the way over here

[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.420]
It's beautiful, and if George ever gets through pochking around

[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.140]
It's gonna be great

[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:34.620]
Rigatonis by the way is a 33-33 North University drive between Sheridan and Sterling Road

[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.220]
In Davi slash Hollywood

[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.820]
Officially Davi, but it's really Hollywood

[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.300]
Okay, unless you park your horse

[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.120]
Thank you so much, that's a beautiful thing

[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.820]
Let's go to Boka

[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.260]
Hello?

[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.320]
Mr. Roger

[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.000]
Yes sir

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]
It's so good to hear your voice

[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:48.920]
I bet it is

[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.740]
I'm off, down to vacation going back tonight

[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.080]
When I get up in the morning every day and start talking to my dogs

[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.020]
I say to myself, boy, it sure is good to hear my voice

[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:55.820]
Then I know I'm alive

[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:58.400]
Exactly, son of Sam was hearing voices like that, wasn't he?

[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.140]
From his dog?

[01:20:59.440 --> 01:20:59.940]
Yeah, anyway

[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.800]
I know you're a big fan of the Godfather

[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.340]
Me?

[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.620]
Yes, that's right

[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.240]
Not the Don, not in Shulah, but the Don Chololion

[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.380]
Now, are you familiar with another epic gangster movie, Miller's Crossing?

[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.620]
Yes, are you weak?

[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:16.360]
Weak

[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.080]
It's alright

[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.300]
I would hardly say it's an epic

[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:22.720]
Is that the one where he takes him out into woods and is supposed to kill him?

[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.140]
Yep

[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.140]
Yeah, exactly

[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.600]
It's alright, I've seen it about two or three times

[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.920]
In other words, if I saw it two or three times, it can't be that bad

[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.340]
True

[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:30.140]
True

[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.060]
So, I'm...

[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:31.460]
Okay, I just want to talk about it

[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.060]
Don't put it in the same league with the Godfather

[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.860]
Yeah, well, different

[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.400]
But, uh, but good

[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.840]
Alright, Neil, uh, auto-material, see how it's about it

[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.480]
Have a great day

[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:41.680]
Yeah

[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.300]
Great weekend

[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.360]
See ya

[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.580]
Thank you so much

[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.980]
Beautiful, all kinds of sausage here

[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:52.080]
Got a little garlic bread, we got cheese wrapped in prosciutto, I believe that is, am I right?

[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:52.340]
Yes

[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:55.920]
Oh, all kinds of like pepperoni's and salamis

[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.700]
Like maybe genoma per amps, am I right?

[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.380]
Or mortadella or whatever it is, it's a beautiful thing

[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.420]
And fresh, uh, I don't want to say buffalo mozzarella would be, that'd be a bad thing to say

[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.420]
Don't say the buffalo part

[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.600]
Here's, uh, a lady in Key West

[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.080]
Hello

[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:13.080]
Neil Honey

[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:13.940]
How you doing, sweetie?

[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.160]
You guys are killing us down here, no star IOD anymore

[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.060]
Oh, or, yeah, we're killing you right?

[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.420]
Yeah, we cut you off right

[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.800]
But you have a small loyal following, like me

[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.280]
Well, what do you mean we cut you off?

[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.320]
We had nothing to do with it

[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.340]
Yeah, we'll keep going back and forth, honey

[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.280]
No, it's not, it's not back and forth at all

[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.080]
I would feel real, it's them

[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:31.620]
Mm-hmm

[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.020]
Yeah, well then they're killing us

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:38.060]
But I mean you guys, you should have a number where we can call you free, man, it should be free

[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.340]
What do you mean by that?

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.700]
For Key West?

[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:41.820]
Yes, for my birthday

[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.740]
You gotta be dreaming, you gotta be kidding me

[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.100]
But I would call you Neil

[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.660]
That's why we don't have it

[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:49.480]
No, that's not very nice, I'm trying to be nice to you, but listen

[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.300]
Here's, let's get to it, let's stop with all this foreplay, because I know this is not why you called

[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.520]
I know you called it about Susan Pound

[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.700]
She's too weird, man

[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.960]
She was good, wasn't she?

[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.020]
Great, Susan or the caller?

[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.300]
The caller, but I can understand you're a little bit like my husband, because you said you were giving her every opportunity

[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:06.960]
I was

[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.200]
Come on, get with her, what is it? Tell me what you want

[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.060]
And she was at the moment

[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.980]
Yeah, but see it's a radio show and the audience is going

[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.880]
Like this, I mean you can't let the audience go into a coma while you're trying to get this woman to say something

[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.060]
You know, just say something

[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.200]
That is correct

[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.800]
Like I had bird, I hate the bird car, where she says just play anything, play something

[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.160]
That keeps talking, in her case it was the opposite

[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.340]
Okay, here's my question, and I want you to be honest

[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:27.780]
What's your question?

[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:32.240]
First of all, don't you think that the past two weeks were great short Fridays and no Mondays?

[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:32.580]
Yes

[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.020]
That's the way of the world as a good day

[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:35.920]
I think so

[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.360]
But right before I went away from the holiday

[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.920]
Let me give you a little more enthusiastic cancer than that, by the way

[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.080]
Okay

[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.120]
Here it is

[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:42.580]
Yeah

[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.180]
This is definitely the way it should be

[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:46.760]
I love him

[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.900]
In fact, they should give us a lot of Friday and or Mondays off

[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.220]
Exactly

[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.480]
They would have a happy holiday

[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.120]
I will say one thing about this company, it's about the only good thing I can say for them

[01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.020]
Is that when you go, you take your vacations and like I have like a kind of hoarded extra days

[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.800]
You'll know that sometimes I'll take off on a Thursday and Friday and then all through the next week

[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:08.120]
And I've added tacked on a couple of extra days because then when you do that and you have the extra weekend in there

[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.580]
It really makes for a good like about a 10 day vacation

[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:12.100]
And they never say a peep about that

[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.960]
And of course if they did, I can tell them where to stick it

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.040]
You're the golden goose, Neil

[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.220]
They would keep me believe you

[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.180]
But I noticed Rick and Sets did that last time too and I hope that a lot of people start doing that

[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.280]
I don't want to be the bearer of bad tidings for management

[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:27.840]
But the time off is well invested, it's a good investment because then you come back all with your batteries be charged like Sally

[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.640]
I agree, so here's my question

[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.080]
Before I went away, I listen to your station all day every day

[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.280]
And I think I've felt pretty good about myself being clued in with our buddy Phil Hendrick

[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:39.680]
Yeah

[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.500]
The Friday before I went away, the Friday before Christmas

[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.280]
Was that business with Bo Camper for real?

[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.960]
No, he, Phil told about that

[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.520]
But I didn't, I was away, that's what I meant

[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:53.960]
See, that's the only thing that Phil has ever done that really I didn't like

[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.660]
And it wasn't that I didn't like when he did Bo Camper the night before

[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.240]
Which obviously you know listen to sports talk and why should you be the one?

[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.140]
Actually, I heard about two minutes of him pissing because he wasn't at the party

[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.180]
That's all I heard because I've gone to the grocery store

[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.500]
Well, I didn't hear it either but evidently he went through a contrived deal about to Phil

[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:15.420]
And this and that and Phil is hurting his livelihood and yaddy yaddy yaddy yaddy yaddy

[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.100]
And all this other crap

[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.660]
Oh, that's beautiful

[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.760]
And and they you know it was all contrived

[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.220]
The whole thing

[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:23.960]
And evidently little Andy got his nose in them in a little bit

[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.540]
And they set this thing up for the next day

[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.600]
And it was all contrived and Phil finally came on here and fessed up about it later in the show

[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.820]
But if you only heard the first part of the show, a lot of people thought it was for real

[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.460]
And that they were really having a big feud

[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.020]
I even called and said like Bo Camper's a crybaby gets where it's ill

[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.080]
He got me man

[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.400]
See, I this is one thing that they're doing here which I am just vehemently

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.800]
I mean absolutely a hundred and I mean with manage, manage is a character

[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.460]
He doesn't have to put on any phone, he's just a nutcase and everybody loves it

[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.540]
Or at least most people love it

[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.420]
But when these other guys want to start trying to be comedians

[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.860]
And they want to start trying to do our stick

[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.800]
And then this maniac program director wants depot to start playing comedy stuff that we play during our shows

[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.660]
I mean, you know we got enough people ripping off our stuff already

[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.120]
We don't need the sports guys trying to be amateur neo-rodgers and Rick and Southern Phil Henry's

[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.940]
I don't want to make you mad

[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.900]
But I know that you say like you don't get it

[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.760]
Why do people want to look at me through their binoculars and they expect me to put on a side show when they come meet me somewhere

[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:20.800]
When I say don't get it

[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.740]
I don't get it enough but that's another show I'm saying

[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.820]
Okay, but here's my question

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.720]
And I'm not trying to be a joe pop psychologist

[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.400]
But you're right, but I've been diant to him

[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.560]
Why don't you admit it but you are

[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.300]
I hear you talk about mommy

[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.600]
I've heard a former chiropractor brother mentioned once

[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.400]
How come you never mentioned your father?

[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.260]
How come I don't mention him?

[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.060]
Yeah, like you never said

[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.220]
Because I have nothing to do with him

[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:42.280]
Is he living?

[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:42.740]
Yes

[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.640]
And you haven't had anything to do with him for...

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.780]
Or I would say 20 some years

[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.920]
See, this... I had to break the news to you

[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.660]
This show is a radio show

[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.840]
And even though there are things in my life that I discuss here because it's part of me and my personality and my existence

[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.580]
This is not like a biography

[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.020]
I know and that's what I mean

[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.140]
It's just that we are so interested

[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.200]
I'm not interested in what?

[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.680]
Interested in everything about you, though?

[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.660]
But you wouldn't be interested in him at all, believe me

[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.920]
Is one of the least interesting people I can imagine

[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.000]
Well, he missed out because you are very interesting and I do listen every day

[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.120]
Well, thanks for sucking around

[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:13.760]
Enjoy your lunch

[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.500]
Have a great weekend

[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.280]
Bye-bye

[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.740]
Come on, Mary, dig in there, it's so the price is right

[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:18.900]
Mmm

[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.400]
Well, you can see how we do that food

[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.300]
Oh my God, do you think there's enough food here?

[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.260]
Jesus, Joseph and Esther, thank you very much

[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.340]
I pray it's fantastic

[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.340]
It's not good, it's spectacular

[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:31.460]
Sensational

[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.320]
But you didn't give me my knife back and I'll never forgive you for that

[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.340]
Because I'm going to eat my-ha-ha-ha

[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.240]
That's that I want to make you feel bad but if I can't cut my sausage

[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.280]
If you can't cut your meat, whatever they say there in England

[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.200]
Oh, then I just dropped it on the damn floor

[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.480]
Thanks a lot

[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.660]
Okay, this is beautiful

[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.640]
What a spread, huh?

[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.260]
Even air in summers never saw a spread like this

[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:51.500]
What?

[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.680]
What do you mean by that?

[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.680]
We used to do this all the time until you came to work here

[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.980]
And then we stopped because we figured that people have worked at INZ

[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.240]
And we don't deserve to eat for free

[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.080]
What do you mean by that?

[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.780]
You didn't work at INZ?

[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.640]
You were at INZ more than a short while sweetheart

[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.880]
Don't tell me you were when I left you left, yeah

[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.240]
That's what Ron and Ron said too

[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.300]
When Neil left say that we did too, that's what they said

[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.680]
It's an inside radio today

[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.440]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach, hello

[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.160]
Hi Neil

[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:20.800]
Yes sir

[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.620]
First time caller

[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.040]
Alright, home is Rochester, New York

[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.000]
I've been down in Florida for about three years now

[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.700]
One fact, one fact, the Rochester, one last time he went to Niktaho

[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.560]
I've never been to Niktaho's for a garbage plate

[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:34.920]
No?

[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:35.800]
Yes I have

[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.400]
Yeah, I'll go pick an herb

[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.120]
Yeah

[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.620]
And that's how it is

[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.240]
About Don and Bob, see this is the problem with Rochester is that those of us who are from there

[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.100]
Even though it's in a relatively nice city when the law locks around in the sun is shining two weeks out of the year

[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.280]
But we try to make something out of nothing

[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.080]
No, you know that I'm right

[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.340]
Because it's a weather is horrendous

[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.520]
It's a very pleasant city if it had nice weather but it doesn't

[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.160]
And other than some very very good restaurants, which is all I ever talk about is Don and Bob's and C Breeze

[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:03.700]
And that's it

[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.960]
Rochester is basically nothingness

[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.200]
And most of the people who live there, even though they're very nice

[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:12.520]
There's some Italians, there's some Jews, there's some Black people

[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.940]
But generally they're farmers

[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:15.460]
It's pretty sad when you're right

[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.240]
Yes, it's a bunch of farmers

[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.500]
Pretty sad when you got to talk about a garbage plate is

[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:19.780]
Right

[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.000]
That's the highlight

[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.780]
Yeah, when you say hey, do you ever have the garbage plate and you say that's the highlight of Rochester

[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:26.760]
Then it almost makes you feel like you're talking about Buffalo

[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.820]
I'm sure the rest of your listeners are fascinating

[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:32.240]
But just keep in mind that Rochester is like Manhattan compared to Buffalo

[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.580]
So that makes us feel a lot better

[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.260]
Listen, I got one question

[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.880]
I live in Orlando so I can't pick you up very often just when I get down this way

[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.140]
Yeah

[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:43.440]
But you'll be able to hear Aaron Summers although you can hear already I guess

[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.980]
Oh, great, she's wonderful

[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.360]
What went on a couple of years ago with you and we?

[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.060]
What went on?

[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.260]
Yeah, was there like a...

[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.300]
Oh, he was doing that every year

[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.800]
Every time they would come down here he tried to do this contrived thing

[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.780]
And he would raise money to buy billboard

[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.180]
See, we raised money on this station to try to help charity

[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.120]
We don't raise money to put up stupid billboards to waste money

[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.980]
To try to piss somebody off in Buffalo

[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.880]
A bunch of nose pickers

[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.240]
Did he do it? They share or no?

[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.660]
I don't even remember

[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.040]
We just don't pay...

[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:10.820]
Yeah, the answer is yes

[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.020]
But we don't pay any attention to the billboard or to him

[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.140]
In fact, we did do some nice things on the billboard to the face it not we

[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.820]
But I mean some of the listeners who were very irate

[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.880]
And he's just a bandwagon jumper

[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.040]
He's not even from Buffalo, he's on here in Rochester

[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:23.580]
Yeah

[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.040]
And even the people there would call up

[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.300]
We'd get calls from people in Rochester saying don't believe anybody's a phony

[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.780]
He's just trying to exploit the situation

[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:34.080]
The first year he came down here he never even had the balls because we exposed him on the air

[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.160]
For being the phony that he is

[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.980]
And a lot of people start getting very irate and making idle and not so veiled threats to him

[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.980]
He didn't have the balls to leave the hotel room, he watched the game in his hotel

[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.220]
On television

[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:47.380]
He never got on your show and you never had a...

[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.880]
You know we had him on the air a couple of times

[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.400]
Yeah

[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.880]
Oh listen, that's a thank you

[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.420]
He's in the perfect market for him

[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.640]
Have a great day pal

[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:57.560]
So yeah, open line and a brow at 524 and a green line 18944

[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.260]
The only problem I got here, let's see I do, I got a spoon

[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:03.060]
I got too much, we got to get the news on for about 25 minutes

[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.960]
So I can finish eating all of this

[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.300]
Come on Adam dig in man
