[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.400]
Ebola.

[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400]

[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.020]
Oh, life

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.760]
I know the fun is over inside here

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.160]
Gonna bring it to America if I wish

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.780]

Gonna move the joy at till I underground

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.360]
Well, I'm not the most intellectual guy

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280]
But I know one thing

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.600]
Up on my guitar you get it

[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.920]
Bola that's fucking bitch

[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.760]
Bola bola bola bola bola

[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.140]
Bola bola bola bola

[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.340]
Bola bola

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.280]
Okay, happy Labor Day here we go

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.800]
It's gonna be a tremendous four hours

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.000]
It's gonna zip by like stuff through a mitt and I guarantee you that right now all this fear over a goddamn dead pussy cat

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.220]
What the hell is wrong with these people around here?

[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.500]
Power for the course is this the same company where we had more crap in the vents here for like 30 years

[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080]
We had stuff that was growing in there which even on at alien autopsy thing they never found stuff like that

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.900]
Just every kind of mong and mold and mildew and garbage in the vents people sick choking and puking

[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.220]
And until we threatened to get OSHA involved in this the occupational safety hazard administration until we threatened to get them

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.960]
Down on the ass of Cox broadcasting they couldn't give a crap less because it wasn't financially expedited at this time to worry about the health of our employees

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.980]
But Rick and suds put a dead cat a dead pussy in the freezer

[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.700]
And right away we got people running around here in tears

[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.600]
We got one of them I don't want to mention Cirrus name on the air that fucking bitch

[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.580]
But she's in tears she's having a nervous breakdown because there's a dead ends in Jennifer ram who I hear I mean Jennifer

[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.860]
Talk about somebody that I thought was really and maybe it's just you know here's the same person who says

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.140]
Gordon gives South Florida a major blowjob

[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.660]
How do you like that and she's worried about a dead cat in the freezer?

[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.940]
This is the same Jennifer who says can beat that gator meat boy

[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.860]
So there a little bit out of sorts around here, but that's the way it goes. Okay. I mean just uh no sense of humor

[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.300]
Everybody very uptight

[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.500]
So the dolphins played a girl school yesterday of girls team and they came out on top big time 52 to 14

[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.740]
What's everybody talking about today a punch over to the sports station?

[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.180]
You know the two or three people who were calling which ends about it

[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.140]
They're talking about their hurricanes getting a crap beat out of mid UCLA

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.120]
What a shame, huh? In fact a couple are really tough breaks over the weekend. No, they're damn

[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.900]
Oh, yes

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.700]
Oh my god. I saw the end of that game the last a few minutes of that game

[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.400]
And of course you just had that feeling that touchdown

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.220]
Jesus was just about to pull the other one out of his ass and he dropped it something happened and he forgot about it

[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.680]
And the clock just ran out and Lou Holtz was standing there with a sour push on the sidelines

[00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.040]
Man, I'm not sure which was better the hurricanes getting their ass whipped at UCLA or Notre Dame getting beat by a girl school north Western

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.860]
Oh, man, let's take a vote on that okay, and boy you talk about ugly

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.700]
You talk about ugly. Can you imagine what's gonna happen with the hurricanes travel up to a tallahassee in a couple of weeks and what FSU is gonna do to Miami?

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.460]
I wonder how Luther Campbell feels now that he's blackmailed this team and a put in that kid there in quarterback who can't even play on a

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.200]
I guarantee a Shannon thought they couldn't do the better job with her hands tied behind her back

[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.340]
even with that ugly pusher hers

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.960]
So anyway 751 W.I.O.D. and Dave. I'm sure we're gonna get a lot of calls all the dolphin fans jumping right on that bandwagon today

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.700]
We're really the best look at that 52 points against the worst team in the league

[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.780]
That's right. That was a good confidence builder

[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.740]
It's called building up a false sense of confidence getting ready for the big fall as in next week

[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.540]
The patriots of course coming from behind in dramatic style 19. Yeah seconds left in a game

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.300]
blood so 30 out of 47

[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.440]
306 yards

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.880]
What's really gonna get people warned is that all of a sudden they got a running back all of a sudden they got a running back

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.840]
The patriots have got a running game. Okay

[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.760]
102 yards for this kid the Curtis Martin is in his name. I don't even know what that was name is

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.880]
102 yards. I told you baby

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.080]
102 yards for the rookie Curtis Martin on the ground

[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.540]
And they played a real team. That's the only difference. But hey, we'll find out

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.780]
Think of us as mutant jeans looking for a new target organ every day

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320]
But you know, I'm fabulous with fabulous tips for life

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.360]
You know, the size of a man's genitals is not important

[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.540]
Unless you're going to have sex with him

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.880]
That is my tip for love and I am Fabio

[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.940]

Hey, I was watching the game yesterday and which game is that? The dolphin game. Yes

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.220]
You haven't catch what Marv Albert said about Irving prior. Didn't see it. I wasn't there. I was out of town this weekend

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.100]
Oh, well, he said the Irving prior. He came in or Jane minister during the office season

[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.180]
And he said that he had performed a warning ceremony on keep fires

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920]
With the way he said it was that he married keep fires. Yeah, and the two of Mario Loping with Louis Oliver

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.000]
Yeah, it's amazing in it

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.620]
Incredible only on a dolphins man

[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.660]
It all says everything about the dolphins and ministry everything

[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.520]
Yeah, okay, thanks for the good news

[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.160]
So friar tuck is that his new name now or what

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.100]
Two open lines in date 751 WIOD that purple line of courses wide open cellular one pound IOD

[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:52.280]
Miami dolphin linebacker Chris singleton will be the sports talk six ten guests tonight tonight sports talk six ten at flanagons in North Miami on

[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.520]
North East under 25th Street just west of which the with with the dexie highway go on over there and see a D-fo and manage

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.420]
It's one of the rare opportunities to hear D-fo live on the station

[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.620]
Here's a lady in the cables. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am happy Labor Day in back to you

[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.020]
You have a sense of humor, right? Yeah, how would you like it if one of those guys that bring you lunch would

[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.400]
Bring you a dead cat

[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:24.940]
Do you think that would be funny? I feel sorry for Phil. He is a genius. What do you mean you feel sorry for Phil? In other words you really think Phil is upset about that?

[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.720]
I am I mean when he know he but he's not upset so in other words

[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.040]
You're buying into something that Phil is telling you want to hear again. How long do you have to listen before you want to stand?

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.800]
He had to send you a telegram personal to your house. I've listened to you. He's not upset about a frozen cat

[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.120]
He got a frozen cat with a birthday cake. That is bad. Why is that?

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.280]
That's just not nice. You wouldn't like it with you

[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.520]
We thought they could come up with you but would you like if somebody laid a dead cat beside it? No

[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.140]
How do you know they laid it beside it? Because he said it was beside the cake and they had to throw the cake away

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.200]
Maybe he was beside himself. Maybe somebody ought to buy him a birthday cake and really celebrate

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.200]
Yeah, why don't you come on over this afternoon and make a little whoopie with him. It sounds like you're

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.260]
You don't know how you don't know how I would like to I tried to

[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.940]
I want a kid. I think he said

[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.420]
Phil Henry is a kid. Oh, I just celebrated 63rd birthday. I don't care. It could be a hundred

[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.620]
Have you ever seen Mark Barking Croft on our sports craft? That's not fair

[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.480]
It's not

[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.820]
You tell him that yeah, but let me say something for let me say something. Yeah, I know

[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.780]
I'll do that. Yeah, I've I asked him to bring me an A's tray for Minneapolis. He'll know who I am. Yeah

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.480]
But he doesn't really know that kind of monkey around with some old bag like you. Are you crazy? Oh

[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.140]
Yeah, you sound old. How old do you think I am? I'm just nervous. I'm never

[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.760]
How do you like to be about 57?

[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.120]
57. I wish. Yeah, you wish. Yeah, 67

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.800]
Right on the bus. 70. You're 67. Yes, I am. Yeah, I told you you're an old bag. I told you I was too old for anything else

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.440]
I want to adopt him and nothing's happening that's fucking bitch

[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.340]
Really, I'm not no bitch either. I just love Phil and you do too

[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.640]
And you know that hurt me when he had a birthday cake with a dead cap aside

[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.500]
Well, why don't you come around and over we'll give you a title

[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.860]
We'll give you a desk. We'll give you your own orifice you can be in management

[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.020]
Make him a cake if he'd come and get it. I'd bake him one

[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.460]
Okay, if I knew you were coming at a baked you a dead pussy

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.760]
Okay, honey have a nice day

[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.120]
Okay, warm up that pocket rocket sweetheart. We have all the day lines wide open 751

[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.280]
What did I tell you this is what they're excited about a goddamn frozen dead cat

[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.680]
It was a cat that just died it died

[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.420]
And died it died probably was too fat. Can we see a fat cat?

[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.340]
It was a fat cat and it died and that's it. That's the end of the story, okay

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.540]
And they brought it over here in a

[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.180]
Shmata and they stuck it in the freezer to hang on do to give Phil I mean

[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.180]
It's more than most of us get

[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.200]
On my 400th anniversary on year and Miami. I get a card from my mother

[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.340]
I get one card. It's from my mother

[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.460]
They don't care enough to send their very best or even are very worse. They don't care to send you anything

[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:22.040]
I remember when Phil Henrietta's one year anniversary on year in his town and he comes on he had he had a card

[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.220]
It wasn't even from his mother

[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.240]
It was like from some probably from this bitch out there that you don't want nothing to do with this desperate

[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.260]
Desperado

[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.480]
Desperatus and how come nobody's talking about that great freedom flotilla get on the weekend

[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.960]
I don't get it. This is the big news story here people talking about a bunch of silly football game

[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.560]
man

[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.380]
One of these people ever gonna learn if they're not out in the Everglades shooting themselves in the foot

[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.420]
If they're not out there under thing getting their toe chopped off they seem to have a foot fetish

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.500]
Maybe that's what it is. It's always some foot problem

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.860]
And in this time there was one guy who drowned he died

[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.660]
He died he died

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.860]
And there was like no life rafts on his little under there's a bad handful of these so-called exiles and they keep running out there

[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:13.580]
Did you see them trying to scramble up back on top of the boat with the their pants falling and their big fat the ass hanging out there

[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.680]
That was that was really classy man

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.080]
When you people gonna understand you're making fools out of yourselves. You're making monkeys out of yourselves

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.040]
How about our frozen monkey in the freezer next time

[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:09.900]
How

[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.520]
That good in the wind up the straw man snorts the lineup. He's drooling like a dog who heard a bell

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.760]
All right, he's high as a lab rat from smoking the crack at a bat

[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.840]
He doesn't like cocaine just likes the way it smells

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.180]
snort and a ball

[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:43.680]
Starrels rolling up the 20s, North and A ball and he's given good and planning they lick the 20 dollar bill

[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.940]
Their teeth are grinding like a peppermills

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.580]
doing a balls

[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.580]
Out the hole in pills

[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.860]
Steve how is in the bullpen his nostrils are wide open

[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.600]
He's so

[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.340]
Okay, he gets advice from doc and doc prescribed some rock

[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:23.280]
So first he blew a line and then he blew to save snort and A ball say abused a magic powder snort and A ball sprinkle it on their clam chowder

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.860]
Prescriptions got the pet you will refill

[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.600]
They do it in the pool if they had gills

[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.040]
Going

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.920]
Out the hole in pills

[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.500]
All that money

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.780]
Where I'll explode

[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.220]
I like to welcome you all aboard as your manager

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.400]
Okay, 10 28 that's what they all are high that's what the Yankees are winning every day

[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.460]
How about those angels by the way in a row and counting hey you don't care about sports

[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.240]
It's just one of those things that it's a good diversion three open lines in date of course that's all of them

[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.540]
7519 463 and a purple cellular one line which we had a very important traffic report from four-letter

[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.920]
On a purple line so important they didn't hang on even though we're paying for it on the

[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.560]
AT&T wireless line, whatever it is for a lottery. Hello. Hi. How you doing? Okay? Happy Labor Day and back to you great football weekend

[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.860]
Was it love seeing Notre Dame lose oh man?

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:31.320]
Was one of the great moments of my life to a girl school no less to North Western which never wins oh and they beat up on them every year

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.060]
And the tide has been turned yes

[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:39.660]
Loved it and it was great because I'm a seminal fan and we kicked major ass. Oh wait 70 to 26 over Duke

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.800]
I would say that they're gonna score over 100 points against you M. Oh, oh and the only thing better than seeing you

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.860]
M lose was getting the boo their band out yesterday at the dolphins game

[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.180]
Their band was there their band was there and they played when a man loved the woman

[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.100]
Yeah, and I thought that was major tacky when a man loves a woman at a football game

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.060]
Maybe Wayne had something to do with this was Perthy Thlegs there or what oh

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.240]
What what is that mean? I mean, I don't know

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.020]
Maybe it was better than all those stupid marches those teams always those bands always playing. Oh

[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.400]
I think

[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.860]
Bob

[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:20.940]
From the floor from that pop pop you know what I'm talking about pop pop pop pop. Oh, I hate I hate college marching bands man

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.340]
They make me sick. I mean, maybe they'd be alright if they place something different like maybe when a man loved a woman

[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.080]
Oh, I know it you see L.A. Band was playing iron man by Ozzy Osborne

[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.120]
Really yeah, well, that's that's L.A. You know, they're all stone out of their minds. Oh, I know

[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.420]
They probably didn't know not not in Miami. Oh, no, no, no the reason that everybody's in mind the only people in Miami

[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.180]
Stone are the you and football team because they got all the drugs wrapped up

[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.960]
They got the good connections with Luther

[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.720]
And

[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.680]
Days of our lives is gonna be hot today. Is he gonna be on today? Austin's gonna be on there and his real name is Austin too

[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.100]
It is yep, and he replaces the old Austin. He's on Melrose and you boy

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.140]
I would like to spend the Labor Day holiday weekend in Austin. It wouldn't be much of a labor

[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.500]
It would be easy God almighty am I right or what he's great? How long has he been on that show?

[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.160]
Just a few months actually

[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.580]
They always have the best guys on that show and actually days of our lives has more sex and violence than any other soap on TV

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.040]
All right

[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.800]
Great now we're talking. I've been watching it for 10 years next month. Let's give the people what they want. Oh, we want it

[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:29.260]
We want it bad. Okay. Well, you have a great day. I'll be watching you just made my day. All right. Thanks. Take care. Bye-bye

[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.260]
So we have two open lines of date

[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.040]
It's gonna be a real battle here today. How is that when you folks are trying to tell me that's what Rick said

[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.440]
He said it was brutal, but what makes that different money?

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.680]
Stana Halala Hazel from any other day. He asked

[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.840]
751 W I O D. I can't imagine why we don't have all those doll fans on here jumping on the bandwagon

[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.040]
Hey, we kicked some ass. Yeah, but you'll play the girls team. Okay. I mean, that's a great start 52 to 14

[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.020]
They were just the sharpest attack. They were running up and down at field. They were like Danny Boy was going nuts

[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.620]
And I did the get back in time here the end of the game on radio that's him for man

[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.960]
He's got the personality of a dead man. You know what man

[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.260]
He is and what happened to mandates did they tone him down or something?

[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.000]
He really did he sounded like Mercedes-Makame bridge. It was like a throttled

[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.600]
Right

[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.700]
Well, what is that? I don't get it. I think they've you know, we don't want them get carried away

[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.580]
Don't get too excited and then the rumors were which I wasn't here

[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.300]
I was out of town over the weekend didn't happen to hear the UM game on I and Z

[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.040]
And also they're carrying it on a light bulb is that true?

[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.340]
They're carrying on a light bulb so that they can because they have no brown or signal tonight

[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.540]
Well, whatever the deal was and from what I understand rumors about sunny having little technical problems out there

[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.220]
Poor sunny nice guy, but boys. He got a route that he got involved with them

[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.300]
He thinks that this place is screwed up which it is

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.240]
But boy wait till he finds out what buddy but Paxons all about and I sure hope he catches that

[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.460]
He gets the check up front get the money out front when you work for buddy Paxon just ask suds and me. We'll tell you

[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.460]
Here's plantation. Hello the morning Neil. How you doing today? Okay, sir?

[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:07.120]
Happy Labor Day and back to you so the rules and fraction committee said the two million dollars that Dan Marino made

[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.940]
There was nothing wrong. It wasn't illegal. It was okay. No, that isn't what they said. That's not what they said

[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.440]
What did they say they said that's from the standpoint of the NFL right that he didn't violate any league policy

[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.980]
That doesn't make it legal in the culture

[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:27.120]
He didn't I'm sorry. He didn't violate any league policy. Right. That's right isn't down Shula part of the rules and fraction

[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.160]
Committee and all that stuff. Yeah. Okay. They probably just changed the rule over the weekend. I love your questions. Yeah

[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.420]
That's all I wanted to know. Okay, pal. Thank you, sir. See ya

[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.720]
Yeah, he's absolved of any wrongdoing. I mean insider trading. I mean outside of the NFL

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.200]
It's illegal but inside the NFL get whatever you can. That's what it's all about. That's the message

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.160]
751 W.I.O.D

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.700]
We have two open lines in date to enbroward 524 one on a purple line

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.300]
What are you expecting people to be called today? It's Labor Day. It's beautiful. It's gonna be 90 degrees

[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.520]
The sun is shining. They're out in their boats. They're out there puffing away. Whatever they're doing

[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.480]
So leave these poor bastards alone. Okay. They got nothing to say of course

[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.760]
If I was to play that goddamn stupid dolphin fight song then they would get all worked up to a frenzy, huh?

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.680]
Here we go

[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.420]
Let's hop back on that badwagon for the big win

[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.540]
Miami has the dolphins the greatest football team

[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.900]
Oh, we take the ball from Golden Gold like no one's ever seen. All right. I can't stand it

[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.240]
So let's continue. Let's just fumble our way along before you know it will be time for lunch

[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:32.120]
Is there anybody open today on Labor Day? I would imagine this is the kind of day there are different kinds of holidays

[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.420]
There are those holidays that are like

[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.400]
When everybody gets let out for you know like Christmas day that either have religious significance or you feel guilty

[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.120]
You need to let everybody go home and to do their thing with their family and then there are other holidays that are have over the last several years

[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.060]
Become like real bonanzas for businesses where they have their big Labor Day sales

[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.860]
So aren't like a lot of places open today or am I wrong?

[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.860]
Huh are the shopping malls close today or what?

[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.500]
They're open right we wrote them all yesterday and one lady was telling another old lady who was asking that they were gonna

[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.860]
Be open it from 8 a.m. To like nine. Oh, sure

[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.240]
I mean there I mean there's a lot of people out there that got time to spend their money today go out and spend the money help the

[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.140]
God damn economy okay send a little over here in a brown paper sack and some money to

[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.120]
Here's Palm Beach hello, Neil. Yes, sir happy Labor Day to you and back to you at the game yesterday

[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.980]
They keep trying to do the wave all the time Neil. They're waving aggravating. Yeah, I hate the wave. I mean it's disgraceful

[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.000]
jeez these fans

[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.660]
But the greatest weekend in football I couldn't know which was better Notre Dame or Miami getting

[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:40.120]
That's a tough call. It's a really tough call. I mean to see two of these anxious sports teams two of these grotesque

[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.360]
Whatever the hell you want to call them both get dumped in a tank

[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.400]
I think Miami getting me 31 to 8 though. That was special. Yeah, but 31 to 8

[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.060]
You hate both themes, but you know you got to hate Lou Holtz

[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:57.380]
But you're forgetting you're forgetting something else what guess who else got his ass handed to a mono platter yesterday in Seattle

[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.720]
Oh, yeah, that was great. He was Dennis. Dennis give me a drink here. I said hey

[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.080]
Oh my god, how do you like that huh? You think you had a couple of drinks after I wouldn't be surprised

[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.900]
He's probably he's probably down on a few right now

[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.400]
And then the top of the night off was Mark Barkingcroft on sports rap huh? You see that boy that was great

[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.740]
How about Amy? I didn't get to listen last week

[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:24.760]
But the greatest call in Philhundry history was a week ago Friday when the guy called in looking for Manditch and they were talking about Bob greasy

[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.680]
Yeah, yeah, yes, I did great is calling the history of Philhundry

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.240]
It the grace call in the history of the human right in the history of phones. They were I mean you were saying you got to get the slacks and the sport jacket

[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.280]
Yeah, we're gonna have the charity function for the you know something if Rick and suds

[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.360]
What have been thinking they could have saved the dead cat for a greasy exactly

[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.960]
Probably would have made a nice holiday meal have a great life

[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.260]
Okay, two open lines on the blue lines five two four nine four six three and Broward five two four

[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:55.040]
W I O D yeah, this will tie this over for about another four weeks this football stuff and then of course hockey will start

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.860]
We'll get into a real sport with real men and real excitement and you know, we won't have to worry too much about this stuff

[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.460]
And some of those shows. Oh my god, you know

[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.040]
I used to really like Chris Burman on ESPN. He was a very funny guy

[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.600]
But you know something when you take something that's good in small doses

[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.500]
And you try to like make it into a big deal. You try to spread it out

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.820]
It's just uh don't make it and they're trying so hard on that ESPN show to be funny

[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.940]
They're not

[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:26.980]
It's the same with ESPN radio where they're all sitting around with a feather up the race laughing and puking and carrying on about

[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.000]
Stuff that isn't even remotely amusing much less, uh, you know fall down laughing funny

[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:38.740]
And they got the sterling sharp on here now who's you know he uh can speak but that's basically he's got nothing to say

[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.600]
And they're throwing a ball back and forth and it's like uh, you know

[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.060]
They're trying to outdo Fox now everybody's trying to outdo Fox and Fox of course put themselves in a leak of their own

[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.980]
With that stupid the preseason show that followed the alien autopsy the other night

[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.140]
juvenile

[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.240]
Pathetic the one with the madden and the summer all the little kids on there tragic

[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.960]
I nothing to do with football then they bring out Terry god damn Bradshaw

[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.000]
Who doesn't have to try to be a jackass because he already is one

[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.620]
How about those how about those teams that just squeaked by yesterday boy like Atlanta and over time no less to be the girls team

[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.680]
And the Steelers just barely squeaking by and the Lions getting beat

[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:20.940]
I'll tell you one thing yesterday of now Benny blades his team lost the Lions and Brian blades out there in Seattle

[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.600]
Oh

[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.740]
I guess he's not jumping high enough and running fast enough

[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.400]
Here's Miami hello

[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.160]
Neil yes sir how happy later ready and back to you um listen

[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.540]
Yesterday was so interesting to watch uh

[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.620]
New Orleans almost kill

[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.980]
San Francisco no they didn't well they almost did no they didn't they were

[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.020]
Dominating that gave it a shot that's always a tough game especially in the

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.580]
Orleans always compared to the champions they always played the 49ers tough always

[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.300]
Well also um in addition to which you notice when the guy recovered that fumble for the 49ers at the end of the game

[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.940]
Yeah, any kind of like drop the ball they were yelling at them from behind don't screw up the point spread okay

[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.460]
See the point spread on again the only one by two so they do the spread yeah

[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.620]
And also ricky waters is uh fellow Delta Eagles didn't come by yesterday either yeah, they were nice um

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.520]
But I got to tell you man. I mean rich co-tites speaking of the Eagles

[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.440]
He screwed up that team entirely and now he goes to the jets and now if they win two games this year

[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.440]
I think they'll be lucky they were absolutely fun. They are abysmal

[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.880]
But let me tell you something it was important for us to pay such a girl school yesterday

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.360]
I mean I'm a hardcore dolphin fan and I think it was something that we needed to do just to gel

[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.560]
I mean it you know

[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.820]
Damarino again the point everybody in to believe in that this is the year get everybody talking to big talk right no

[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.700]
I'm gonna say it's gonna be the year but I'm so happy

[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.260]
We've got weapons and I think if we just gel that's you know that's key

[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.060]
I mean our defense is about to come together. Yeah, I'm glad you know that

[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.440]
Carcson there again. I mean that was pretty scary last week

[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.080]
But uh, I don't know I was pretty happy with everything that turned out. I mean the score was you know was pretty

[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.140]
Pretty cool, I guess yeah

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.640]
I'm out of material deal. Okay, good luck to pal

[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.240]
You know so they sound like they're trying to talk themselves into it. Well, okay. It was a good start though

[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.300]
You know a win is a win if you're playing a guy if you're playing vassier a win is a win

[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.000]

[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.520]
Uncle me. Why are you working on labor day? What do you mean because these are a bunch of inseparable bastards?

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.040]
And this is ridiculous. There are any addition to which I'm going on vacation later in the weekend would look bad not to be here

[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.720]
You know what I'm saying? Well, that is true. Did you see you went away this weekend? Yes? How would you go to Toronto

[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.720]
Toronto yes, okay, good. Hey, why are you writing a book? No, but you make you win on vacation

[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.820]
I did not go on vacation. I went away for one day. Well, hey for one day

[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.380]
Look, I went away this week and I went to Tampa, Sarasota

[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.700]
Getting out of here every weekend every every possible moment to me is the greatest thing in the world

[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:13.920]
I hear you learning I look forward to two weeks from tomorrow. I'm on my waiting New Zealand for five weeks great

[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.720]
I'm the guy that called you for a few months ago

[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.320]
I'm gonna get a few of my friends that are also nearly that a witness we're gonna report back into here

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.520]
There's a casino at the hotel. We're staying at but I've got a lot more to do in New Zealand than go to a casino

[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.660]
I was curious if anybody got stuck in the traffic problem down in

[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:34.080]
Uh dolphin land yesterday because I was out of town and I've written the paper that it was pretty much of a mess

[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.980]
They had a traffic problem and a parking problem

[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.600]
I'm on the concept the park really the parking problem obviously people were going by empty lots

[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.100]
And then they got to the stadium people had parking passes and they got to the uh stadium

[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.100]
We're told to turn around and go back past call during everything

[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.600]
So I don't know

[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.820]
Common sense strikes again sure makes me feel a lot better. Well have a great time pal. Okay, bye-bye

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.360]
Okay, open lines all over the place day at seven five one, but we got even a bad line ringing hello

[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.040]
Who the hell who keeps calling on a bad line

[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.860]
Who was that?

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.120]
Defoe was the one that kept calling before but I don't know who that was what tell us he won

[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:18.700]
Earlier it was uh why is there really such a person there isn't his life on tape and if he doesn't stop typing out those goddamn monologues

[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.260]

Have a little bit of a problem on the way just a little bit of a goddamn problem and man overboard. Okay. What am I gonna tell you?

[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:23.200]
Nobody cares about these things laughing stock of the world right here. You're looking at it. You're in it. You're smelling it right here

[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:32.860]

You have eaten in brigands many years ago many many times what ice cream. Yeah, that's unbelievable

And uh somebody told me that they have it an extra down here. They have what?

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.580]
Briggum's ice cream never heard of that

[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.060]
I don't know that's what they said. I don't think so. I think they're bogey. I think they're yanking now

[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.900]
You take so you did that or I would go over here and check it out

[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.760]
That's right. That's right. That's where I'm headed right now. Okay. Good luck to pal. Thanks a lot. Okay

[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.700]
There's a guy's going to extra right now. He's got something to do on his holiday

[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.880]
We're not gonna go out and play golf or tennis. We can do that almost any day of the year

[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.160]
We're gonna go to brigams and see if they have extra

[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:23.080]
Open line on the green line 18944. Here's a mobile in bokeh. Hello

[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.340]
Yes, sir. Okay

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.260]
Happy Labor Day. I am laboring as well. I'm on my way to it

[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.780]
Just one quick note. I want to touch on my stuff open today or what stores are open malls what?

[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.240]
Yeah, I'm an insurance salesman up at the West Palm Auto Mall. So I'm going up there to make some deals today. Okay

[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.880]
I just want to touch based on one quick thing and I know you're not or

[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.580]
I know you don't lead on to be a big fan of the mad dog man

[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.040]
That's and I take it. What do you mean by that? Well, I listen to you show quite regularly

[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.800]
I'm not either a man of his I just don't wait a minute don't say either when did you when did I ever say I wasn't the big fan of

[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.180]
Amanda see what you're trying to do is put words in my mouth so that we can agree now

[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.680]
Why do all colors want to twist the host around their point of view?

[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.780]
Why can't we just admit that I like manage and you hate them?

[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.140]
You like man. This and I hate them. Okay, sir enough. We agree on that much at least

[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.620]
When I just wanted to touch base with was that jackass

[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.820]
I'm a jack man and I know that's not many people have

[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.600]
Yeah, I think of that today, but I would take up something different if I were you because I got news for if you win one game this year

[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.260]
It'll be a miracle. It's a girls team. It's a joke. Yeah, you're very very right. I agree with that

[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.980]
I'll top of it. I'm a match fan. So you know what kind of seasons I'm in for I've been used to this for quite some time

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.220]
Yeah, but anyway, I just had an opportunity to have a work yesterday

[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.580]
So unfortunately I had to listen to the mad dog announcing the game yesterday. Yeah

[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.540]
I think I's pretty much of a kiss at to say the least. I mean he jumps to bandwagon

[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.420]
I will listen to the preseason games

[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.760]
When eight dolphins weren't playing very well and although they scored a lot of points yesterday

[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.220]
They had a couple of a couple of mistakes also, but they look pretty decent. Yeah, I'd win the jets right and so would anybody else

[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:04.080]
Exactly exactly, but I just like to say if you don't mind that like to call Jim man dog man that

[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.820]
Quite a flaming ass hole

[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:14.140]
See that man's a freak. Yeah, that's it. I just had to get it off my chest. Okay pal. Okay. We'll see what you get your date. Okay

[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:21.260]
610 W I O D still the central characters of Larry King's nightmares

[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.900]
I've just seen the most disgusting thing. I just I'm getting my set all warmed up

[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.040]
Okay to make sure it's on the right channel here because she talked about the days of our lives

[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.860]
I flip over to channel four they got the mda telephone on here now

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:40.680]
And I could be wrong, but I have a stinking sinking feeling and a pit of my heart that this is going to be on here all day long

[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.140]
And they're going to be preempting all the network programming

[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.880]
Unbelievable absolutely unacceptable channel four rots. I hope that they when they moved to channel six next Sunday

[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.240]
I hope their signal is down like about 10 watts

[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.160]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach is gone. Okay. Like I said they're gone. Here's Pemberg Pines. Hello

[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.920]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going buddy? Okay, pal. All right. I was a decent weekend

[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.700]
I went up the uh the citrus bowl. That's pretty nice

[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.360]
Yeah, I've never been there before you're been there. No, I have not pretty nice stadium. Yeah, you know for

[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.180]
You know what they use it for anyway. Yes. It's got them bleach your type seats. You know what I mean

[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.280]
Not too great on the back. Yeah kind of like the orange bowl where you sit on cement right

[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.740]
Yeah kind of like that exactly. Well, they have a separate hemorrhoid concession. Yeah

[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.440]
Yeah, um, yeah, one of my teams did good. We did some pound them

[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.060]
I went to that Florida state game and they came home for a nice ass beating by the dolphins

[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:39.980]
My ass is still killing me. Yeah, we'll see what happens. I know I don't think we're a ghost team now. We're just young

[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:47.340]
Boomer the jets are pathetic. Oh, well, she's where you are rich. Coat tide is going to drive that franchise into oblivion

[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.340]
That was not the coach. I wanted huh? That wasn't the coach. That's not the coach anybody wanted

[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.960]
I don't know what makes them think if he if he doesn't succeed somewhere

[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.620]
What makes them think I wouldn't be surprised next season they moved to Trenton

[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.480]
I'm telling you don't be too surprised. That's where they belong this team. Well, how about Balexie

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.120]
There you go. I think that it may even work out better. Okay, pal. Hey, Neil

[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:15.120]
Yeah, do me a quick favor. Yeah. Okay. Um, I want to hear yeah

[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.300]
The cats in the cattle

[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:27.320]
Cats in the cattle that's an I know I know what it is. Okay, take a bye. Bye. Okay. It's an error ain't it? It's uh, not at the end

[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.800]
It's what it might be in there, but it

[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.400]
Inward in there. No, we never put it in there. Why don't we put a piece of crap like that in here

[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.540]
We do have this though

[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.600]
I'm not playing this, but it's just you know, I'll play this thing. Okay, but this is kind of cute

[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.780]
And it fits in when they're frozen pussy in the freezer too is a matter of fact

[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.520]
Wouldn't you know some old bag 60 70-year-old bag. She's got the hots for a feel Henry and she's all upset

[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.280]
Then he had a throwaway is birthday cake because there was a frozen cat alongside of it

[00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.910]
Oh

[00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:08.010]
So yesterday they're a huck in a china well all weekend long about the opening of the rock and roll hall of fame in Cleveland

[00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.050]
So in yesterday, I was gonna bring it in, but I was so angry I threw it out

[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.390]
Because otherwise I would have brought it in and I really would have gone nuts

[00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:22.310]
They had the list. Did you see that of all these people's favorite songs which was the best rock and roll song of all time

[00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:27.730]
And the consensus of the Sun Sentinel audience was stairway to heaven

[00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.550]
What that always wins anytime to take a survey like that

[00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:39.370]
Why these right honor always has that's not even in the running. It's not even it's not even in the running

[00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.330]
And so they asked

[00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:49.050]
DJs like Ricky Tiki Rick Shaw and some of these other in sunny fox and and they took this pull and guess who else they asked

[00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.810]
Aaron Summers now what the hell is she got to do with music? What music is she playing on that show?

[00:36:53.810 --> 00:37:00.330]
But they've got this incestuous relationship probably that uh die cove at the Sun Sentinel is the one that wrote that the piece

[00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.530]
And maybe that's what she's looking for is a piece, but anyway

[00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:10.610]
And whatever it was that Aaron came up with maybe somebody still got yesterday's ragly and around somewhere and the paper too

[00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:16.150]
But it was some non-descript bizarre marginal like most of the songs that they were naming

[00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:17.550]
Marginal crap

[00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:26.350]
Like L. Chio the hitman a while and a hundred he came up with some other pre-like I think the 1910 fruit gum company something really weak

[00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:34.170]
I mean when you're talking about the best rock and roll song of all time now Johnny dork he came up with satisfaction

[00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.230]
Which uh, you know, I don't think so

[00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.370]
But for Johnny that was pretty good

[00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:44.910]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach hello. Hey Nail. Yes, sir. Yeah, I love your program. Yeah

[00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:51.530]
I just got one. What's not like? I've got I've got one comment. Yeah, let me offend. That's what's not the like okay

[00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:57.470]
You can see watching a ballgame or something now and then but man some of these guys need to get alive

[00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:01.130]
I think they know more about some of these football players crib and they know about them

[00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:07.990]
That is their lives don't you understand it? That's why they're so obsessed with Dion neon Dion primetime maybe because they're in the joc

[00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.190]
world

[00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.190]
This is a scape for a man. That's what's all about. That's where it's at

[00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.670]
That's what's wrong with America. They're all bunch of spectators. They're all bunch of sheep

[00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.750]
Just watching other people

[00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.430]
That's right. Go out there and find a life. Go out there and do something get off your ass

[00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.890]
That's right

[00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.190]
Right

[00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.610]
Amen

[00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.250]
I got on a plane. I got there a lot of here this weekend

[00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.090]
That's what I did. I didn't just sit around watching a bunch of stupid ball games

[00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.830]
Yeah, but it's the same anyway, right? By the way, you see Buffalo loosed it in for last time

[00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:40.350]
Okay pal have a great life. Yeah, have a great holiday. There's a guy's got a life

[00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.130]
He's out there doing stuff. Maybe he's doing people

[00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.170]
But anyway last night. Oh my god that what how am I forgetting?

[00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:51.170]
Notre Dame gets killed the Patriots pulling out with 19 seconds left

[00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.130]
They win the hurricanes they get their ass handed to him out of god their plate

[00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:01.730]
It was unbelievable and Buffalo blows and soda the bill

[00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.210]
Man

[00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:08.930]
Notre Dame the hurricanes and the Buffalo bills all in the same weekend

[00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.930]
I brought you a Brad Bougare Belmotti is foaming at the mouth about that

[00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.630]
I'm telling you Denver. I mean Denver is uh, you know, Elway look pretty good last time

[00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.350]
I got to confess that he looked pretty good for an old guy who's long in the tooth

[00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.550]
He's got teeth that haven't been invented yet

[00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:29.470]
But uh, we're gonna get this empty anything all day long now that she's got me all worked up about the young this uh

By the way understand Andy Calb was very upset about the afrozen can also little humorless Andy Calb

[00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.970]
Who if they start riots in overtown on the Phil Henry show god that was really a funny bit Phil

[00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:03.410]
But if we got a frozen cat in a freezer that wasn't funny at all pretty true

[00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.490]
That is true. Did you happen to see the pregame warm up on Fox yesterday where they did an interview with Jerry

[00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.790]
No, that was great and they asked him a bunch of stuff and he was very level headed

[00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:17.450]
He said he wanted to accomplish all these titles and he wasn't gonna be self Jerry rice is great

[00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:23.270]
He is and then at the end they asked mr. Brown to ask them one of their favorite question was about loyalty to teams

[00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.970]
Yeah, and he said he stayed with the 49ers for the rest of his career and all right

[00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.650]
There you go. I thought I rest my case

[00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.170]

[00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.470]
All of the dice

[00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.650]
She just loves to put for 69

[00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:32.910]
She picks up a woman taste so fine

[00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.370]
She's not ready. She's a die

[00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.330]
Oh

[00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.830]
The woman she just loves to live

[00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.810]
She would never ever touch your

[00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.830]
She's no lady she's a die

[00:49:58.770 --> 00:49:59.170]
Oh

[00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.690]
I try not to romance up but she just

[00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:06.270]
said

[00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:07.990]
Oh

[00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:14.130]
She said she'd rather strap on a deal door

[00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:17.350]
Oh

[00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:24.130]
She's my dream girl, but it just can't be

[00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.790]
Since I found that she is

[00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:32.270]
She's no lady she's a die

[00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.030]
I felt so sad when I finally have to leave

[00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:48.190]
But she will never love me

[00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.110]
Because I don't have a f***er

[00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:50.930]
I'm a die

[00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:57.150]
Oh

[00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:01.730]
Oh

[00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.970]
Oh

[00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.750]
1117 at W.I.O.D. What's in the name right remember they had the I like Ike bumper stickers

[00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.610]
You don't remember that but you certainly have heard about that you've seen people who got those things around right

[00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.850]
What if Nixon would have had the same thing I like dick probably would never got elected

[00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.330]
The last time here's Miami hello

[00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:25.750]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing pretty good? I don't think you're doing pretty good working on Labor Day

[00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.050]
I'm doing great. Yeah, that's because I'm going on vacation in a couple of days for

[00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:30.490]
I'm doing really great

[00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:37.470]
No, it's starting lots sooner than that in a couple of days. Oh, so you're gonna be off next Monday. Yeah

[00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:41.030]
Oh no wonder no wonder what it's right after

[00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:43.510]
After the Patriots beat the crap out of the dolphins

[00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:50.490]
No, man look this week we scored 42 points next week. No, you scored you with no you scored 52 points right 52

[00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:51.250]
You said 42

[00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.850]
Yeah, now the temperature might be 102

[00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.370]
Your temperature might be a ridden to

[00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:01.050]
Huh, yeah, they have a good team. Yeah, they have a great team. You have a really good offense

[00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:06.810]
But you have no defense. Yeah, well, how come they have the Cleveland? How come they held the Browns to 14 points yesterday

[00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:11.470]
Nobody would what often see your browns have huh the browns are not the dolphins

[00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.070]
That's for damn sure

[00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:18.010]
And you know what and you know what the jets are not the Browns

[00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:24.490]
Why is it just faceted that we have a better team? Well guess what we're gonna make this superboard. Yes, what I guess we'll find out won't we?

[00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:29.230]
Yeah, I'm allowed talk. I've been here in this talk for since 1985 10 years now

[00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.070]
I've been here in the same trash talk every year

[00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.770]
Now, but deep down inside you know this year we have the team. Okay, good luck. Yeah

[00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.250]
It's obvious that you're going on vacation

[00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.410]
Yeah, it's obvious to avoid being here for the game right okay pal

[00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:44.670]
Yeah, you always look at the football schedule. You know how far in advance

[00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:50.450]
I got a drawer full of plane tickets man in my house for the next seven eight months and that's no lie, baby

[00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.250]
I plan way ahead

[00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:55.230]
And as a matter of fact if I would have thought about that

[00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:56.630]
I probably would want to be here to see it

[00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.290]
But guess what I'll be somewhere where you won't be able to see it

[00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:05.130]
It did a bad break because what would you rather do be on vacation someplace having a great time or see another goddamn football game

[00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.150]
That guy to call from Palm Beach before was absolutely right

[00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.990]
Life is more than a football game. Okay. I mean I I enjoy football

[00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.090]
I watch my share

[00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.810]
But life is more than just sitting on your ass watching a dumb football game. Okay, paly

[00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.210]
Life is like getting on a goddamn raft and nearly drowning

[00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.710]
That's what life's all about Julio get with a program

[00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:30.070]
Here's Miami hello hello Neil yes

[00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:38.810]
I got a fat Hankelberg spy report. Yeah on his 15 minutes of fame yesterday picking his nose on ESPN

[00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:43.010]
Yeah, with those those memorable picks. Yeah, they were real memorable

[00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.930]
All for three yesterday with a push

[00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.110]
With a push with a push. Yeah

[00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.750]
He's clueless. He is

[00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:58.350]
He's consistent though and he's the big talent on QAM. There you go. That's why they got a one share

[00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.750]
Open line and date 751. How come I'm choking on this lunch?

[00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.910]
It's by the way from our friend at Stan stage jelly and sunny is our new delivery boy

[00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.730]
Oh poor sunny sunny from the market

[00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.990]
Not to be confused how come we're not getting those spy reports on a sunny herch

[00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:18.290]
Because I understand i and z had some grotesque technical problems the other night

[00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:22.850]
And it wasn't bad enough for sunny had to take that shellacking there 31 to 8

[00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:27.670]
It wasn't bad enough that mark firm and referred to our team as the Huracunis

[00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.650]
That wasn't bad enough, but adding insult to injury was the fact that

[00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:36.790]
i and z has got the worst technical staff that they were clueless and it kept cutting out and you could hear every time

[00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:42.290]
They thought they were what's that god damn echo in my get that out. Oh, sorry. We're out of here. Okay. The case got them all first

[00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.990]
The test light our life it was grave

[00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:50.470]
So you know things are changing the old warm is turning man the old warm is turning

[00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:53.410]
It's not important that your team wins

[00:54:54.210 --> 00:55:02.470]
It's more important that the teams you detest lose like the buffalo bills like Notre Dame especially and like those hurrah canes

[00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:09.530]
610 W I O D learning to be humble, but not making much progress

[00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:13.570]
It happens every year around labor day. I don't want it to go

[00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.690]
I need it bad

[00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:21.830]
American say goodbye to summer and it can hurt because we don't realize the dependency we have on it

[00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.290]
I want my weedy come help me

[00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:32.450]
That's where we come in we're the labor days support line the place to call when summer separation is too much

[00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:37.690]
I can't face the cold. Oh you can you've got everything to live for

[00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.090]
No, there's nothing. There's Halloween

[00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:46.510]
But he's thanksgiving well and what about Christmas come on sing with me

[00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.230]
jingle bells jingle bells

[00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:58.070]
The labor day support line can help you too if you're afraid of losing your summer and becoming the cabin

[00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:04.130]
Slug you turn into every winner call 1-800 summers gone, but don't call now

[00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.870]
We're going away till next summer

[00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:14.650]
Oh poor baby 11 25 at W.I.D another one of these holidays. That's become meaningless except for a day off for a lot of people and nice

[00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:19.910]
Chance to go out get drunk have it you know two three dozen beers and that's what America's all about. What's wrong with that

[00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:26.050]
Having some nice sales in the malls everybody get a chance to go out shopping all day go out there kill some people in the water

[00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:31.850]
Oh, they had a thing was it on CBS? Where where do I see that this morning about these hovercraft?

[00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:37.590]
About these punk's these kids and they're like individual. Oh my god

[00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:43.290]
In fact, they even showed one of the things where it's a mammature film or some some asshole got wiped out

[00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:49.490]
And then there was this other poor guy they showed ago was down there snorkeling and he came up just as the guy came zooming by

[00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.670]
It was an ugly thing you didn't want to see it

[00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:56.510]
But hey, we don't want to have no restrictions on that on a personal pleasure craft

[00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:59.710]
I mean go out there and have a good time and kill a few people, okay?

[00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:03.010]
Because you never know some of them might be rafters. They're expected to get killed anyway

[00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:08.690]
Here's a Palm Beach Gardens. Hello. Hi Neil happy Labor Day and back to you. Whatever that means

[00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:17.370]
Exactly listen just to change the subject just a second. I belong to a an adult film video club

[00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:23.530]
And every month they send an interview with here one of the Starlets

[00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.950]
Yeah, and I think you would enjoy this

[00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:31.370]
Apparently after she's done filming a couple movies she goes out in dances, you know the strip point and

[00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:37.070]
The question was do you ever have bad experiencing dancing?

[00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:41.190]
And she says yeah, I didn't like dancing in Canada

[00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:46.330]
The managers of the clubs I went to weren't very nice and treated me less than a cow

[00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:51.150]
And it's not customary in Canada to tip the dancers. They don't tip

[00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:56.950]
How about that? I just wanted to just you know say that you're exactly correct

[00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:00.250]
Okay, paly. Okay, buddy. See you. Bye. Hey

[00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:05.810]
Open line of Broward 524 we have uh did I mention good morning to Omar? I didn't say that did I?

[00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.850]
Omar this kid who was a listener of ours and I'm on a plane yesterday coming back

[00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:14.910]
Yesterday afternoon and here uh these two guys getting on a plane and he says hey, I know you and I said yeah

[00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:20.590]
I said sit on my lap. He said okay. It was Omar. I signed his little thing there with the autographs and uh he was a good guy

[00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:25.010]
Just shave a little bit Omar. Okay next time shave a little bit and we'll go back you and me

[00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:30.230]
So anyway here's uh you're gonna be chronic. Go out there and protect somebody, will you? I'm off today

[00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:36.130]
Dave the cop Jesus. Yeah, you're always off the greatest rock song of all time low spark of high heel boys

[00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:37.390]
What do you think of that?

[00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:43.150]
Maybe you don't think of it. I think your taste sucks. Thank you. Did you watch the uh god?

[00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:44.710]
Did you watch the whole game last night?

[00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:49.470]
Watch game because it's something I want to pull out. No the dolphin game. No I wasn't I wasn't here. All right

[00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:54.970]
It's midway to the third quarter. You know how they have news bulletins that flash along the bottom of the screen. They're crawled

[00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.710]
Yeah, well this is just a taste of what's gonna come just to your wear it

[00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:03.470]
They start saying bulletins about Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands gonna get pounded by a massive hurricane

[00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:04.930]
etc etc. by Luis

[00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:09.950]
Now this is something Puerto Ricans pounded by Luis and it got a big smile on her face. Yeah

[00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:13.890]
Well, this is a case for what's gonna happen with our hometown news stations

[00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:17.870]
You know pumping up all the excitement in the middle of a football game

[00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:22.570]
Something that there's nothing to do with us with the state of Florida at all at the very least a week away

[00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:27.550]
And they're pounding, you know people in your party. Pupor Dave or spoiler fun man

[00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:32.350]
Yeah, but then it makes no sense because the people really were interested in knowing about the hurricane

[00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:35.770]
What are they gonna do? They're gonna turn off channel four now turn on to one of the other news

[00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.990]
They're gonna turn on the guy dim weather channel if they have a brain which I'm watching right now

[00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:43.390]
In fact, there's not a drop a rain inside. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's perfect

[00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:47.010]
Hey, the circle be up and that's not all it's the hurricane is right? Yeah

[00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:52.850]
All right, if Luis is up that means so a lot of the rest of us too. Well, thank you. Okay. How about hey, you does a great song

[00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.070]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[00:59:55.510 --> 01:00:00.130]
See, uh, hey, dude, it was a long song not a great song. It was just long

[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.290]
And it's the only record that faded out for like three and a half minutes

[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:08.430]
Fade it out for three and a half minutes most records, you know, they get to like the last 20-30 seconds

[01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.270]
They fade they know, that's it

[01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:17.890]
But not hey, dude, it just went on and on but it was a classic because it was the Beatles, baby

[01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:22.930]
That's why it was on Apple records which made the suits really like they didn't like the Beatles on capital that much

[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.150]
That was for punk kids that was bubble gum

[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:32.590]
But once they got their own label once they got on Apple records then everything they did was a work of art a work of genius

[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.530]
A lot of it was crap

[01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:34.990]
I

[01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:38.390]
Did like the white album. No, there was some pretty good stuff on there, you know

[01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:42.890]
But none of that will ever be nominated for best rock song of all time because uh, hey, what can I tell you?

[01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:47.430]
All that we can't play that rocky raccoon because we're playing too much of that uh, right?

[01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:49.310]
Ha too much of that rocky music

[01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:56.150]
Here's a debut. Hello Uncle Niel. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? I'm one of the guys that dropped off the bubble mice. He's Friday anyway

[01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:01.710]
Uh, he dropped off one the file. Oh, well, why are you calling a bubble mice?

[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:06.330]
Do you remember he wrote that on the file and spelled it wrong? Oh, yeah, did you see that on the inline?

[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:09.550]
Really? I haven't read it yet. Let me try it really quick about it

[01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:13.210]
Oh, you know something I went out this before I went away for the weekend right to the bookstore

[01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:21.290]
And I bought about a half a dozen UFO books rich one book stop. Yeah. Oh, you got a one up here at the plantation in the song right right right?

[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:28.310]
Anyway, uh, I had the distinct pleasure unfortunately of being at the game yesterday everybody's talking about how great it was

[01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.450]
Did anybody call you about the invocation in the beginning?

[01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:33.410]
No, you're not going to believe this

[01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:34.770]
They brought out

[01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:39.390]
Reverend whoever for the to the field and he gave like this

[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.110]
Blessing or something to the dolphins and that everybody would be okay

[01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:51.530]
And at the end of course everybody's just listening and telling me to and let the dolphins go to the Super Bowl and the freaking place went crazy

[01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:57.270]
You know, I was dying over there incredible anyway, Neil. I'll talk to you later. Okay, palie

[01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.910]
Yeah, now they're praying for the dolphins to go to the Super Bowl

[01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:04.710]
That's how desperate they are see when you show that you're desperate. That's a bad sign

[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:08.150]
It's one thing to be confident. It's another thing to be desperate

[01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:12.970]
Anybody out there know what it means to be desperate two open lines and date 751

[01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.810]
We have one on a purple line pound iod

[01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:19.170]
We'll be watching the young and a horny I guess come 12 30 because god damn channel four

[01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.530]
Scott that mda telephone. I hope they raise a lot of money. It's a good cause

[01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:26.910]
I don't want to sound like a communist but get the damn soaps on there for crying out loud

[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.870]
Every time it's a holiday and people are captive audience

[01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:35.950]
Uh, they put a bunch of crap on and they put telephones on to try to squeeze money out of your pocket. I don't like being squeezed

[01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:44.850]
Here's sunrise hello. Hello. Yes. I need you. Yes, sir. How are you? Okay? Good. So a friend barricola this weekend

[01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.790]
Yeah

[01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:52.070]
The convention they got a home show. Yeah, and I think it's very good idea to do the events

[01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:57.170]
Yeah, and also did you hear about your manage? What do you do pay to make him a little uh plug on here?

[01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:01.850]
Something no he did yeah, yeah, you did no he didn't how much you give him nothing 50

[01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.170]
No, a couple hundred no, it was welcome by so I'm there

[01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:11.830]
Because I had to get some camera stunt. I saw a manager. Yeah, he said of a doctor playing a girls team

[01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:17.310]
Did he yeah, it's what they said I'm not on his show last night about it o'clock. No, he didn't

[01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:22.030]
He said they were playing a girls team. Yeah, it should they weren't playing a team. Where were you to get that line?

[01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.850]
I have no idea. Yeah, honest to god. Okay. Thanks for the good news

[01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:31.530]
At least he's getting honest now that manage. All right. They're playing a girls team. That's right mad dog

[01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:32.830]
They were playing a little league

[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:36.490]
Not even a good girls team though worst of the worst all right

[01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:40.290]
I'm not trying to take away. I mean detract. They scored 52 points. They looked really sharp

[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.410]
They got their act together they played a hell of a game

[01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:47.870]
But again, they were playing against the worst team in the league though worst team in the league

[01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.050]
Worst and Houston

[01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.570]
Worst and Jacksonville Worst and Carolina

[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.970]
Worst and Atlanta

[01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:53.910]
Worst and

[01:03:54.350 --> 01:04:02.270]
Anybody the worst of the worst and how about Tampa Bay? Oh my god. What's all was that all about what they'll kind of drugs are those guys doing

[01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:09.170]
Two open lines at day 751 now that I see that the radar there's there's not a cloud. There's not even a pigeon dropping in the sky

[01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.070]
It's beautiful. It's perfect

[01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:16.790]
So come on. Let's go greatest rock song of all time. Let's take a pull today. All right

[01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:21.230]
Let's take a pull. I'll write them all down at the end of the show. We'll throw it in the waistband. I got you down

[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:25.010]
There you go. Let's pretend we're taking a pull like she does every night for four hours

[01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:30.290]
Wouldn't you think like a couple of hours of that crap would have been long enough four hours of saying penis and

[01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:34.370]
69 or whatever she I mean enough already with that show Jesus

[01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:42.470]
Here's Kendall. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. I surprise no one I talked about the fight yesterday in the stand. Oh really? Oh, it was wonderful

[01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:46.730]
Probably better than that Tyson five. I was up in the end zone in 400 sessions somewhere

[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:51.510]
And it was unbelievable to see the copper on back and for taking away jet fans

[01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:58.750]
It was wonderful. No, they went one after the other. So in other words, you're telling me the dolphin fans were all very a well-behaved

[01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:06.310]
What your tummy come on? Maybe someone I'll call later and tell there was some real fat redneck guy black jeans with no shirt bleeding in the entrance

[01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:13.530]
Dissection 402. Oh, I walked over and just half over before the game started and the police came and took them away

[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:16.490]
I didn't ever find out what happened to that man. And why he was laying there

[01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:21.590]
And a little third quarter was a big fight near the top. It's too dolphin guy to be up on this jet guy

[01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.810]
Yeah, pretty well knocked him into the

[01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:30.310]
The us their way great and the cops came up there and all the dolphin guys pointed to the jet to jet guys who didn't do anything

[01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:34.290]
They were just trying to leave early and they got ejected. Oh

[01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:38.410]
Beauty nice guy. I thought it was I'll tell you nothing next season when a jets come here

[01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.970]
There's one one thing to take care of those jets fans one way to do it shoot them in the lane exactly

[01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:47.530]
I got a bad ain't too bad. I got another place for you. Yeah, all right. Yeah, okay, pal

[01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:51.770]
Open line in date. How come we got that feedback? And I call what does going on here?

[01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:56.090]
Well, we wanted we asked for some feedback and we got some open line in date

[01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:59.330]
751 purple line set it a one you're in your car right now

[01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:04.770]
Okay, you're grasping you're groping you're reaching for it in a phone too the AT&T wireless line

[01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:08.470]
That's the worst name, but we do like them a lot, but the name blows

[01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:14.810]
Don't forget dolphin linebacker Chris singleton will be on with the default tonight in manage and sports talk

[01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:17.010]
They'll be over at flanagans in north Miami

[01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:22.350]
North East out of 25th just west of dixie highway and they'll be having a great time over there

[01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:26.870]
And say hey, there'll be a high five in and low five and and grabbing a little ass manage

[01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:30.810]
Well, you can be sure that probably defos and it'll be great then of course next Monday

[01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.850]
They may not be quite as happy. Yeah, but you're going out of town. You're going on vacation right

[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:36.890]
I planned it just so I wouldn't have to be here and hear the abuse

[01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.670]
Here's the lady in Oakland par hello

[01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:48.230]
Hello, hello, yes, there she is. Hi Neil. How you doing good? I'm a first time caller. Great. Don't you get sick of that? No?

[01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.690]
No, yeah, no

[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.330]
That's sometimes okay

[01:06:52.330 --> 01:07:00.290]
Anyways, I want you to call her long time listener. I have a really shameless request for you. Yeah, I want to hear the asshole song

[01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:04.210]
I've been telling my friend all about it and you just won't play for me anymore

[01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.990]
Which one we have because it's too long I'm just a regular joke. You mean that Dennis Lurie song

[01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:14.710]
How come that didn't get the greatest rock song of all time the greatest rock song of all time is

[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.590]
comfortably numb by pink Floyd

[01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:20.910]
You know, I just put that asshole thing up there to play it for you

[01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:26.610]
And now you're not and now well, I'm gonna play it, but I'm doing it with great reservation. So take a number

[01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:32.630]
Have a great day. You too. Oh my god pink Floyd. Oh

[01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:35.310]
Mm-hmm. I'd rather hear pink Floyd Kramer

[01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:38.150]
We got that let's play that instead of asshole

[01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:42.930]
11th or it can't say asshole on a radio though because there might be a lot of kids out of school and they never heard that word

[01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.730]
610 W I O D

[01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.630]
Dad are we there yet?

[01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:51.190]
Good can't keep his packer in his pants

[01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:58.850]
This is for the people of the CVS. They got stupid tennis on instead of the unoriented people on channel 4 when you're dead

[01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.090]
Tell a thaw on folks

[01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.350]
I'd like to see the song about

[01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.490]
About me about you

[01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:09.650]
And it is very low as oh no

[01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.190]
Bottom of our chest

[01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.530]
About that special feeling we get in the

[01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.630]
Subcontinent

[01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:22.290]
Maybe in the liver maybe in the kidneys

[01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.250]
Maybe even in the cold

[01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.830]
We don't

[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.770]
I'm just a regular

[01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.490]
With a regular job

[01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:35.850]
I'm your average white

[01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:37.570]
Suburban ice

[01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.250]
Love I like football

[01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:41.850]
Tornow books about you

[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:50.850]
I got an average house where the nice hardwood floor my wife and my job my kids and my car

[01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:54.390]
I'll feed on my table and a cube of

[01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.750]
So

[01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:00.390]
Sometimes that just

[01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.790]
Ain't enough to keep a man like me

[01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:05.750]
Oh no no wait

[01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:09.890]
I know I've got to go out and have fun

[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:12.050]
And someone else has expense

[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.450]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:17.310]
I try really slow

[01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:19.930]
In the old-fashioned way

[01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:22.690]
While people behind me are going

[01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:25.010]
And they're saying about a fool

[01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.050]
You're a fool

[01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.130]
You're a fool

[01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.290]
I'm on a fool

[01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.550]
But you're a fool

[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:34.210]
I use public toilets

[01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:34.910]
And I

[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:38.870]
I walk around in the summer times

[01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.670]
And I walk about this year

[01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:41.930]
I'm on a fool

[01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:44.690]
You're a fool

[01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:46.310]
I'm on a fool

[01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:48.230]
You're a fool

[01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:51.070]
And sometimes I pour

[01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:53.330]
In the handicap spaces

[01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.450]
While handicapped people

[01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.410]
Make handicapped spaces

[01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.770]
I'm on a fool

[01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:00.510]
You're a fool

[01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.770]
You're a fool

[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.030]
You're a fool

[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.970]
You're a fool

[01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:10.090]
Maybe I should be singing this song

[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:14.250]
Ranting and raving and carrying on

[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.330]
Maybe they're right for they tell me I'm wrong

[01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:23.930]
Now I'm on a fool

[01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:26.010]
You're a fool

[01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:27.210]
You're a fool

[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.710]
You're a fool

[01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:32.730]
You know what I'm gonna do

[01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:35.330]
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 panel

[01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:36.830]
I killed a rattle convertible

[01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:37.510]
I think

[01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:39.530]
With a whale skin a half a cat

[01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.750]
And all other cow in the area

[01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:44.250]
And big brown baby seal eyes for headlines

[01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:44.810]
Yeah

[01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:46.470]
And I'm gonna cry for that baby

[01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.250]
At 150 miles per hour

[01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.590]
Just getting one mile per gallon

[01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:50.870]
It's like a now-sported fighter

[01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:52.070]
She's furthest to McDonald's

[01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.670]
The old fashioned

[01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:54.470]
Not by the great of all styrofoam containers

[01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:56.070]
And when I'm done sucking down those

[01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.810]
Three small burgers

[01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.010]
I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag

[01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:00.830]
And then I'm gonna talk to styrofoam containers

[01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:01.410]
Right outside

[01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.030]
And then I'm gonna catch them

[01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:04.370]
Saying anybody can do about it

[01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:05.170]
You know what I'm doing?

[01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:06.550]
Because we got the bomb

[01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:07.170]
That's why

[01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:08.030]
Two words

[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.550]
Nuclear

[01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:09.970]
In weapons of day

[01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:10.610]
Russia

[01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:11.230]
Germany

[01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.010]
Romania

[01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:13.670]
They can have all the democracy they want

[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:14.870]
They can have a big democracy

[01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.090]
Can't walk right through the middle

[01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:16.890]
And see it even square

[01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:18.230]
And it won't make a lick of difference

[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.670]
Because we ain't got the bomb

[01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:20.330]
So Dad

[01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:21.710]
John Wayne's not dead

[01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:22.630]
He's frozen

[01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.370]
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer

[01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:25.490]
We're gonna throw out the dook

[01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.750]
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

[01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:27.330]
You know why

[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:28.810]
The door's taken a cold shower

[01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:30.830]
We'll multiply that by 15 million times

[01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:32.450]
That's how pissed off the dook's gonna be

[01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.430]
I'm gonna get a dook

[01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:34.470]
And John gets the betties

[01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:35.310]
And leave armament

[01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:36.350]
And stand back and boy

[01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.170]
And a case of where

[01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:38.610]
And drive down a big saint

[01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.350]
You know you really are an asshole

[01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.550]
But you just shut up and sing this song, BOW

[01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:12.470]
I'm an asshole

[01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:14.510]
And I'm proud of this

[01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:18.310]
Why did he throw the case

[01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:19.490]
So in other words he was upset

[01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:22.150]
You know the cake here and a dead cat here

[01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:23.870]
They got a birthday cake for Phil Henry

[01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.230]
I thought this was all a joke

[01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.250]
I saw the dead pussy

[01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.950]
When they brought it in and they wrapped up

[01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.210]
And it wasn't unwrapped

[01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.730]
In other words, it was still wrapped in that thing

[01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:33.210]
With the tail hanging out

[01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.870]
I'm in the tail and I can see a paw

[01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:35.930]
Yeah, a tail and a paw

[01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.090]
Well that's the best part, isn't it

[01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.330]
George said the tail is the best part

[01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.750]
So anyway

[01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.530]
And they put it right next to the cake and he got so upset

[01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.510]
He threw the cake out

[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:47.190]
I don't know how I'll say it

[01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:49.610]
Was that because he lost his appetite or because

[01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:51.930]
Well let me let me ask you a question

[01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.090]
Why would there be anything

[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:55.250]
I mean a cat's been dead for a long time right

[01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:57.150]
It's been in the freezer

[01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.950]
Right

[01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:59.570]
Yeah that's right

[01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:03.770]
Now would you assume that there was like any bacteria on a dead animal at that point

[01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.350]
I mean it wasn't out in the sun rotting where they were like

[01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:08.010]
You don't know what I'm saying

[01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:09.670]
I don't know how long it was out in the sun

[01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:10.670]
What do I know about that

[01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:11.690]
But it doesn't make any difference

[01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:13.910]
I mean it's been on ice for days

[01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:15.130]
What's the days I don't know

[01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:16.290]
Yeah, a couple of days

[01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:17.730]
I couldn't tell

[01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:20.730]
And the dead cat in the thing in the bag

[01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.090]
Was going to contaminate his cake

[01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:26.010]
I think Phil is getting a little bit hysterical if he asked
