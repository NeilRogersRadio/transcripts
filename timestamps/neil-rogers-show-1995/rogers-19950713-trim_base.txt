[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.260]
Hackwood can't keep his packer in his pants.

[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.340]
The doctor says I'm sick and I won't last long, but the beast I survived till the end of the song gets seen.

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.860]
Oh, you jackass!

[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.060]
OK, 10-06, oh look at that, it worked!

[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.100]
What the hell happened, it worked in there?

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.900]
It's a keyboard thing, can I say?

[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.140]
Oh, it's a keyboard thing.

[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.000]
Well, let's take this one.

[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.080]
You can get another one of Crescus for about 15 bucks to replace this piece of direct we got in the year.

[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.960]
But hey, it's good that we got all the corporate hot shots in town.

[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.420]
Thank you so much, sparing no expense to provide us with the very best direct that nobody else.

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.760]
Would it get this at the flea market?

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.700]
Man, oh man, there's five-year-old kids all over America that got better computers than we got.

[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.280]
So it's all set now, it works.

[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.980]
I can't switch keyboards until you want to break because I got to reset it.

[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.440]
Oh, I don't care about that, but is this going to come back up in here or what?

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.220]
What's the deal now?

[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.940]
Oh yeah.

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.360]
Well, why do we have to switch it?

[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.740]
Why don't you wait till 2 o'clock?

[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.260]
Because what's his name is on tape?

[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.700]
What's his name?

[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.780]
So anyway, happy Thursday, too.

[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.720]
Here we are, by the way, how am I going to get paid today?

[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.780]
We had nobody decide to check.

[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.120]
So they all out there at that listening meeting?

[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.820]
Or is that over now?

[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520]
Is that just for the morning show to get them all psychotic and nervous?

[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380]
And start spreading those ugly rumors about Ron and Ron?

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.680]
I'll tell you this is some outfit.

[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740]
First of all, let me just say this.

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.080]
Craig Barnes and Dave Joseph at the Sunsendle.

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.060]
Thank you for the nice coverage about my dear friend, Alan Finkelson, in a paper this morning.

[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.700]
The only thing I do want to say is that for 20 years, this great man came to this town.

[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.300]
I never forget.

[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.700]
I first met Alan 1976.

[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.160]
I was at WKAT.

[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.780]
We both came here about the same time.

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.640]
And he said to me, you just wait.

[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.540]
He says, I'm going to bring this media in this town.

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.100]
I know they don't care about harness racing.

[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.080]
They give us no coverage.

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.240]
They couldn't give a flying crap about Pompadopark.

[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.800]
You watch, I'm going to bring these people around.

[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180]
20 years later, as they're getting ready to bury my friend this afternoon.

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.880]
And nothing.

[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040]
Other than Dave Joseph, I'd say he's the only person in the media in this town except yours truly,

[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.640]
who has given any coverage of any kind.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.000]
I'll remember a couple of years ago when we had the breeders crown last time at Pompadopark.

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.160]
And Bernie Rosen had to call, thanks to Alan screaming and carrying on,

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.160]
had to call up the Jackass Segredo, the UM Jackass.

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.020]
You can't help the Speltoni Segredo without UM, by the way.

[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.860]
Had to call him up on the night of the breeders crown and say, you know, how come you don't have anything on the air?

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.300]
And so, you know, it's just pathetic.

[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.040]
So, Tony Segredo, I want to say people like you help to put my friend in the ground.

[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440]
I just wanted to say that right now.

[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.000]
But anyway, thanks Dave Joseph for at least being one guy who cared enough to write the very best.

[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.300]
Also, really great news is you're going to do that diet again today.

[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.920]
You bet your sweet ass I am.

[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140]
I had gained, I didn't want to admit it, but I gained about four or five pounds when I was on vacation there.

[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.000]
Those last three or four uncontrollable days.

[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.380]
And why not? I was on vacation, have it a good time.

[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.060]
So, here it is. I've been back like Monday through Wednesday as three full days.

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.200]
I lost back the weight plus an extra pound. I'm up to 15 now.

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.980]
Blood sugar is 60 this morning. I'm feeling great.

[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.160]
And it's just it's it's miraculous.

[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.100]
So, you can go off. I don't suggest that you go off of it because then it takes you about a couple of days to get back in ketosis again and get that thing working.

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.600]
But man, did I eat yesterday?

[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.200]
We had steak in here. We had filet mignon and New York strip and jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon for lunch.

[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.280]
And then for dinner, I went home on the grill on the gas grill and made two gigantic cheeseburgers

[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.820]
with no bun, of course. And plenty of yarlsburg cheese with no carbs.

[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.760]
Get on the scale this morning and it was fantastic. It was great.

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.480]
What a feeling of accomplishment. And plus my pants are falling off on the floor.

[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.560]
So, that's the one piece of good news. Also, I'm still curious. Maybe somebody can explain to me the thing.

[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.780]
I just I'm missing something. I pick up the paper this morning.

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.900]
I look at my sports section, which of course is the only part that anybody should really read.

[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.280]
Lions blades hurt. Fit a frustration cited. What the hell was that?

[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.900]
I'm so mad at both of you guys.

[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.080]
Detroit Lions safety. Benny blades underwent surgery on his right hand Wednesday for an injury his coach said he sustained in frustration

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.900]
upon learning of the shooting death of his cousin.

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.920]
Are you seeing all the similarity? Is this like a copycat deal now?

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.880]
The surgery went as expected. Head trainer Kent Falbs said we'll be able to better determine his prognosis after a while.

[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.100]
Blade slammed his fist against an object after after learning that his cousin.

[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.480]
I mean, what is this? It's like the same old neurotic repetition, same crap all over again.

[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.640]
He's got a big cut on his hand. Oh, man. Yeah.

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.760]
He slammed his fist against an object after learning that his cousin Charles blades have been shot to death July 5 at the plantation home of Seattle Seahawks receiver Brian blades.

[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.420]
Benny's brother. He said it happened in frustration. Oh, man.

[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.440]
Said Lions coach Wayne fat fonts or fat Wayne fonts.

[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.200]
The Lions open training camp next Wednesday. Benny blades hand was treated in the Lions training room at the party ex Silver Dome.

[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.340]
He left without comment. Benny blades lives in a condominium near his brothers.

[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.820]
He was not present at the shooting police have said he might not be available to the Trent's final exhibition this game August 25 in New Orleans.

[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.700]
And it just and then of course we have this story about and Drew Rosenhouse holds another press conference yesterday and a plantation police.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.700]
They don't trust them. They're going to twist it all around. That's why we don't want our man going in there and being questioned.

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:15.840]
I don't get it. Do you have a choice? In other words, if the police come to your house and they say, okay, Mr Schwartz, I want to take you downtown for you know, we want to do a little questioning.

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.780]
Okay, we're not placing you under arrest. We don't have to read you your rights. We just did. If you want to have your lawyer present, that's fine.

[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.800]
But we would like to bring it down, especially somebody that was in the room alone and the shots went off and there's all these unanswered questions.

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.040]
And neighbors said that they heard yelling and carrying on and all kinds of goings on in here. And we just want to ask you a couple of questions.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:44.700]
Oh, man. Exactly. What? Now, don't feel like it. Don't don't be feeling like it. Don't ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.

[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.720]
I mean, what is that? So maybe somebody can explain it to me because I just don't get it. I think the guy who called yesterday had a good point, but I don't want to say which one.

[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.540]
I think he had an excellent point. He said it's kind of I don't want to say because then we'll get in the all kind of promise.

[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:13.760]
I'm not a boat. You guys. I know. So why even start? All right. So we'll see where we go here today because they're in town. All the big hot shots. I'm going to a lot of pressure. We really, you know, because I know that when I sit down here at 10 o'clock every morning, I'm thinking, God, I sure hope I do a show that pleases Bob Neil, Bob Green and Steve Dickel today.

[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:26.840]
Because otherwise, I'm just, you know, somehow I'll feel guilty when I take that goddamn paycheck on Thursday and by the way, where is it George 12 minutes past 10 at W. I do we got food coming today from John's. Smith subs, right?

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:37.620]
That get it right. All right. And you know, a little meat, little cheese, something like that. God, this thing is great. I don't want to get started on again, but I will. This atkins thing is great.

[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:55.100]
And you feel great. You get up and you prick your finger in a morning and you look at that blood sugar and it's 58 60 nice and low down there. And you come in. You got all kinds of energy. You feel like you're full of vinegar and douche. This is the way to live, baby. Take those carbs and shove them 10 13 at W I O D.

[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:11.900]
16 W I O D. Black Johnny, Bobby and O J. We're pointing fingers and open for the best. I killed Nicole. This summer free willy returns and you can find them exclusively at McDougall. Hey, kid, do you want a free willy fun meal?

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:19.320]
Sure. Do I get a toy? Boy, hell, you get willy. Hey, Cookie, we need some more willy. One McWillie coming right up.

[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.420]
Yes, it's a killer well of a deal. Introducing the free willy fun meal new from McDougall.

[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:40.520]
Okay, so I got my check already. So I guess it's time to get to all out of here. Thank you so much. Now we got the board ops giving us our paychecks. That's good. Is Wayne like going downstairs, writing a few checks? That should be me. You dropped it off up here and I didn't feel like schlepping.

[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:55.740]
Miami. Yes, sir. I had to call you. You got to hear this story. It is in the Harold in the regional section. Yes, on the front page, the regional section. There's a guy who is driving a food truck to the middle market on eight street.

[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:10.820]
And he stopped and somebody jumped in the truck and started stealing food. Yeah, back and said, hey, what the hell are you doing? The guy clocks him on the head with a can of black beans. And then other people show up and this guy refuses to leave after trying to rob this guy.

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.820]
The police come. Then he takes his clothes off, gets in the truck and hides behind the cans of beans. Have to be removed by a swap team.

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:33.660]
Yeah, I had to call him. Tell you that that's the kind of police work that we specialize in here, man. Probably asked you a more heavy bean. Well, the woman last year, but we got up on the side naked instead. I'm not coming down for you. Give me crack. Right.

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.800]
You got to love it down here. She had a big crack problem like Oprah. Right. Exactly. Okay, pal. Thanks for the good news. Say hi to Brian Blades for me.

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:57.800]
Okay, yeah, I'm still waiting here. Now we tried this yesterday for four hours. We got a lot of smart ass people in here, but I'm this is a very serious thing, man. This is like a major, major local story. And I guess we're just going to let it kind of slide by guy gets shot.

[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:15.660]
That two bullets, not one, two for the price of one. Nobody can explain to us how it happened. Nobody's going to describe exactly what happened. And nobody's talking to the police and drew Rouse in the house who was just absolutely reviled by everyone, even just hearing the name, even if they don't know him. And if they do know them, they really despise him like poison.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:23.880]
And he's popping off a big mouth every five seconds. And while we don't trust the plantation police, well, listen, who the hell does, but what the hell is that got to do with it?

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:40.380]
We got a whole new deal in American. I mean, jocks go out and especially football players, what about baseball players? They get nailed. Okay, drugs, anything, even minor stuff, few coke deals, they get their ass nailed, but football players can't murder anybody. Is that the dealer what? Here's Broward.

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:50.640]
Neil, I had a not a car accident, but I had a misfortune driving through Palm Beach County. And I saw a sign promoting a station I never heard of with Don I miss.

[00:10:50.960 --> 00:11:05.700]
Yeah, it's a dick Farco and Gary Daniels. Yeah, I thought dick Farco was dead and buried. Yeah, I'm what about Don I miss. He's also dead.

[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:16.480]
I guess they're worse than the life of recycling old washed up talents. Well, that's Palm Beach for you. That's where Palm Beach County specializes it before I go. You can't smell. You can't spell come without you.

[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:27.420]
I know you're a day behind man. You're real late. Man is real late. You know, we're not going to get started on that again. Are we? We did like two and a half hours of that yesterday. All these original people can't spell marriage. You mean without you.

[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:41.780]
Yeah, okay, 751 W I D were off to a real start this morning. Rick was full of crap when he gave me a song to dance about that little spark. I saw a little spark on a phone bank when I walked in here about 915. Broward 5249 463.

[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.900]
We want some answers here today. Damn it. I want some answers now. Don't forget by the way, Dr. Atkinson. I will be a book.

[00:11:52.520 --> 00:12:02.440]
I have a feeling there's going to be some kind of heavy duty massive turnout there. Don't you? They have 750 copies of the book that they bring it in special. I think it is going to be vivid and massive if he acts may.

[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:15.020]
Here's a mobile and Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Neil. We don't care about Brian Blade. They're killing putty cats and Miami beef. Exactly. That's what we care about. That's the kind of thing our great crime reporter and the Buchanan from the herald all those years.

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:22.840]
She's worried about their killing putty cat over on the beach, but we got a guy who's just been murdered in cold blood who's dead or than a goddamn door nail.

[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:37.620]
Better than a dead cat and she ain't writing about that. Now we can butcher people but leave the cats along. Good point. See you. Thanks. Yeah. Pussy cats. They're killing on Miami Beach. Well, Edna's very as she's big into that pussy cat. She's into that.

[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:47.080]
But when it comes to people, here's one of the major bizarre unfolding right in front of your push. And nobody wants to come to grips with this because it's a guy.

[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:55.000]
They're not only a football player, but a guy that played for you. I guess if you go to you. You know, no crime is too big for anybody goes to you.

[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:04.540]
I mean, I'm not suggesting a course that he did it. Am I am I suggesting that I'm implying it. I'm suggesting that there's lots and lots of questions that the longer it goes on before this man is called in.

[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:13.100]
I have many, many questions that I would like to ask, including what the hell is wrong with the plantation police. I guess so if you're going to kill somebody plantation be a good place to do it.

[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:21.300]
Not the acres though state of hell out of my neighborhood. But plantation be hell of a good place because they're too busy down there. That goddamn you float them changing the filters in the coffee machine.

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:29.040]
That's all they do in plantation is right traffic tickets and work on a coffee machine at that. What is that is that it's not a you totem. It's say.

[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:41.620]
What is it? It's on a corner of Broward and University right across from Broward mall and we spot circle K circle circle one circle you ranch. Now there's no Jews in there.

[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:50.360]
Anyway, it's 10 21 at W I O D at least five Toyota dealers this weekend are going to tell you that they're going to beat the price on every deal in town or they'll give you something.

[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:59.440]
I'll tell you what they'll give you is a song and a dance and a headache. I mean, Kendall Toyota will beat all these other dealers every time on every price or they'll give you nothing.

[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:08.780]
Why the hell should they have to give you a premium because see if the other dealers were given in the straight talk and the emis they wouldn't be promising and they'll give you some big deal like that.

[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.620]
But a Kendall Toyota all they do is give you the lowest prices in town day in day out weekend week out month and you know how it goes.

[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:33.320]
For example, a brand new 95 to sell from 89 95 nobody's going to beat that pickups from 99 95 Corolla's from 10, 995 Camry's is little as 14, 995 and only Kendall Toyota will pay everybody 2500 bucks more than your trade is listed for in this week's black book used car guide.

[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:39.920]
So you can get sucked in with those other slogans and all those stupid giveaways for a pop up toaster whatever you want.

[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.360]
But if you want the best deal get your ass down to Kendall Toyota on us one just south of day land on the label.

[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.600]
610 W I O D like most muscles the more you use us the better we get.

[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.600]
I killed Nicole.

[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.860]
I don't know who's on the radio from 10 to 2.

[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.620]
Lousy mouth is a baby is the truth.

[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.800]
I'll sign a white alarm was every day.

[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.900]
Best with the miracle of being gay.

[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.780]
The world's greatest homo is South of Sally.

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.060]
Hacking baits baits pleasure in a big big way.

[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.600]
The world's greatest homo is South of Sally.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.600]
Hacking baits baits pleasure in a big big way.

[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.000]
But only.

[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.300]
Oh and just in case they are really having a listening party today.

[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.180]
Here's a message for Bob Neel and Bob Green.

[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.540]
I'm so mad at both of you guys.

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.720]
OK 10 25 at W I O D see it said both so I couldn't include the other one in here.

[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.300]

[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.420]

[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.200]

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.260]
how come people are up but how come they're all watching this oj crap and

[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.440]
are all been out of shape because of that little a countertops between uh...

[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.600]
johnny and his conquerant and christ darney as today like that was some big

[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.020]

we've got a local scandal we got a possible murder on our hands here and

[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.220]
nobody is uh... excited about it

[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.360]
the other reason why i can't jump up and got got everybody's face is because

[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.580]
he knew his uh... his witness his witness

[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.500]

to their get their ducks in the road so when they do good

[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.660]
what do you think they're ducks in a row today is the thirteen investigations

[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.240]
like you saw yesterday that they come out with a good neighbor's and all

hundred nine four four see this is the best the south florida people can do okay you can't spell murder

[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.120]
without you and you can't that one guy called started it with that scum which was great you can't

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.860]
spell scum without you and that's all we needed the other ones were good though but no seriously

[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.960]
that's the best response they can give because the american public has been and it's like i heard

[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.760]
rick talking this morning about that chip that they want to put in the tv's now the v chip so that

[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.220]
you can block out the violent programs well guess what when you go to europe they have they love

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.180]
american tv because they don't have very much of their own and then even what they do create their

[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.980]
own is just copies of the american quiz shows like uh... uh... prices right and all that stuff which they

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:43.500]
do very poorly by the way but basically what they have is dubbed in foreign language all the american

[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.040]
tv shows the more violent you want they got it and guess what they're not running around with guns

[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.980]
they're not running around killing each other there's no drive by shootings like we have an

[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:58.460]
another one yesterday and the public here has been so desensitized they don't know the difference

[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:04.280]
between that's the problem television has done it they don't know the difference kids watch that

[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.100]
crap and they don't know the difference between fantasy and reality and what are great leaders in

[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.540]
washing and want to do is they want to be the babysitters okay let's just keep banning stuff

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.560]
like that's going to change the mentality of the stupid people out there who can't tell the

[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.320]
difference between and the problem is that we have really ignorant trash people out there multiplying

[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:30.720]
i say forced sterilization immediately right that's the answer to it let's have some people with

[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.480]
a little bit of a brain and a little bit of class and stop stop glorifying all these goddamn jocks

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.300]
how about somebody that's got a brain how about somebody like that do you have any respect for that

your gun two bullets one in the dead guy neighbors here screaming and yelling brian it's the word

[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:26.280]
murder look at all man you know i'm just so sick and tired of these jocks thinking that's just

[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.140]
because they can hide behind their uh there's celebrity exactly behind a god damn uniform in a

[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.560]
jock strap yeah he's going to devote the rest of his career in his life and football to his

[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.500]
to his dad uh uncle or cousin aware of yeah he is because he's a ball player you know and i'm

[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.540]
sick of it i you know i played professional ball and i was also in broadcasting and i i love

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.680]
for so much but the past ten years Neil i don't pay attention to it hardly at all you're dealing

[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.400]
with a bunch of degenerate deadbeats with a bunch of slime balls you know Mickey Manell whitey

[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.720]
Ford Billy Martin those guys used to go out and have a few pops and woman eyes you know like

[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.660]
everybody else in those days but those guys were class they were a great a class that compared to

[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.900]
these slime balls we got today and those guys 30 40 years ago they were making a tiny fraction

[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.340]
a minute fraction of what these jerks are making today they played because they loved it number one

[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.280]
right number two they didn't have the slime ball attorney's cannon behind them or in front of

[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.900]
them or inside of them rubbing their neck and and number three they just uh they they had a real

[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.280]
feel for what it was like because they knew that it would stop and it would give a kid an

[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.320]
autograph and would never even dream about charging somebody for an autograph any athlete that wants

[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.020]
to charge a kid for an autograph should be shot right on the spot no questions and it makes me

[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.380]
sick that's why when you've got a few people like maybe a Jeff Konaine who i really respect

[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:51.200]
there's a classy guy he's a real i think he's a throwback to the to the manel see the problem is

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.020]
though with Konaine is that he's very low key don't have much of a personality so he does you know

[00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:00.600]
he's very underrated because he just has no flash no flare but these other guys uh you know Mr.

[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.160]
Hot shot this this hot shot and that one uh they're the guys that get all the uh the attention

[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.780]
and one last word for Brian Brian even the plantation police are gonna figure this out eventually

[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.700]

i mean somebody must know there's two guys in a room and one of them is still alive

[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:42.900]
even a guy damn editorial in the sunset and all they blade silence breeds suspicions it says

[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:50.240]
boy an open letter to Seattle seahawks wide receiver Brian blades how dare you refuse to talk to

[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.320]
police and prosecutors about the july offense shooting death of your cousin charles blades at acts

[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.420]
your right your main silent may be technically legal but your decision to exercise that right is

[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.720]
irresponsible on ethical and inexcusable how do you like that says the prestigious sun sentinel

[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.580]
the holier than now with all those ads for those uh body massage things on a sports page

[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.620]
that's right says you were alone with him in the room of your plantation home on the gun went off

[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:21.840]
you the only witness what happened k pa saman anybody football hero or ordinary human being who

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:30.960]
is present football hero or ordinary human being i give up oh just stop and let that soak in for

[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.320]
just a second okay football hero or ordinary human being like Albert Einstein for example who

[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.320]
was present at the scene of a violent death should come forward voluntarily to tell police what

[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.080]
he knows and not behind legal rights to arrange silent that's called being a good citizen

[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.280]
no one's accusing you of wrongdoing all they just want to know your version of what happened if

[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.540]
it was an accident as you maintain then you got nothing to fear but fear itself and that's what

[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.720]
f.d.r. said and look at him now and everything to gain by speaking out your silence inevitably raises

[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.140]
suspicions by police prosecutors family neo rogers friends and the public that you have something to

[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.520]
hide can you live with those suspicions and he says yes don't force prosecutors to subpoena you

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.960]
and offer you immunity for testifying your silence fuels the ugly notion that there's a different

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.340]
standard of justice for rich and poor celebrity and commoner what an ugly notion that is

[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.500]
where do they come up with an idea like there's a different set of justice for celebrities and

[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.600]
like the common ordinary man oh man i don't buy that maybe we can get the dream that's what we

and about a pound and a half a ground beef uh wait a minute i just started i would cook it up and

[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.080]
eat the entire however much that makes what is that sir eight whatever it's supposed to serve

[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:46.520]

[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:04.540]
Buenos dias hello yes sir good morning Neil how you doing okay okay i spoke to you two weeks ago uh

[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:12.720]
i told you um um that i had a minor hundred attack i was 27 years old yes and i told you i was

[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:19.380]
been two weeks and it lost 20 pounds oh also my blood pressure star i was on a blood pressure

[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:24.860]
pill right they started dropping and dropping and dropping i'm off the pill um how long

[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.080]
in uh two weeks and i feel great but the only problem that we're having we're doing this as a

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:38.480]
family thing too and uh our problem is uh the uh the night trites there's night trites and bacon

[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.700]
there's night trites and ham there's night trites and everything so we called the acon center

[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:48.900]
and it told us to look for slap bacon but that also has night trites in it so we can't uh i don't

[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.860]
know what you know you had bacon yesterday but most all of them that i've seen has night trites in it

[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:58.280]
yeah well nothing is perfect it's not a perfect world okay but that's not going to affect your

[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.460]
weight loss no okay it's not then because there's no night trites whatsoever and anything right well

[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:08.460]
of course you try you try for perfection but you're never going to get it and if you get like

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.360]
healthy choice cold cuts i think if you look on the label you'll find that they don't uh some of

[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.700]
them do well some of them do and so so get the ones that don't the only ones that don't have is a

[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:22.580]
turkey and that's it all the other ones do all of them yep we look at all the packages in the store

[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:27.740]

unbelievable i got a question did anybody bring up to you since when you were at a town last week

[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:06.660]
there was an article in the paper that the fcc is going to be clamping down on decency on radio as

[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:12.760]
well till midnight now all that was is that there was a u.s. appeals court in washington that the

[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.320]
you know the nineteen eighty seven ruling they had about in decent speech and all that crap they just

[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.180]
uh... they just upheld it they said the fcc still i think that's until ten o'clock at night or eight

[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.980]
o'clock whatever the hell it is it's a bunch of crap is what it is all right i thought that i don't

[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:29.720]
i say it was one of his career and now they're also going to decide about violent programming on

[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:34.220]
television let me say it again nobody with a brain in this country which doesn't cover too much

[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:39.320]
territory but nobody in a brain wants the government censoring speech okay it's unconstitutional it

[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.520]
is unacceptable and they can kiss my fat ass well it just sounded like the fcc's got a new boss

[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.400]
now and he's saying was no no it's just it's just the same old crap all right well in closing

girlfriend Patricia Barrett that i'm an asshole honest about that i never saw that clip for

[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.020]
uh... some strange reason court tv never decided to show that again well they didn't replay it i

[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.860]
guess because of the the word it came across live on channel seven in patrick phrase here every

[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.340]
one there panic i guess they don't have a dump dump on the crazer he's a real

[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:38.180]
yeah well he panicked and he said uh... he might not mudd something about uh...

[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:42.440]
hey this is uh... date time tv children may be watching we're going to watch and we're going

[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.680]
public has been brainwashed and believing there's something terrible about words sexist dirty the

[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.680]
human body is dirty words are dirty we're talking about a two-year-old sandbox mentality in this

[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:17.380]

did you refer to me as an asshole yeah and it would have been great and what did he say

[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:29.260]
uh... nothing that's when they interrupted i guess and uh... it would have been great

[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.740]
if the defense the dream team would have stood up in unison at that point great

[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:37.420]

uh one of the one of the talking about uh these bridges about large and boats that you talked about

[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.240]
earlier about what

[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:40.980]
bridges cars and boats now we're talking about bridges over over the uh causeway not the ones

[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:47.420]
in your mouth i don't have any of my friends okay okay yeah calm down so take a deep breath

[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:53.840]
and then he put it regulated by the united core of engineers you got to know well it is all

[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.320]
bridges over navigable waterway see if i knew that i wouldn't have been asking say what's that

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.420]
i said if i knew the answer to the question i wouldn't have asked it in the first place okay well

[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:10.420]
i'm saying sir is that the united states core of engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over

[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:18.700]
navigable waterways over one navigable waterway yes sir okay okay yeah so it's up to them to decide

[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:27.780]
what time the bridges should not be open to the marine traffic yes and what time should they not

[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:34.780]
be open to marine traffic sir i'm telling you that they come up with the times well what what

[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:44.760]
is the time i believe it's at rush hour times sir that they are not open to marine traffic other than

[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.580]
that they are open to marine traffic so in other words any slump with a boat can come along and back up

[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.600]
traffic for two months absolutely correct sir well what kind of a communist bunch of crappers that

[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.980]
that is not a communist bunch of craps sounds like some kind of the end of the all fascist commie pinko

[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:12.600]
experiencing me right exactly no i think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat i

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:18.600]
think that's what they ought to do man you better know your law is mr because you sure don't that's

[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.620]
right i suppose you want the man bridges closed to both traffic and a hurricane too i want the bridges

[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:28.900]
closed period okay i want them closed i want the bridge tentative to go home and watch your

[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:34.100]
MTV and get the hell out of our lives i want those bridges closed let them use the junior

[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:38.600]
