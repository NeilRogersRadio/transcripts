Though we try to hide them and forget we knew them

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.920]
They used to work beside us

[00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.800]
Even though this time they made us lose our minds and we barrel wick Alpantim being Gary Bruce Jeff Clark Johnny dark and Joseph Gackie

These aren't all the people who are still here working and he'll still working

[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.900]
We are all just people who are out there giving just a minute

[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.740]
They go in

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.340]
I wouldn't like to eliminate rabbits

[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.220]
Let's have that

[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.560]
And we're out there giving just a make a living yes, I am

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.480]
12.06. The W.I.D. Hope you appreciate that pal

[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.240]
I had to look high and low and there was red and the goddamn computer

[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.780]
We have an open line of power at 5249463 now they're showing them and his brothers there

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.800]
They're getting already again. Of course. We know they done it because they said we'd done it

[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.960]
But now it's well we got this hot shot bitch attorney and

[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.140]
We just remembered we were my last of his children and we were afraid for our lives

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.820]
It was self-defense. It was self-defense. They were gonna kill us right

[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.620]
But we sure enjoyed that Porsche that we went out and bought and those Rolex watches and all the other fancy good stuff

[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.460]
And that's how we were able to get all the money to buy this fancy lawyer. That's how we're still alive

[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.240]
Open line and Broward 5249463 2 on the green lines which are out of business out of work and out of now

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.660]
Wait till you hear this. I don't want to get back out of that topic again

[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.120]
You're the unmexitable, but in this whole article in this page is a

[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.140]
Darden signs with an agent to write in lecture. Okay, that's great

[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.780]
But next to it in the article about the NBC interview and all the protest and all the phone calls

[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.620]
There is one paragraph that is this is the epitome of what it's all about

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400]
Simpsons contact was NBC West Coast president

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.200]
Don Olmeyer. That's the contact that helps set up this thing tonight

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.040]
Olmeyer a long time friend

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.980]
Olmeyer visited Simpson in jail and championed the X football players cause

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.600]
Just prior to the start of the trial

[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.640]
Olmeyer told TV writers that not only would OJ be found not guilty

[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.160]
But that he is innocent of the crimes end of quote. I rest my case guilty

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.600]
Both of them fry both the rest

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.340]
So you see they got this incestuous relationship going on there

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.440]
That's why he winds up on NBC for free tonight, and that's why you know it's gonna be a puff piece, baby

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.920]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello. Hi, Mayo. How you doing? Okay. I know I'm in a minority

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.160]
I'm a white 47 year old male who has my doubts about his guilt. Yeah, however

[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.260]
Having said that yeah, if you want to give if you want to give credibility to tonight's piece

[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.200]
Yeah, instead of Katie Kirk and Tom Broke call they should have Marsha Clark and Chris darkened

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.780]
Yeah, okay two open lines at Broward 5249 463 524 w. I would do you let's go to Miami on a purple line. Hello. Yeah, sir

[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.760]
How you doing? Okay?

[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.620]
Two things one of them

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.160]
One I thought about a while ago, but yesterday that the religion the dog personality call was the greatest call of all time

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.560]
Thank God was a bozo. I mean he really believes in it and then that's good

[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.440]
He should believe what he wants, but he doesn't believe dogs have personality

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.020]
And the said the sad part of it is he says he's got dogs. Yeah

[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.340]
That's the worst part, but this guy that just calls about the about not buying food at the stadium. Yeah, I think

[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.740]
This is some kind of protest. Why do I have to see if tickets? I mean

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.640]
He writes a check for five thousand dollars a year for four tickets, right?

[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.560]
And then he's not gonna spend the ten bucks to buy the food right? I just think he's cheap

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.500]
I don't think that he's

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.240]
Protesting or maybe he's getting too much indigestion from the crappy food or so and that's possible unbelievable

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.100]
Yeah, all right nail your god and have a great life. Yeah

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.780]
Open line and a purple line pound out of you that guy yesterday that calls see that's why I love I love those discussions on religion because

[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.140]
Everyone that calls into defend the indefensible they make total jackasses out of themselves

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.440]
Well, yeah, he's a dog lover, but dogs don't have any personality and dogs don't have any feelings

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.320]
Everything they do is instinctive

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.940]
That's right so when the dog sees you come home from work and he's wagging his tail and jumping up and down and

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.280]
Slobbering all over your face and looking you all over the post

[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.440]
That's because he's not really happy to see you

[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.020]
He's just doing it because he's conditioned to doing it. Well who taught him to do that?

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.700]
Who taught him to do that?

[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.940]
Was there somebody inside the house the first time you left the house and they said to the dog?

[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.620]
Oh, here's Shmendrick is home you better go there and here's what you do you jump up it down and look him all over the face right

[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.220]
Or like if you let you let the dog get off the sofa you jackass and he gives you that wounded look in his eyebrows

[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.500]
Going a certain way and like he goes into the corner and sucks

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.920]
He's not really heard his feelings. He just does that instinctively only human beings have feelings, baby

[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.660]
And you're killing mine with your Stone Age bull crap

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.680]
With your God bull crap with your Jesus and Moses all of it. I'm not picking anyone. I'm telling you all of it

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.800]
It's equal opportunity bull crap

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.100]
But it's a lot easier to

[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.160]
Spue all that bull crap than it is to grab the bull by the horns and say hey

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.500]
We're gonna eliminate all these horrendous things that are going on and we're gonna start acting like civilized people now

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.020]
We don't want to do that God will take care of it. This is his plan some plan, baby

[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.140]
Boy nice screenplay

[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.780]

[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.940]

[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.440]
He's the guy that introduced him to Bobby Shapir. Oh, yeah

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.060]
And said hey, this guy is gonna put together for you the dream team and get your ass off you stupid bastard

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.020]
No, I don't think yeah, you better listen to me man. He gonna get you off and sure enough. He got him off

[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.000]
And Don Olmeyer's the one who set this thing up on NBC tonight and you people out there

[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.600]
You think there's some credibility involved in this you think that this is gonna be something worth watching

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.800]
And then you're gonna sit in front of the tube and you're gonna just stick your stupid head in there and get sucked in again. Yes, I am okay

[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.200]
Here's a mobile in for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir? Great. Hey, listen

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.540]
We've decided I'm out here training a new guy for the company

[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.460]
We decided we're not going to participate in the violence of America and watch OJ tonight

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.560]
Okay, we decided to do something much more less violent. We're gonna take our wives and go see seven

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.940]
Okay, that's good and

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.820]
See Brad Pitt and see OJ. Yep. That's it for any day of the week man

[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.240]
Or maybe we can do something really really plastic like seeing silence of the lands again. There you go

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.480]
Yeah, much less violent to know Jay right okay one shameless request. Don't forget to bring the Keoni

He wants to hear it real real loud, which I don't think it's on his you know

[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.820]
I am so sick of this computer. I'm serious. Let's take this thing up front and stick it right up Bob Green's ass W.I.O.D

[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.060]

Four power than a else president say man. I'm the most powerful god damn man in the world. Yes, I am

[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.300]
Four power than a else president say man. I'm the most powerful god damn man in the world

[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.300]
Six for never to get that taste and smell out of your

While 86% of newborn boys in this cupier of circumcised the procedure is widely performed without any sort of anesthesia

[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.240]

I will not patronize blockbuster any other company that perpetuates this kind of behavior

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.860]
It's me again is an OJ on provocateurs

[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.300]
I

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.360]
Those

[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.360]

[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.600]
That is great radio. I am that hemorrhage. Don't we have a longer court than his piece of crap? Look at this

[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.860]
Look how short this damn thing

[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.500]
I'm gonna take this court and I'm gonna shove it right up his ass. Oh Neil

[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.720]
This place operates like a freaking nut house it really does I want to be left to freak alone, okay?

[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.320]

[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.960]
Let's play that little psych game with the audience if you move real fast

[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.600]
You might get in and we might give you a million dollars in cash, but I sure doubt it

[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.540]
Let's not go perpetrating no hoax on the public again, okay?

[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.500]
We'll get that guy real upset that called Phil yesterday. We're calling the FCC. Wow

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.940]
Because Dan marino is retiring from football and guess what he is someday

[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.360]
Maybe not today. Maybe not next suckers, but someday

[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.220]
Someday he'll be retiring from football

[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.500]
And at that point people all over this juvenile town

[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.300]
Will be weeping and sobbing. They'll be drowning like Alice in her own goddamn tears rantell

[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.020]

Hey, Neil how you doing? Okay, sir happy suckers and back to you. Thank you

[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.100]
I was at the dolphin game on Sunday and I saw this something

[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.020]
This was that way after the game. I hung around because I wanted to miss all the traffic. I noticed some

[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.100]
Dolphin players. I think urban friar and some other cold players down there kneeling and squatting and they were kneeling on it

[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:30.040]
Doing some prayers. Oh, yeah, very very disturbing. Can't they do that in the locker room or something?

[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.740]
I don't know what that's all about what that be all about well

[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.300]
Irving of course, you know he's born again

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.380]
And he put you know I had somebody called yesterday about isn't it greater?

[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.000]
Ving put his whole life back together in yada yada yada because he was a wife feeder in a piece of crap

[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.420]
And a deadbeat and now he found the Lord and of course and like I said he's weakened he needs a crutch

[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.320]
And if it works for him, that's fine. Just don't ponder off on me. I heard he stabbed his wife

[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.420]
He stabbed his wife. I heard it was a knife injury or something. Oh, well, whatever

[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.860]
Shameless request. Yeah, it seems to be going around with football players

[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.120]
Yeah, act the wife. Okay. Thank you for for Irving

[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.100]

[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.680]
I'm trying to put some more asses in those seats at the arena tonight

[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.060]
Exciting game a big game. You're gonna get to see that Schmeckle Koyvoo that rookie for Montreal

[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.860]
It's supposed to be so great and you'll get to see our new improved dynamic offense in a team that scored some goals for the Panthers

[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:44.780]
tonight

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.400]
But you can't see it unless you're there. I don't think it's on TV is that I hope I pray

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.260]
I mean if we have to listen to Rimmer again. Oh Jesus

[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.840]
Although of course if it ain't on TV that's even worse because then you got to listen to Chris more if you're not going to be there

[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.160]
So that's all the more reason to be at the game because nobody wants to hear Chris more

[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:09.840]
There is no more disgusting and revolting thing on the face of the earth and listen to that man pretending to be doing play by play on a hockey game

[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.000]
He ought to be in prison right now in federal penitentiary for impersonating a hockey broadcaster foster

[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.920]
He would is doing cartwheels in his grave

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.260]

I don't see now. Let's see here's the thing is it on TV is it on TV is sunshine

[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:33.700]
uh

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.040]
What

[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.560]
Home games

[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.200]
Well what is it on TV or is it not on TV or not TV

[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.360]
It just says TV sunshine. Oh, it is on sunshine. So like I said Rimmer will be there

[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.340]
So that's another good thing you don't have to watch OJ turn over to sunshine and hear rumors say they scores

[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.160]

[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.640]
Anyway, uh, I don't know if you did anybody mentioned paper this morning. It said that

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.860]
Cochrane is gonna be off camera

[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.940]
giving hand signals

[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:30.440]
He's gonna be doing a black power salute baby. All right. He's gonna be giving hand signals to Simpson and what to say and what not

[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.260]
And during a during the outbreaks, which there aren't going to be any breaks

[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.800]
But if there were I guess he'd come in maybe do

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.780]
While he's on there talking now secondly secondly, yeah, uh, is that

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.740]
That he would have to refuse to answer questions

[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.300]
That might

[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:57.820]
So then what is he gonna answer? Is he gonna be fine? Yes, please pass the water right

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.180]
That's it. I have to tell you also. I've been with you know something

I never thought about that sir

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.540]
You've done a tremendous pubic service

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.680]
You might actually influence a few people out there like one or two to realize what a bogus waste of time

[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.420]
This is because the goldmins have already filed that civil suit

[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.360]
It's gonna happen. He's gonna have to testify and that's gonna be like a cost him a lot of money

[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:24.180]
Maybe and he's gonna have to say oh well. I can't answer. He's gonna do a mark firm and I want to assert my fifth amendment privilege

[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:30.000]
He's not even on a witness stand. He's only gonna say what he wants to say. Yeah, he's gonna say how's my friend Bryant doing?

[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.880]
Yeah, he wears costus so we can scope out those games this weekend. All right one other your side note douche bag

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.720]
I've been listening to you for 20 years. I went on the yackens diet. I lost 17 pounds. I feel fantastic

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:50.080]
I got to exercising. I can do three sets of 30 push-ups each and I'm 69 years old. All right

[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.360]
There you go keep it up. Okay

[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.420]
There's one of the meaningful calls which we really get one on this station, but there's one right there

[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.880]
Except of course those brilliant people over calling Phil yesterday. Why are you doing this to us? It's a fraud

[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.240]
We just called a dish-jockey. We know what he said. Yeah, we called some dish-jockey

[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.940]
Arena was just done with the Zagaki by the way and he did say on channel six news

[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.300]
He said he's gonna read our channel four. Oh, that's bad. I keep getting that screwed up

[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.820]
He's gonna retire

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.100]
someday

[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.500]
What show is that from that song, George? Is that like West Side Story? What's uh musical is that from someday?

[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.620]
Huh

[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.000]
You don't know you don't know your musicals. I'm a few bars. Huh?

[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.100]
I don't know what you're talking about someday. Isn't that the name of the song?

[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.860]
How does it go?

[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.440]
Slowly

[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.540]

[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.100]
I've been listening to you for a while first time I've called great

[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.060]
Um, the reason I'm calling is because I heard you mentioning Hazel Park racetrack earlier. Yes, ma'am

[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.520]
You remember the bowling alley that was behind it

[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.140]
Uh, vaguely. I mean I never went in there by sure. No, it was there

[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.620]
Well, I used to work in it. We used to send our bets over to racetrack

[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.800]
11 mile into quinter you got it. Yeah, yep

[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.640]
You got it. We used to while we were working we'd listen we could stand on the front porch of the bowling alley and hear the horses going

[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.260]
Really? Yeah, and you could hear that voice of Jack Riggs. That's right. Yeah, that's right

[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.580]
So we used to listen and then we all knew we lost so we'd have to go back in and get back to work

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:38.500]
Yeah, I had some good times up there at the track in Detroit. I had years of great times. It was a it was a good place

[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.180]
Yeah, well enjoy the game tonight. Okay. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye

[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.180]
How do you like that somebody calling about Hazel Park about harness racing almost unheard of in this town?

[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.220]
Okay, where most people are deadheads like that guy that called before with this filthy uh, disgusting mouth

[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.300]
Oh, what do you like? What's more, you're always talking? Yeah, I'm not gonna ask holes like you is what I'm not because we got too many of men's world

[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.240]
That's what we got

[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.960]
I say youth and Asia, baby, that'd be a good place to send you

[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.480]
Oh, by the way, somebody was telling me George that you're right, which I hate to admit that people from the far east

[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.700]
Do not like being called Oriental's people from the Orient like to be called Asians

[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.280]
Yeah, that's that's exactly what was said because like Oriental is like a rug Oriental rugs Oriental

[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.460]
Trinkets anything Oriental chachkis like you know inanimate objects like the Chinese

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.080]
But the people they want to be called Asians. I was shocked when I found out

[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.240]
You were shocked. Well, I've been saying it all my life too calling them Oriental's yeah, and what about the

[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.260]
Jojita what do we call him just a little jab? Jojia. I guess it's good enough for him

[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.800]
That's good enough for him

[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.360]
What a piece of Drek he turned out to be just you know, he ought to be a Barker at a circus

[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.600]
Maybe he can be on the prices right

[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.340]
Because that's what he turned it into but we're not getting back into that again. Let's come on. Let's stop

[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.680]
Let's get away from it

[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.960]
Let's talk to somebody a Greek like Kostas. Hey Neil. How you doing? This ain't Bob Kostas is it? Nope

[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.880]
Okay, I don't want to talk to none of OJ's asshole buddies

[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.600]
So you're gonna be at the game tonight Kostas? You want like I told you I have to take care of some business with my dad

[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.660]
So I'm just gonna be on Friday night taking care of some business with your dad like during the game at night

[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.180]
Now what kind of business is gonna be like a some kind of a drug dealer something? What is that like late at night?

[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.760]
I told you I told you last time when I talked to you that he came to visit me

[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.680]
I haven't seen the guy for like two years. Yeah, he's a bit of four a week or two. Well, I'm sure he didn't enjoy

[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.740]
He'd love going to the hockey game. Yeah, he did man

[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.000]
He was just freaking out with the body check you couldn't believe how like brutal the game is

[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.540]
I mean, you know, he was like oh, I got to can't believe that lot of stuff like that

[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.300]
But like hey, that's the way the game is well of course being Greek

[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.360]
He probably figures it's hard for them to hold on to the soap. We get hit that

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.000]
Yeah, and bending over to right?

feel Henry is from there saying and he don't he don't want to be

[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:01.760]

that god spoke so much through so many people and through the hires up in the um in the hierarchy or

[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.660]
whatever but um never told them how much um a child abuse was going on there right underneath

[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.960]
their nose yeah and um how much uh children were being persecuted by the religious god yeah

[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.360]
sexual abuse and well you don't understand god don't have time for that because he's busy uh with

[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.320]
all these football games he's got a lot of football guys saying a lot of prayers he's got to respond

[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:42.560]
sexual abuse four or five times a week and by the um by the uppers in the in the hierarchy i mean

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:49.220]

[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:54.880]
the call and we'll see go ahead okay i'm on here we are i just i just had a i just had a quick comment

[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.820]
about the oj thing tonight about the what the oj thing what is that whatever's going to be on

[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:05.360]
in the oj thing is going to be out tonight the oj thing what i'll see that i have absolutely no

[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.880]
interest in it but what my what my husband had decided to do because he he's very upset about the

[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:17.060]
the verdicts etc right what he had decided to do was to go ahead and email mbc and ask them for

[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:22.400]
all the advertisers who are going to be advertising on the spot there are going to be any well

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.260]
apparently there were going to be and they're going for um they're going for about 650,000 for

[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.700]
however when i guess a thirty-second spot or whatever no where did you hear that he had heard that

[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.020]
on the news several days ago well it says right here there will be no commercials during the

[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.360]
outlawing interview and they also will not be uh boosting the rates during the hours before and

[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.520]
after the interview so i don't know where he heard that may that may have been the original idea

[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.800]
that they wanted to really seize upon it but i think they got so much bad publicity and fallout

[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:54.500]
they thought it might be a real bad idea well i would imagine so he did get a response that from

[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.380]
the email though saying that um they did not have a completed list yet but they provided with them

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.240]
as soon as it was completed in addition to which i think that everybody ran away from that thing

[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:08.100]
like uh it had the plague i would hope so because to me and somebody who's going to advertise number one

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:13.140]
is pretty unscrupulous but number two to pay the kind of price as they wanted or reportedly wanted

[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.260]
was kind of ridiculous so i was just going to encourage if there are any we didn't want to watch

[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.740]
the thing at all but if there are any um advertisers at all we just emailed and that way we cannot

[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.960]
give them our business anymore nor do we have to listen to the um the swill okay hang on

[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.640]
all right guarantee it won't be on insane Thomas yeah probably not hang on line six take care of that

[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.380]
our prize on there uh i got to uh make a trip uh real fast not to say Thomas but i think down

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.760]
those stairs what is it about that place there are certain restaurants where the food is really

[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.780]
good and tasty but within just a few minutes oh man i mean i am telling you this is going to be one

[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:51.000]
of the most outrageous things that ever happened to me in my life are you following me are you listening

[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.300]
i'm not exaggerating here i'm telling you exactly the way it is mr one oh nine at w i'd have

[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.800]
in the middle of an emergency and he's taken her name and dressed for this stupid thing we're doing

[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:07.540]
here's um a lady in corral springs hello nale yes ma'am hi first time caller great i just got to tell

[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:13.000]
you i am so in sense that mbc states that just because they and oj Simpson aren't going to

[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.940]
um

[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.020]
it made profit from the interview that they expect vindication you know and i think the whole

[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:25.440]
i think that by whom about what i don't know i heard it expressed that hey listen we're not making

[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.480]
any money so this is just something that we're doing and i'm saying the thing that i'm saying

[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.460]
let me let me say something okay and all with all the respect i understand what you're saying but

[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.660]
people don't watch networks okay they watch programs that they like right so if people watch

[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.280]
tom brokaw doing the news every night they may be pissed off about the fact he's a part of this uh

[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.080]
charade going on tonight but after a couple of days they'll still go back and watch tom brokaw

[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.100]
they may want you know you follow what i'm saying in other words people don't watch things based

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.140]
out whether they're on fox or they're on cbs they watch programs that they like

[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:05.400]
well that's true but i have to tell you as a rule i mean like i say first time caller even though

[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:11.540]
i've listened listen to lot it's not something that i usually do and yet i have been moved i'm

[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.140]
thinking yeah the mbc peacock you know that's how they're acting they're strutting around you know

[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.860]
showing all their feathers hey we got the first interview yeah and when i'm wondering you know

[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:26.900]
there's always this great race to be first on a story and why is it never considered that maybe

[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.900]
the scoop is not always a good thing yeah i mean it's every one you know what they're going to be

[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.860]
scooping us a lot of that you better believe it you know it reminds me of a dog chasing a car once

[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:41.180]
he catches it what the hell is he going to do with it oh no so no you know you got kady kirk and tom brokaw

[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:45.560]
and they're facing this white battering egotist who have no reaction will be sitting with the

[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.300]
johnny kakran on the sidelines the high five and you get it right and they provide a form for this

[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.400]
despicable human being and don't i understand don't have the wrong goal man and the culprits

[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.440]
john olmyer of mbc's going to be doing a camera's personal event to make sure that all the shots are

[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.960]
flattering and that they make him look good oh holy i don't think he has a flattering angle anymore

[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.780]

minus six is minus seven i know so what's the story that i'm sitting here just like all times the

[01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:36.670]

[01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:21.830]
just reiterating what you said i'm so tired of these excuse makers the first two years nobody

[01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:26.590]
again there last year we despised wain just as much as we do now and nobody used that as an excuse

[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:31.590]
and we came out and we filled up the arena 97 percent capacity and now all of a sudden everybody's

[01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:35.730]
got a good excuse isn't that great and this year we get the team that every we know we're faster

[01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.650]
we're quicker right there was more excitement in that calgary game sunday that then we saw

[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.850]
about any ten games put together last year sure was your hundred percent

[01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:46.990]
the right is roger nielsen crap it's an aggressive style that was just the one thing you know we

[01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:51.130]
did kind of uh we came back three two very quickly and then tried to sit on our laurels for

[01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:55.090]
a little bit and saw that a team like calgary even with their input in offense without auto and

[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.650]
new and dyke and yeah the rest of the guys thanks a lot feel how's like that was a nice past

[01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:02.730]
a jody hull baby did how's it getting the system at her well i believe it was nice yeah i believe

[01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:08.690]

Okay, let's go to a western on the purple line hello

[01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.450]
Hey, hello Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay?

[01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:50.330]
Listen, I was just listening to you guys

[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:55.250]
I know we almost are usually doing this time of day and across my mind that you know you mentioned a pencil

[01:09:55.250 --> 01:10:00.290]
The a pamphor and one have you but I have yet to see any real advertising form

[01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:03.490]
Are they leaving Florida or what I got news for a man they had

[01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:08.470]
Full page two page spreads in the Sun Sentinel and a herald on pick a seat day

[01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:13.630]
Which was about the week before the season started a couple of weeks before the season and they got no

[01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:18.570]
Responses at all and that cost them about 20 grand just for those two ads at least 20 or 30 grand

[01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:23.590]
You know you mentioned all the time and I know you guys I don't know what the deal is

[01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.090]
I mean everybody knows that the season has started. It's all over

[01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:31.570]
It's a wild course the game is on TV again to see I think what they ought to do is black out all the home games for the panthers

[01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:34.450]
I mean most places don't have to do that and that would be a shame

[01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:38.890]
But I think we may have to start doing that it could be that a whole thing is missing is some place

[01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:42.870]
The one who's anger who's missing is somewhere yeah now he'll be there

[01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:50.230]
He'll be shining his balls by you know that they got a guy there seriously at the hockey games because he sits

[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:53.970]
Not that far from for me. I have to see him down here is head is like a beacon shining in the dark

[01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:58.530]
And they got a guy that comes in between every every stopper to play and shines his ball spot

[01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.710]
Yeah, he's got like a little rag and he shines Wayne's ball spot

[01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:12.050]
To you if you can okay, I'd like to hear because I get up at like two o'clock in the morning. Yeah driving in

[01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:17.830]
I mean here the burby burby bank thing. I was disgusting. I don't know how to only stay on the show

[01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:21.990]
But I'm actually to hear some of your tapes at least but we're gonna keep up the date over you know

[01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:25.030]
We mean instead of the Glenn burp bank show that's what was yeah burpee

[01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:32.390]
Okay, we're gonna pound back. Yeah, okay. I'll suggest that to our program director one day when he sober. Oh, that's not gonna happen

[01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:38.090]
You got your Yankees and rads braves and Indians little college football here's some hockey over there

[01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.030]
Pat Riley says focus on the players not to coach. What does that all mean?

[01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:47.530]
Nothing until you say dolphins now you're talking dolphins on radio

[01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:13.710]
News talk and entertainment radio

[01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.710]
you

[01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:44.470]
Oh

[01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.930]
I

[01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:51.510]
She just said love for my high.

[01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:55.290]
She said she'd rather strap on her jeal door.

[01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:58.970]
Oh, really good.

[01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.750]
She's my dream girl, but it just can't be.

[01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:09.290]
Since I found out that she is lazy,

[01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:12.990]
She's not ready, she's a die.

[01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.970]
I have no pre-puse.

[01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:20.030]
That's about to happen.

[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.430]
She's coming back to never be a die.

[01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:40.190]
I would say that about to happen is to radio what the rest of the house is going on.

[01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:40.710]
I'm going to die.

[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.290]
153 at WIOD.

[01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:49.870]

[01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.850]
I had somebody change their resettity.

[01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.830]
Keter was asleep.

[01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.010]
But I'm afraid that food's going to go to the other day.

[01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.470]
What do you think?

[01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:10.070]
What are you talking about?

[01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.090]
How can there be a sweep?

[01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.830]
They just started.

[01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.990]
Today's Wednesday.

[01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.230]
Yeah, but the fifth game is going to be Sunday.

[01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.770]
It might not be a fifth game.

[01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:18.390]
Well, wait a minute.

[01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:19.930]
They're playing today.

[01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.930]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.030]
Is the second game.

[01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:24.230]
And Friday and Saturday is the third and fourth game.

[01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.570]
Yeah.

[01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:25.830]
You like Seattle?

[01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:27.350]
Oh, you think Seattle is going to sweep them?

[01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:28.350]
No, I don't want them.

[01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:29.510]
I'm going to Cleveland to watch Cleveland.

[01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.330]
No chance.

[01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:30.730]
They're not.

[01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:31.470]
Don't worry about it.

[01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:32.010]
Don't worry about it.

[01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:34.370]
The only other game Seattle win is the game Randy Johnson Pidge.

[01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:35.150]
Don't worry about it.

[01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:36.590]
Are you the ugliest thing you ever seen?

[01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.830]
What is it?

[01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:38.590]
Randy Johnson.

[01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.870]
Ugliest thing, but man, he sure can throw a thing.

[01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:42.150]
He can throw, but he needs to get like,

[01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:43.370]
don't got a chin construction.

[01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:44.630]
No, I'm going to go in there.

[01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:45.430]
He needs a body transplant.

[01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.570]
Yeah, hey, uh, speaking about that,

[01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.310]
do you see that, uh, state attorney for, uh,

[01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:52.910]
New Mexico ever that was that training collapse?

[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:53.410]
No.

[01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:54.330]
My name was Janet.

[01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:56.010]
There was a strong resemblance too.

[01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.630]
All right.

[01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:57.850]
Okay, let me call one person.

[01:14:58.090 --> 01:14:58.890]
Janet, yeah.

[01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:00.150]
Uh, Rick.

[01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:00.990]
Beep this.

[01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.590]
Okay.

[01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:02.130]
All right.

[01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:02.930]
Have a good time, Miguel.

[01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:03.450]
Get out of here.

[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:04.770]
Here is the Coral Springs.

[01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:05.090]
Hello.

[01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.610]
Hey, Neil.

[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:06.090]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:06.470]
How are you?

[01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:06.870]
Okay.

[01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:09.390]
I was just taking a look at the Panther broadcast.

[01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.810]
I think we're the only team in the NHL.

[01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:14.150]
We're three out of the four broadcasters are women.

[01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.810]
You have Elaine.

[01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:16.470]
You have Denise and Chris.

[01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.090]
I think Rimmer is the only man in that group.

[01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:20.150]
And believe me, it's only because of the mustache.

[01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:21.970]
It's the only way he can be sure with him.

[01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.410]
You've been hard on the rimman today, huh?

[01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:24.370]
Well, he deserves it.

[01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:26.330]
He's just always with his Dino sister really crap.

[01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:27.590]
We're all getting even with him now.

[01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:28.050]
Yeah.

[01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.370]
I am so sick and every time this man calls me,

[01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.890]
I see him at the goddamn arena.

[01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:33.790]
He brings me some, you know, he brings me this stuff

[01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.310]
with all the TV schedule for all the teams.

[01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.610]
Yeah.

[01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:36.270]
Which I appreciate.

[01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.590]
But in the meantime, why about I gotta hear about Dino's

[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.850]
thinking sister really already?

[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.250]
Yeah.

[01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.890]
If they want to, you know, go ahead.

[01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.070]
We won't tell anybody, but if I get out of my life with that little,

[01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:45.510]
he's about a hundred years old.

[01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:47.010]
I got, we don't need any more old fart.

[01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:48.170]
Oh, Rimmer or sister really?

[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:48.370]
Both.

[01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:48.770]
Oh.

[01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.590]
Hey, I love the rimman, but in closing, Neil, I'm running out of material.

[01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:54.070]
I was just thinking that Atkins diet.

[01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.490]
Yeah.

[01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:56.310]
I'm surprised QAM has an asked for it.

[01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:58.610]
It looks like they got about 900 pounds of radio

[01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:01.710]
between about 10 in the morning and about 6, 7 p.m.

[01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.230]
There you go.

[01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:04.570]
You got the sports bay weighing in at about 4, 10.

[01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.790]
Yeah.

[01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:05.730]
A lot of large ads.

[01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:05.830]
Right.

[01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:08.010]
About 400 and Goldberg, about 600.

[01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.750]
Good point.

[01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:09.130]
Right?

[01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.810]
That's the only reason they're losing money over there.

[01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:11.690]
It's not because of the ratings.

[01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.510]
It's because they can't afford to feed those bastards.

[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.110]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:14.810]
See you tonight, pal.

[01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:15.130]
Take care.

[01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:15.730]
Bye-bye.

[01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:16.770]
We're gonna see you guys tonight.

[01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:18.870]
If the arena come on, we're gonna see you tonight or what?

[01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.210]
Yes.

[01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.690]
All right.

[01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.550]
I'm gonna tell you I'm taking personal responsibility

[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.730]
for that crowd tonight.

[01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.110]
Okay.

[01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:27.030]
I'm not taking any more excuses.

[01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:29.090]
You can always tape that OJ thing.

[01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:31.410]
Then you'll have it on tape and you can watch it over and over

[01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.770]
and slow motion and freeze frame and replay.

[01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.410]
Okay.

[01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:35.890]
You can tape the damn thing.

[01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.250]
Everyone here's got a VCR.

[01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:42.630]
And if you don't know how to program it, just start it when you leave the house around 6 or 6.30 and let it roll.

[01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.730]
That tape will run on extended play for six hours, man.

[01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:47.890]
All the way through the midnight and then some.

[01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.950]
So don't give me no excuses.

[01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:55.590]
You got to stay home and see the interview of the century with a bonehead with a murderer of the century

[01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.870]
with the ass kissing network of the century.

[01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:00.790]
I'm telling you now they've just moved ahead of CNN and ass kissing.

[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.190]
I never thought it could be possible that it could happen.

[01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:07.330]
NBC, even a peacock is shedding feathers now.

[01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:09.090]
He's so goddamn embarrassed.

[01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.390]
Here's a sunrise.

[01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:11.790]
Hello.

[01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:13.890]
Sunrise.

[01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.710]
Neil, great show.

[01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:15.270]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:20.370]
I just came down here from Philadelphia and I was listening to you talk about the Panthers and up and

[01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:20.970]
I was just going to fill it off of you.

[01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:21.950]
The flyers and the Eagles.

[01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:27.910]
You can't get tickets for it but the Phillies and the Sixers, they can't give them away.

[01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:31.230]
And I think that's pretty much the way it's going to be down here.

[01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:32.070]
Well, why is that?

[01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:34.290]
The last two years the Panthers sold out almost every game.

[01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.070]
We had 90s to wait.

[01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:37.290]
One of the best tenants records in the ALEG.

[01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:38.650]
97% capacity.

[01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:40.210]
Well, I didn't realize that.

[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:42.090]
And we got a good young expansion team.

[01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.030]
The team got a new coach.

[01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:45.190]
We got more excitement, a little more offensive minded this year.

[01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:46.050]
We got an exciting team.

[01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.850]
They're no excuses.

[01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.870]
And by the way, man, this ain't no Philadelphia.

[01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:51.870]
Keep in mind the dolphins who up until Sunday were undefeated.

[01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:56.450]
Channel six had to buy up the last 2500 tickets to that game so it wouldn't be blacked out.

[01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.770]
How do you like that for a bogus sports town?

[01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.710]
Well, this is no sports town.

[01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:02.050]
This is a fantasy here.

[01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:04.670]
All the talk that everybody's saying about Super Bowl.

[01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:05.450]
Oh, yeah.

[01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.890]
They talk to you, man.

[01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:12.470]
And wait till you see that Rutgers, Hurricane, game now there's scaling it down to 40,000 or less for Saturday.

[01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:15.870]
I would say less would be a safe bet like is in a lot less.

[01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:17.890]
Like about 25,000.

[01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.770]
And guess why?

[01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:20.230]
Because they're having a crappy season.

[01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.170]
Well, whoop they do.

[01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.630]
Well, they're all fair weather.

[01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:23.410]
There you go.

[01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:24.150]
You got a man.

[01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:25.290]
You hit it right on a little push.

[01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:25.690]
Okay.

[01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:26.590]
Have a great day.

[01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:27.550]
See ya.

[01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:29.070]
Yeah, this is no sports town.

[01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:31.090]
We thought we had sandy claws.

[01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.230]
We thought he was going to hand it to us on a silver platter.

[01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:35.250]
He turned out to be a back stabbing asshole.

[01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:37.050]
And so now we got him as an excuse.

[01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.470]
Hey, by the way, Jennifer, I want to ask you a question.

[01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:42.690]
So anyway, seven.

[01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:45.070]
What?

[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.430]

[01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.670]
What is wrong?

[01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.550]
I just want to ask Jennifer a little question about that Luis Miguel concert on Friday and Saturday and Sunday.

[01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.090]
She's going to be there and et cetera.

[01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.850]
Huh?

[01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:57.730]
You're going to be there, Jennifer, or what?

[01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:59.390]
You coming to see Luis?

[01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:01.090]
Jennifer?

[01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:04.090]
How come you see that speaking of it?

[01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:06.270]
I hear Jackie's going to be here.

[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:11.270]
And one day, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

[01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:13.290]
Wednesday.

[01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.850]
The year and age of New York.

[01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:16.210]
The late one.

[01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.850]
I got a background.

[01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.130]
I'm sorry.

[01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:20.130]
It's not the same thing.

[01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.650]
It's not the same thing.

[01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:23.630]
Come on, Jennifer.

[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.110]
Okay, she's not speaking to me no more.

[01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.750]
Here's, well, I guess she doesn't know I got those naked Brad Pitt pictures.

[01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:37.250]
Not the ones.

[01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.450]
I'm not talking to ones off the internet.

[01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.930]
I'm talking about the real things.

[01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.210]
Big 8x10s glossy full color.

[01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.990]
Okay, sweetheart.

[01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.050]
Oh, she said she'll be right in.

[01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:46.550]
Here's the curl springs.

[01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.890]
Hello.

[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:48.030]
Hello.

[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.150]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:50.690]
Is this WIOD?

[01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:51.610]
This sounds like me.

[01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:52.450]
Oh.

[01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:54.190]
Hello.

[01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:54.850]
What's up?

[01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:56.290]
Turn that radio off, sweetheart.

[01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:57.730]
Oh, okay, sorry.

[01:19:58.090 --> 01:19:59.350]
How are you doing?

[01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:00.410]
Good.

[01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:01.250]
What did it?

[01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.110]
What did it say?

[01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:04.330]
Thank you again for the hockey tickets you gave me for Sunday night.

[01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.830]
Right.

[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.490]
And I tell you that I, that was my second hockey game.

[01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:09.270]
I had a great time.

[01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:10.170]
You're going to be there tonight?

[01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:11.910]
And I got tickets for tonight.

[01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:12.490]
All right.

[01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:13.730]
Now we're talking.

[01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:14.490]
Oh.

[01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.910]
Great.

[01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:16.850]
All right.

[01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:22.650]
So, um, in closing, I just want to call some rich and good in your juice bag.

[01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:24.070]
Okay, we'll see you tonight, sweetheart.

[01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:24.690]
See you tonight.

[01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:25.230]
Bye-bye.

[01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:26.110]
See you there you go.

[01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:28.410]
You can thank me for anybody who's going to be in those seats tonight.

[01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:30.010]
I won't be too many, but you can thank me.

[01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.630]
Give me all the credit, okay?

[01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:35.630]
Don't blame me for the 2000 empty seats that Jeff Moss calls in when the show is almost

[01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.850]
over.

[01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:38.550]
It says, well, we got the same empty seats today.

[01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:43.090]
We had yesterday and it evening for that because I'm sitting here trying to buy myself a new sport jacket,

[01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:48.110]
which by the way, Mr. coming from a fashion plate like me might not really be a bad idea.

[01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:50.550]
The only radio station.

[01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:51.870]
That's what I want to see.

[01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.150]
I don't want to see that.

[01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.090]
610 WIOD.

[01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:55.450]
Miami Ford Lutter Day.
