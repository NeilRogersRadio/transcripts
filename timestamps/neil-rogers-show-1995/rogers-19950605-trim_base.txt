[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]
Hey fat boy, go sell some spots and stop trolling for free lunches, okay?

[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.180]

[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.800]

In the wind, D-A-Y, as you see K-S.

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.580]
Everyone's been talking about one talk radio host for years.

[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.040]
Now, Broadway is singing about him too.

[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.680]
It's my fair living.

[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.980]
When shooting fans just aim right at their heads.

[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.380]
They're gonna get it.

[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.600]
My fair living, it's the touching story of a simple bald-headed macho man

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.300]
who gave up right wing obscurity for mainstream insanity.

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.160]
Well, I broke in at night, a water gate was right.

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380]
Cause it made my career.

[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.540]
My fair living, nobody who sees it, sees it the way she Gordon does.

[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.580]
This scares me.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.760]
I think he's crazy.

[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.140]
He's a plain and wacko.

[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.460]
My fair living, it's the new Broadway musical with the songs that are on everybody's lips.

[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.540]
I'm crazy not for from the ride.

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.960]
1007 at WIOD, happy Monday to him.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.440]
Man, oh man, oh man.

[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440]
First order of business today, we gotta get rid of buffo toads, baby.

[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.040]
When it starts raining like this, heavy duty and they start breeding.

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.580]
I got a problem like there's a lot kitty corner across from my house that's like an empty lot.

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.540]
That's got all kinds of melalucatries and cramping.

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.540]
It's like a goddamn swamp and water.

[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720]
And you can just hear the frogs croaking in there.

[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.600]
If you go up the street about a mile in the sunrise, your other thing is croaking all the time.

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.100]
More human sounds.

[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.060]
But seriously, they're like pouring out of there those goddamn buffo toads,

[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.180]
which ordinarily wouldn't cure except they're not too good for lunch for your dogs.

[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.740]
Now, I bet you somebody in this audience knows, is there some kind of stuff you can put out to kill those damn things?

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.860]
Like maybe a gigantic brush fire might do it.

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.440]
What the hell do you do to kill those goddamn things before they like and fetch your dogs?

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.800]
So anyway, yesterday morning, I'm out there at the saw grass like a noon.

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680]
Get in the car about five past noon.

[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.060]
Don't they open it noon on Sunday? I think so.

[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.020]
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm missing out on something.

[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.080]
But man, oh man, the traffic to that place yesterday,

[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.640]
you would have thought that they were given merchandise away.

[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.560]
You would have thought they were given away a hundred dollar bill with every purchase of anything over a dime.

[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.720]
That place is packed, packed.

[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.740]
And that's the number two tourist attraction, the whole goddamn state.

[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.620]
What's going on there?

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.460]
Not much.

[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.140]
I go into that bookstop, that book's a million, whatever, and how that store is in there.

[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.340]
And it's okay, it's big.

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.640]
And the store too.

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.000]
And wander around, there's suds in there with his wife going through the little people section.

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.900]
And you know, all of a sudden it dawned on me.

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.840]
This is what excitement is about at this time of the year in this town.

[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.920]
Or maybe at any time of the year is a little trip to the saw grass.

[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.080]
Now, everybody in this audience denies that they're ever going to the saw grass.

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.500]
I've asked about that a million times.

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.260]
Nobody in the audience admits it.

[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.740]
But I'm sitting there in the food court having my sorbet from Hagen Dazs.

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.880]
Instead of that awful watery ice cream that they pedal.

[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.340]
And like four people came up.

[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.480]
Oh, and one guy comes up with his little kid who's about like five days old or something like that.

[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.380]
Oh, David, here's the most famous man in the whole mall.

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.220]
Yeah, good guy, but just stay away with those pretty little kids.

[00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.440]
Okay? That's start drooling all over you and like do doing in their stuff while you're sitting there trying to have your sorbet.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.560]
It's a little bit unsettling for the appetite.

[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.600]
Rocky Etcheveria are a good close personal friend.

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.720]
I guess we're not going to be able to retire thanks to him.

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.880]
Kate Pasa starred the clearest bankruptcy.

[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.700]
So it says here in Joan Fleischman's yet to column in the heraldous morning.

[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.600]
Gone belly up.

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.540]
Would you like to see Rocky Etcheveria belly up?

[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.860]
Not at this stage. You're looking a little longer to the tooth, Stevie.

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.540]
He's gone belly up actor Stephen Bauer under his given name Estaman Etcheveria.

[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.300]
He filed chapter seven in US bankruptcy court.

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.240]
Bauer is just he's only a million and a half dollars in the red.

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.760]
Oh, don't say red. Come on.

[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.020]
He's that come on. He's to that's bad.

[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.400]
Don't say red when you're talking about a kid from higher.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.040]
Leia Lloyd's of London says he owes five hundred and twenty thousand dollars for an insurance payoff after he backed out of a movie.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.520]
The last pie's on.

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.720]
It's lawyer say he had a drug and alcohol addiction.

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:10.820]
Among his creditors and goes on and lists lawyers and the banks and this and that Bauer list assets of thirty three thousand two hundred dollars including a thirty two thousand dollar screen actors guild pension plan a two hundred dollar bank account.

[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.720]
Two guitars and stereo equipment worth seven hundred dollars.

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.560]
What a shame.

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.780]
Good guy but they all Johnny Depp used to be a good guy too.

[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.380]
Remember that back in the old days in Miramar.

[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:34.340]
All of these people used to be good guys and all of you are jealous because they got famous and made millions of dollars and now they're all broke either that or they're running around bustin up motel rooms getting into big ass trouble and doing lots of drugs and ruining their lives and other people's too.

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.920]
Had a great time on the mandature last night and found out from the real producer with that show that it was lit at a little Andy Calb that started all that to these pot fan crap.

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.040]
Andy you are seriously the biggest pain in the ass I've ever seen in my life this kid is the most you talk about a people on a power trip.

[00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.000]
Little people are almost all of them to go on power trips they want to run the goddamn world and Andy Calb is a perfect example of that.

[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.160]
In fact when at the winter book came out he said to Phil Henry said man I had a great book.

[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.460]
He was he was taking all the credit for the book.

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.920]
That's a little Andy but anyway we still had a good time on that show.

[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.960]
Manage I noticed was really eyeing those two young dolphin prospects in fact he made the comment during the break he said boy those guys look really good.

[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.480]
And I said how about a quick shower to cool off man it's court court there you go.

[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.460]
Here's a lady in Davie she's gone.

[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.100]
The lady in Davie is already gone our first call of the day she had the right and she had frog advice but she's already gone.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:47.420]
The last number that called your line was 305 424 7548.

[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.740]
These people let if you don't get to them right away like within 20 seconds.

[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.420]
And now she's not answering the phone.

[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.020]
I put her on the head everybody put her on the head everybody.

[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.660]
Hello what happened hello.

[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:13.760]
Hello.

[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.420]
That wasn't her.

[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.480]
So what does that mean if that wasn't her maybe another call came in and then just hung up and that's who this person was.

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.020]
This old bitch perhaps I'm just speculating.

[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.880]
I don't think so.

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.040]
She was a young bitch.

[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.160]
Another bitch okay anyway somebody out there will have the information to hell with that old bag.

[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.220]
Like I said if we don't get to them within 20 seconds immediately drop everything well we can't hold on more than like that.

[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.840]
That's as long as we're going to hang on it's just not important enough to us.

[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.080]
That's okay guess what you're calling that important to me either okay.

[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.440]
Here's Miami hello.

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.720]
Yes Neil good morning.

[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.480]
Yes sir.

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.580]
Listen about the problem with the Danny bought a Foucault frog.

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.100]
Yes.

[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.840]
Listen I've seen because I had a problem with that every time a rain it would come out from everywhere.

[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.140]
Mothballs.

[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.060]
Mothballs do what?

[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.860]
You put them in the container and that'll take care of them.

[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.780]
Bye bye baby.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.900]
Yeah but how do you like it isn't there something you've been a little bold and you said them around the perimeter.

[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.960]
But you're not listening to me.

[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.360]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.160]
You put them in a little bowl and you set them out around the perimeter of what of the yard.

[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.160]
Of yeah your house.

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.640]
So in other words if I go out and buy $4,000 worth of mothballs that'll solve the problem.

[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.060]
No you need about $5,000.

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.980]
That'll keep them away.

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.100]
Yeah it worked for us.

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.580]
Okay.

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.760]
Okay great.

[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.000]
Okay there's a man in a lot of pain so that's the answer is mothballs for all you people with the Bufo Toads

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.080]
and you people with your dogs I don't know about cats.

[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.840]
I have no idea maybe cats I don't our cats totalickers.

[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.080]
Cats don't like to get high but dogs are very much into that and of course they become addicted to it and especially little ones like my minpin.

[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.320]
So like I said I think that maybe in the next couple of weeks I'll have one dog.

[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.120]
Here's Miami hello.

[00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.040]

[00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.800]
Good.

[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.940]
Two things one on the guy on the mothballs.

[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:16.000]
Yeah well if you find them instead of putting them in the moth as far as the balls you kind of spread them around you kind of powder them and just dust it.

[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.880]
I mean you're not really crunchy.

[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.740]
You dust what?

[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.240]
With the mothballs.

[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.920]
You just put them in the areas where they're at but the problem with the mothballs.

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.480]
What do you mean with the areas I have a third of an acre of a yard?

[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.120]
Oh so you got a problem.

[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.820]
Yeah I got a problem that's right.

[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.580]
But the thing is also the mothballs when it rains especially the way it's been raining.

[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.380]
Yeah they lose their effect real fast.

[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.160]
Right it washes all away and it's yeah it's an exercise but forget about it.

[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.960]
The thing is that I know for a fact that you can kill them with salt.

[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.260]
Just throw salt on them.

[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.680]
I've always been told chlorox.

[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.440]
Well salt will do the trick they'll blow up.

[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:49.900]
Really?

[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.440]
Oh that sounds promising.

[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.340]
Yeah see the problem with me is I go out there and I catch you.

[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.720]
I have a towel sitting back on the patio and anytime I see one in fact I got about six of them over the weekend.

[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.840]
You pick them up and I throw them a heave them over the fence out on the street.

[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.060]
I make sure I don't throw them over the neighbor's fence because I got a neighbor with a dog too.

[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.380]
Right.

[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.040]
So I throw them out on the street because what else are you going to do with it?

[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.260]
You can't flush them down the toilet because I did that once in my house in Jacaranda

[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.460]
and it wound up clogging up the whole guy them thing.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.800]
Yeah they will blow up with salt and when we were little when I grew up in California

[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.960]
I was gonna have to be like kosher salt or just mortin salt.

[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.860]
Any kind of salt.

[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.500]
And regular salt.

[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.500]
Just plain old salt.

[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.120]
Yeah well we were little we used to catch them in California and put them in shoe boxes.

[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.600]
Yeah.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.320]
Put about four or five crackers in there.

[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.300]
Just put the lid back on with tape and just blushing blow.

[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.820]
Beauty.

[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.860]
I tell you but the salt will work.

[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.340]
Okay.

[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:42.920]
Thank you.

[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.120]
I'm on my way to the store right now.

[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.420]
Okay.

[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.380]
751 WIWD.

[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.420]
Anyway then we are over the weekend to Panthers announces unconscionable ticket price increase.

[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.560]
Unconscionable.

[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.400]
Then of course Mandage is trying to say last night he's trying to give me a song and dance about

[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.160]
Well it's still below the league average because he read that in the paper.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.220]
Doesn't make any difference.

[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.480]
If you go back to the first season until next season they started with the seats that I've got which fortunately I don't have to pay for.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.640]
31 dollars.

[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.720]
Then last year they went to 38 dollars.

[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.500]
Now they're gonna be 45 dollars.

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.500]
So in two seasons they've gone from 31 to 45.

[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.900]
That's a 14 dollar increase that's almost 50% for a team that didn't make the playoffs the first two years because we got a stupid coach

[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.940]
and an owner that don't want to spend any money for any real players.

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.780]
And they increase just like the same thing that happened with the heat.

[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:36.300]
And this is the same guy who said, oh even if we have the scrap the scrap players in baseball we'll still average 16,000 people

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.720]
of game out there to Robby Stadium.

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.820]
Well guess what I know was a rainy day yesterday with that 18,000 with the real players and their 19th loss of the sea or whatever the hell it was.

[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.080]
They're 85th loss of the season.

[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.140]
They're 400th loss whatever the hell it was.

[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.860]
It's only the 5th of June and they're already 75,000 games under 500 and mathematically out eliminated.

[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.260]
Speaking of the Marlins by the way the most bush league thing I have ever heard next to the morning show on QA in this morning.

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.460]
That was the most bush league thing.

[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.280]
And blue lips, Rimmer, he was the pivot man with those two kids they got with the two 10 year old kids they got on the year.

[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.620]
What kind of a show is that, Rimmer?

[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.940]
If you had any self respect man you'd tell them to shove that damn place.

[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.280]
What a joke that is.

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.640]
They got 10 year old kids on there doing sports shows.

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.160]
Oh boy how about the dolphins?

[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.340]
They're going to win this Super Bowl.

[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.520]
Oh I think you're right.

[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.960]
Anybody think so?

[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.620]
But the most bush league thing I've ever heard in my life was from Joe Angel.

[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.880]
The most overrated everybody in this town.

[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.200]
I guess it's because Chris Moore is on the year doing hockey and we got so many bad announces like Zimfer.

[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.140]
I don't want to mention his name.

[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.800]
But Joe Angel it was Friday night.

[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.500]
The game was just ending.

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.080]
Was it Friday or Saturday?

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.300]
The game that they won.

[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.800]
Was that the one they won?

[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.760]
Did you hear it?

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.880]
The Cubs lose the Cubs.

[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.520]
Oh my god and so here's the third out.

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.740]
I forget it was a strikeout.

[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.420]
Whatever the hell it was.

[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.780]
And he says as usual, put it in the wind column.

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.460]
You know that fake.

[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.660]
And then he stops and goes into this.

[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.880]
Cubs lose, Cubs lose, Cubs lose.

[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.880]
Holy cow.

[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.600]
This man wants to be John Miller so bad.

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.840]
Which quite frankly I don't know why anybody might be John Miller because he's fat and the pain in the ass.

[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.640]
And wants to be a sit down comic instead of a baseball announcer.

[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.320]
And couldn't lick a Mel Proctor or Chuck Thompson's ass.

[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.540]
John Miller.

[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.900]
But Joe Angel is no more than just a wannabe.

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.920]
Joe I hope you're listening man because I know you do listen to the show and so does his buddy O'Brien even when he's on the air.

[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.620]
That was to me the most bush league the most outrageous, the most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.160]
I think this guy even when he has sex with his wife or whoever it might be.

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.120]
I think he's fake and the orgasm is so fake.

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.240]
Everything he does is fake.

[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.160]
Anyway it's 10.19 at your real station as in really obnoxious W.I.O.D.

[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.680]
At night when the lights are dimmed there's passion on 6.10 W.I.O.D.

[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.960]
Hey Aaron.

[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.480]
Hey guys.

[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.360]
I ain't listen.

[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.680]
He shows you too.

[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.140]
I've not got to say this for sure.

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.380]
So educational and exciting and stimulating.

[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.720]
All of this wrapped into one covered in chocolate.

[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.880]
It's like Barbara Walpers on Spanish fly.

[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.920]
Passion zones with Aaron Summers.

[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.240]
8 PM till midnight.

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.560]
On news talking entertainment radio.

[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.940]
6.10 W.I.O.D.

[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.200]
And W.I.O.D.

[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.000]
South Florida swears by us.

[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.320]
Or is that at us?

[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.960]
Well really so Denise Pothin also made a comment that when he heard I was going to be on the sports crap thing with managed last night he wouldn't come on.

[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.440]
Well the feeling is mutual okay.

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.880]
A loud ass fat mouth.

[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.360]
Anyway 10.22 now I don't know how many people out there.

[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.380]
I'm not going to get into a big hockey thing because I think New Jersey is going to win the whole goddamn thing now.

[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.640]
That's very depressing because they're boring in their style of play ought to be banned.

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.560]
It's depressing.

[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.080]
Especially that guy.

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.700]
I'm old clod of the mule man.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.160]
He makes me nauseous and other frog.

[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:54.020]
But yesterday at the end of the Detroit Chicago game and unfortunately last night we didn't have that highlight on 33.

[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.640]
But at the end of the game I mean there's like two and a half seconds left.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800]
The game is basically over.

[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.560]
Tony Amade just desperately out of his own zone.

[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.620]
160 feet just shoots it down the ice.

[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.660]
And here's this maniac Mike Vernon the gold tender for the Red Wings.

[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.400]
He's already you know at the end of the game when the team wins the goalie starts skating out of his crease and then he puts his arms up in the air.

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.980]
You know victory and the teammates come in a kiss and they grab a little ass and whatever.

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:27.200]
Well he's like starting to do this already then in the paper this morning I'm reading he says well he didn't couldn't see it then the reached for it.

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.180]
Yeah right that's why I know that if I was a goalie and I had a one goal lead with about two seconds left in the game.

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.560]
I'd come way out of the crease there way out of the net to cut down the angle on 160 foot shot right Mike you bull crapper.

[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.220]
Can we say that they said the effort yesterday on Phil show so I guess we can say bull crap.

[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.060]
But anyway and so it hits the post and they showed the replay over and over again it was like 0.5 a half a second left.

[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.020]
They would have counted if what had gone in they'd have been given him the old octopus.

[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.180]
If that thing would have gone in there they could still be playing that was one of the most irresponsible pieces.

[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.100]
I've ever seen in my life here's a lady in Margate hello.

[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.440]
Hey yeah.

[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.760]
Yes ma'am.

[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.620]
Any tear of ice.

[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.100]
Okay.

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:10.080]
I want to get a tattoo that says that has SS and then my social security number on it.

[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]
Why do you want to get a tattoo?

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.340]
Well I have other tattoos.

[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.040]
Why?

[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.820]
Because like.

[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.000]
Do you enjoy defacing your body? Do you have a grotesque body?

[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.080]
No no I mean I like it looks alright.

[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.600]
Yeah.

[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.920]
No but like some people that I know they say they'd be like kill a fence it.

[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.060]
What do you think?

[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.760]
It would be too offensive to do what?

[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.160]
To get like SS tattooed on my arm.

[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:35.660]
Yeah.

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.540]
With my social security number.

[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.560]
But I think it'd be like kind of like a skinhead or something.

[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.100]
No I don't like a Nazi at all.

[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.880]
Do you have knee boots?

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.700]
Do you have hip boots?

[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:44.740]
Yeah.

[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.420]
Yeah.

[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.220]
Now we're starting to get to the bottom of it yeah.

[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.240]
Well you met me before.

[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.240]
Who are you?

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.040]
I'm Cindy.

[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.400]
I met you at the hockey game one time.

[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.680]
Cindy from the hockey game.

[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.800]
Sure I believe it.

[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.600]
Yeah I got like earring in my nose.

[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.100]
I met Stephen Bauer at the hockey game too and he just went bankrupt so I'd watch it Cindy.

[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.320]
See it probably wouldn't be the best idea to get forget about the SS to get the social security number tattooed on the thing.

[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.000]
Because then people will find out your name and they'll start using your social security number

[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.740]
and getting into your credit card accounts and your bank account.

[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.260]
Really?

[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.100]
And oh yeah.

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.360]
Yeah I didn't think of that.

[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:17.720]
Yeah.

[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.640]
So why do you want to put it on there just because you have a bad memory or what?

[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.560]
No no.

[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.980]
Like a Stephen like being number.

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.200]
Like a what?

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.140]
Like being.

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.560]
Like an ID number.

[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.040]
Yeah.

[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.480]
Yeah just to...

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.380]
Because you have to use it.

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.260]
And then you want to hang around on South Beach where all the Holocaust survivors are right?

[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.120]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.940]
You're sick Cindy.

[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.680]
You're sick.

[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.880]
No no I'm not.

[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.620]
No I'm not really.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.160]
Okay well come on by and show it to us when you get it done okay sweetheart.

[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.040]
Okay let me tell somebody a dish bag.

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.300]
Yeah.

[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.100]
I want to call whoever stole my dog chain at the outspin concert of flaming dish bag.

[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.680]
Okay Cindy.

[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.360]
Alright thanks.

[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.380]
See a bottom's up.

[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.360]
We have an open line of Broward 5249463.

[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.180]
I sound like nasal again like it on the Friday.

[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:54.900]
Don't I a little bit?

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:55.940]
Not as bad.

[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.600]
I don't feel nasal.

[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.240]
No there's nothing in there.

[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.680]
Not in there either.

[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.020]
Here's the sunny Isles.

[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.220]
Hello.

[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.500]
Sunny Isles.

[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.100]
Hello yeah.

[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:05.780]
Yes sir.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.940]
Hey about the...

[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.660]
The Buford Frogs.

[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:08.900]
Yeah.

[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.480]
Okay.

[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.700]
What are we going to do about the frogs?

[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.660]
I put a big sign up that said frogs go home didn't work yet.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.160]
Well it's been to what kind of frog you got two kinds of frogs.

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.780]
You got the French Canadian frogs and you got the frogs and hop around in your yard.

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.180]
Well both of them can be easily taken care of.

[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.500]
Yes.

[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.360]
Do you have like a little compost area?

[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.360]
A little compost area?

[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:26.780]
Right.

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.440]
Like when you throw all your fruits and vegetables to the decompose?

[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.040]
Not really.

[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.800]
I haven't been throwing away too many fruits or vegetables lately.

[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.260]
Okay well or a pile of leaves where you can find a whole bunch of earthworms under.

[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.980]
You make rat poison with it when they go to eat the ones that they need to be poisoned.

[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.520]
Yeah that would be a real good idea with two dogs in it back here.

[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.900]
It starts spreading rat poison around.

[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.300]
Oh no.

[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.760]
Those want to eat the rat poison?

[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.660]
They won't.

[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.080]
No if you mix it with the compost with the worms.

[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.460]
The worms and the rat poison will be...

[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.320]
I'm going to mix compost and worms in rat poison in my yard.

[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.980]
That sounds real appetizing.

[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.040]
Sure well the frogs love it.

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.360]
Yeah.

[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.600]
But they want to eat it they die.

[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.120]
Alright.

[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.200]
Thanks a lot.

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.240]
Come on over for lunch pal.

[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.860]
We have an open line of dates.

[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.780]
This is the kind of stuff that this audience sinks their teeth into baby.

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.000]
Let's have some compost and rotten fruits and vegetables and a bunch of rat poison.

[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.380]
Alright.

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.840]
And let's feed that to our management.

[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.680]
Sounds good to me.

[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.520]
And maybe the sales department like Fat Boy.

[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.720]
He's always looking for a free meal.

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.000]
If I could tell you seriously the regular listeners to this radio station would pee their pantaloonies.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.400]
If they could hear the a call that he made to George just before we started today.

[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.680]
We're not having no lunch in here this week.

[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.880]
Between now and the Vegas trip.

[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:31.980]
I know you're smiling.

[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.340]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.140]
I get on that scale in the morning now and it says tilt and little bills start going off.

[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.780]
I'm fat too.

[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.100]
Yeah.

[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.000]
We're all fat.

[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.740]
And Fat Boy that's all he wants to do is share his fat with the rest of the world.

[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.720]
Just remember one thing I've told you for a long time.

[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.160]
Fat people what they want to do is share the fat.

[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.600]
They want everybody else to be as fat or maybe even fatter than they are.

[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.020]
Then they feel better about life.

[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.880]
Here's a pompano.

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.160]
Hello.

[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:56.580]
Neil.

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.140]
Yes sir.

[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.560]
What's up guys.

[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.080]
How you doing?

[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.820]
I saw you on a sports trip last night.

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.320]
And I thought it was funny man when you read Mandage.

[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.020]
About the shul on the shower.

[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.400]
Yeah.

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.940]
He kind of skipped over it at the beginning when he started talking about shul.

[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.900]
We already know how you feel about that.

[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.120]
Yeah.

[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.280]
And then of course he had Eric Reed there who's not a bad guy but just the consummate shul.

[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.580]
You know just a real butt sucker.

[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.200]
And you know I mean you're never going to get any objectivity from Mandage about Shulah or Marino.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.040]
Those are the two guys that Mandage can never be objective about.

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.500]
Because he's showered with one of them a lot and I think he would like to with the other one.

[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.180]
Yeah it's him like you were the only one being objective.

[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.820]
There you go.

[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.760]
You want the truth come to me pal.

[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.540]
You want BS go to those sports guys.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.980]
How is he off the air is he like come on don't lay into me.

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.340]
What is it?

[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.700]
No no he loves it.

[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.580]
Yeah he likes it.

[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.160]
He's a good guy.

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.940]
The boost is he going.

[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.680]
Yeah exactly.

[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:40.920]
All right.

[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.960]
Hey if you got a chance today can you get that officer Prince Carnar?

[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.660]
No problem.

[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.100]
All right buddy.

[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:45.900]
Have a great day pal.

[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.520]
See ya.

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.680]
Open line at day 751 WIOD.

[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.960]
We have two open lines in Broward 5249463.

[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.420]
Don't forget the old passion bone tonight from eight to midnight here on WIOD.

[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.860]
I think that show is taking off like like hot tamales in the Tel Aviv man.

[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.040]
It's just really something.

[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.760]
I can't put my finger on it.

[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.820]
Here's coconut creek.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.220]
Hello.

[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.240]
Neil.

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:05.880]
Yes sir.

[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.080]
I need some help.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.380]
Yeah.

[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.160]
I'm interested in buying one of the you know the RCA dishes.

[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.680]
I've been to two different stores.

[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.640]
One brand smart said oh yeah absolutely no problems.

[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.120]
These I have to put it underneath the screening closure because I'm living a townhouse.

[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.560]
I went to Sears.

[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.460]
Guys that's absolutely not.

[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.880]
You're wasting your time.

[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.080]
So there's two two.

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.660]
You're wasting your time with what?

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.360]
To put the dish up because he they one guy says it won't transmit through the screening closure

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.440]
with the fiberglass screen and the other guys from brands mark.

[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.460]
Oh yeah no problem.

[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.460]
We do it all the time.

[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.760]
You know they're both closely experienced you know installers.

[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.060]
Who do you believe?

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.520]
You know they're the same price.

[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.320]
I mean there's nothing there's no waiver there.

[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.860]
You have a fiberglass screen?

[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.860]
Yeah I mean it's a metal screen enclosure with fiberglass panels.

[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400]
And I have to stay underneath that.

[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:59.280]
I can't you know because it's a townhouse situation I can't get a variant to go outside of it.

[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.320]
Well I'll wait I'll wait for somebody to call in but I just my feeling is about the small dish.

[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.860]
I just can't see how based on what happens when it rains real heavy which it went out for about four minutes on Saturday.

[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.040]
I don't think it would do the transmit I think they're right.

[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.960]
The other that was the other question I had is.

[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.500]
But but but again you know I don't see why somebody would want to sell it to you because they're going to install it.

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.080]
And if they're going to install it you know you're going to be sitting there and watching them when they when they find tune it in and get you the picture.

[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:29.300]
And if there's no picture what would be there what what motivation would they have to put it in if you're not going to get a picture.

[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.740]
Right you're not going to write them a check when they want to put it away.

[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.080]
Exactly.

[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.540]
Yeah I pretty I also mean those call in.

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.660]
I really want to you know want to get the setup for you know football season all that.

[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:38.860]
Right.

[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.180]
And the other thing you mentioned you just brushed on too is the rain.

[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.340]
Is that a that is a bigger big factor?

[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.740]
Well no it's not a big factor.

[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:52.700]
I would say over the entire weekend as much as I watched it it went out on Saturday morning for about three or four minutes.

[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.880]
Saturday about 1025 in the morning when it really started when it just started coming down all hell broke loose.

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.580]
It went out for three or four minutes and that was it and just as searching for signal and the screen goes blank and it came back on again.

[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.160]
Okay.

[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.000]
And as much as it rained all the rest of the weekend I never never lost a picture again.

[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400]
All right you're the greatest.

[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.000]
Okay pal.

[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.960]
I'll see you.

[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:19.900]
So if anybody out there's got a the small dish they got a little one and it's they got a screen in front of it and the picture was coming through or not coming through or maybe they just have a little one near upset about it.

[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:25.180]
We have an open line in day 751 one on a purple line at pound IOD it's 1031 at WIOD.

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.740]

Okay 1035 at WIOD happy Monday to you and what can I tell you man it's just going to be we got a week and a half to go to Vegas.

[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.600]
That's the one thing that really keeps my adrenaline flowing and keeps me going.

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.360]
I do a rickia was talking about this morning I do have a big drawer full.

[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:10.320]
No not a drawer full of that I have a drawer full of tickets plane tickets for here and for there and for all over the goddamn world.

[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:18.680]
And that's you know you look ahead and you keep looking at the counter it's only like 25 days till here and 10 days until there and pretty sad commentary but that's the way it is.

[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.620]
It's nice and warm but then when it rains you say well this ain't so great after all you know what I'm saying.

[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.860]
Here's Kendall hello.

[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.060]
Good morning Neil.

[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.700]
When is this how are you sir great good I came upon a situation that could take care of your boot food frogs in a second.

[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.180]
Okay my dog used to dig out of my yard I put up a phyto shock fence.

[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.540]
I have fried boofoo toes on this thing daily really.

[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:47.440]
Oh yeah I did this just keep my dog in the yard I used a four inch quarter inch mesh going all the way around the perimeter my back property.

[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.240]
I don't know if you have a wood fence yeah I have a big wood fence what I did is I attached it to the wood fence all the way around the perimeter.

[00:24:53.620 --> 00:25:00.460]
And when the frog keep it about an inch off the ground right once they jump and go underneath the fence they hit it you have fried boofoo daily beauty.

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:07.440]
I'm telling you it works and if you want to cook it but doing your favorite don't touch it the supper will go in your heart too.

What do you mean by that?

[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.300]
Well what I'm saying is you know keep the dogs in and once they touch it it's all.

[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.260]
No you mean don't touch the thing I see what you're saying.

[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.560]
That's what I'm saying you touch that because I touch it myself.

[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.440]
And what about if the dogs touch it?

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.180]
You want to see a double back flip?

[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:23.820]

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.880]
How about a little of fried min pin and a little fried boofoo for lunch?

[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.780]
We have an open line in day at 751 two and brown.

[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.620]
So when we're getting back to this thing with the panthers you know I'll go because I get my tickets for free so what the hell do I care?

[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.060]
And I guess if I was paying I would go to because I'm big enough of a fan and there's nothing else to do in this town.

[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.460]
But you know here's this big sob story Esther and Blade Runner girl she sends me this fact.

[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.200]
She says as opposed you haven't seen this yet which I haven't.

[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.660]
PS go red wing she says oh that's right I forgot about her Stevie I's herman crush.

[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:10.300]
And here's the letter dear Esther we want to express our sincere thanks for the undying support you have demonstrated over the past two seasons.

[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:16.420]
Your quick acceptance of our franchise has been remarkable and in our opinion makes you one of the most supportive groups.

[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.980]
Esther is a group.

[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.380]
I know she's a little chunky but what does that mean in the entire NHL?

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.700]
Oh I see they're talking about the fans as a group.

[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.620]
Through your commitment you've helped the panthers feel Miami-Rain to 97% of its capacity.

[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.700]
That's the good news. Now here's the bad news.

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.580]
And I still say what I said on sports crap last night that that whole thing about threatening we're going to pick up and move if you don't build us an arena.

[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.900]
And say that was just a little game plan a little psychology there to soften you people up for the fact that guess what we're goosing the prices up again.

[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:55.440]
The good news is hey we're staying here Wayne's got a commitment to keep your hockey team you're going to keep them but the bad news is you're going to pay through the hose baby.

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:06.820]
And the letter goes on to say however the unfortunate reality is the fact that even when we fill the house we still fall way short of breaking even financially and Wayne's only worth 900 million this year.

[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:16.340]
To be perfectly candid are operating cash losses a year ago were 4 million and this past season will reach 7 million even while reducing our non-team operating expenses by 5%.

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:30.880]
And it goes on about the a small seating capacity and the TV revenue is very limited and who the hell wants to see Denise pot fan talking crap anyway and yada yada yada and therefore all the above facts only underscore our desperate need for a new facility.

[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:42.240]
A facility in which the panthers can equitably share in all the revenue streams and one which has a larger seating capacity clubs seats sweets bop bop at that time only then will be more successful in holding down ticket increases.

[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:49.900]
Now there is when we build a we're not going to give you no money back and cut the prices back but we'll be holding down future increases and you won't have to pay more than 100 bucks to sit in the upper deck.

[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:58.240]
However until we do play in a new facility it is our objective to continue making your visit to the arena very enjoyable experience except for eating that trash food.

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:06.140]
We'll continue our efforts to improve our on ice product as we build a team which will continue to hustle and put it all on the line for you each and every night.

[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:20.900]
And so there you go and like I said you know it's going to be interesting to see how much resistance there's going to be and if enough people stop buying I don't know it's hard to say.

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:28.820]
It's hard to say I say if they fire Roger Nielsen's ass and they signed a couple of real players that might more than compensate for the offset the crappy ticket prices.

[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.400]
But we'll see if that's going to happen because I have my doubts.

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:40.420]
Here's the curl springs. Hello. Okay. The way you get rid of frogs is right after the rains when it's nice and wet. You hop on your lawn mower and you just mulch them all up.

[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.180]
And if that doesn't get rid of them all you just add 15% of the tab and rest of the frogs will leave too.

[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:55.240]
Okay. Hop on it is what he said. I'm hopping on my lawnmower right now baby. I'm riding it this afternoon. I'm going to ride it all over the goddamn place and the lawnmower too. How do you like that? You jackass.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:07.420]
All the brow lines just opened up there. Actually I thought we were going to have a show here. I really had my doubts when I sat down based on what I heard on the on the worst team this morning and then why I saw on Rick's phone which looked like somebody'd yank the cord and the phone too.

[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:25.160]
But now I have my doubts. 5249463524 w. I. O. D. in Broward County this morning is anybody out there. Is there anybody who's not at the saw grass? Is there anybody out there who also thinks that the ice cream at Hogan does is too watery in the saw grass mall and something ought to be done about it like right now.

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:37.540]
They have what the hell is that flavor that I really like preling something or other. Oh no it's macadamia not oh man do I love that and I've had that there a couple of times and it's watery.

[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:45.180]
You can actually see like the liquid. I'm not talking about when it starts melting which I do like that but I'm talking about when they put it right in the cup out of the big thing.

[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:56.240]
You can see the liquid it's watery. It's like somebody is watering that baby down man and when you think of Hogan does you don't think of water. I wonder what Nicole thought about it.

[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:02.340]
See if you would only gone to Hogan does instead of Ben and Jerry's that bitch might be alive right now. Here's a mobile in four lot of day. Hello.

[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:10.680]
Hey Neil. Yes sir. You haven't looked that good on TV since the days of Channel 51. Yeah. Only this is at a time when a few people were awake. I hope.

[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:19.620]
Hey you wouldn't believe how many people were up at three o'clock in the morning watching you there when on TV went off. Yeah. Five or six watching the four no movie with the squiggly lines.

[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:29.240]
Right. That's right. Mm hmm. On an unrelated note have you seen that still on movie the specialist. No I have not nor would I ever under any circumstance. Why is that?

[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:36.860]
Because Caprita has a giant role in that movie. Yeah. Well I'm happy for you about that. I'm happy I'm happy for him but I would not see a movie with sliced alone in it.

[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:46.580]
Oh I mean it was a terrible movie. Well I don't need to see Caprita in the movie. I've seen him enough. You know like in real life and I'm sure he'll be back here in a couple of months with his tail between his leg.

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:31:04.860]
Why did I quit that job? Why did I do it? Well he did pretty good actually most movies he has like that 10 second cameo part. Yeah. And in this one he was in it for almost the entire movie. Great. So let's keep our fingers crossed. I'm glad I know. I'm glad I know somebody in Hollywood. It's making a few bucks because my other buddy just went bankrupt here. So at least I got somebody to fall back.

[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:13.300]
Okay well now you're on your way on TV. Okay. Good luck. Thanks a lot pal. I'm on my way. How come it's okay for me to be on sports crap. Oh by the way this chair is about to fall apart.

[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:24.240]
I just heard something in this thing. It sounds not too exciting George. All our chairs are like on the floor. Let's bring fat boy in for one final blast. Come on boy. Here we go boy.

[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:33.640]
Two open lines in one in Broward 524 in the green line 1 800 944 9463. Yeah. How come it's okay that I'm on sports crap and I'm parallel to Belon here.

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:39.080]
And I can talk a little trash on there about the man that's showing with Shula. That's okay but on the radio here it's like.

[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:47.400]
Oh he's he's disgusting. You know. He's just way over the line. We can't we just can't sell that show. We can't put him on here.

[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.280]
He's he's filthy and grotesque and disgusting and everybody wants him off here. But on TV he would be great.

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:02.780]
George. What do you look at me like that? No it is true. It is true. I should be on television. There's no question about that.

[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.460]
This is a waste of time being on radio. Now with all the respect to our loyal audience all 40 of you who are left.

[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:16.040]
You know it's been a nice run for you. I write. But television is where it's at because you're reaching people even even by accident.

[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:21.960]
I guarantee you more people were watching at sports crap show last night just by accident just because it's on their TV set.

[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.320]
Then we'll ever listen to this radio station in a million years of Tuesdays. It's just it's just the way it is.

[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:33.380]
And you know it's probably not a smart thing to say because we're competing with the TV people forever to but I've said it for years and it's true.

[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:43.180]
Television is a goddamn awesome powerful force that's brainwashed and manipulated the minds of millions from coast to coast and practically destroyed our whole goddamn society.

[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.120]
So why should I be part of it and having fun and profit from it?

[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:55.200]
Here's a Miami on the and you know Andy came into apologize this morning. They have a little they had a few technical problems last night and they better butch up their active.

[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.040]
They want me to come back on at them thing again. That's a real that's a that's a real to that thing about the news.

[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.420]
Pathfan that if I'm on here he wouldn't come on there. You know why he wouldn't come on here because I'd embarrassed to live and crap out of that piece of

[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.420]
Drek. That's why.

[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:15.780]
Because I make a jackass out of that monkey which usually does a pretty good job of himself. There's another guy these color analyst man all these ex-jocks.

[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:24.640]
I want to talk about that last night but we didn't have the time. All these ex-jocks course you know manage my kid a little uptight about that but we make an exception for him because he's after all a professional.

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.780]
Right. But setting him aside.

[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:36.640]
All these guys John Davidson who's got a garbage mouth who never stops talking. And I know yesterday he was like Dennis Vard.

[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.020]
She got to puck off the back of the net there because you don't want the face off in your own end. He should have flipped away to excuse me.

[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:51.600]
The face off is outside the blue line. That's right. The red wing shot it in. He just has to compulsively keep talking and talking and whoever's doing to play by play working with guys like that.

[00:33:51.600 --> 00:34:03.100]
You know you want to send him a sympathy card because these guys really these big bombastic egotistical assholes like Bill Clement and John Davidson and Denise Potphen.

[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.740]
They think we tune in to hear their bull crap to hear that. Oh here's the hollow flavor. Yeah big deal. So what does that mean?

[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:17.740]
I'm not impressed. Okay. The guy was great 20 years ago. He was a player and he's in articulate and a jackass and a but sucker to top it all off.

[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:26.660]
And we'll never tell you the goddamn truth because he's a shill right. Remain. Oh sorry. Here's Miami on the purple line. Hello. Hello. Yes sir.

[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:36.880]
I just want to let you know that. I'm going to express way is absolutely bad at love. Love them. Love them road. Stop and I went around.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:46.920]
Came in my own dairy and there's no traffic coming through on the south side. It's it's only a clogged. It actually is.

[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:53.600]
Okay. Thanks. Get a new phone too. By the way. Okay. The palm metal. We'll probably hear that on the traffic at about three or four hours after they clear it out.

[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.900]
We do have an open line. It's in the purple line selling to one pound I OD. Are we going to hear from I don't you know something.

[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:05.960]
I don't think there really are that many small dishes out there in this town anyway. Well I would have thought that as soon as those things hit the market.

[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:13.800]
I would have thought that they would be hotter than Hall of On South Beach. I mean you know here's an opportunity to say to kiss your cable company goodbye.

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:23.800]
If you could see the crappy picture that they got on the cable in my mother's house and it turns out that it is TCI used to be store is now TCI you people ought to be shot.

[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:34.480]
Not just keep increasing the prices but to be charging anything for delivering a picture you could take a goddamn coat hanger and stick it out the window and get a better picture than what they're delivering in the same in my house.

[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:40.520]
Continental. Grave robbers. Here's where we going. Hi Alia. Hello.

[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:56.360]
I'm Neil Roger. Yes sir. I just got a question for you. I don't know if you mentioned it or can barely hear you. Okay. There's one or three point five radio station is at the day. I don't know if they say they're they're just sending a message with a heartbeat saying that they're going to improve the whole thing and just recording the whole thing.

[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:07.740]
Right. You think they'll bring Ron and Ron. Do I think they're going to put Ron and Ron on here. Yeah well that's something to think about could be but no one want to cheap out for that is I have my doubts.

[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:22.220]
Yeah just the whole recording the whole thing and nothing no music or nothing. On other words they're not even they're just running it constantly. Oh my God give me our breath. They're just beating it. Huh. There you go. Boy it's going to be bloody by 103.

[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:41.440]
All right bro. Okay. Well listen keep listening. When it comes 103 I want to report okay. Okay you check it out man. Thanks. All right. We all have an open line in day. Now who's he working for is that tonight is the sun and law. Open line in day 751 1 and brown or 524 so probably our friend Mitch Lewis will be out of there. Maybe you can bring it back here.

[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:58.700]
Boy things have never been the same. It kind of wrecked our whole damn production thing. Wreck them. Hell it damn near kill them when he left here. The great mates Lewis who actually was creative and came up with some real interesting stuff for us. We don't want nobody like him here and we sure don't want nobody like Larry Bessler reminds his own business and does a good job and air just this it's an air.

[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:07.400]
We don't like guys like that. We like people who like fat boy that cause a lot of problems and eat a lot of meals. Anyway it's 1048 at WIOD.

[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:25.540]
This is the beat of a heart. The beat of a major programming move will be made this afternoon at two on 16 WIOD.

[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:35.360]
The greatest TV spot speaking of TV in the history of mankind. Have you seen the new Grey Pupon spot?

[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:45.760]
Grey Pupon Moustered. You haven't seen that. So anyway here's this very distinguished looking gentleman with a big suit and a whole deal on in the back of a limousine.

[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:55.020]
He's got a squeeze bottle a plastic squeeze bottle of Grey Pupon and it's almost down to the end and he's squeezing it.

[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:03.300]
I don't even know what he's squeezing in a hot dog or whatever the hell he's eating and he's squeezing the last bit of this Grey Pupon and it goes like that.

[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:12.480]
And the limo driver turns around and gives him a real sour look and he says, oh excuse me. It's just you had to be there.

[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.200]
I got a great idea since they're doing the fart beat all day.

[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.760]
In honor of our new a big programming move at two o'clock this afternoon.

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.680]
How's that three hours? All right. It's a fart beat. I'm WIOD.

[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.660]
I guess we can count filling on another one of those people that found out about a program change on the race. Are you sure?

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.540]
I think so. That's what it sounds like to me. So he called you just now. He was very squirrely on the hotline there just now. Yeah.

[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:47.740]
You know, when you when your number's down to a three two man, I mean you're a great talent. But that stuff wears out after wow with the voices and the whole stick.

[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:57.720]
You know, you used to be great then. Then when he had the guy the I 95 asshole guy and said the effort on here the other day that you know we're going to mess him around here. He's a hell of a guy and the smokes hell of a chain thing,

[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:05.660]
chain link fence. But other than that, he doesn't know about it. I'm not bad. He's put him in the same category with Davey gravy line. But see, don't worry because he came back.

[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:21.040]
So big changes, baby. We're going to have fire some big ones this afternoon at two o'clock. Here's the Miami Lakes. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Are you supposed to be on on Sunday? You're best of Neil tapes. I have you're asking me. I have we had any idea.

[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:43.360]
I'm a fire report then. Yes. I want to say that Chris Baker really sucks. No kidding. Okay. He made your bullet and here we go. He really sucks. Okay. Gary Burbank was on Neil. Oh, you know something. I heard of Graveline. I heard. I heard 30 seconds yesterday. I've never heard him before doing a spoof on large ass limbaugh. I take back what I said before was the worst radio. I've ever heard in my life.

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:57.900]
He's almost as bad as the bitch in the night. Gary Burbank. Hey, do it a rash lip off. Take off. It was it was a tragedy. We're like a 10 year-old kid playing radio in his basement. It really sucks. You still definitely going to leave.

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:12.920]
It's still going to leave. Yeah, you said at two o'clock. I said we have big changes at two o'clock. Does it mean he's not going to be there? Might be his pantalonies. You'll have to stay tuned, pal. Keep you on a hook. Stay tuned, sweetheart. Yeah. But wait. Yeah. But wait a second. Anyway, it's 10.53 at WIOD.

when you get to the end of griffin road is where it hits twenty seven

[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.820]

[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.720]
where the road ends

[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.900]

faith keeps man from saving self

[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.760]
salesman starves and dies waiting for gods hell

[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.540]
agnes or a gun

[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.040]
when do it finally got stuck in a snow last fall trying to drive the back roads

[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.220]
over the climate mountains he put his faith in god

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.360]
and waited with the patience of joe for somebody to rescue him

[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.180]
for nine weeks he said in the cab of the pickup check the days off the calendar

[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.620]
in his salesman's day planner and wrote a stack of letters in a neat hand

[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.200]
on a legal pad and to his two sons his fiancee and his boss

[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.860]
if he had stepped out of the truck and followed the road back around a

[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.720]
corner he soon would have found clear pavement leading down the mountain

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.760]
the safety last month some teenagers who got stuck

[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.420]
themselves discovered filly starved at death in his pickup

[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.740]
the people who live in this rugged country couldn't believe he'd just sat

[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.660]
there like some dumbass for so long the snow never stays on that road but

[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.160]
right there says Glenn carpenter of gold beach who dug

[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.860]
Finley's pickup out of five feet of snow with a front end loader on

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.700]
May 22 before going on to open the road for the season

[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.040]
depending on the weather Finley 56 could have had a few hundred yards or a

[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.620]
few miles of snow to walk through before reaching pavement

[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.460]
but there was no sign he ever left the truck i have no control over my life

[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.600]
it's all in his hands he wrote his will be done

[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.500]
Finley wrote his boss and one of the letters found with his body

[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.120]
death here in another month or so or he sent someone to save me yet knowing

[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.860]
his will i'm at peace and his grace will prevail

[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.160]
if i'm to save if what is it if i'm saved to finish my life here

[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.800]
please know i'll always be thankful to you and rain your servant if not

[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.840]
i'll see you in glory

[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:09.560]
anyway i'm not saying it in glory whole anyway after Finley vanished his boss

[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.440]
uh max sealer owner of asyns campers sent him out another man to search

[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.680]
form deputies in kusbe his last stop sent up a helicopter

[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.740]
meanwhile Finley accepted his fate writing calmly to sealer the most

[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.620]
wonderful thing out of this ordeal has been the never-ending fellowship with

[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.220]
the lord he wrote i haven't eaten since noon of november 14 yet i feel great

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.360]
i'm in good spirits i'm in good spirits he said

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.120]
i've never known such fellowship nor how his plan for man can be a love for us

[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.360]
beyond all things Finley kept crossing off the days on this

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.900]

[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.740]
memos they want nothing's ever gonna change here because they don't care about it if there was

[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:12.160]
gonna change we'd have more than one spot this hour but uh you know what are we what are we really

[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.720]
talking about is the fact that we we need a little inflammation for example we went and ate its

[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:22.480]
shells in sunrise on Saturday had dinner there at shells and i you know i'm thinking of myself

[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.600]
well we'll go at five o'clock as they open at five because i haven't been in shells in a long time

[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.820]
i'm the guy to put them on the map in the first place years ago and so we drive up there in a place

[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:36.900]
is packed packed and i look on the door and they're open continuously from 11 30 in the morning for

[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.280]
lunch until whenever they close at night i didn't know that i'm doing spots form i didn't know

[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.840]
nothing about it because i have no information trouser trot that's that's his account trouser trot

[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.540]
and it's the same with everything else that goes on here yeah but you know the talent doesn't

[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.520]
service there you guys just don't take care of our clients the way they do the way fat Hank does

[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.700]
when he goes gets all those free meals that's right we can eat quite that much

[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.180]
but i mean what are we really talking about that we don't have any information like the trip to

[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:10.800]
Vegas we're leaving 6 30 on i don't know whether we still got those six tickets left or not six

[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:13.640]
deal yes ma'am i got a couple of hockey questions for you yeah i got my panthers invoice

[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.440]
15 000 something for eight season tickets so that's a little steep

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.960]
mm-hmm and i also have a question about the Detroit Red Wing what is the deal with the octopus

[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.760]
you know do i have to keep telling the story i just got through telling the story on friday i

[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:34.280]
wasn't here well a guy in a guy had a fish market 1952 okay the back in those days there was only

[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.880]
six teams in league okay i used to take eight games to win a Stanley Cup there was only two rounds

[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.460]
in a playoff so eight wins you want a Stanley Cup so he got a real clever idea because the octopus

[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.160]
has eight testicles tentacles he figured he would take one of the game and you know if they won

[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.240]
they would toss it out on the ice and it would represent the eight games that it takes to win a

[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.120]
Stanley Cup and a cut cut on and he got a bunch of fishy people in Detroit i got it that's what

[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.620]

[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.040]

[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.480]

[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.940]

[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.580]
and use you for fun and profit and drain air v mounts air v ounce of energy out of your body

[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:15.140]
i still say man if we could just if we could find a place that had something that was good

[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:21.060]
and not loaded with cheese and fat and stuff we'd be way ahead of the game we'd have it licked

[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.100]
by the way if there's any if there's any punks out there live any acres that like

[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.320]
licking toads come on by and i'll be tossing them out and the seriously just drive on by and i'll

[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:36.680]

[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:56.020]
i'd never seen the show before and that that was the first uh exposure to it is a pretty interesting

[01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:02.500]
script they had a good time what show was it it's called the right verdict it's on where uh what's

[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.340]

[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:17.260]
pissed off about it yeah i think this guy let me just say this anybody that watched that show murder

[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.940]
she wrote should be murdered i'll tell you that right now that could have been the worst show in

[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.520]
the history of tv it made my mother the car look like omnibus that's how bad that show is unfortunately

[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.040]
it's gonna probably still be on some other time but oh oh look pretty uh it was pretty good i

[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.800]
didn't somebody tell angel a landsbury she's been dead for 20 years already get the pain overall

[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:40.200]
exactly okay thanks for the good news i also say how do you uh buddy cliff the uppool man he's one

[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.040]

[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:56.540]

[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.700]
trees down there that i wouldn't have all that mong and crap in my pool anymore i think that my

[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.080]
pool filter is a piece of crap is what i think there's still plenty of garbage in there

[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.900]
if i had a good pool filter would just suck those bufos right through there no problem

[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.600]
maybe we can have clipped a pool man come down and lick some of those toads huh

[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.880]
i think he's already ahead of us 1128 at w-w-i-d in his path

[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.880]
i'm gonna have to go

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.060]
any other job

[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.880]
but driving in my junk car

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.160]
hurt on the radio

[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.900]
for you get older

[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.400]
you gotta save some dough

[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.140]
no i can't save none

[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.980]
let my pay goes higher

[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:54.200]
guess i can't retire

[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.860]
what's the deal

[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.180]
it don't make no sense

[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.100]
after i pay my taxes

[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.940]
i can barely pay my rent

[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.480]
i should save more

[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.320]
but there were it's burned like fire

[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:26.640]
because i know i can't retire

[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.680]
you'll need a million dollars in your account again

[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.620]
you'll save it much because i'm always eat out of back

[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:41.080]
stop eating i get ahead

[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.620]
but you do that too long and you're wind up dead

[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.440]
so so the curries broke

[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.780]
spread on my money

[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.560]
i work until i crout

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.900]
probably as a plus point

[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.920]
bring all of these bills

[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.480]
please make me prosper

[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:19.420]

[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.860]
marlin both i just i've also got a little payroll and uh from this ticket increased by the way all

[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.820]
going to use that money to go out and sign free agents or to get you know like a real player to

[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:00.900]
on a team i mean just the increase over the years is is too much there and look at this uh mr

[01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:35.810]
which they're in malls all over the place now like in the sawgrass they water it down yeah

[01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:40.490]
for four bucks a scoop it's not bad yeah that's true for twenty bucks an ounce that's not too bad

[01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:44.690]
there you go thanks for the good news all right see ya well that explains it all along

[01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:49.590]
because I you know and see now that something's wrong with that because when you buy something

[01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:53.790]
in the store and then you go buy it in fact you would think it would be the other way around wouldn't

[01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:59.410]
you like when you go to nathens and you buy one of those great nathens weenies you know how it's

[01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:03.490]
going to taste then when you buy them at the supermarket which you can already package the nathens

[01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:07.630]
weenies and you take it home I mean it's still pretty good but it's it's just not the same as when

[01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:10.990]
they make it right there on the on their grill or whatever the hell are doing to it wherever they're

[01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:17.210]
sticking it so you would always think that if you go to the place that it would be the very best

[01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:23.250]
and that if you like bought it in a store somewhere package can boxed whatever it would be like a

[01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:29.550]
little less good but in this case evidently it's not here's four lotterdale hello
