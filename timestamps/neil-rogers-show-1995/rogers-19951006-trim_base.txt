sucked in by the media and that uh... they're immersed in this

[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.120]

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.920]

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.320]
well you're not that young i mean compared to me who are you have it okay now i

[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.760]
want to i want to say to you that um i've i've enjoyed your show over the years

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.240]
yeah but i want to explain something to you regarding uh where most of the people have

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.120]
tell my people came from with this uh celebration type thing that everybody's talking about

[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.980]
okay i've been asking for that for uh i'm gonna tell it to you straight okay first of all i

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.740]
want to tell you that we only have uh in this market one uh black station i think this wbr

[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.300]
what about hot 105 last time i checked it's right up the hill of hot let's have a hot

[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.900]
well if i have a lot of listeners too but for the most part um how many five are one of the top

[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.960]
four or five stations absolutely i want to commend those jocks over there that uh

[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.560]
monitor this program when they have the uh the announcement of the verdict when the people

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:11.020]
were calling and and they were extremely ecstatic about his his acquittal um the station manager

[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:17.200]
the program manager and director and at the dj told the told the people there that it was nothing

[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.880]
to really be jubilant about okay and that was a word it wasn't that they were feeding out the

[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.700]
frenzy for everybody to jump up and have a great time and start cheering this guy on yeah because

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.560]
we really felt and i know most of the people that feel the way i do that this was a uh sort of

[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.980]
bittersweet victory so to speak we really don't know well they're all these people uh

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.340]
cheering about him wasn't just a mind we think it was all over the country i'll tell you exactly

[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.880]
where it comes from you know and i mean i hate to say this because a lot of people think that when

[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.360]
we say this we're we're coughing out but there's thing called a blank experience and only black

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.880]
people have experienced that and i think you'll agree if you have always met with disappointment

[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.120]
and dismay and the criminal justice system which for the most part has been just that for us

[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.620]
here was an opportunity for people they came from a community it was just every day people they

[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.960]
were nobody in particular you'll find out the love of people and jury were mixed back they came

[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.920]
from places like one one of these that she came from krennishel that's not a luxury area that's

[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.460]
know where we're owed a little bit right okay these people have an opportunity to really voice

[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:31.280]
an opinion through the fact that they were registered voters that really made a major major change

[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.460]
or difference in some event and i think because they had that in that i mean there's nothing nothing

[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.900]
extraordinary about blacks being on juries when our black people on juries every day anywhere in the

[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.700]
country there's juris that was on edge jury that were people of color black people in particular

[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.140]
that is relatively unusual i think you'll admit that for the most part most highly proof of our

[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.560]
cases have not had that when ronnie king was beaten to a pulp and we all saw it on video yeah but

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.420]
we went through that ronnie king the million times that the last time got nothing to do with that

[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:08.040]
that was that was the mean reason why everybody was was jr i do not know if oj some some is innocent or guilty

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.620]
of committing a crime i do know this i do know he is definitely definitely guilty of beating his wife

[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.800]
yeah and that is not why are people making a hero out of well i think what happens is again like

[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.480]
i said before i think they're not making a hero out of them i think that most sure they are well

[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.500]
most people didn't want to believe he was guilty me because he was a public figure that was a hero

[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.220]
to begin with it is very difficult to take that feeling that you had that strong emotion and just

[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.260]
totally erased that from your mind as if it never existed he was on other words of michael jackson is

[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.760]
sleeping with little boys and if uh... oj killed you know two innocent people in cold blood because

[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.320]
their superstars it's very difficult for us to accept that is that what you're saying i mean but

[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.520]
most people have been fed this type of data this information to them every day over the airway

[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.220]
oh well of course that that's the whole thing with this here that was your whole crap that's right

[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:08.540]
their programs to do that i mean you know uh... you know that might be about a history of of abuse

[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.140]
and that you can't you can't look the other way and i know that well you know something when david

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.620]
burker which was on trial and i realized i don't think that he himself uh... practices religion but

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.640]
i mean his parents were jewish i didn't see jewish people who've been uh... oppressed for

[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.020]
years and years far longer than blacks in america by the way thousands of years before there was any

[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.260]
america i didn't see any groups of jewish people gathering around and saying oh my god this is a

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.440]
grotesque injustice because david burker which is uh... you know been convicted of being the son of

[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.820]
sam in killing all those people in new york i didn't see any uh... jewish backlash against it

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.540]
well i don't think that was the same type of i didn't see that gays who are who are far more

[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.960]
in america today than black people i don't say i didn't see them when uh...

[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.140]
john wain gacy was convicted and sent to the electric cheer in chicago murdering all those kids

[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.060]
or when jeffrey dommer was convicted of uh... killing all those people i didn't see any gay group

[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.000]
skiing together saying this is outrageous and we've been discriminated against they didn't get a

[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.960]
fair trial none of those people in the old had the notoriety that oj sentinat and being a public

[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.500]
figure for so many years doing what we would call major accomplishments the highest maturity

[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.620]
a great athlete a superstar so what does that have to do with it i would have been gacy i want to

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.680]
want to have been trophy in college i would have been made it okay i think i was okay i'm not saying

[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.920]
what i am saying to you is that it's hard for people to turn their back on their emotions

[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.800]
when it comes to a predisposed emotion and that's what it is people program i tell you i feel very

[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.700]
bad about what happened and i my heart goes out to the people that were murdered as well

[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.000]
i think that the exportation from this trial was absolutely ridiculous should never been tell about

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.080]
everything those carat should have been out of there the first every single person if he came near

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.100]
this trial made a bundle and you can tell me that's right all this probably this trial was not

[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.320]
about race it was a trial about money it was not a trial about race but the thing is who

[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.180]
commercialize this trial i tell you one thing you know a lot of people say that johnny car uh...

[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.100]
talker and play the race car but i can recall back when uh... when old jay somsibos first arrested

[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:16.360]
and time magazine published his picture and darken the picture which which a lot of people object

[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.980]
to i'm i personally objected to that well what do you think the purpose of that well you think

[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.980]
that you can't you think time magazine is the racist magazine no i think the purpose of it was

[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:30.720]
that that was a subtle racial overtone i think it was done that way in that man and it was a

[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.240]
apology that was given from time magazine openly for doing with the i don't think it was a

[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.260]
conscious thing i think that it was just i just i just i just tell you i mean you can start looking

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.720]
for uh... all kinds of stuff everywhere you know if you want to come this is true i can tell you

[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.720]
this i think that this whole thing has been just been based upon the fact that uh... you have

[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.480]
the people sent them this jury for a little so long they were there for nine months that's a very

[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.700]
long time yeah and a great great portion of the prosecution's case no i don't want to argue the

[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.380]
case i don't want to argue that part of it i don't want to discuss that it's a

[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.800]
mood point it's already but my point is that how can people come to a fair conclusion that they don't

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.800]
even understand this so all they have to rely upon it all think of the bitter life on was their

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.740]
emotion i think that they want to see this guy a quick like i said let's get the dummies off the

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.720]
jury's and get professional jurors and some get get emotion out of justice there's no room for

[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.140]
emotion in the justice system but they're not always going to change the ill yeah if first of all

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:35.800]
my people began to understand the importance of voting registering to vote to come in an active

[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.780]
member of this system which is the only system that we have unfortunately like a lot this is the

right after the juice tripping after what after the old day trial the juicy trial yeah why did they

[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:26.280]
have to come on and give that statistic about one in three blacks are locked up now oh they've

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.960]
been hyping that a lot lately one on three a blacks between twenty and twenty nine yes i'm a black man

[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.000]
mm-hmm to me it seems as if it says how come we don't know how many white people between twenty and

[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.640]
twenty nine hour and twenty is there's a lot of there's a lot of young people out there

[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.760]
committing a lot of crimes that's not a line is the number of white men in jail so

[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.440]
this is i mean it's like one in twenty billion or something i don't know i would have been

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.360]
interesting to find out but they never gave that i didn't see that several times i mean that says

[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.140]
to me like don't worry white america we didn't get old jay but we got the rest of them yeah yeah

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:02.420]
like everybody who's been putting jail is innocent exactly mm-hmm well i got another point okay um

[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.360]
i want to give white america a chance to to say that i feel old jay was guilty for one thing

[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.920]
let me get that off my chair yeah but they don't have anything to worry about because we as black

[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.660]
we don't own any major food or retail outlet we have no due disaproved what are we talking about

[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.460]
how about churches chicken okay that's that one yeah all right and what about that watermelon patch

[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.240]
down there at homestead well what about the guy that looks like ross for oil all the all the chicken

[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.640]
we there you go we get it from the home so hey yeah we got no political power we frank Purdue no

[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:43.280]
major corporations yeah i'm Purdue and no major media or tv we don't own jack because i mean

[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.580]
we're still the same situation we always been for the last eight million years nothing's changed

[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:56.280]
and what's the what's the reason for that well i feel as if the reason for that is that

[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.140]
i tell you what the king's message it wasn't carried out the way i don't know if he even king knew

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:09.920]
what he was talking about because the message wasn't carried out yeah we took businesses out of

[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.840]
our own neighborhoods out of black neighborhoods and when we were able to go into the white neighborhoods

[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.740]
and shop and do our and do our businesses there on the beautiful marble floors and the air condition

[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:26.380]
buildings we left our neighborhood yeah and they did cheer you read and we just have it overcome

[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:32.860]
that we haven't gone back into our neighborhood and rebuilt them and did anything i mean no maintenance

[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:42.460]
within our you know own system on black i think that's one reason for it also too did you see

[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.940]
our loose faircon was on donny you the other day no i wouldn't watch i wouldn't watch him for more than

[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.400]

[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.760]
issues and everything and the lady stood up she said well what do you feel about a guy in politics

[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.020]

[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.080]
Palm Beach post no blackout wine oh comment i'll tell you why bugsie and thanks for sending me

[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.180]
this article because our papers here for some reason don't have any clue what's going on

[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.780]
because the Sun Sentinel has got a big article blackout deadline is today dolphins get to 24 hour

[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.020]
extension because it was you i'm kipper on Wednesday and supposedly juiced on by dolphins eats on

[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:16.740]
Wednesday and there it falls they out and it says at the end of this article uh channel six was

[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.400]
prepared to buy out their remaining tickets for sundays game on thursday but when station officials

[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.800]
heard about the extension they decided to wait until the deadline today to make a final decision

[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.420]
they bought out less than a thousand tickets to televised the home opener against the jets in the

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:35.800]
Palm Beach paper it says uh any implicit burden on the Jewish community to buy up their remaining

[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.780]
tickets was removed when channel six and Miami guaranteed that it would purchase any surplus by

[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.580]
Friday afternoon that means no blackout which means channel six and five in Palm Beach will show the

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:52.440]
game so depends on which paper you read but uh what can i tell you okay little rumble there at the

[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.360]
Asoda joint they're on a young and a horny man and they just can't get them out of there just turn

[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.460]
around and put your tail between your legs or whatever and get her out of there to and cut the crap

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:07.340]
look at this so anyway it's a 1242 a w i would be so i guess you know depending on which paper you

[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.680]
read don't worry about the blackout it's said when i just uh try to con you people into buying a lot

[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.880]
more tickets but whatever's left to they'll buy them up because they want to get that game on here

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.360]

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:25.960]

[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:49.240]
all right see you so yeah open line at day 751 can you imagine that johnny cacchard mayor of los angeles

[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:05.100]
here's uh boca hello wait a minute it's a wrong line boca how can it be a boca online nine

[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.260]
hello there's never anybody on it line what are you dreaming or what here's a cutler rage hello

[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:18.320]
hello nil yes sir hi i'm i'm an african american i'm just calling to say that there are just too many too many

[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:25.000]
black people who are calling and making excuses for oh j yeah oh j is a grown man he can make up

[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.180]
his own excuses he doesn't need a whole country behind him the thing that really i felt bad about

[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:38.140]
for the whole jury is because of the fact that the whole trial was televised and everything and they

[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:44.100]
did feel a whole about a lot of pressure who knows the jury the many members of the black jury they

[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.060]
might have actually thought that oh j was guilty or not they said the someone said they did

[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:55.500]
yeah but the thing is is that they knew i mean even if they were on the jury they can't it doesn't

[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.100]
matter if they were on there for like maybe a week or so they know that the the trial was

[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:07.080]
highly publicizing everything and that you know once they did get out onto the streets and everything

[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.640]
everyone would know that they were on the jury because the media they were as soon as they got a

[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.040]
hold to it chances are they probably would show their faces right and so i think many of the jurors

[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.280]
probably felt the pressure of it because i know as a black person if i was to be on the jury one

[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.440]
thing i would have to consider was how would everyone else feel about me giving my own opinion

[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.900]
and if they didn't feel the same way about my opinion then chances are that our who knows something

[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:40.720]
could go wrong so the jurors many of the black jurors they probably did feel that as black people

[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.560]
they should support oh j not just because they think that he's innocent but because of his color

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.620]
and some of the other jurors i think there are white jurors yeah in order for them to feel that

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.520]
they aren't being racist or anything you know by voting against oh j even though they might

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.900]
think that he is guilty they probably voted you know towards his innocence because they did feel the

[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:11.100]
pressures of it but i don't think that um any any black person who is calling up this show should

[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.720]
make excuses for oh j you know it's not it's not right they're calling up saying that he's

[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.800]
innocent and everything no no they don't even think about it they're looking at the fact that he's a

[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:29.580]
black man who had a white wife and everything and they don't see the fact that she got killed or

[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.060]
anything they just look at the fact he's a black man okay have a great day pal okay open line in

[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:55.300]
united states for five years and i still can't figure out americans i come from argentina um

[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:03.780]
argentina is a country made of it allians the people from stain there's a lot easier a big colony

[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:10.180]
of germans right right it's the fourth country in the in the world that has the most Jews and the

[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:16.520]
most Nazis yeah you're right well kind of balanced it out uh but when an argent when you ask an

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:22.840]
Argentinian or a person that has lived there for a long time or their their children who have been

[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:30.600]
born there you have some what are what nationality i'm Argentinian why do americans here make such a

[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:37.300]
big issue about race and where you come from oh i'm Cuban-american i'm African-american i'm

[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:45.040]
Jewish-american um i still and it's just plain stupid it's just stupid and and the media have helped

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.660]
to create this and perpetuated and it's just it's just the way the establishment likes it it's called

[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.960]
divide and conquer that's just the way they love it but it's just that i don't see america is

[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.960]
going to make it as a as a society ever if they don't get all together and say you know we're

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:07.140]
American it's not gonna it's not gonna happen it ain't gonna happen like this like with this

[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.900]
oj Simpson by the way i didn't even know who he was before all this started and you know something

[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.820]
a lot of the people especially these women who are calling in on all the shows including this one

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:22.160]
who wouldn't know oj Simpson from oj Schwartz who were never followed football who haven't got any

[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.420]
idea what team he played for what the only was all about all of a sudden they got an opinion because

[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.000]
it was a big media event that was on television every day like a never ending soap opera that's why

[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.880]
they haven't got any idea who he was and everything has to fall into a racial issue yeah and

[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:44.580]
that's america welcome to america it's not only it's not only racist there there is no solution

[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:50.840]
there is no solution i mean it's institutionalized it is institutionalized whether you're black whether

[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.560]
you're gay whether you're Chinese whether you're this we're gonna find some reason to hate you and

[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.760]
that's america that's why this country blows everybody makes such a big personal uh the american

[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.000]
people are extremely parochial people most of whom have never been anywhere related to real

[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.060]
civilization they think because we got the best strip shopping malls anywhere in the world that

[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.480]
that makes us a great country and because we got bigger color tv sets except for the japanese

[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:25.540]
and so that makes us better than everybody they haven't been anywhere they don't know what

[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:30.400]

[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.600]
you know it takes some comfort in on that you know what i don't know what the status but you know

[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:03.680]
most people go through the uh judicial system i don't know what it's 75 85 95 percent go back

[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.640]
into it you know once they're in they go through jail they usually come back through it again

[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.700]
anyway so it takes some cover on oj oh probably be back okay thanks for the abriant observation

[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.700]

she came from why is that because this place you know how stupid you sound man no this place sucks

[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.400]
you misunderstood what i was saying i thought you were going to give me one of those

[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.540]
the go back you know what the place where he's from is probably much better than here i'm not

[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.580]
so sure about that our continuous like some very very very serious problem this place is going to

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.240]
hell in a hand basket yeah and it ain't going to get any better yeah everything that is going on

[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.340]
right now is just going to get worse and worse and the thing that upset me the most well thanks for

[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.480]
you rock mystic view the same thing that upset you about everybody jumping around and screaming and

[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.420]
which not only was black there were also white people doing that's right i think a lot of the people

[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.340]
did it because it was the thing to do but what really struck me as weird was that how do they know

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.280]
was the thing to do is a spontaneous thing that happened immediately yeah but i think there was a

[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.320]
buildup for i think that you knew that was going to happen anyway no i did not i i never expected any of

[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.240]
that i expected a lot of people to do that but the thing i did not expect was college educated people

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.800]
people at Howard University right that was university my aunt that was puke well you event that's not

[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.620]
a real school anyway but the people that were college educated people that are supposed to be

[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.860]
leaders in this community were were applauding it just as much as the people that were jumping around

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.420]
on the streets and that's what upset me the most was that i thought this was going to be an isolated

[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.280]
thing i knew the people out front of the courthouse that was that was they were there for that they

[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.800]
were there to cheer that's why they went down there so i expected that from them yeah but when we

[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.200]
were seeing feeds from around the whole united states nauseating it was just i couldn't believe it

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.560]
and i want to make a comment about what you were saying before about police corruption and

[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:13.000]
brutality yeah i was a police officer in a city in Palm Beach county and we had a predominantly black

[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.940]
community i don't know if i can say the city why not that's up to you it was city of belgley okay

[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:24.000]
we had a predominantly black community and the rest of the community was made up primarily of

[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:32.940]
different ethnic groups mexican we had a lot of migrant workers a lot of Haitians right and

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:40.080]
in the time that i worked there i never once saw somebody beaten and i never once saw somebody

[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.880]
falsely put in jail i don't know if you i'm sure you know but i don't know if a lot of people

[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.260]
have a listening know what probable causes it's an affidavit that's written by a police officer at

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.380]
the time of the rest to the document why he believes that the person should be arrested and i

[00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:01.040]
can tell you there were numerous times where we had people incarcerated for witness statements or

[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.300]
for suspect interrogations and upon completing all the statements if there wasn't enough probable

[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.020]
cause we released them we wouldn't send them to jail and let the state attorney work out we did

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.920]
what we thought was right in house and didn't get anybody else involved yeah and i do not think

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:23.080]
that mark firm and or police corruption of brutality represents the large part of police officers in

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.740]
the united states i know a very big part i'm sure there are maybe not in belgley but in big cities

[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.860]
all over this country maybe it's different in bigger cities maybe because we were in a small

[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.700]
town it was you know it was a lot more um run the right way because of the fact that we knew the

[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:43.020]
community was watching us but you know i can't speak for bigger cities but from what i have seen

[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.900]
and also riding with other departments like to point out you that there were a lot of lynchings going

[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.000]
on in small towns in mississippi and the georgian places like that that's true but i think that we were

[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.740]
maybe we were a little bit more scrutinized than other places but it it is from what i have seen

[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:02.600]
it is not as widespread as everybody thinks and well whatever amount it is when you got a gun in a

[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.980]

nothing's going to change is everybody's going to ravin ray but uh as time goes on things will

[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.720]
always remain it's just another hobby it's just another thing to kill some time that's all

[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.180]
like how it feels said we're in the board of killing business and look at this deal i killed it

[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:15.600]
for like 15 months exactly i do want to make one comment uh to mostly black people uh the after

[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.820]
what about all black people who are all black all black okay okay all black i mean you said

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.460]
people are mostly black i know i'm just i'm just giving away i know i know try to calm you down

[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:33.300]
uh when uh when the radeen king vert came down i'm an anglo-american and uh when uh i was

[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.340]
disgusted by that verdict but i did not and i don't think not one i don't remember any white

[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:45.360]
burning their house going into streets and riding yeah and the only people who were cheering were

[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.760]
probably a mark ferment in the raleigh but the mainstream america i mean people that have a little

[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:58.040]
bit of common sense they were disgusted now i don't know but i i don't want to sound a little bit

[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.540]
too ignorant but you know are the blacks forgetting all the whites american and the americans that

[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:09.280]
helped them throughout the years of their car wasn't it their don't start don't start making

[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.580]
a complicated now man uh you know i'm serious because i don't start talking about the juicer

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.520]
wait a minute don't start to have me about the jewish civil rights workers are got killed in

[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:23.400]
Mississippi and about the uh n-w-a-c-p was founded by jews and about the acl you and all the other groups

[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.400]
that have worked so hard to protect the rights of black people and to give them progress because

[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.680]
it ain't going to do any good man because when you want to find anti-semitism in america you will

[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.400]
look within the black community there is such rampant anti-semitism that it's a frightening thing

[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.340]
it is a frightening thing rampant i think i just know i look at it and uh i'm going through a

[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:48.780]
okay you got a bad thing okay call me back maybe open line of brown or five two four nine four six

[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.840]

[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.420]
this one hates that one and everybody hates the jews and this one hates the blacks that's a

[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.700]
that's the american way that's just the world in fact it's not just this country it's in a lot of

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:07.240]
barbaric places all over the world like in bosnia and in indian pakistan and in northern

[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.760]

[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.220]
all week and i don't know if anyone has mentioned this but do you remember the color davis murders in

[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:49.280]
texas and uh... this uh... his trial was like nineteen seventy six but this was a wealthiest man

[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:56.260]
ever tried for any kind of a crime much less murder he uh... murdered two people he murdered his

[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:02.260]
wife twelve year old daughter and her boyfriend and there were three witnesses at the house he shot

[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.900]
two of them one of them with his wife one of them was another uh... young man who happened

[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:12.620]
upon the scene who is still paralyzed for life and shot at his girlfriend who was running away

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:19.520]
but uh... to make a long story short he was tried and three witnesses at the scene identified him

[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:25.840]
and he got off and he is still up they made like a tv movie of it in fact this year yeah but

[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:32.100]
it was one of those things where he became a celebrity because of the trial and though back in

[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:36.480]
well look at all the celebrities that this trial spot i know that people identify with celebrity

[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.520]
right and that's why they're so hyped up about this whole thing because he had such a following

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.480]
a people people gathering around the court at all and one other thing to while he was in jail

[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.000]

he's a lot of the stuff in half of the jury and my nice and too my ties in that religion

[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.040]
oh yeah just like that god that's good to get like that just like that and i'm not putting

[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:09.800]
anyone's religion down but it just so happened that so many people on the jury were these religious

[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.140]
bible bell people this was in texas to don't forget and this was a really really wealthy man

[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:21.900]

this apartment building John Moon John Lennon of the Beatles or John Lennon yes the tennis

[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:46.420]
conferred and Warren Moon and would not allow John Lennon to move in why is that it would be too much

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:52.080]
confusion too many people then they're around now I think it's because he was British maybe so

[00:51:52.080 --> 00:52:00.300]

[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:06.340]

[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:43.680]
pan Jesus OJ God which means he'll be listening to the show pretty soon so like I said Monday

forget I lay off of him baby I've always had an aversion to sharp knives here's a Delray Beach hello

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.660]
hi I know yes sir I wish Lorenzo had a branch over here in Delray quick comment

[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:06.220]
when OJ called the show Larry King yeah he mentioned about leaving the house on

[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:11.320]
front in the dark yeah in the dark and then we're back in then put the lights on no he didn't say

[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.260]
at the point yeah but the point I want to bring out is did you notice Johnny Carpenter just saying

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.600]
yeah I wasn't watching it I wasn't that our axlery let me tell you what happened uh Johnny

[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.700]
Carpenter is is yesterday him to death you know everything OJ say and he's yes and yes and yes and

[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:32.540]
but do you remember in the trial when when um Johnny Carpenter got up and he says yeah that was

[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:38.200]
OJ that was going into the house he admitted it he says that was OJ and what was he don't he was

[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:42.460]
coming back from heeding golf or hitting golf board right that was the out by he was uh

[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:47.440]
slicing the wire like that and and well but don't you remember in his statement to the police which

[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.600]
of course never was uh read in the testimony he said that he was taking a nap during that period

[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.540]
oh yeah the the preach while Shapiro said got up and said he was taking a nap now let's face it

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.780]
from a quarter to ten when it came back from McDonald's for his big Mac and the drugs or whatever

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:06.320]
they bought there from that time till a quarter to eleven uh I don't think he had time to go out and

[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:12.940]
play some golf and take an out and admittedly admittedly he went in the Bronco and he called from

[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:18.460]
his Bronco in the car phone at three minutes after ten so we know he was out admittedly what

[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:24.000]
that he called he was out of his Bronco no he was out of his cell phone outside he went out to the

[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.260]
Bronco and he had his cell phone at three minutes after ten he went he calls from his Bronco from that

[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.980]
car phone yeah of course because when you're inside the house naturally you're always going to make

[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.240]
a call out in the car you're going to if you're in a house right now when you want to call

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.060]
me right that's right otherwise uh somebody might be overhearing it but the point that I wanted

[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:48.940]
to bring out yeah here he here's Johnny Cochland agreeing with him when he when it's Cochland himself

[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.900]
you got to understand Johnny wants to be the mayor of LA you're you're nitpicking now man listen

[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.440]
it's all over and just just keep just keep thinking of that picture of Johnny with that uh

Cause me it's just a game

[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.080]
I grab a little poke and man they're giving me a name

[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.660]
They call me the fondler, yeah the fondler

[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:28.580]
I feel the round around around around around around

[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:28.980]
Oh!

[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.380]
And I'm assistant on my left, my secretary on my right

[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.360]
There's a cute little page that I'll be driving home tonight

[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:37.900]
Okay!

[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.420]
And when she asked me, the secret of my success

[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.580]
I rip open a shirt and try to do it on my desk

[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.860]
Cause I'm the fondler, yeah the fondler

[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:53.140]
I go around around around around around around

[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.720]
Well I'm known all over town

[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.640]
I gotta watch but I don't care

[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.660]
And I'm attacked, come and lie around

[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.080]
Just give me two sips of wine and I'm lying here

[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.900]
I'm gonna run to well, well I'm a town for senator

[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.660]
Who likes to write it down, gotta see Crit Hutton Place

[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.040]
Well my diary won't be found

[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.760]
And when I get the urge and if I find a willing girl

[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.940]
I'll hop right in with the sack, I will and give that girl a twirl

[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:29.280]
Cause I'm the fondler, yeah the fondler

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.060]
I go around around around around around around

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.420]
Oh!

[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.320]
Hey, yeah!

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.360]
Hey, what's that else?

[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:37.360]

[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.120]
Nothing!

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:40.980]
What?

[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:41.880]
Oh!

[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.920]
Get your hand off me!

[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.240]
What a pervert!

[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.240]
Cause I'm the fondler, yeah the fondler

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.440]
I go around around around around around around around

[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.600]
Oh!

[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.100]
128 to W.O.D.

[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.460]
Speaking of Mary and Berry and I'm thinking of Jerry Studz and Barney Frank and Ted Kennedy

[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.480]
Unless you get like Mel Reynolds, he's going to jail from Illinois

[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.520]
The Democratic congressman who got caught with those young ladies pants down and some underage

[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.360]
But generally speaking, people don't care if they admire somebody, if they like their politics

[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.660]
If they admire what they did in sports or in the media or show business

[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.540]
And movie star, they don't care

[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.980]
They don't give a crap about their personal lives

[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.500]
Look at Clinton for crying out loud

[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.420]
I'll never forget that he and Hillary were on 60 minutes

[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.000]
And everybody, including me, we thought, okay, this is the end

[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.440]
We had all the Jennifer Flowers crap, I mean it was pathetic

[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.660]
This is the end, this man will never get the nomination

[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.340]
Never even if he did get a chance to be elected, he's El Presidente, baby

[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.080]
People don't really care about that stuff

[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.700]
That's why all you people like Denise and I don't know whether she's sincere or just a good act

[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.760]
But who really believe about this battered wife thing and about how people are so

[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.960]
Their consciousness has been raised and they're so outraged about the you know battered and abused women

[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.540]
They don't care about that, they aren't interested

[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.020]
And maybe the one juror who said even though was a disgusting comment

[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.360]
Maybe he was honest though, it was just a waste of time

[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.160]
They might as well have saved the 911 tapes, we didn't care

[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.140]
We don't care what a rotten son of a bitch he might have been to his wife

[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.340]
We don't care, we're not interested

[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.840]
That domain he killed her

[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.720]
So you can go through that long list of people you know and their constituencies

[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.940]
Whatever it might happen to be, they're gonna keep electing them back

[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.340]
Or they're gonna keep giving them their support

[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.100]
Because people in America don't care about these things

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.600]
That's why it's a new story one day and the next day nobody knows from it

[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.980]
Whether it's Warren Moon or Bobby Cox or Irving Spikes

[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.420]
Or the two guys at the University of Nebraska, the two-punk football players

[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:55.720]
Nobody cares, that's why Hugh Grant, what a schmuck he was man

[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.920]
Goes on and apologizes, he should have been high-fiving with Jay Leno and everybody else

[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.860]
Alright, there's another one for Hugh, everybody likes that

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.480]
They like the fact that all these people out there are sleeping around

[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.280]
That's what they want to read in the goddamn inquire and the star in the globe and all their tabloids

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.120]
They want to find it who's sticking it where

[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.920]
Here's a cruel gable, hello

[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.040]
How you doing Neil?

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.480]
Okay

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.240]
Oh man, I'm going nuts, Neil, I know what I'm gonna do

[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.040]
But at any rate

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.460]
Half an hour on the show, baby, half an hour in his audio, so I'm gonna see you all again

[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.240]
I have a good life

[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.960]
I am waiting for Monday with Bated Breath

[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.680]
Me too

[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.700]
But at any rate, I think I could adjust right, I think you know

[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.640]
You got to let it run its course and this is it

[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.840]
I think I don't even want to talk about it anymore

[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.240]
I'm as sick and disgusted as just about everybody else what the brain is

[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.520]
The reason are really caught Neil is that bitch that caught in the last hour

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.960]
That Argentinian bitch

[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.400]
Yeah

[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.040]
Okay, there's a reason why she's hearing not an Argentinia, okay?

[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.160]
You want to talk about a racist country?

[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:53.860]
Argentinia baby

[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.840]
There are no blacks there, no blacks in Argentina

[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.880]
Why is that?

[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.100]
Don't tell Mark Ferman that

[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.580]
Yeah, well, I believe I don't know

[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.640]
I'm sure he's checking for his passport right now

[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.600]
So listen honey, if it's so good over there hop on the next Iberia flight and get the hell on out

[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.360]
Have a nice day

[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.040]
Okay, well

[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.900]
Where's that, remember that song that the guy did at Cemetery Village

[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.100]
Which I think was number one for about two minute and others must be to money

[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.440]
There's please don't take my penis

[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:23.800]
Some of our great to hits here in Iraq, but where's that you know the one I'm talking about?

[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.880]
Oh, gee, oh here it is, alright

[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.100]
This is just for that lady and this guy

[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:31.880]
Alright

[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:34.800]
Oh

[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.380]
Are you?

[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:37.620]
Puzzle

[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.040]
I saw you

[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.000]
My heart began to flutter, tried to speak

[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.260]
And then began to stutter, and you walked by

[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.400]
I knew that this was really long

[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.280]
Oh, hey

[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.040]
Said hello

[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.740]
You turned and smiled so sweetly, then you spoke

[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:05.260]
And I was yours completely now I'm just gonna ask you a question

[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.240]
Is the title where the song is called?

[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:09.540]
The title is my Argentine

[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.740]
Well, I think you get the message, I can't stand anymore of it

[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.200]
Let's go to, I told them if they would have played that on the coast man

[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.360]
They'd be number one with a bullet

[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.020]
For Lauderdale, hello

[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:19.800]
Hello

[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.440]
Yes sir

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.420]
Now what's going on?

[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:21.960]
How you doing?

[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.700]
Okay, let me just say one quick thing here

[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.140]
Okay, if anybody falls this trial

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.020]
Okay

[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:29.700]
If anybody won?

[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.940]
If anybody falls this trial closely in the beginning of the trial

[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.520]
Okay, Johnny was losing

[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:39.440]
Yeah

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.240]
He had the only thing

[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.040]
What's going on there in the back?

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.880]
Are we having like some kind of a level back there?

[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:45.600]
Oh yeah

[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.420]
Okay, Johnny was losing

[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.640]
Johnny was losing

[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.940]
Okay, the evidence was against them

[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.900]
Okay, the motive was

[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.700]
All other defense witnesses get blowing up one at a time, right?

[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.160]
And, okay, well he's got somebody did live in the back there

[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.300]
And I don't have time for it, okay?

[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.780]
We have an open line in Broward 524

[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.920]
And here's West Palm Beach

[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.540]
Hello

[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:09.500]
Hey Neil

[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.020]
Yes sir

[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:10.860]
How you doing today, sir?

[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.960]
Great, I've called with Noah Jay today

[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.420]
Good

[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:15.620]
You know, it's...

[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.380]
Although he will be a neighbor of yours very soon

[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.640]
Yeah, I hear that

[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.460]
And what really ticks me off, Neil, is like you said, you know, you stole my fire every day, which is okay

[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.480]
You know, this thing was over long ago

[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.300]
Like you said, we knew he was going to walk, who cares?

[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:30.580]
Right

[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.380]
It's over

[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:36.180]
Yeah, what are these bit like that woman that's called yesterday, she cried for six hours after they read the verdict?

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.460]
You know, she needs mental health, she needs a psychiatrist

[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.800]
Which incredible is Neil, the football season is in full effect

[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.140]
Right?

[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.180]
He season starts tomorrow

[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.340]
Poppano Park opens tonight, we got some heavy-duty stuff coming up here

[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.520]
You got baseball...

[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.820]
Playoffs are heavy-duty, they're exciting games

[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.400]
What more could jazz for in life, and here we got everybody crying

[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.520]
Not me, not me, like I said, man, I'm going to be at Poppano Park tonight

[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.060]
I got the Leafs in the Penguins tomorrow, I got the...

[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.420]
And of course, at one o'clock tomorrow, I got the Panthers at New Jersey on TV

[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.020]
Oh, it's a beautiful day

[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.460]
And then Sunday, I got the Panthers open or at the arena

[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.560]
So it's a full weekend of important, of course, to play off games again tonight

[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.280]
So what the hell is wrong with these people?

[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.440]
It's a beautiful thing we got here with all the sports going on, and then these assholes calling it

[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.540]
And what can we do to solve it? They're crazy or what?

[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.980]
What kind of la la land are they living in? It's not going to change

[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:32.000]
It's like standing there, and when you hear somebody calling this, hello new, no, oh Jay thing

[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.580]
You feel like every time they open their mouth, you're being kicked or something

[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.620]
It's like killing the cold

[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.040]
Yeah, you know what I mean? It's just incredible

[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.200]
Well, Neil, I can't say that

[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.300]
You know something, 99% of these people are people who I either have never heard from

[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.300]
Or, you know, like once in a blue moon

[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.040]
But no matter what else I'm talking about, they will not call

[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.540]
I said here day after day after day, discussing every goddamn thing that's ever happened in the history of the universe

[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.880]
And most of these people, including especially these women, never would take the time to call

[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.540]
They all got a busy life, they can't, they're listening, but they'll never call

[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.640]
But boy, nothing's going to stop them on this deal

[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.100]
Neil, they're probably the same people that are calling when you give away the tickets and stuff

[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:15.720]
But you know, Neil, I have a shameless request

[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.300]
Yes sir

[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.200]
And a small card for you

[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.140]
You got a little one, yeah

[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.940]
And a small one, this shameless request is Phil's twisted

[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.520]
Yeah

[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.640]
And a small card is when I moved to West Palm, I listened to Neil Rogers every day

[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.660]
All right OJ

[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:30.900]
Have a good one, see ya

[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.660]
Open line to the green line, yeah?

[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.080]
OJ probably be listening to the show so we better be real nice

[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:41.380]
Like I said, after Monday, we don't mention that name on here again or Eiffely Bailey or Johnny Cochrane or Carl Douglas or Buster Douglas

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.980]
Or Barry Shek and Bob Shapiro, we don't, it's banned, okay

[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.940]
Unless we change our minds

[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.260]
136 at WIOD, Charles Alfie Eries come up with something that'll make you flip that old wig and get the look and great

[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.740]
That's the new replacement, a hair replacement system called the hairline

[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.720]
It actually creates a natural looking hairline for you guys

[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.420]
The most critical area of any hair replacement system, the thing that's the most important is the hairline

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.300]
And with this new system from Charles Alfie Erie, the closer you look, the more natural it looks

[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.140]
Just take a close peek at it and the hair too

[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.540]
The hairline is created with the appropriate recessions for each individual

[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.900]
So it looks like the hair is growing right out of your scalp, not like somebody laid a dead moose on top of your head

[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.160]
The effect is just incredible, so if Mendocsi it didn't work

[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.820]
If you're not happy with plugs or transplants, if people are snapping their ice skates onto your forehead

[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:31.400]
Whatever the deal is, or maybe you're wearing a hair replacement system from somebody else than shame on you

[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.060]
You want to look your best, feel your best smell your best, maybe get a little action once in a while

[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:41.340]
Look, years younger, here's the answer, Charles Alfie Erie, you'll find a studio at 4390, North Federal Highway and Fort Lauderdale

[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.480]
If you want to read about the great new system, just call for their free brochure, there's no obligation

[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.860]
Call a toll free number and they'll send it to you in the mail and the brochure too

[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.440]
1-800-321-2413

[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.040]
You'll have more hair than Ron Jeremy

[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.060]
1-800-321-2413

[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.520]
610-W-I-O-D

[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:00.920]
Approaching critical mass

[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.020]
O'Neill, my queen, God

[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.180]
The manager told me that I was right out of my head and then he said Phil Hendry was using a voice instead

[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:18.840]
Such lies I didn't listen to his jive, I knew all along

[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.840]
He was all wrong and I knew that he thought

[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.400]
Are you sure?

[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.980]
That I was crazy but I'm not, oh no

[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.420]
Yeah, but wait a second

[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.840]
The manager told me that I was a little confused and I said, hey Bobby

[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.140]
Yep

[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.740]
I didn't call to get abused this way, I heard a show just the other day

[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:41.260]
I think you ought to know what he did on his show, I was very upholed

[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.180]
That's the reason why I call

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.340]
Yeah, but let me say something, Frist, let me say something

[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.120]
This woman named Margaret calls you, she'll quite a lot

[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.940]
And I don't want to listen to the suck up folks

[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.580]
Not I know you think Phil is a genius

[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.080]
And that is okay, I just feel that way, but here what I say

[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.000]
I didn't think it was a bit funny

[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.620]
Especially when he talked about the aborted baby fetuses

[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.560]
With the cocktail sauce on top

[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.260]
Yeah, but did you, are you sure?

[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.660]
The manager told me that I could use some couch time but I should have made me

[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:11.860]
Yep

[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:16.960]
You let me speak my mind, you'll find I didn't think it was very kind

[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.740]
When baseball was played by the crippled and blind

[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.620]
And to make matters worse

[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.480]
Passion phones with Sunny Hersh, oh no

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.020]
All right, all right

[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.980]
The manager told me that I was right out of my head

[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.160]
And then he said, lady, your true easily misled

[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.240]
Cause you should know Phil Henry shows you naked new

[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.240]
So why don't you relax and have a value more too

[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.240]
Cause you don't know if you've got to talk to Bobby Green or not

[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.340]
And you know three voices are better than one

[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.660]
141 at WID Final, scored tomorrow by the way Florida State 56 University of Miami 10

[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.720]
Let's go to Miami

[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.420]
Hello

[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.380]
Hello

[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:56.940]
Yes sir

[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.160]
Hey Neil, hi, my name is Darrell, I'm a first time caller

[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.500]
It's a pleasure to speak with you

[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.380]
I'd like to touch on something concerning the OJ trial

[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:09.100]
I really haven't heard anyone say anything about this and to me it's the primary reason why he got off the hook

[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.840]
And it's not necessarily because of the money that he had

[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.760]
Although that had a lot to do with it to me

[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:20.120]
To me the primary reason he got off the hook is because of a bunch of inept and competent losers on the prosecution

[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.500]
There was idiots dropped the ball in the biggest trial of the century

[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.760]
Because they acquiesce to penalizing the jury that they penalized

[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.620]
In other words, nine blacks on that jury that didn't make a big cast

[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.040]
Didn't bring up the Bronco chase, didn't make a big case that an innocent man wouldn't flee

[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:36.920]
All of that

[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.260]
All kinds of stuff that mysteriously we never saw

[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.060]
But see if they had at least half black house land on that tree

[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.760]
It would have been a hung jury at the very least

[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.700]
In addition to what speaking of witnesses there was the one woman who says that she

[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.620]
And she seemed like a pretty credible woman

[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.400]
And lived in the neighborhood over by Nicole

[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:56.180]
Said that she saw the white Bronco with OJ in it driving away

[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.760]
And this was way back in the beginning

[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.300]
And Marsher was such a goody tooshu as well

[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.160]
She sold her story or she was going to sell her story to a tabloid

[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.040]
Therefore we won't put her on a stand

[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.840]
Well it seems to me that just about everybody else we saw

[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.220]
Sooner or later wind up selling her story to a tabloid

[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.520]
And they still all managed to get on a witness stand in the teller bullcrap

[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:19.100]
Absolutely and also I read that there were fibers that the scene found from a 93 or 94 Bronco

[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.180]
And they couldn't enter that into evidence because they didn't tell the defense about it soon enough

[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.980]
Great. I mean on and on. Are they sure that I'm telling L.A.

[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.360]
If you want to if you ever get angry you want to kill somebody go out to L.A. and do it man you'd be okay

[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.840]
No because those losers deserve to have their legal careers ruined for the rest of their lives

[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.720]
Because they embarrassed the country and they embarrassed the city of Los Angeles

[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.680]
And I was outraged, outraged when I found out about the racial make-up

[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.100]
I'm not a racist don't get me wrong

[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:46.620]
But just because OJ is black doesn't mean he deserves to have and I'm blacked on his jury

[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.080]
That's crap

[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.620]
Yep, that is crap

[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.860]
I could understand if it was like in DC or somewhere where there's a you're in the inner city Detroit

[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.540]
You know 9 or 10 blacks on a jury that makes sense

[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.600]
Yeah exactly

[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.480]
When you live in Brentwood 9 blacks on a jury is not a jury of your peers

[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.800]
Exactly and yeah that's about all I had to say about that

[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.980]
And I'm surprised I haven't heard really anyone else in the media talking about that

[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.320]
I mean to me that's the career

[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.040]
You're trying to cut to the chase and make it too simple

[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.420]
And if you do that then there's no excuse for having all these people on

[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.800]
And don't spoil the party pal

[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800]
I guess not, Neil, it's a pleasure talking to you

[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.420]
Have a great weekend

[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.800]
Don't spoil the media friendsy man

[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.100]
You thought that it was all over

[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.400]
Surprise even CNN has special show today to tell us it's not over

[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.620]
They're clinging to this man or hanging on to it like oh geez

[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.920]
They're hanging on tight even John Bob it is embarrassed

[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.440]
Here's a mobile hello

[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:38.880]
Neil

[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.540]
Yes sir

[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:41.980]
I've been listening all week

[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.780]
And like a lot of other people I'm kind of disgusted

[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.280]
About hearing all the racist remarks from everybody

[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.000]
It's I was kind of like Rick I think

[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.720]
I didn't I don't say that

[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.440]
I don't say you were like Rick please

[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.660]
I knew it was it wasn't great but I didn't think it was this bad

[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.300]
Really?

[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:00.880]
Yeah

[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.100]
You thought that race relations were Hunky Dorian America right?

[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.060]
Yeah Hunky Dorian but I thought that we made a lot of progress

[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.120]
I had from 25 years ago 30 years ago

[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:10.860]
Yeah but no

[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.100]
We forgot about Ronald Reagan you see being an era along with Bush for 12 years

[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:19.160]
So I mean they helped to turn a clock back 50 years so we're like already back into 40s

[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160]
Yeah sucks

[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.660]
But other than that I want to get off OJ but I have one thing for you

[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.020]
Yeah

[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.180]
Let's see Johnny Cochran said if it doesn't fit you must acquit

[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:30.560]
Yeah

[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.840]
And they did acquit and I will admit that 77% of white

[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.640]
How come he couldn't do that like you know what I'm saying?

[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.120]
And save me the effort there

[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.820]
We have an open line on a purple line that used to be the cellular one line

[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.800]
But now it's the AT&T wireless line

[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.360]
And no matter what you call it it's a free call if you make it in the reason I'm stalling is because this guy just said crap

[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.720]
But anyway if you pick up the your thing pick up your instrument your apparatus

[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.080]
And your cellular one and your AT&T wireless and dial pound IOD

[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.480]
Miraculous in the photo ring like it's suing right now and maybe George Lanserick

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.440]
Oh my god don't forget we got Pompano Park opening tonight 630

[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.740]
In fact we got a couple of baby races there so it's a good idea to get there early

[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.700]
Posttime is 730 tonight and tomorrow

[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.740]
We got new ownership, new management

[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.680]
We got they want they want living and breathing people out there

[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.680]
They want the young the old the hung the unhung the uncut

[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.240]
They want everyone of any age to come out learn about harness racing

[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.260]
Have a good time. It's a great place great new food in the dining room

[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.740]
It's going to be sensational

[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:39.380]
And fat rich is going to mind his own business keep his nose clean and stay in his place or guess what rich you're out

[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.980]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey. Thank God sometimes that we live in a bush town

[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:51.600]
All my fiance wanted for her birthday was ticket to the dolphin I bought him today. All right

[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:56.060]
Thanks to this guy he put us over the top now you can see the game on Sunday

[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.160]
Unbelievable man tickets available. They I think they were giving them away

[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.680]
The channel six are going to buy them all up again. I guess yeah, that's that's what they said there yeah

[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.720]
They didn't want the announcement to be too obvious because then they realized everybody stopped buying them

[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.620]
Every time somebody says oh well, you know, there's always an issue. All I remember is that playoff game

[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.180]
Wave I think it's like an 85 or so and they couldn't sell out a playoff game

[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:18.040]
It was blacked out. I can see it. It was embarrassing and that was embarrassing

[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.960]
Unbelievable. Well, this is a playoff game for God's sake. Yeah, they love it and they're out

[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.520]
And they started off for no other the only undefeated team left in the whole national football league

[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.980]
Everybody's talking a big game Super Bowl and in the meantime they can't sell a game on what does it take my god?

[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.520]
They push it back to four o'clock at the NFL must have I

[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.580]
There must have been embarrassed to say hey all right. We'll give them one more chance. Yeah, they don't make it now

[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:44.720]
I don't know what's right one more time. Okay. How about if we give you a ten dollars and a ticket and deal with Wayne

[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.940]
If you sell it up by kickoff will give you

[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:47.100]
A

[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:52.620]
Jesus and next time Wayne gets them insider trading information. He'll give you a phone call. Oh, there you go

[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.040]
Okay, enjoy pal

[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:59.620]
We have an open line at day 751. Let's see who the who the Patriots play or the Broncos

[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.200]
Geez

[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.560]
Patriots do suck, but you know you got to stick with your loser no matter what it is just like the angels

[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:10.980]
Okay, how do they do I guarantee the angels would have given the Yankees a better shot than these mariners or they all

[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.520]
O'Randy Johnson will mo am done. That'll be that's the no-brainer

[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.520]

North of Atlantic Boulevard and Dan Marino's town tavern don't forget nobody beats a standard brand deal

[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:24.120]
From the time they found the bodies to the words OJ has been dying to hear the best radio news team in South Florida brought you the trial of the century

[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.700]
We've been cheering and buzzing time left to find a decision or a job or in Belgium since and not guilty of time of murder

[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.540]
Now, Schlock's takes you for a terrifying ride into the future on politics

[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.880]
2025

[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:59.840]
Generation X is all grown up and now those non-communicative underachievers are in politics

[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.940]
And in president what is your plan to battle unemployment?

[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.040]
Like duh, next question

[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.500]
Politics 2025

[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.420]
How will Washington function when every issue can be explained with one syllable?

[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.860]
Mr. Speaker can the Democrats ever regain power in Congress?

[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:22.340]
Yeah, politics 2025 looks ahead behind the scenes in the White House

[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.060]
Madam President what is our economic policy?

[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.000]
Whatever

[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.120]
Could you clarify that?

[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.260]
Whatever

[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.040]
Politics 2025 this fall on Schlock's

[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.400]
We better hurry here here's a lady mobile in Miami

[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:44.820]
Hello

[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:45.480]
Hello

[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.320]
Yes ma'am?

[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:46.820]
Am I on?

[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.820]
You're on, you're in

[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.820]
Yeah I got a question for you

[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.560]
Is the on?

[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.260]
Yeah but you got your radio on in the back and you're going to drive us both crazy

[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.380]
Okay, turn that baby down

[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.400]
I'll turn it off

[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.860]
My husband and I were watching night or the town meeting the other night

[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.680]
And one thing that really bothered me that no one ever even brought up

[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.680]
There were black men coming up there on part of the back black business

[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.400]
League and all that other stuff

[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.360]
And on the black men's association

[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.500]
Nobody you know if a white person would have gone up there and said

[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.680]
I'm part of the white men's association or anything like that

[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.220]
That would have been racist or bigoted or air

[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:20.560]
Yeah, okay

[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.100]
Let's go to Hollywood hello

[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.440]
Dale, yes sir

[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.440]
I was reading the sentinel today about McDonald's and Uproar

[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.560]
With Israel's

[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.440]
Well that's right you know something I brought that in

[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.100]
I never had a chance to bring up about the cheeseburgers in Jerusalem

[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.300]
And of course you can't have cheese with the meat man

[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.900]
And they're pissed off over there now it's trade baby

[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.880]
They're going crazy

[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.240]
How do you like that?

[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.620]
And also I think they're going to cheeseburger today

[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:44.900]
Huh?

[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:45.860]
I think OJ

[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.540]
The time with the dolphins makes and will be called the killer asses

[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.040]
Okay
