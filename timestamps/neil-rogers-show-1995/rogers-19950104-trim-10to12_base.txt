Do you weigh your chocolate?

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.180]
Yes, the women's chocolate.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.280]
Got you in your chocolate.

[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.280]
Got you in your chocolate.

[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.780]
Got you in your chocolate.

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.260]
Chocolate, chocolate.

[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.340]
You got to weigh your chocolate.

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.320]
Got you in your chocolate.

[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600]
You got to weigh your chocolate.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.860]
Give me a head of like a lung.

[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.400]
Give me a head of like a lung.

[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.860]
Give me a head of like a lung.

[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.760]
Give me a head of like a lung.

[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.460]
If I had a lung, I'd fall for that being round.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.120]
There all around, just like those ladies dance around.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.300]
You've got to weigh your chocolate.

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.300]

[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.760]
Oh wait here!

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.620]
Do you like books like internet?

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.420]
Recompseled you kind of likes books like internet?

[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.540]
Recomp sihalling all Robel soapy boys

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.460]
We've got a lot to do with all that's wrong

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.880]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.380]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.980]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.020]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.040]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.140]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.540]
She can do your act with some act

[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.000]
They've all been schlecht

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.960]
Wow you got a beard

[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.980]
You've got a beard

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.220]
JWALA

[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.600]
HABIT

[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040]
You've got a beard

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.460]
You've got a foot

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.280]
You've had a foot

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.360]
You've had long

[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.600]
IF I HAD A long

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.380]
They've all been

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.140]
They're being loud, they're all around.

[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.580]
10 past 10 at WIOD. Happy, what the hell day is it?

[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.340]
Wednesday to you.

[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.840]
You know, when you have that extra day holiday,

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.060]
you just still lost. Happy Thursday, like let's get out of here for the weekend.

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.860]
So I did see that thing on Channel 4 News last night and approved to be on a

[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.660]
shadow of a doubt what a silly goose that the cigarette always.

[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.400]
Did you see the part where he looked Ron Bennington right in the face?

[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.060]
And he asked him that stupid question.

[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.700]
Have you guys ever seen each other's penis?

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.160]
I mean, I thought to me that was probably the lowest piece of trash I've ever seen

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.620]
in the history of journalism.

[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.760]
And how about that Newt Gingrich and his mother on CBS this morning day, huh?

[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.500]
Oh, yes!

[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.340]
She's a bitch.

[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.120]
Oh, sorry.

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.000]
Did anybody see that?

[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.140]
That was a beautiful thing.

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.060]
I thought he was going to get up and smack Paul Azana a couple of times,

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.380]
beat her up around the shoulders and the armpits and just Hollas.

[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.680]
It was a beautiful thing.

[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160]
By the way, speaking of freebies, I do have something about once a month.

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.060]
We have a periodic thing.

[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.860]
If I can use that expression, Shindler's List.

[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.340]
Look at this double set, double videocassette.

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.640]
Shindler's List.

[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.660]
So if we have any old Jew that wants this, it'd be more than happy to give it to him.

[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.380]
Still in his plastic container.

[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.160]
Shindler's List as in boy.

[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.860]
So anyway, the big news, which we had it on here here first, like weeks ago.

[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.200]
How many weeks ago do we have that on here?

[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.820]
About Castronova going over to Azeta?

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.140]
About two weeks ago?

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.580]
Yeah, at least something like that.

[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.620]
Maybe a 10 days ago.

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.800]
The Castronova was going over there and that Ron and Ron would be dead meat.

[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.900]
And Rick Riley, of course, has all been out of shape because he feels that we've been treated unfairly

[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.320]
or that he's been treated unfairly.

[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300]
And he ought to get used to it because that's the way this town is.

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.940]
The local media in this town sucks.

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.060]
There are a bunch of morons.

[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.620]
You have a bunch of stringers who write for the newspapers.

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.580]
And if you think that they're going to ever give you a fair shake, all they know is howard this and howard that.

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.000]
And Larry King this and Lardass Limbaugh that and Michael Jackson this and Madonna that.

[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.680]
And that's about 10 rows in.

[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.780]
We can't leave her out.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.680]
The hype people.

[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.720]
Arnold and Slice Deloam with his $20 million movie that hasn't even been written yet.

[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.640]
That's what the life is all about, man.

[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.160]
That's what it's all about is hype.

[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.660]
We're not the hype, like I told Rick, we're not the masters of hype.

[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.060]
We're the masters of being comatose in this place.

[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.420]
Oh, we got a great station, but let's not tell anybody about it.

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.120]
Don't say it too loud.

[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.540]
Somebody might find out.

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.800]
Listen and enjoy it.

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.240]
Okay.

[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.460]
But anyway, I told you about the Ron and Ron thinking about Castronova.

[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.720]
Are they up to the teas yet?

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.460]
Anzada, they're doing their A through Z.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.540]
Like I told you yesterday.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.720]
And then they're going to go into their progressive, their alternative.

[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.680]
Whatever the hell it's going to be.

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.180]
They're going to be right up there against she.

[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]
They're going to be doing AOR.

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.080]
And now we're going to have two AOR stations to split the 2.8 share that she has been doing.

[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.400]
So they can both do about a one something, which will be right in line with Buddy Bud Paxons territory.

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.320]
Here was the only claim to fame.

[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.760]
Here's a guy that's got a $12 million house on 75,000 radio stations and a bunch of other crap.

[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.780]
And did it all through that schlock home shopping network, which is where he made all of his money.

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.260]
And also buying and selling a lot of distressed radio stations for fun and profit.

[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.580]
Who knows nothing about this business.

[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.760]
Who wouldn't know a good show if he'd bid him on the ass.

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.800]
And the only claim to fame he ever had in any of his stations was the Ron and Ron show.

[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.960]
Whether I elected or not, that was another story I've already spoken my piece on that.

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.040]
But that was his only claim to fame.

[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.400]
So now he's got casted over there playing the more music more often on radio or rock revelry.

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.000]
Whatever the hell that means starting tomorrow morning.

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.860]
And going to do about a one five or a two share in the morning.

[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.240]
They're back to obscurity like Zeta has been since somebody I know left there in the morning.

[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.100]
Seven years ago, they're going to go right back in a crapper.

[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.460]
And buddy, but it's going to be at least be consistent.

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.420]
That's what I've always said in life.

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.600]
If you can't be good, at least be consistent.

[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.800]
That's what they are consistently invisible in the ratings.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.620]
They have no audience.

[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.520]
Whether it's INZ.

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.540]
By the way, did we ever tell that Elaineette to her story in detail?

[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.580]
Do we know any more about that?

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.360]
The fact that she got blown out over there is news directoris.

[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.420]
And the reason that nobody is talking about is because she is suing them in a sex discrimination suit.

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.440]
She started suing before they blew her out.

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.360]
Oh, I see.

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.740]
Well, I can't imagine why they blew her out then.

[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.500]
She was suing and then they fired her.

[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.200]
That's a surprise.

[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.400]
A smart movie, Lane Honey.

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.460]
Nice move, baby.

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.360]
And get that nose.

[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.100]
They're refixed.

[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.560]
She had a nose for news that Elaineette tore.

[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.980]
So she goose them up to about a what about a one share?

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.180]
So this market continues to amazing us down.

[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.080]
So there's an article in the herald and one in the sunset,

[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.020]
and I'll which I'll get into.

[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.340]
Also, I have gun.

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.740]
I got tons of crap today, man.

[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.080]
Oh, what are these people want?

[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.220]
They want that chindler's list?

[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.460]
Look at that.

[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.760]
I sat down here like a big and empty board basically.

[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.740]
Nobody gives a crap about anything because they're still looking at their wounds about the U of M.

[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.940]
And boy, I got plenty to say about that too about the University of Miami and that outlaw football program.

[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.040]
In fact, this whole thing that goes on in sports today, this step in fetchant mentality,

[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.860]
which is totally unacceptable, totally unacceptable.

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.140]
And most people, they'll talk about it in private, but you're not supposed to talk about it in public.

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.080]
I think the NAACP autosuit every one of these universities, especially the University of Miami,

[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.480]
for allowing this kind of behavior to be seen in public.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.820]
Going out there and acting like something out of a step in fetchant from like 50 years ago,

[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.180]
putting on this damn, I'm telling you, if you talk about promoting stereotypes and prejudice,

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.560]
that's exactly what these guys are doing with their stupid clown act.

[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.780]
And people are real, and you know, people are laughing at them.

[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.560]
They're not laughing with them, they're laughing at them.

[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.120]
So black people in this country want to continue to be kept in the dark ages,

[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.680]
if you point that expression, here's the perfect way to do it.

[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.020]
Is keep fulfilling the stereotype, man.

[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.380]
Just keep going out and having these guys go on there and do their step in fetchant routine.

[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.460]
And meanwhile, everybody has laughing at them.

[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.700]
Trust me when I tell you guaranteed, everybody has to say the same thing.

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.180]
They don't want to say it on the air because, well, we don't talk about these things in polite conversation.

[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.380]
But what's polite about it?

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.620]
It's rude, it's crude, it's obnoxious, and it's unacceptable behavior.

[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.840]
And screw these guys.

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.840]
So anyway, we got the press release from Ron and Ron here also.

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.200]
I did not see the thing on Channel 4 News last night where Tony Segredo asked them.

[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.920]
Have you guys ever seen each other's penis food?

[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.140]
But I hear about George's sought. You saw it yourself.

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.180]
And, you know, of course there's several sides to the story, and generally speaking,

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.700]
there's a lot of liars all the way around.

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.780]
Like on the one hand, you know, Murzky saying one thing,

[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.760]
and then on the other hand, they're claiming that it was the announcement of the DS's wife having AIDS,

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.900]
which is why the show got yanked off in Miami and Jacksonville, which is not the truth,

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.420]
because they already knew about that months and months and months and months ago,

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.220]
and now they're trying to say, oh, gee, just a couple of days after the announcement,

[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.080]
the show gets yanked off the year, and that's why they're taking us off the year,

[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.600]
which has nothing to do with it.

[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.560]
So, you know, that kind of reinforces the things that we were hearing ten days ago,

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.960]
about the fact that they were using this announcement to try to build up sympathy,

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.200]
and to try to get the packs and to renew their contract.

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.520]
You know, I mean, you talk about crass.

[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.820]
Okay, I know there are a lot of guys who like their show, a young, you know,

[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.460]
18 to 34 males, especially, they had an audience, although it was diminishing rapidly,

[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.160]
and Howard was blowing them off the map quickly.

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.260]
And they were already on the way down.

[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.120]
Rick would be very upset if I didn't mention that.

[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.980]
Rick and the suds were taking plenty of their audience.

[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.600]
They were already on the way down and out.

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.640]
But to use something like that, the guy's wife's illness, she's got AIDS,

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.620]
and to use that to try to exploit a situation, which is what a lot of people perceive it to be,

[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.560]
is about as crass and low as you can go.

[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.340]
I mean, that's just the unconscionable.

[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.020]
But there are a lot of people who believe that that's what they did.

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.600]
And it didn't work.

[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.620]
Ten, seventeen at WIOD.

[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.100]
So we got just a pile of crap to go on here.

[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.800]
Who wants that damn movie, by the way?

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.580]
Is there old Jews on the phone?

[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.100]
Unless they're an old Jew, they're not going to get it.

[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.840]
At least over the age of 200.

[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.080]
I want chandeliers to list.

[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.200]
What's the deal giving away?

[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.720]
And of course, if they're old Jews, they probably don't have a VCR anyway.

[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.740]
So what's the deal here, huh?

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.280]
Sixteen, WIOD.

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.740]
Pre-mature modulation.

[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.940]
Hello!

[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.340]
Hi, it's Peewee Herman.

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.400]
Take it from me.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.940]
They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.660]
Today's fast-paced world holds its share of headache.

[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.840]
Hey, there's a thumbprint on this report.

[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.600]
Do it again.

[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.660]
Oh, yes, sir.

[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.580]
Got a problem?

[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.860]
No, sir.

[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.180]
Under some pressure, huh?

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.760]
Yeah, I feel like my head's going to explode, and aspirin doesn't do anything.

[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.660]
Well, here, take some ibuprofen.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.720]
Ibuprofen?

[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.900]
Well, I'll try anything.

[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.200]
Oh, and dirty rotten stuff.

[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.360]
I'm pulled up.

[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.340]
So Peewee think he's talking to.

[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.660]
I had to make a little...

[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.620]
Do his own...

[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:38.940]
Report.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.820]
Feel better?

[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.960]
Yeah, what's in ibuprofen?

[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.340]
Well, nothing we can admit to on the radio except our secret ingredients, screw them all.

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.940]
Which eliminates any inhibitions you might have about saying what's on your mind.

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.800]
Oh, here comes your boss.

[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.300]
Look, I want this report done even if you have to work through your lunch hour.

[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.240]
Listen, I'm not...

[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.300]
What are you going to get off your...

[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.580]
...and do some work around here?

[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.340]
Oh, I see.

[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.520]
You take ibuprofen.

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:03.840]
Yeah.

[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.700]
I take it too.

[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.260]
You lazy piece of...

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.940]
Oh, no, sir.

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.600]
I'm the cop here.

[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.420]
I do profe.

[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.140]
You're only a fucking derailleur.

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.380]
1023 at WIOD.

[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.220]
So anyway, let's start with Pat Curry, our good close personal friend who now pedals her crap to the herald

[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.480]
as the radio writer for the herald.

[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.880]
A son sent a little blue ass out, so now she's over with the herald.

[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.380]
Is she still writing too? Did you see her?

[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.900]
She watched Channel 4. Did you see her?

[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.380]
Her doing her.

[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.020]
I didn't see the piece of...

[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.260]
...puts.

[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.100]
I didn't see the Puts piece.

[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.560]
So what were they talking to her about?

[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.520]
What does she know about anything?

[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.100]
They let her get like a certain sin.

[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.640]
Yeah, I got a sentence for her 10 to 20.

[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.900]
Bitch.

[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.160]
So anyway, Ron and Ron off Zeta 4, cast her over and brew her replaced them.

[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.460]
Fans of Radio's Rockets, Ron and Ron cheer went for a disappointing drive time today.

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.880]
The city-hitted show was dropped Tuesday by Zeta 4.

[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.560]
Zeta 4 and its owner, Pax and Communications, announced Tuesday afternoon that the 6th to 10 AM show had been replaced.

[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.020]
Effective today by South Florida Radio veterans, Paul Castrono balls and Ron Brewer.

[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.120]
Pax had also dropped the show Tuesday from its Jacksonville station, but it continues on the year on the it's Orlando affiliate.

[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.060]
Now I didn't know that.

[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.420]
They own a station in Orlando that it's on?

[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.220]
So what does that mean?

[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.900]
I don't understand what the hell that means.

[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:20.720]
In addition to which if they were dropping the show because DS's wife has got AIDS, how come they're leaving it on the year in Orlando?

[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.500]
Probably because the contract is not for renewal, I would imagine.

[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.700]
But Pat Curry doesn't go delve in deeply enough to give us that information.

[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.400]
I'm sure somebody in the audience like the Phantom Informer can let us know what the deal is with that.

[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:42.980]
In response, Ron and Ron show officials issued a news release implying that the show had been dropped as a result of an on-ear announcement in December that Ron DS's wife Debbie is suffering from AIDS.

[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.580]
We're surprised because we had already told Pax and communications that we're going through a transitional phase.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.740]
Co-host Ron Bennington said we told them that Ronnie would have to miss some dates because of his wife's illness.

[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.620]
And they told us we had the full support and love of Pax and the full support and love of his holy highness.

[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:05.260]
Mr. Born again, Mr. Holier than now, Mr. I would stab my grandmother in the back if I could make a few bucks on it, buddy bud.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.200]
Another one of these good, Born again, Christens with his $12 million house.

[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:20.740]
$12 million house. People are starving on the streets and this man is building a goddamn $12 million house attribute to greed and being a good Born again, Christian with his Christian manual.

[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.100]
I wonder if Paul Castret always read that baby yet because it is mandatory reading Paul.

[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.320]
You're going to have to turn into an immediate J Barker.

[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:37.340]
No touching below the waist, no touching above the waist, no touching anything. Hands behind your back or straight up in the air.

[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.640]
Anticozont about the ratings in his son Ed and about Neil Murseki, the program director says it was a matter of ratings.

[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.100]
They were off. They were going down.

[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.260]
Bap, bap, bap. And then of course there's a son sentinel spin on it, which the son sent a lot of page 2b or not to be or 2a on the inside.

[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.620]
People in the news stern bumps Ron and Ron, which ain't even mentioned basically in the other article.

[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:06.260]
But the Melissa Ruggieri, which is Rogers and Italian, of course, member of the family, stern bumps Ron and Ron, just four months after invading the sound flow to radio market.

[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:16.340]
The Howard Stern show has claimed its first casually the first of many Melissa were all going off the air because Howard's on here in Miami as in all packing up our little kid bag and leaving.

[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.360]
Now Melissa, you stupid bitch.

[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:27.200]
WZTA home of the one time ratings grabbers Ron D. As in Ron Bennington officially severed its ties with the duo syndicated morning show on Tuesday.

[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.960]
One of several changes the station will unveil today.

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:39.880]
According to Neil Mercky, program director for the state of the station had been searching for a new morning program even before stern end of the market in September on WBGGG, which that now that's that's bull crap.

[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.660]
I don't believe that for a second. They were kicking ass. They had gigantic numbers. Why the hell would they put a different morning show on?

[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.700]
See that why do you have to lie Neil? Why do you have to BS the public?

[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:59.060]
Ratings trans indicate Ron and Ron's often crude show had declined from a 4.8 to a 3.5 share over two months span by comparison.

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:07.600]
Two months after his arrival, Stern boasted WBGG's morning ratings to a 5.5 share from the 1.3 share the station all over the summer when it was Waxy FM.

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.840]
The full arbitrage on ratings fall book, which covers September through to several of you, the religion about two weeks.

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.860]
Stern may or may not have been a factor in Ron and Ron's decline.

[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.540]
Mercky said they've been sliding for a long time in the decision to carry the show anymore was purely a ratings thing.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.100]
Paxing communication, which owns Zeta will also yank Ron and Ron from its sister affiliate in Jacksonville.

[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:33.860]
The duo's Tampa Bay show it aired on Zeta since 1993 will continue to serve its nine other affiliate markets including Tampa and Orlando.

[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:41.020]
And then of course not about Castronova and Brewer. So anyway, then here's the press release from Zeta.

[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:53.580]
Boy, I got just crap off the old shoot here this morning. Ron and Ron devastated after being dropped in Miami in Jacksonville after AIDS announcement says the press release from their corporate orifices unbelievable.

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:08.280]
The actionally syndicated radio program the Ron and Ron show is devastated after being notified today that it is being dropped by Paxing Communications Corp stations in Miami in Jacksonville after making the much publicized on air announcement prior to their Christmas hiatus that Ron DS's wife Debbie is suffering from the AIDS virus.

[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.940]
The Ron and Ron show hosted by Bob I will continue to serve Bob I will.

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:26.500]
We are shocked and sad and the Ron and Ron show a serve these markets extremely well. We have a very strong bond with 1000s and thousands of loyal Ron and Ron listeners and promise to be back on the year as soon as possible with another radio station, which is why they were sucking up with me by the way and us over here.

[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:36.160]
Remember that business with the with the AIDS announcement about the best stuff stuff and peaches which we appreciate the help by the way, but I don't think the motivation was quite as honorable as it was made to sound.

[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:44.000]
We feel as though we've been as matter of fact, I happen to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were sniffing around to try to get them on the station a little bird whisper that through the door.

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.660]
We feel as though we've been let down after Paxing Communications had pledged to us their full and complete support as late as last Friday.

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.160]
The program director of Zeta and Miami had told me that they were committed to us as their morning show and that Paul Castro nobo would be doing afternoons.

[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:05.420]
We obviously underestimated their level of support and their amount of lying. You see again because they operate by that good Christian credo over there on Zeta, they would never lie to you.

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:13.380]
Unless of course in this case, this time, this time I'll make an exception K this time only you can ask me about my business.

[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:22.540]
Just like Michael Corleone, the same the odd father strikes again. Let's take a call from sunrise and get rid of this tape. Hello?

[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:30.540]
How you doing Neil? Okay. I just got to tell you one thing. Yes. I usually watch the dolphins on TV even though I'm not a dolphin fan. Yes.

[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.760]
But I was working out in the yard on Sunday and I listened to your new broadcast crew.

[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:47.480]
Our new, our new broadcast crew. Yeah. You mean on the game? Yeah. I'm the game. You mean Bill Zimfur? Yeah. Zimfur on the skin flute. Yeah.

[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:58.540]
Yeah. But I gotta tell you where the hell did this man that's come from? What does that mean? What does that mean? Where did he come from? I think he's the old tight end man. Old number 88.

[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:07.120]
Yeah. Well, he's a great former tight end. Man does he suck. What what does that mean? You're knocking the mad dog now. Everybody loves Mandage.

[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:16.540]
In fact, he was in the building yesterday when Aaron Summers came in and said look at the **** on that blonde man. Yeah. Only she's not blonde, but he wasn't looking at her hair.

[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:27.760]
I'm telling you I will never listen to a dolphin game when the station is long as he is. Well, why should you be different from anybody else? That's why they're on television. Yeah. Well, God. I've just had to get this off my chest.

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.580]
Okay. Well, feel better. Okay. Can the Middle Ages do you get the tail? No.

[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:41.920]
Carlson here rips the mad dog and he wants he wants me to give him Schindler's list. This guy is out. He's history man. He is off ripping my good buddy Jim Mandage.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.380]
Yeah.

[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.920]
Boy, talk about Hutzpah. Oh, geez.

[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.680]
Okay. We got just too much crap around here today. What is this? Here's a this is from today.

[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.040]
A judge has ordered professional football player Cleveland Gary. Whatever happened to Cleveland boy Gary anyway.

[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.920]
By the way, speaking of the dolphins and his wife to pay American express more than $35,000 in back charges.

[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.900]
Remember that story that's been an ongoing thing. Pay up already. Okay. Pay it now and cut the crap.

[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:25.520]
He's got to pay 13,576. His wife Simone got to repay 22,000. The credit card company sued in October claiming they'd failed to pay their 28,842 bill on their American express gold cards since February of 1993.

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:35.300]
February of 93. And this is goddamn January of 95. And God don't know how much money the dolphins just handed away for him useless as as a teacher on a frog.

[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.120]
And in the meantime, he's just hanging on probably sold all that good stuff that they bought.

[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.880]
What is this bought the best of 94? It kicks serious as as in Mandage. It says this facts. So raise the crap.

[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.500]
I'm a bar. Jay Barker is uglier than Al Goldstein's ass. It says Jay Barker is uglier than Al Goldstein's ass.

[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.520]
Yes. Okay, big.

[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.540]
See takes the helmet off and out of the way that there's from what we heard yesterday. Another born again.

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:08.560]
Christian was running around shouting from the mountain tops. I'm a virgin. I'm a virgin. I never do not. And man, I never touched that thing.

[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.400]
I don't want to know nothing from that. And then we hear yesterday that he's a boozer and carousel and banging everything on campus is what we heard.

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.720]
No, that's just a rumor. But what do you believe, folks? Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:28.380]
Hey, Nio. Yeah. Hey, how you doing, man? Good, man. Just saying it in here, man. I had this this tickle here was one of the changes list, but she wondered why?

[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:42.020]
She was a bit of a chinslaur's list. Tell her to forget it. Yeah, I know. Is she Jewish? Well, she's cute with those clothes. Yeah. What I was going to tell you. I don't think she's sick. I'm sorry. Yeah, probably not. But I'm going to make sure that she gets sick.

[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:54.400]
That she gets it. Yeah, I'm sure she'll get it. Yeah. Hey, what's happening with the tickets, man? With what tickets? All these pre-loaders. Everybody wants the tickets now. They're hoping that Miami beat San Diego and they're really losers.

[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.220]
I didn't say nothing about any tickets today. I've been on for half an hour and say one word about today. I've been on for half an hour and say one word about today.

[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.300]
Yesterday you mentioned that the fact that you still have the tickets. I don't run anything. Good. I'm just going to go. Good for how long?

[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:22.320]
Okay, let's go to Cooper City. Hello. Hello, sonny. Yes, I'm an old Jewish man. Actually, I was listening to the ball out of 45. I was listening to...

[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:31.000]
Phil Hendry. Anybody ever hear Sonny and that goofball from Philadelphia together? What else is his name, George? Go ahead.

[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:37.020]
So I was listening to Phil Hendry yesterday. Yeah. The first time I ever found him to be funny, he was a star.

[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.540]
What are you people all talking about? The first time you ever heard him to be funny? You're out. You're off the airpile.

[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:51.520]
Yes! All these people that we got a whole new deal now. This must be... this must be Paxons people over here calling in today trying to flood the lines with BS here.

[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.480]
First guy's ripping manage whom everybody loves manage, right? Yeah. There you go. Even old Sour Pie over there.

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.340]
And now he's ripping into Phil Hendry. One of the great talents in the history of our business is the first time he ever heard him.

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:11.020]
Why did you call him and tell him that you spineless piece of dirt? You walking jellyfish? Call him and tell him that. God Almighty, talk about...

[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:18.420]
I sit here. I go through a 33 minute monologue. These people wouldn't know Ron and Ron from... they wouldn't know Don I'mus from Don Amici.

[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:30.080]
They wouldn't know Tony Cigreto from Tony Alamo. Jesus, Joseph and Mary, where the hell are these old... just because I said we want to hear from Old Farts, it was a joke, okay? Go away! Please!

[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:38.280]
Hey! Here's a lady in Hylia. Hello. Hello. How'd you like the flowers? How do I like the flowers? Yes. They were beautiful.

[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.680]
You received them? Thank you. You're welcome. They were lovely and you're still a douchebag. Thanks a lot. That's okay. Why?

[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:55.280]
Because you... I don't want to go through that whole thing again. Can't you move on with your life now? Or can't you stop saying something about it?

[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.380]
I haven't said a word about it. If you were talking about the dolphin tickling.

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:11.760]
Yeah. And it's true. It's true. I give things away. I have valuable things to give away here once in a great while, sometimes which I purchase with my own cash. And then I give away to people who don't use them.

[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.760]
Or just take them for granted, or even worse, lose them, or make up some cock and bull story about losing them. It wasn't a bull story.

[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:48.740]
It was a bull in cock story. It was what it was. No, it was. It was a bull in cock story. It was a bull in cock story. It was a bull in cock story. It was a bull in cock story.

punky little but piece of crap and had a real bad complex and didn't look as

[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.040]
facade

[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.980]

for those marshmallow roast

[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.600]

[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.940]
sufferers out there my mother my mother finally after spewing up bull crap

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.160]
all these years finally told me something true yesterday

[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.860]
and that is stay away from citricil you know your doctor always tells you to

[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.140]
take like a little uh... i hate to say stool softener laxative because that

[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.700]
makes you sound like a real old part

[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.640]
but the bottom line is uh... don't take that citric cell it's got citric acid

[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:19.980]
in it

[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.780]

out i threw it out and uh... i'm feeling great

[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.420]
yet anything that's actually it will that's right

[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.220]
so watch your acid

[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.460]

Oh, you'll let me come home, that's a little bit of a wholpetaction

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.660]
For you to live, you're all TCT, and now what it means to me

[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.800]
C-O-N-D-O-M-S-E-F-O-S-E-S

[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:59.200]
To the point of my heart, I need to find out that my world's attraction doesn't let me get me potential

[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.220]
I need a low-petaction doesn't let me let me be potential

[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.540]
I need a low-petaction doesn't let me go

[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.480]
Where am I going to let my world's attraction go?

[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.160]
I need a low-petaction doesn't let me be potential

[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.700]
I need a low-petaction doesn't let me hide baby

[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:21.040]
Oh, have you ever offered me a little bit of a wholpetaction?

[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.000]
I need a low-petaction doesn't let me go

[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.920]
I hope that last doctor I went to a Tamarack who's listening to this boring big fan of the show, a big fan of hers too

[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.600]
And the first thing he asked me when I walked into the office, how's your retra?

[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.800]
It's 11-08 at W-I-O-D, happy Wednesday to you, we are really rockin' and suckin' today, not?

[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.640]
We're talkin' about Ron and Ron today, which nobody wants to talk about because they had no audience left evidently

[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:49.500]
Also we're asking a musical question, how come in those college bull games over the weekend, all those viral football players were holding hands in the huddle?

[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.840]
That's the new deal now, see they won't talk about the padding on the butt, that's bad enough, they can't...

[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.560]
They just, oh, they look the other way, they pretend that's not goin' on, they will never respond to that

[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:07.460]
And in sports it's okay for one guy to pad another guy on the butt, but anywhere else in life in his country if they did that, they'd all be like raising an eyebrow and whistling at the top of their thing

[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.620]
But now the new deal is these football players, and even on the pro level some of them are doing it

[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:19.480]
Every time, not just like once in a while in a crucial spot in the game like as in let's be together, man, we gotta stick together

[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:26.460]
Cause I'm pissed off, not if that pointed again, but like every time they go back in the huddle they're like grabbing each other's hands and whatever else they can get

[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:32.300]
They're holding hands, guys holding hands, now what is that to teach a bunch of young college athletes, huh?

[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.200]
Now one of this countries is gonna hell on a hand casket, man

[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.560]
And nobody's got Shinler's Listia, which I don't understand, I'm just dying to give it to somebody

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.860]
And the movie too, here's Weston, hello?

[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:47.420]
Yeah, a nail? Yes, yeah, I just want to tell you one of my relatives is the survivor of the Holocaust

[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.760]
Yeah, and...

[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.620]
No, that's lucky, and they haven't seen Shinler's Listia

[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.680]
Well, they'll bring back a lot of bad memory, so let's keep it that way

[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.300]
We have an open line in Broward, 524, I'm not gonna give it away, just cause that kid made up that story

[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.420]
I'm gonna drag this thing out the whole show today

[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.880]
I mean all the other movies that I give away generally speaking, nobody even acts for them

[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.900]
Nobody even wants to goddamn things, but I got to speak it well, it's two tapes

[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.480]
And if you're smart enough to put a little Scotch tape over the bottom there, you can actually tape over these

[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.900]
Huh? What's wrong with that?

[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.300]
These are nice virgin videotapes, probably cause at least 399 it came art

[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.760]
Here's... what do I just do? I do Weston, I believe so while you were genuinely reflecting

[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.460]
Here's Westchester, hello? Hello, Neil? Yes, sir

[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.060]
Neil, I've got a problem, maybe you can help me

[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.380]
Yeah? I think I'll fall out

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.640]
Holy hands in the Huttles in it

[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.700]
I would go for it though

[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.120]
Why did guys hold hands in the Huttles football games?

[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:45.880]
I think it's like a sense of brotherhood, just like to lure themselves into being like one unit

[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:51.340]
Oh, well, you nick? Yeah, a lot of you nick that hold hands, you got a point I think you got it

[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.020]
What's the other story?

[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:59.600]
Neil, I'd like to send his list like movie, but I'm more interested that I think I fall on virgin mandates

[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.240]
Yeah

[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:07.000]
I mean, ever since you played that screaming yes, I mean I've been hot and bothered

[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.800]
Have you? No, is there anything new with the fact that it used to be a tight end?

[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.200]
Yes! Yes!

[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.100]
Okay, I think both campers more his type

[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.200]
We have an open line in day, 7519-463, oh he wanted a movie, dammit

[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.880]
Let's go to Jupiter, hello

[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.320]
Hey, they all do it

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:24.780]
Pretty good

[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.900]
Great, got a random report

[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.320]
Yes? Yeah, I do yours day, I'll have to stay at slow

[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.280]
She played the Dickens cider bet

[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.860]
I've heard her play a couple times

[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.340]
Nice

[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.240]
Nice judgment there, sweetie

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.360]
Remember a couple weeks ago, especially up there in Palm Beach with all those 900-year-olds parts that are going for really big

[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.100]
I'm almost sick today, so you have to excuse me

[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.500]
Yeah, you sound like you sound like crap

[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.140]
I'm not saying I'm assuming you're okay, man

[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.920]
Huh? I'm assuming you're not okay

[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.260]
Yeah, right, it sounds like it

[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.760]
You remember a couple weeks ago in Jocelyn or Goyce Limb that booted out

[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.240]
Well, they've put this down an article about the evils of masturbation, the use of them with the analogue

[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.560]
Yeah, there you go, that's me

[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.320]
I'm a little slow

[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.020]
They used to teach and all that

[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.540]
And I could send you the article, I'll save it for you

[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:20.220]
Oh yeah, I know that, and it's not that many years ago, back in the 40s and early 50s, the public line, the AMA and all these other geniuses

[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.560]
A masturbation would make you, you know, grow hair on the palms of your hands and make you go mad

[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.420]
And all this other crap, and of course you had to wear real thick lenses, coat bottle lenses and all this other crap

[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:36.120]
They even had a part where they would put cages on some kids that couldn't leave alone that got stuck in the locker

[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.900]
And then of course there was John Crawford who used to tie her kids hands behind his back and I went to bed

[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.460]
Oh yeah

[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.120]
So he couldn't accidentally wind up touching anywhere

[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.460]
Maybe still rubbing that

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.480]
Yeah, unbelievable

[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.540]
Can I have that movie?

[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.080]
Sure

[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.060]
Okay, let's get it over with

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:56.900]
Okay, this guy's on a, give him the damn Shemler's list, he gave us a little Randy Spireyport there on Dickens Sider

[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.080]
We have an open line a day, of course these falls will all cone off now

[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.100]
How's David Cohen doing by the way, still getting a grip on life?

[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.360]
Open line a day, 7519463, let's do a lady in Pember of Pine, hello

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.140]
Hi, this is Doris, I wanted to say good morning

[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.260]
Good morning Doris

[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.280]
Did you see the topics magazine Sunday?

[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:15.720]
The one?

[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.300]
The topics magazine

[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.280]
How about the tropics?

[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.160]
The tropics

[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.160]
Or the topics, yeah

[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.340]
All right, the world's wrong, the world's wrong

[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:26.480]
I didn't see it, tropics, tropics or whatever it is, I didn't see it

[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.940]
I thought the picture of Cherrick and then Harding was one of the funniest caricatures I've ever seen

[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.220]
One of the funniest ones?

[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.920]
Curricatures or cartoons?

[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.240]
Curricatures

[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.700]
Whatever, I'm stupid today, right?

[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.300]
Curricatures?

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:41.920]
Carricatures

[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.120]
Carricatures?

[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.300]
How about one of the funniest pictures?

[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:50.480]
I thought I just mentioned him, David Cohen, one of the funniest pictures I ever seen

[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.140]
He sure had a lot of bull in the pen

[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.280]
Yeah, he had his hands on it

[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.800]
I told you, you've been saved my life since I moved here in 87

[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.400]
Yeah

[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.700]
You're my son, John

[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.200]
Oh yeah

[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.140]
Yeah, well I know you have better calls than this thing

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.240]
I sure hope so Doris

[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:05.840]
Oh, thank you

[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.460]
You have a nice day

[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.220]
Thank you, you've been here for five

[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:08.820]
Bye-bye

[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.820]
She's becoming a caricature of herself to be honest with you

[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:21.480]
We have an open line on, in fact we have several, but I noticed that one in Broward, five, two, four, nine, four, six, three, five, two, four, W-I-O-D

[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.820]
Just call up George and whistle Dixie

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.000]
Yeah, that guy's got to, and we got the green line open, of course it'll never ring again today in the way

[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.520]
And the great news is that the star line is still a buzz and it's still working there

[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.640]
Bell South mobility has not yet committed that interpretact of disconnecting it

[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.760]
But I have a feeling that any moment, any day, any second, any heartbeat, any deadbeat, it's going to happen

[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.680]
And at that point, if it when it does happen, there is going to be a revolution on this show

[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.200]
The likes of which they have never seen at Bell South mobility, I guarantee you that

[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.360]
Trust me when I tell you

[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.700]
By the way, I mentioned it's 1114 at W-I-O-D

[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.860]
George, you're taking a break now?

[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.660]
How many have we got?

[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:03.260]
Three

[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.260]
Yeah, and we don't want to take one now?

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.120]
Well, usually the way when you take your normal break

[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.320]
About 12

[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.760]
When we do three, usually take up around 20

[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.300]
Yeah

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.060]
So in other words, we have a new deal now you're going to tell me what we're doing

[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.740]
The breaks, is that the new deal? Like they do on these other shows where they

[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.380]
Know you just have a host and a weirdo

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.200]
Where the hosts come in like they're lost and they can't have their own program long

[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.580]
I want to tell you something that really bothers me and I hope that Rick Riley is listening to this

[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.980]
And everybody else who does supposedly does a show on the air

[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.340]
If you are, if you're just that dizzy, and of course in his case he is, so he's exempt from this

[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.660]
But anybody else, if you can't keep a copy of your program long and you don't know when it's time to take a break

[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:50.360]
And you don't have control of the structure of your own program and you have to rely on

[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.940]
Some pre-pubescent butzucker like Andy Calbor, anybody else to decide to format your show

[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.800]
In that case you need help

[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.640]
I guarantee you Phil Henry don't do that

[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.120]
In fact I notice on Friday when he's out there in a road he gets like foaming at the mouth

[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.640]
Because they're trying to make him take breaks when they're in any spots

[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.480]
And he gets all bent out of shape about that

[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.800]
Yeah, but let me say something for some, let me say something later

[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]
So now it's 11

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.700]
Let's take a mobile and four-letter deal, hello

[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.500]
Hey Neil

[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.960]
It's Lenny, how you doing?

[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.600]
Get out of here

[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.560]
Okay that'll do it now, that's a good step to break time

[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.420]
Can you believe that I've heard him call and Phil?

[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.080]
Let me say something to you right now, okay Lenny the limo driver

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.080]
We don't want, I'm speaking for everyone on this station including Rick Riley

[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.900]
Whether he goes along with or not because he's too much of a pussy to admit it and put his foot down with anybody

[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:40.020]
We don't want to speak to you, you are a nitwit, you're a turd, you're a troll, you're just a goofball

[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.540]
We don't want to talk to you, you're a pain in the ass, you're a chronic

[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.440]
You are beyond chronic, you're useless as horns on a frog's ass

[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.540]
So go a vague, go drive somebody because you're driving us nuts

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.620]
Now that to it, 11-16

[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.840]
Let's take a mobile and four-letter deal

[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.300]
Oh god, we didn't get to him fast enough, damn it, they probably thought we were going to take a break

[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.960]
Sorry, two open-loins in Broward, probably on Lenny

[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.180]
5249-463

[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.800]
And one on the green line at 1-800-944-9463

[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.900]
We haven't had one Ron and Ron called, they're not one

[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.960]
I went through 30 minutes of gnashing and got rid of every article

[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.840]
I talked about their press release, about the ins and the outs and the ups and the downs

[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.120]
Not one, talk about an impact

[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.980]
And of course Rick was sitting here this morning telling me, oh yeah, we got the whole Ron and Ron audience over here now

[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.080]
They're all over here, man, because they tuned out and see that this morning they're all pithed off

[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.720]
They're really pithed off and they're not over here

[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.600]
I don't know where the hell they went, but they sure ain't here, I guarantee, I guarantee you that right now

[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.720]
So it's 11-16-163

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:47.320]
Let's take Miami on the purple line, hello

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.500]
Yeah, how you doing Neil?

[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:48.960]
Pretty good

[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.940]
Listen, I called the sucker round for those movies that they're already gone

[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.480]
They're gone, that's right, they're history

[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.700]
No more sucking around

[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.280]
They're not doing anything with that bell

[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.600]
I want to do a radio show, I don't want to be radio giveaway here

[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.960]
I want to talk to some people that want a little verbal intercourse, I'm action here

[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.260]
I just call it into sucker round for something for free

[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.440]
Let's intercourse each other

[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.520]
I do not pass

[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.740]
They're not a bell south crap when they disconnect

[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.100]
We file a class action suit for tumors

[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.460]
Yeah, there you go, good thinking

[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.540]
Hey, I mean, you've got to get them hustling somewhere

[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.900]
I got news for you, on the day that that happens

[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.000]
I'll conduct a massive cellular one, I'll have more new people signing up than they had in a

[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.620]
in a barrel full of monkeys

[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.100]
That's it, I'm wondering what ever the hell that means

[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.240]
I used to when I had bell south for a while and they screwed everything off

[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.720]
They make me sick, I go home and get my mail yesterday

[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.920]
Here's a bill from bell south mobility

[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.000]
We're disconnecting your phone, which by the way I had this connected

[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.280]
We're disconnecting your phone because of the unpaid balance, hundreds of dollars

[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.680]
Which has already been paid, like two weeks ago

[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.840]
I called the turd burger up and I say, you know, I'm getting a build here

[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.380]
And he checks the thing, oh yeah, there's a zero balance

[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.180]
You want to get it reconnected? I said, no thanks, have a nice life, goodbye

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.360]
Well, I had the same time

[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.120]
They can't get their crap together for a lover money over there

[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.480]
I had the same type of problem when I had calls on my bill that I didn't make

[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.360]
I contested it, it came down to the Iodum $18, they took me to court at random

[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.040]
Hundreds of dollars without me to court

[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.340]
Good for you, stick it to them

[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.800]
That's it, stick it anywhere we can

[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.400]
Okay, bye, have a great life

[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.500]
Purple line's open, that's cellular one, that's our favorite line

[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.400]
Dot at pound IOD 11-18

[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.360]
At your...

[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.100]
Well, you see, you can play this game, you know, I'll just drag it out forever

[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.480]
Just keep your right on the edge of your seat

[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.660]
I mean, if you want to take the break, when I want to take the break, great

[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.720]
Like maybe I had to go downstairs and do a little number or a big number

[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.780]
Maybe I want to do it right here in the seat, I don't know

[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.060]
But all of a sudden you're still well

[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.380]
I don't know, I thought you'd take it

[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.800]
Don't think I'll just blow and smoke because I wasn't ready for it

[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.800]
Yeah, you're blowing something in there, I guarantee you that

[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.240]
I'll tell you what he was doing, he was spinning around in the chair

[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.880]
Looking at the spower, Aaron Summers dropped something yesterday

[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.120]
She was in that control room and man, he was wheeling that little chair back a little further

[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.480]
Almost into the guy, damn window back there

[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.840]
Aaron Summers is okay and everybody's booking this building

[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.160]
She's really, she's a lot better than I thought

[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.860]
She's gonna start Monday, eight to midnight on a station, I guarantee you

[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.100]
She'll have the highest rated show in this market

[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.680]
Make no mistake, AMF, MP, MBM, shortwave

[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.820]
She will have double digit numbers at night, Aaron Summers

[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.360]
And even though she has no idea what she's talking about, that's not what it is important

[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.880]
She's got a great ass, she's got big, very, very well-shaped tutors

[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.580]
She's got a nut, and I'll tell you something, you know, Christy Brinkley

[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.340]
I mean, I'm sorry, which one am I thinking about?

[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.220]
Now, now I'm getting confused

[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.400]
See, I always get those two confused and I'm gonna say the wrong thing and everybody

[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.640]
Oh, how could you say that?

[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.700]
Which is the one I'm talking about?

[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.220]
Oh, Cindy Crawford, I'm sorry, I always get her confused with Christy Brinkley

[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.900]
And I apologize to Christy Brinkley because that was a shot

[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.900]
What is the big deal with Cindy Crawford?

[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.600]
Do you think she's a hot babe?

[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.020]
No, she has a mole, that big deal

[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.740]
She's got a skanky looking face man, her nose, she needs a nose job

[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:50.580]
She's bad, Cindy Crawford

[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.560]
She couldn't lick Christy Brinkley's ass, I'll tell you that right now

[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.080]
Or air in summers, although it might be, a lot of guys would like to watch

[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.980]
20 past 11 at WIOD

[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.580]
Some things in life are easy to describe

[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.400]
Like the way Madonna looks at five in the morning

[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.620]
The stadium the morning after a night game

[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.260]
And a hangover after too much tequila

[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:13.860]
But how do you describe the Phil Hendry Show on 610 WIOD?

[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.800]
Send your answers to WIOD

[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.580]
Miami 33141

[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.540]
And in the meantime, imagine turning on a night light

[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.820]
Rolling over to see the Phil Hendry Show

[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.080]
2 to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday

[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.320]
On news, talk and entertainment radio

[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.800]
610 WIOD

[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.240]
Oi

[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.460]
610 WIOD

[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.700]
Where the seven words you can't say on radio are down to two

[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.760]
Mr. Merrick Madditch, he's a european

[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.240]
Saturday night on CBS

[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.100]
Eat it is back from the dead

[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.860]
It's the 20th anniversary of all in the family

[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.720]
Oh, rookie death

[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.620]
If it ain't John Jell-A-Wee

[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.240]
Daddy, don't be such a cool

[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.060]
What is now, what ever happened to my little girl?

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:00.980]
Look at you

[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.680]
Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh?

[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.720]
Maybe you have a salad once in a while?

[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.120]
Daddy, don't you know how many of the world's people have never had a decent meal?

[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.380]
Again with the charity Spirats

[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.780]
Well, it's true

[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.340]
Charles, why don't you send them the bones from the taiki you had for breakfast?

[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.360]
What about a moon?

[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.760]
I call them against all she's prepared

[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.140]
The death I taught you was pushing off days, you smile

[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:33.240]
Oh, now watching the last episode was all a bad dream

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.780]
It seems so bad to me

[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.760]
Look, who was it back there, Beded?

[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.460]
Who's to die off, you can give me an edgy beer

[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.060]
That's 20th anniversary of all in the family

[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.380]
Saturday night on CBS

[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.780]
Brought to you by IBS Home Car Respondent School

[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.400]
Where you can learn auto mechanics, gun repair, and back to the show

[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.360]
You guys are so over

[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.420]
Have you seen her lately?

[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.540]
She has ballooned up

[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.680]
Now they only show her from the forehead up

[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.400]
I mean her face is that she's got a head that's as fat as Lord-ass Limbaugh's ass

[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.540]
She is just gigantic

[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.440]
She is a monstrous

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.520]
She looks beastung

[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.820]
Like an allergy

[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.880]
How about beastly?

[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.660]
Oh, man is she gross

[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.720]
But hey Gloria, you're the Beth

[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.460]
And old Rob Reiner, he's looking real good too, now isn't it?

[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.000]
Yeah, here's North Miami, hello

[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.480]
Hello, this is Neil

[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.100]
Yes sir

[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.180]
Okay, I'm one of the Ron Ron couple

[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:25.940]
Now listen to this

[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:26.160]
Alright

[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.080]
Well, I listen to them in the morning

[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.400]
And then I flush the year of show

[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.940]
And then to Bill Henry

[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.960]
And I'm really mad about this

[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.840]
Said a four garbage man

[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.200]
They're gonna get what they deserve

[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.000]
They're gonna get about a one share over there in the morning

[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.700]
Yeah, I really like rock and roll music

[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.600]
And in the kind of garbage they put on here

[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.740]
I just just put that on here

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.820]
Yeah, and it's gonna get worse

[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.900]
I just, Ron Ron was the only thing I used to listen

[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.080]
And half am, that's all

[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.200]
There you go

[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:56.760]
Alright

[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.380]
Kisses is a good biopal

[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.000]
And have a great life

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.920]
See ya

[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.860]
And get a new phone

[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.820]
We have an open line in date 751

[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.860]
And one in brown or in 524

[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.600]
And at Green Line we gave away Shinler's list to somebody on the Green Line

[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.840]
I'm sorry, I apologize

[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.140]
What an act of stupidity on my part

[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.240]
I can't believe I did that

[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.060]
Where's that guy live? You got his address?

[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.240]
Where are we sending that tape to?

[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:15.620]
Jupiter

[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.260]
Oh, like I said, that's okay

[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.280]
I thought maybe he was in Boka

[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.680]
Oh, God, would that be disgusting if we gave it to somebody in Boka?

[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.200]
Oh, fat

[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.180]
Here's a lady in Pompodow on a starline

[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:27.660]
Hello

[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.660]
How's the hang in mail?

[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.200]
Okay

[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.300]
How's the anchor in the acre straight?

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.480]
How's the wine?

[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.520]
The anchor in the acre straight?

[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.640]
I don't see him too much

[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.960]
Except every once in a while when they're sitting up there on the sunrise over by the corner of a hundred and eighteen

[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.120]
Shooting their thing down the street

[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.480]
And I'm always going nice and slow

[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.840]
Well, I might take off somebody and do a sprag

[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.700]
Okay, go ahead

[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.020]
We have an open line in a brown or in 524

[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.000]
One on the starline

[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.760]
And star IOD

[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.540]
And one on the Green Line

[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.620]
1-800-944-9463

[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.640]
Are we going to hear from a woman today who's got anything to say about anything?

[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.100]
I mean, I just can't believe that. Of course, we didn't have a good friend Doris. She was kind of a caricature of herself

[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.300]
And then we had, who else did we hear?

[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.340]
The bigot lady

[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:12.040]
Oh, yeah, they're women from Boka who wanted to talk about those Cubans again, about those goddamn Cubans again

[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040]
Thank goodness no white people commit crimes

[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.780]
That's right. Thank goodness that Charlie Manson was Cuban

[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.220]
And David Berkowitz and that guy who's shooting up the abortion clinics, he must be Cuban too, right?

[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.620]
There's even a few white people committing crimes out there. Honey, how do you like that?

[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.780]
You bigoted old bitch that they just can't let it go. They can't let it go

[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.180]
I don't know if they are going to go to the bathroom or to the room

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.100]
Alright!

[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:38.620]
There you go. Stick that in your pocketbook honey and twist it

[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.580]
And a Green Line is just sitting there. Look at that.

[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:46.460]
Okay, well I guess we forgot about these tickets we got for the big game. There isn't any big game but we got a bunch of tickets

[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.740]
And we're only giving them way to people on the Green Line

[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.060]
At 1-800-944-1-2-1-2

[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:58.140]
Let's give away that golf cart absolutely free, little used a little used golf cart almost in pristine condition

[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:03.320]
Like that pristine bullet that went through John Connelly's wrist, body, John Kennedy's brain and Jack Wilens hat

[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.060]
And the offender of the limousine

[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.940]
Let's go to South Miami. Hello?

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.120]
Hey Neil? Yes sir. I've got a title for the sequel for Shindler's List

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.860]
Yes sir? Shindler's Pist

[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.940]
Do I know the fourth on here? I thought I was going to start Brian Cox

[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.840]
Well, we can let that out

[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.540]
I'm pissed off man. That would be great. I can just see it right now

[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.320]
Breaking in the fortenites to buy more juice

[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.200]
Uh-huh. Well give it to both of Brian maybe you can do something with it

[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.320]
Okay, good luck you

[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.880]
We have an open line in day 751

[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:36.080]
We do have that Shindler's List thing. Did we ever put that in here? I doubt it's not really all that great. It's okay. I might even play it. I doubt it

[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.080]
Let's do we did South Miami. Here's the lady in Westchester. Hello?

[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:40.980]
Hi

[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.160]
I want to give you a suggestion

[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.680]
I suggested of what?

[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.280]
I said about WIOD instead of saying that, say 9463

[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.900]
Luckily I just remembered the number that's all I got you

[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.460]
Uh-huh. Luckily for who?

[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.880]
Well, what would you say WIOD instead of saying WIOD at 9463

[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.620]
Okay, just call 9463

[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.580]
Okay. Just okay if you're in date 9463

[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:06.900]
Right

[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.880]
Okay. Everything's alright

[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.200]
Everything's alright

[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.220]
Yeah, that's good

[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.440]
I'm listening to something

[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.220]
Well, I'm glad I'm glad everything's alright

[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.580]
Okay, and don't forget now 9463

[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.220]
Right, okay, how do you say that in Spanish?

[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.660]
How do you say that in Spanish?

[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:22.660]

[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:22.820]
How do you say that in Spanish?

[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.480]
I can't speak Spanish

[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.120]
Nueve

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.740]
Wow, yeah, what is that saying?

[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.980]
Nueve, Quattro

[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.620]
Oh

[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.420]
Quattro, SACE, it trace

[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.140]
Wow, you can try it in Spanish

[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.580]
Scented trace, huh?

[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.880]
You taught me three words

[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.480]
There you go

[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.080]
Here's another word

[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:40.780]
Here's another word

[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:41.780]
Adios

[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.760]
We have an open line in date 751 on a green line 189

[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.160]
No, wait a minute, I'm sorry

[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.460]
9463

[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.580]
If you're on a green line in Boca West Palm, Jupiter Uranus

[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.780]
9463, okay, don't dial anything

[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.820]
I'll just keep pick up that phone and keep dialing 9463

[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.800]
My allergies act in up again and here today

[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.200]
I have a feeling that very shortly I'm going to be dashing through the snow

[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.020]
Just like Santa and his reindeer

[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.520]
I'm going to be dashing through that giant pile of mong

[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.000]
Oh, I'm sorry, that's Jeff High

[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.300]
In the hallway there, I thought it was a pile of mong

[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.720]
A mong pile, well same difference, here's Pompato Beach, hello

[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.100]
Hi, is this 9463?

[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260]
This is it, Sunny?

[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.560]
You know Sally Struthers is so huge

[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.280]
The only thing I can think of compared to would be the size of Rush Limbaugh's head

[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.320]
Yeah, like I said, like Rush's ass on a bad day

[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.600]
If you were seen as size of that head, I mean I accidentally turned the channel and it took up the whole damn screen

[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.580]
Who, who is her his?

[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.040]
I've never seen his head nor do I have any desire to see it

[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.280]
Well, Neil, this is Boyd Bragg

[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.840]
I know, I think anybody could find it

[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.820]
We have an open line in day 751, 1 and Broward, 524, 1 on the Green Line, 1-800

[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.940]
Did he get cut off?

[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.180]
He started talking head stuff and he got cut right off, that's a shame

[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.280]
He is off limits now, he's out

[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.480]
Wouldn't you agree?

[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.140]
You are beyond chronic, you have nothing to say, you're beyond chronic, you must

[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.080]
I'm going to do you a big favor seriously, I'm going to force you

[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.400]
Even if it feels bad in the beginning, just like a little SNM

[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.100]
I'm going to force you to find a life

[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.780]
Even if it hurts, you must find a hobby

[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.860]
Badminton would be good, you can go out there and play with that old shuttlecock

[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.860]
You can take up surfing would be great, although I think shuffleboard might be the board that you're looking for

[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.320]
Whatever it is, just grab it and go with it, but go somewhere and do a fast grab

[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.400]
Go away, please

[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.720]
In fact, maybe Lenny the Limbo Driver will pick you up in the tube you can have a long chat about chronic doses

[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.980]
Oh my god, he's just out of control

[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.400]
And just, you know, it starts sailing right along

[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.040]
Oh, this is Greg, get out of here

[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.980]
One thing I don't like on this show is chronicosis, man

[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.040]
I don't want no chronic, it's the kiss of death

[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.180]
I don't want to hear no talk, so you hear the same god damn half dozen people every day who have nothing to say

[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.240]
The same old people like old Bonnie from Kendall

[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.340]
Now Bonnie's bringing in the family, the Gonsa Mishbhukhas moving down here

[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.880]
So she can line up the verbal artillery down there

[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.220]
And then it was Sandy and Bobby and this one and that one

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.940]
All these front-running phonies who are looking you're asked one day

[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.180]
And then all of a sudden the next day before even washing it off, they're looking somebody else's

[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:03.760]
I think that's disgusting, grotesque and certainly hazardous to your health

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.580]
1232, see it's not 1232, I just do that time of the see if you react

[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.640]
It is somewhere like probably out in the middle of the ocean, it's 1232

[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.360]
Maybe in the Bahamas, man, maybe in Brazil

[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.000]
You know what I haven't played in a long time and I'm just dying for it right now

[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.120]
Like Tom Hopkins would say I'm really horny for it right now

[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.180]
Where the hell is it?

[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.160]
I played the little clip from it but I haven't played the whole, like I said, anytime I've played it, I'm not sure

[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.760]
I'm looking for something for it, get it

[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.840]
You know it's gonna be gone, all the way this particular case, it just happened to a finger it right now

[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.400]
I want to take this brave dress up

[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.340]
Like many tap-pordeops

[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.580]
Like a brave braid

[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.840]
Let me bathe you

[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.120]
Oh, alright

[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:08.860]
Yeah!

[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:09.880]
Yes!

[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:12.960]
Yes!

[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:13.800]

[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.080]
Yes!

[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.140]
Yes!

[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.100]
Yes!

[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:16.520]
Yes!

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:16.520]

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:16.520]

[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:16.560]

[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:18.760]
Yes!

[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:19.220]

[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:20.960]
Yes!

[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.120]
Can you imagine the on-race cater and mandates together?

[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.360]
That would be a broadcast.

[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.240]
Man, you'd have to get new speakers after every game.

[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.000]
I'll quarantine you that.

[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.940]
1133 at WIOD.

[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.380]
16, WIOD.

[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:38.400]
Delivering daily without warning sickness.

[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.580]
I need help.

[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.580]
We need some help.

[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.640]
Man, I need help.

[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.600]
We need some help.

[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.360]
We need some help.

[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.340]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.580]
This is Rush Limbaugh, Servant of Humidity, Talk Show Host, Hemroyd Suffer.

[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.940]
Folks, at over 300 pounds, I know the agony of this kind of dilemma.

[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.160]
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you there's help.

[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.660]
With new Preparation Rush and my Rush to Excellence Suppositories.

[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.020]
Now you can end the pain and itching of hemorrhoidal tissue.

[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:13.080]
Just look for my picture on the box of suppositories and the applicator tube.

[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.280]
Find product from OIV, the obesity and broadcasting network.

[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:18.900]
All right.

[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.280]
Okay, 1137 at WIOD on an ass-kicking Wednesday.

[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.600]
Somebody's getting a kick somewhere.

[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.340]
I guarantee you that.

[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.760]
How about those dolphins, huh?

[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:26.340]
All right.

[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.900]
Let's jump on that bandwagon.

[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.160]
You notice we haven't had one call.

[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.540]
Well, we had one call about Rod and Rod.

[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.660]
Thank you so much, your, sure, sir, for making me feel like I didn't waste a half an hour, one call.

[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.800]
And then the thing about the, the Shufflin off to, wherever they're Shufflin,

[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:40.980]
oh, they're Shufflin their feet.

[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.980]
Maybe they learned that from Wally Hensley at Pompe no Park.

[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.620]
Sorry, Wally A, just a joke, okay?

[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.100]
As these signals on which horse is going to win the race, right?

[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:48.980]
Fat Rich, ride.

[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.660]
At a boy Richie, you're so full of it, man.

[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.480]
It's coming out your nose.

[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.160]
And I just don't understand.

[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.900]
See, I told you that they wouldn't respawn of that.

[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.740]
I mean, forget about the guys holding hands in a huddle.

[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.520]
They won't talk about that.

[01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.540]
They don't want to think about it.

[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.760]
But the fact that these, uh, and why is it that only black players are allowed to do that?

[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.140]
Is that just come natural?

[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.480]
That the step-and-fetch it routine and all that jive has crap?

[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.660]
And then getting down kneeling in the end zone and, uh, doing all that stuff?

[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.520]
Is that, is that a black thing?

[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.900]
Did Alex Haley write about that?

[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.180]
See, you don't want to say it either.

[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.600]
What were you going to say?

[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.540]
Who else would work, too?

[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.820]
Well, I don't, I don't know, but why do they want to?

[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.560]
That's my point.

[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.680]
I don't understand it.

[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.400]
Because everybody else is laughing at that.

[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.640]
Just like when people are illiterate and can't express themselves,

[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.280]
people don't respect that.

[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.280]
They frown upon that.

[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.040]
And nobody wants to get that message across.

[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.260]
It's kind of like, you know, this is the way things are supposed to be by design.

[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.780]
And it's, uh, said that nobody, you know, and, uh, I'm telling you, it's just, yeah.

[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.140]
And the same thing with Frank Costa getting a nail for losing that game there today.

[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.840]
Not that I want to rehash the fact that Nebraska beat Miami in the orange pool.

[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.160]
Oh!

[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:48.800]
What I do.

[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.400]
But, uh, what is that?

[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.580]
Is that because he's Italian?

[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.040]
Do we have some kind of an, I'm going to call it Italian defamation league right now.

[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.180]
I'm going to get on the phone right now.

[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:01.060]
The same people who were very, very right in protesting against the Godfather.

[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.320]
I remember when Joe Dajiola, who grew up on Dego Hill.

[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.180]
Can I say that in St. Louis with Yogi Berra?

[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:06.700]
He did.

[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.420]
That's what they call the Dego Hill in St. Louis.

[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.600]
All the Italian, all the talent, all the talent in the Italians live there.

[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.560]
All the luxion.

[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.880]
And, uh, as in Luxion Kool, that's noodle pudding.

[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.800]
See, you're learning what, what, what, what an education you get from this show.

[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.920]
What a tremendously educational show this is.

[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.200]
In fact, probably, uh, it's too good to be on PBS and Newt Gingrich agrees.

[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:30.320]
What a little fat, what a hypocritical little fat-faced slime ball.

[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.860]
Oh, CBS was so unprofessional.

[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.800]
Just because, see, he never responded to the fact.

[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.080]
Never denied that he told his mother that, uh, that, uh, what's her name?

[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:38.840]
Hillary is a bitch.

[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:39.740]
What's her, Puss?

[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:40.920]
She's a bitch.

[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:41.520]
Of course she is.

[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.380]
Here's a mobile and store.

[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:43.720]
Hello.

[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:44.940]
Neil, how are you?

[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:45.400]
Pretty good.

[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.580]
Good to talk to you.

[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.160]
This came over from the Tampa area.

[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.880]
All I got to say is, if I start taking S.U.N.

[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.420]
As Paul say, are going down, baby.

[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.020]
Are they really?

[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:53.920]
Oh my god.

[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.020]
Yeah, S.U.N.

[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.220]
S.U.N. was over there for vacation over New Year's.

[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.720]
And he said that they sounded comatose.

[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.100]
Oh, it's, it's terrible.

[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.340]
I'm telling you, thank the Paul S.U.N.

[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.280]
Now, I'll put them in the emergency room right now.

[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:07.860]
Another thing, I'm like, uh, also, I looking forward to the, uh,

[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:09.980]
Yeah, last, uh, I talked to last, uh, he said they were kicking.

[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.280]
That's right.

[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:11.600]
Yeah.

[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.780]
Looking forward to football this weekend.

[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:17.200]
But all I've got to say is, as long as Will McDonough's around,

[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.620]
America will never be beautiful.

[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.200]
Okay.

[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:19.880]
Thank you.

[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.460]
And he's got, can you see Will McDonough and, uh, and Wayne Huzinghi together again.

[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.080]
The crater pie.

[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:33.120]
It's, uh, 1140 at, uh, uh, uh, uh, around and around and about.

[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.420]
Here's Sunrise.

[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:34.780]
Hello.

[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:35.920]
Say, Neil.

[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:36.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.220]
How you doing, Arla?

[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.720]
I used to listen to Ron and Ron until I got a backstab this morning.

[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.640]
And I had a twist that, you know.

[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.080]
It must, uh, you must be bleeding.

[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.760]
And then they rub the salt in the wound by putting that Paul Castronova on.

[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.940]
That's really, that's really rubbing it.

[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.600]
I can scrape stuff from underneath the refrigerator.

[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.680]
It sounds better than he does.

[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.920]
I hope they really do not think that's going to help their ratings any.

[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.380]
They, they're not going to have any, so they won't have to worry about it.

[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.040]
They won't have ratings.

[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.500]
I mean, he's got off on his friend.

[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680]
They're, uh, Ron Brewer there.

[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.780]
What a waste of air time that is.

[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.140]
Yep.

[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.960]
And so you know, I'm listening to Rick and Sousa all the time now.

[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:01.520]
All right.

[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:02.560]
Now we're talking.

[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.520]
Now we bring the people back to AM where, uh, the real crap is going on.

[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.180]
Yeah, no, and I can pick you up everywhere.

[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.180]
I don't have to worry about, uh, finding the station for running, running, running, anymore.

[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:11.580]
Exactly.

[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.040]
So, uh, I just like to say, build packs on the douchebag.

[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:14.520]
Okay.

[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:15.000]
Thank you.

[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.040]
I'm not going to see buddy, but you're not fooling anybody.

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.840]
You're about as credible as Jay Barker.

[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.460]
I wouldn't be surprised if the two of them are doing it.

[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:27.120]
Open line and Broward, 524WI would be one out, but I sure hope not.

[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.120]
One on the green line, one out, uh, oh, I'm sorry, 9463.

[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.320]
On the green line.

[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.540]
If you're in a boat, good, Del Ray.

[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.320]
Just pick up the phone and down 9463.

[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.420]
And Georgia will answer it.

[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.220]
No problem.

[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.920]
Here's Miami on the purple line.

[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.180]
Hello.

[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.060]
Yeah.

[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:39.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.040]
Uh, Neil, yeah, uh, did you, uh, first of all, I want to thank you for the CD.

[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.020]
You're a gift for my daughter.

[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.540]
Which, oh, the one I signed, yeah.

[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.500]
Yeah, when you signed, uh, and did you see that magazine I brought in about.

[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:52.560]
Las Vegas.

[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.020]
When did you bring that the same day?

[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.120]
I dropped off the magazine Las Vegas life.

[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.600]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.720]
Well, that's a wild go.

[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:01.940]
Yeah.

[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.180]
Oh, it's about a week in a half.

[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.820]
Right. That to me, that's a long time ago.

[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:05.180]
Yeah.

[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.000]
When you're old and seen, I'll, man, when you're old in the feebrile.

[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.120]
But just, uh, that article about the weightings over.

[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:11.860]
Yeah.

[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.780]
Can you imagine one hotel employing 12,000 five hundred?

[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.660]
I understand, but I don't see it's too depressing.

[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.780]
It's only the fourth of the year.

[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.280]
We don't want to have to go through this whole thing again about how, uh, you know,

[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.420]
our care this place is.

[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.140]
And the fact that we live in the dead estate in America because it's, it's true, but it's very depressing.

[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.180]
It's morbid.

[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:27.920]
Yeah.

[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.060]
All we, all we have to say is Florida sucks.

[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.680]
There you go.

[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.380]
Two words, some of all of.

[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.280]
Now, we had a great time out there.

[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.300]
We were out there for about five days and had a great time.

[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.000]
You can't beat it.

[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.480]
You have to have a great time in Vegas.

[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.280]
If you're not, you have to have your pulse taken.

[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.560]
If you go there, don't have a great time.

[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.500]
You have to be a dead head.

[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.640]
You have to be a moron.

[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.540]
And we don't gamble.

[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.560]
My wife and I, you know, don't have to gamble.

[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.460]
No, it was fantastic.

[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.080]
That's right.

[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.880]
And, uh, the trip was cheaper than taking a cruise.

[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:53.300]
Right.

[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:53.860]
Oh, please.

[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.880]
Now you're really getting me going.

[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:56.700]
Gambling and cruising.

[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.120]
You mentioned it both on the same day.

[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:58.880]
Don't do it, pal.

[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.100]
But we did find a fabulous Chinese restaurant out there under shopping center of all places.

[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:03.440]
Really?

[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:03.980]
Yeah.

[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:04.640]
What's it called?

[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.340]
Uh, Changs of Las Vegas.

[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:08.260]
Yeah.

[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.920]
Uh, the shrimp were fresh.

[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.560]
They come, they have a tank right there.

[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.000]
A jumbo, you know, giant shrimp.

[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:14.700]
Mm-hmm.

[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:15.840]
And so we ordered shrimp.

[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.320]
Molo's Chinese shrimp, I think, is the operative word always.

[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:18.800]
Yeah.

[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.920]
And then they had a fish tank there where they caught the live fish also in case you ordered a fresh fish.

[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.300]
Beauty.

[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.380]
I'll mark it on my list on Shindler's list.

[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:27.980]
Yeah.

[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:28.960]
Well, have a great day, pal.

[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:29.460]
Okay.

[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.300]
Nice hearing from you.

[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:30.620]
Bye.

[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.520]
Here's another guy just had a great time in Vegas.

[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.820]
We don't want to have that here.

[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.080]
We don't want the evil of gambling here.

[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:36.480]
God forbid.

[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.060]
By the way, see it, Pompato Park tonight.

[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:38.500]
Oh, sorry.

[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.040]
We don't want no gambling in this town, do we?

[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.740]
No way, Jose or Evo or Esther.

[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.220]
We don't want no gambling here because that would bring in lots of crime.

[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.800]
Thank God we live in a community where everybody can be safe.

[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.180]
If they padlocked the door and never leave the house, maybe, maybe.

[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.420]
Let's go to a Miami, Buenos dias.

[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.760]
This is Rods, a John on that.

[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.020]
Hey, Rod, how you doing, Rod?

[01:16:59.140 --> 01:16:59.600]
How are you, baby?

[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.140]
Yeah.

[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.420]
Be sure to list the box.

[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.600]
Yes, there are no balls on that.

[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.060]
Four nine.

[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.580]
All right, Rods, a job.

[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.520]
Take it a break from doing that.

[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.220]
I'm going to do a great PNL.

[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.220]
So it's our first out.

[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:08.720]
Well, it's not our first out.

[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.500]
Sorry about that.

[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.720]
I thought it was our first out anyway.

[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:10.980]
Yeah.

[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.560]
Who is that?

[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.240]
Okay, I know you want me to get the card out.

[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.840]
I didn't want to do it.

[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:16.940]
I didn't want to do it.

[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.140]
Like El Jolson said, you made me do it and I do it.

[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.700]
Where the hell is that card?

[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.040]
Now, see, that's the problem.

[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.480]
You start looking for those damn cards that you can't find out.

[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:25.780]
I mean, what?

[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.580]
Okay, I think we got the...

[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.800]
Let me get a little bit more compression going here.

[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.520]
The little lumpy here, myself, the gravelers.

[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.840]
I got five, baby.

[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.360]
Hey, 75 degrees in the magic city.

[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.560]
Hey, we're broadcasting live.

[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.500]
Hold on a second.

[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.880]
Let me stop that over.

[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.600]
75 degrees in the magic city.

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.100]
Hills over, Grayson.

[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.360]
Oh, I'ma go already, old dog.

[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.500]
Come on down with it.

[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.840]
We're going to get down to that.

[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.340]
We're going to get down to that.

[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:51.920]
We're going to get down to that.

[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.920]
It's the right time.

[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.260]
What the hell am I talking about?

[01:17:59.020 --> 01:17:59.900]
I still...

[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.000]
I just amazed at that.

[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:01.840]
That couldn't have happened twice.

[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.240]
I hope that Phil Henry is listening right now.

[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.220]
You talk about a blind talk up, man.

[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.480]
No timing.

[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:08.920]
No, you gotta see that's the old trick.

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:09.800]
I mean, you know, getting...

[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:14.200]
In fact, that's what really pissed me off is when I used to start putting the times of the musical intros on the cart.

[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.740]
I mean, anybody can look at a timer into a talk up.

[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.900]
What kind of talent does that take?

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.660]
The kind of talent that you find on FM.

[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.340]
That's the kind.

[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:20.800]
None.

[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.380]
A bunch of voices.

[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.720]
All so, a bunch of kid curries.

[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.760]
All sound the same, man.

[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:25.620]
No talent.

[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:26.280]
No personality.

[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.700]
No, not on nothing.

[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.520]
We have an open line in date.

[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:31.900]
75...

[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.380]
I'm not on a green line at 9463.

[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.020]
Here's a lady in Key Largo.

[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:35.300]
Hello.

[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.220]
Key Largo, I've been waiting so long.

[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.480]
I'm almost in Florida City.

[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.320]
I'm on the stretch.

[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:40.940]
All right.

[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.580]
You're making progress.

[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.020]
You're almost heading towards civilization.

[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.260]
If you keep going a few hundred miles, you'll make it.

[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:46.660]
I know.

[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.160]
You know.

[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.120]
This is the first time I've ever called you.

[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:49.620]
Why not?

[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:50.700]
I just...

[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.900]
Well, you know, I think it's because...

[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.880]
You get so used to hearing you all the time.

[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:55.220]
Yeah.

[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.240]
And I know I got this mobile, but I never call.

[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.620]
But the thought that Bell South is gonna pull out.

[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:02.300]
All of a sudden this morning I'm in a feeding frenzy.

[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.520]
It is scary when you hear that they're gonna pull out.

[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.000]
That's right.

[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.780]
You know, can I say something about Miami Dolphin?

[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:09.920]
You can say whatever you like.

[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.360]
This is America until Congress convenes today.

[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.320]
You can say whatever you like.

[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.840]
I think they're playing Great Ball.

[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.280]
And I just can't wait for the day when Jimmy Johnson catches the team.

[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.420]
Oh, right.

[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.440]
So I've been waiting for three years.

[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:21.920]
Yeah.

[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.680]
I keep digging when's it gonna happen?

[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.840]
Here's another vote against Brainstem Shulah.

[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.600]
I can't believe it.

[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.580]
I've been that way for four years,

[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.080]
but nobody wants to hear me.

[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:30.300]

[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.720]
Yeah, up until a year ago when you said that,

[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:36.500]
it was like, you were gonna dump my own martini on my head.

[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.640]
But now people are willing to listen.

[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.320]
Now they're willing.

[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.800]
Now they're all Johnson for it.

[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.120]
Yeah.

[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:44.500]
Now can I just really run Erickson through the rain or here?

[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:45.540]
Please go right ahead.

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.780]
I think that the team...

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.640]
Now about before you go into that, well maybe that's what you're gonna talk about.

[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.480]
Are you gonna respond to what I said about the Givestirkeys out there in the field,

[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.580]
like a bunch of assholes?

[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:54.320]
No.

[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:54.880]
Why not?

[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.460]
You don't agree with that.

[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.040]
I don't think that's the issue.

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:58.760]
The issue is very...

[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.000]
I didn't say whether it's the issue,

[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.740]
but you certainly must have a feeling about that,

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.380]
that you probably do not wish to articulate.

[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.740]
Now if they can do that, they wanna do that and play great ball.

[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.360]
I say more power to them.

[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.500]
Oh, I don't agree.

[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.520]
But that's okay.

[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.400]
It's time to shut it down and get down to the game.

[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.640]
You can have fun when you do that.

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.380]
But what does that mean?

[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:15.780]
They lie.

[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.800]
It's a college football team.

[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.940]
They lost a couple of games.

[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.400]
I mean, do they have to win every week?

[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.820]
But that's not the issue.

[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.320]
Do they have to win every week to get a few fans to show up?

[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:24.620]
Yeah.

[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:26.700]
What is it?

[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.360]
What is his story besides he drinks too much milk?

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.240]
What is the problem with that?

[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.140]
I don't care what he drinks.

[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:30.680]
He's all right.

[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.720]
He's an okay guy.

[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:32.620]
But when a team...

[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.500]
When a bunch of young men who are trying to play their heart out anyway...

[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.220]
I don't think you like his...

[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.460]
I don't think you like his kids' complexion.

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.000]
That's the problem.

[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.740]
His son's got that crater face too.

[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:43.440]
I don't know.

[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:44.500]
I never thought about that.

[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.180]
But I've never thought about that.

[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.060]
Was that his son?

[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.300]
That's not his son, Craig Erickson.

[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.740]
That's not Dennis Erickson's son.

[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.760]
I don't know about Craig Erickson.

[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:53.960]
Was he his son?

[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.680]
I don't think so.

[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.900]
He's got a kid that plays football.

[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.380]
That was his son wasn't George.

[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.680]
He wouldn't care what I was saying.

[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.080]
I'm listening, but I'm interspersing some interesting stuff in with the two.

[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:01.440]
Go ahead.

[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.900]
Well, my problem with Erickson is that these guys are like a little more than halfway through the season.

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.120]
He starts talking about entertaining other coaching jobs.

[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:10.860]
Yeah.

[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.840]
What kind of way is that to act?

[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.600]
What do you mean they're halfway through the season?

[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:15.560]
When did he say that?

[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.580]
When did he say that?

[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:17.820]
When did he say that?

[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:18.140]
When did he say that?

[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.220]
When did he say that?

[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.620]
When did he say that?

[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.580]
What about a month or so or a month and a half ago?

[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.720]
He was looking around.

[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.820]
He didn't say that.

[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.860]
And he was considered.

[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.140]
He didn't say it.

[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.140]
I heard him say it.

[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:30.160]

[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.320]
During the season he said it.

[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:31.400]
I heard him say it.

[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.220]
During the seeded broad crack cast and walk away.

[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.400]
Well, we'll pack him a sandwich.

[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.260]
I'm a glass of milk.

[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:36.560]
I think so.

[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.940]
Jimmy Johnson back at UM.

[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:39.600]
Yeah.

[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:40.600]
Well, no.

[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:46.060]
I don't know who's going to coach UM in the end, but the defensive coach, I think, does a fine job.

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.040]
He'd make a good head coach.

[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:47.740]
Okay.

[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.940]
But Jimmy Johnson does really good.

[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.620]
Let's bring Bill Arn's bar to coach you of it.

[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.380]
He's a good ball.

[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:03.440]

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:03.460]

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:03.460]

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:03.460]

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:03.460]

[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:38.960]

[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:39.380]
He's a good ball.

[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:39.640]
He's a good ball.

[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:39.640]

[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.060]
He's a good ball.

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.060]

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.060]

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.060]

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.060]

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.060]

[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:43.300]

[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:43.300]

[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:43.740]

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.000]

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.000]

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.000]

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.200]
He's a good ball.

He's a good ball.

[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:08.960]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.560]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.540]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.420]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.100]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.400]
He's a good ball.

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.280]
I sure do.

[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.160]
Or maybe if I get my tongue in the right position, right Luis?

[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.160]
Right?

[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:25.580]
Yes.

[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.200]
We have an open line on the star line.

[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.200]
Use it or lose it baby.

[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.020]
Use that star line.

[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:33.300]
If the people at Bell South mobility perceive that line is dead for more than like five seconds

[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.920]
they're yanking it right away in the line too.

[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.160]
I don't want to start playing butch balls, Diana.

[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.680]
It's 1150 at WIOD.

[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.320]
Sixth ten WIOD.

[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.380]
For better reception.

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.340]
Take off your clothes and raise your antenna.

[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.680]
Don't show up.

[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.240]
Oh!

[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.340]
Not to be outdone by the mad dog.

[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.880]
The coach released an album of his own.

[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.400]
A collection of hand-tick tools sung by the coach himself.

[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.500]
Cause you will see one fine dead.

[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.220]
You will look at me.

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.720]
You're gonna know what's out of you.

[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.280]
What meant to be the one who did.

[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.980]
One fine dead.

[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.420]
You're gonna want me or your girl.

[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.440]
I like it.

[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.160]
Never sound as old fine.

[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.520]
It's old fine.

[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.420]
It's old fine.

[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:25.780]
It's old fine.

[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:26.360]
Yeah.

[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:28.540]
My baby.

[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.520]
Stop on fine.

[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.800]
Same with Jesus up in there my wife.

[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:34.780]
Roo.

[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.140]
Oh, yeah.

[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:37.880]
It's old fine.

[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.340]
One fine.

[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.680]
One and one I recall.

[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.520]
The wife that brown brown.

[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.880]
Jesus loves me.

[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.520]
I feel fine.

[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.020]
And for a change of taste.

[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.260]
The coach is all time favorite.

[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.920]
My guy is red-high.

[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.920]
Your guy Lee Dooley squat.

[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.300]
Well, my guy Lee's red-high.

[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.300]
But your guy Lee Dooley squat.

[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.840]
If she's got my money, now she's really got a lot of money.

[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.560]
Well, he's so fine.

[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.060]
He's so fine.

[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.620]
He's so fine.

[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.320]
He's so fine.

[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.180]
He's so fine.

[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.160]
He's so fine.

[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:19.780]
He's so fine.

[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:19.780]

[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:20.420]
He's so fine.

[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.340]
He's so fine.

[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:21.340]

[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:21.340]

[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:21.340]

[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.380]
We need some help.

[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.160]
We need some help.

[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.640]
Love 55 at WI-D.

[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.700]
There's brainstems, Shula sings my favorite.

[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.280]
Let's go to North Lauderdale.

[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:28.520]
Hello.

[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.480]
Hi, Neil.

[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:29.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.060]
You were talking about the Shuckin and Jyvin players.

[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:33.520]
Yes.

[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.560]
And the holding hands.

[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.060]
Those are two separate issues, yeah.

[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.560]
And the kneeling on the ground.

[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:38.900]
Right.

[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.220]
In the end zone, right.

[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.760]
I don't know if anyone called in about this.

[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:45.780]
After the Detroit game, I'm a season ticket holder.

[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:52.240]
And a bunch of players gathered at midfield for the kneeling down in the prayer.

[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:52.980]
Really?

[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.480]
Do you know who was involved in that?

[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:57.940]
You mean dolphin players?

[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:58.340]
Yeah.

[01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:58.960]
I wouldn't think.

[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.380]
Not just dolphin players.

[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.260]
Dolphin Denny.

[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.440]
Dolphin.

[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:04.660]
Denny was involved in that?

[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:04.960]
Yes.

[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.220]
He is down there at midfield on his knees.

[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.180]
He ain't got a prayer.

[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.720]
You're into you that.

[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.840]
He was on his knees, huh?

[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.540]
Probably a lot of experience with that.

[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.620]
Dolphin Denny is a duck.

[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:16.480]
Oh!

[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.280]
And in closing, I have a comment to a Newt Gingrich.

[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:20.700]
Yes.

[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:21.200]
Listening.

[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.380]
Newt, our Black brothers have a very clear definition about something.

[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:32.100]
Our Black brothers say that a hoe is someone that will do everybody.

[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.880]
A bitch is someone that will do everybody but you.

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.020]
Smelly bitch.

[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:38.680]
Okay.

[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.200]
Bye.

[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.040]
Have a nice day.

[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.620]
That was Harry Smith calling it, by the way, from CBS this morning.

[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.180]
We have an open line in Broward, 9463, and one on the Starline at Star-I-O-D.

[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:49.540]
Yeah.

[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.300]
And of course, Newt, like I said, doesn't deny it.

[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.920]
He's a foul mouth duplicitous.

[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.100]
A wife stabbing.

[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.580]
I mean, oh, man.

[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.940]
She's dying of cancer in a hospital.

[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:58.800]
Come on, honey.

[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.660]
Sign on this divorce release here.

[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.080]
Let me out of here so I can go get a good deal.

[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.700]
I mean, so I can go have a good time in, so I can get out of here now.

[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.140]
Come on.

[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.220]
So I can go be a hot shot, dot the eye.

[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.980]
And the media there are enough feeding friends.

[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.980]
They got Newt I.

[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:15.540]
I mean, Bob Dole, he's boring as he always was, but they've got an obsession with this fat part.

[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.200]
They're just a fat face piece of dirt.

[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:18.780]
Here's Davey.

[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.000]
Hello.

[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:20.620]
Davey.

[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:21.940]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:22.420]
Okay.

[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:23.960]
First time caller, man.

[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.060]
I've listened to you a long time.

[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.620]
I usually work in during the week.

[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.760]
I don't get a chance to call you.

[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:28.340]
And you're off?

[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:29.080]
Yeah.

[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.060]
Was off yesterday, too.

[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:30.960]
Listen to y'all the yesterday.

[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:31.960]
Great.

[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:35.280]
Did you get a chance to see Hank Goldberg?

[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.420]
They had him on TV this morning.

[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.180]
Really?

[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:38.500]
Yeah.

[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.620]
You sound a little bit depressed.

[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.920]
Now I think I know the reason why.

[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.680]
He was talking to some people.

[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.300]
I guess it was his radio show, but they had a camera on him or whatever.

[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.460]
Are you cereal?

[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:48.780]

[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.760]
And now I know why he does radio.

[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.220]
That was Hank.

[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:55.740]
Yeah.

[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.720]
And he was talking about the show voting and stuff.

[01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.580]
And they were talking about.

[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:02.240]
A lot of people were calling up, you know, saying they ought to get Eric's out of there.

[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:02.800]
And that's that.

[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:07.240]
And he was saying that the show voting is nothing that's part of the game.

[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.020]
It is not part of the game.

[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.480]
How come it is that the white guys don't do that?

[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.760]
And for the black guys got like a separate set of rules.

[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.820]
And unless they're allowed to show boat, and act like a bunch of jivas, turkeys,

[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.640]
then suddenly somebody step it on their fun.

[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.720]
Now I will say this.

[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.860]
All these unsportsmen like penalty calls on spike in the ball or excessive celebration.

[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:28.160]
I think that's a bunch of crap whether they're white, black, or both, or a little bit of each.

[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.760]
But I mean, as far as all this, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.240]
The shuffling and jivin and all.

[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.920]
Oh man, that's just pathetic.

[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.160]
It's a rotesque.

[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:36.760]
It's embarrassing.

[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.260]
Well, what he was saying is that it was all right when Johnson was there and they were winning.

[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.200]
But now that they're not going on different things.

[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.560]
Well, you know something, I hate to break the news to you, Hank.

[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.280]
But when Johnson was there and they put on that thug routine and they wore those fatigues

[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.300]
and they went out to the festival.

[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.960]
And they got their ass kicked by Penn State and the festival.

[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.700]
People were bitching and groaning and moaning about it then too.

[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.460]
So he's got a short memory and as usual, he just isn't asking us.

[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.620]
That's Hank, the biggest ass kisser in town.

[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.200]
He must have a tongue as big as his pus.

[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:07.040]
Yeah, and he was pretty much cropping at the mouth too because everyone was, I mean,

[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.400]
he really looked like a rabbit dog.

[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.360]
He was going nuts on the phone.

[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:09.880]
There you go.

[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.380]
So I just wanted to let you know about that.

[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.680]
I started out this morning and I said you got a great show.

[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.260]
I'm going to call a couple of guys a douchebag, all right?

[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:17.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:22.560]
I'll tell John and Keith, you're a bunch of Don Schurler-loving douchebag.

[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:22.900]
Oh!

[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:23.440]

[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:24.740]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.280]
I'm going to get out of here.

[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:29.600]
Open line in Broward, 5249463, one on a purple line, one on a starline.

[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:30.360]
Starline!

[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.920]
Don't tell me that's disconnected.

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:34.640]
Now, Bell Soft Mobility, you better get on that baby because like I said,

[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.980]
I give them the amus man.

[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.740]
I told them they better use it or they lose it.

[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.680]
Like many other things in life, use that starline, fondle of caress it, love it.

[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.680]
Because they're going to yank that on us any second.
