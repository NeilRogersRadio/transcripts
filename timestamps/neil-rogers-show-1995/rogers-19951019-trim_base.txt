Is life worth endless nightmare of confusion and chaos leading to a bleak nothingness?

[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.540]
Or is it just me, PJ?

[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.760]
Why do I have dreams about my mother in Sarama?

[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.420]
Why did I give my life savings to a bizarre cult religion founded by a bad science fiction writer?

Am I worthy of seventh-level Zardazar?

Am I a butthead?

Can you believe it?

[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.220]
Yeah, sure can because there's at least a hundred million dummies out there and I think

[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.300]
most of them are listening to us.

[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.520]
Don't forget Phil Henry, two to six this afternoon.

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.740]
I'm going to start promoting the goddamn Phil Henry show.

[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.480]
Did you?

[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.380]
I'm telling you I did.

[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460]
I went on for like an hour about that two to three hour yesterday.

[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.660]
I'm going to promote this man.

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.600]
I'm going to stand on my hand.

[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.540]
I'm going to do cartwheels.

[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.640]
I'm going to buy my own billboards out there just to promote Phil Henry because it's beneficial

[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.660]
to all of us because there might be a little slop over.

[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.940]
In fact, we would have thought since the passion bitch went up just a hair at night.

[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.120]
I can't say what kind of hair.

[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.580]
She went up a little hair at night.

[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.240]
So there'd be some slop over from that.

[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.440]
She wouldn't you think just a little.

[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.980]
Squirt, Squirt.

[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.740]
Oh, Norbert, oh, cleaned it up.

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.020]
So anyway, it's 1207 at W.I.O.D.

[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.280]
Everybody in the building can curse.

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.840]
They wasted like a million and a half bucks on Howard and Chicago with the same company

[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.460]
that if we have a cart machine that's broken, well, we can't be bothered with that in

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.980]
here because we're building a new building and if you live long enough, we might be in

[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.100]
there.

[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.680]
Wouldn't that be great if we were in that new building right now in Hollywood?

[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.260]
Oh, God, would that be a beautiful thing.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360]
Here's a lady on South Beach.

[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.660]
Hello.

[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.220]
Neil.

[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.880]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.240]
Hi.

[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.400]
I'm coming out of the woodwork.

[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.120]
You're coming out?

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.500]
Yes.

[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.920]
Okay.

[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.500]
I just got back.

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.180]
I've been in Los Angeles for two months and I was there when the verdict was read.

[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.960]
Were you under jury?

[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.700]
No.

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.680]
No.

[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.880]
But do you know Cato has his own radio station out there?

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.680]
His own radio station, but he's on a radio show.

[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.500]
Yeah, radio show.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.420]
Isn't that sad?

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.580]
It's pathetic.

[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.520]
That goes to show you.

[00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.000]
He's like this man.

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.420]
Yeah.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880]
Very popular and they just, they're into him.

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.060]
They're into him?

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.420]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.500]
Based on what?

[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.100]
I don't know.

[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.260]
He fits out there.

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.360]
He's like that burnt out surfer look.

[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.180]
Everybody's like that out there.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.520]
Right.

[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.040]
Exactly.

[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.540]
Oh, my God.

[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.940]
Right.

[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.340]
And I came back here and there's nothing here either.

[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.700]
Right.

[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.300]
So.

[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.720]
I don't think Los Angeles and Miami are like the two hot spots right now.

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.640]
No, well, I was like, although they don't have the parrots

[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.280]
younger out there.

[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300]
So we got that up on.

[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.100]
We got to leg up on them.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.880]
They don't have a sky.

[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.920]
No, they don't or what?

[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.380]
Or what?

[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.920]
Or blimp?

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.140]
They don't have the good year blimp right?

[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.640]
But I mean, there's nothing here either, Neil.

[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.460]
I mean, this is a very dying town.

[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.420]
Your kin.

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.120]
No, I know you.

[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.320]
But I'm a young, vital woman and I don't know what to do.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.600]
You're a young, vital woman.

[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.600]
I guarantee you we could find a lot of guys.

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.580]
Young, vital guys out there will give you a busy like 20 hours

[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.320]
of the day at least.

[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.900]
Well, I know I've been listening to your show for years.

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.840]
And if there are guys who listen to your show,

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.840]
I don't know what to do.

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000]
You don't know what to do with them?

[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.380]
No.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.980]
Well, maybe they can give you a little instruction.

[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.460]
Maybe.

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.960]
OK.

[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.200]
Take it easy, Neil.

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.440]
See you at one of our appearances.

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.880]
I guarantee you we'll line them up for you.

[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.060]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.380]
All right.

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.780]
Well, maybe I will come because I never go to any of your things.

[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.680]
There you go.

[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.480]
Come to one of my things.

[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.160]
OK, baby.

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.800]
OK, sweetheart.

[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.460]
Bye-bye.

[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.960]
She's going to come to one of our things.

[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.840]
We're going to have like a gang bang right there

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.700]
right in the middle of the mall.

[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.460]
What's wrong with that?

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.000]
She sounds like she's cooperative.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.160]
She's looking for a little excitement in her life, OK?

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.420]
She's tired of all these deadbeat places like L.A. and Miami.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.900]
God.

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.900]
Go somewhere it is like a little bit of action.

[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.600]
It's your right here.

[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.180]
751, we do have the Piratechunger.

[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.680]
Look, God.

[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.480]
See, that call was really better than any call it

[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.720]
Phil had yesterday in its own way.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.060]
Not as funny, but really better,

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.740]
because that was the epitome of what these people think.

[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.420]
These parochial little people who've never

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.920]
been more than two blocks from Dateland.

[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.840]
Here's Pompano.

[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.120]
Hello.

[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.840]
Wait a minute.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.000]
Like I said, hello.

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.520]
Hey, Neil.

[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.260]
Hey, I did see that thing on Ray Seale's cousin last night.

[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.420]
Right.

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.860]
That's just, I don't know what to say about.

[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.360]
It's a disgrace.

[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.480]
I mean, this kind of stuff you know it goes on all the time.

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.280]
And the only time we ever hear about it is if it's somebody,

[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.780]
you know, happens to somebody famous, it's called a...

[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.940]
Right.

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.960]
I mean, here's a guy who was a black guy who evidently was,

[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.040]
you know, well dressed.

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.000]
He was driving a Jaguar, not a deadbeat.

[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.060]
He was driving through a white neighborhood

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.140]
and a black guy in a white neighborhood that said,

[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.240]
old story, they're still doing a porn guy's over.

[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.080]
And then what happened?

[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.980]
They probably pulled him over.

[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.520]
You know, they started giving him a hard time.

[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.780]
Yeah.

[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.240]
I got all pissed off about it.

[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.380]
Right.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.160]
And it was like three of them and one of him.

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.460]
Yep.

[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.140]
And he's dead.

[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.160]
Yeah, it's sad.

[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.080]
I mean, you know, where's this kind of...

[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.700]
Where, where, how far have we come, you know?

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.860]
I mean, sure, blacks aren't slaves anymore, but, you know...

[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.780]
And see, all these people that were so whipped up

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.720]
talking about the Farrakhan March and talking about the OJ thing,

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.520]
all it is is lip service because they don't really give a crap.

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.320]
They don't care.

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.940]
Right.

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.980]
I mean, it's like, I, you know, I'm a little concerned about it,

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.960]
but you know, it's just, you know, it's the fact,

[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.860]
you know, it'll blow over and then I'll forget about it.

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.380]
They make it into a big media circus and then people pretend

[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.700]
that they give a crap, but as soon as that's over with,

[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.980]
well, let's see, what do we got on Haralo today?

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.540]
What's Jenny Jones got on, you know,

[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.820]
what's the next thing that we can sink our teeth into?

[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.200]
Right.

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.620]
I mean, I'm concerned about it, but, you know,

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.120]
what can I do?

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.420]
What am I going to do about it, you know?

[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.560]
I mean, it's just tough, I don't know what, you know.

[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.280]
What can you say?

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.260]
Go out of the passport office, be a good idea.

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.620]
Hey, and I said, in case.

[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.360]
I feel Henry's saying yesterday it was great.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.180]
And I heard you say you wanted to start a promote in him a lot.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.680]
I just, I was wondering if you could play that

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.700]
so Henry's song you have.

[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.400]
Which one is that one that starts out?

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.340]
My manager told me.

[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.660]
Yeah.

[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.120]
Oh, what is that college urge?

[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.260]
That fill thing.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.120]
That thing's great.

[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.100]
Oh, feels twisted.

[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.780]
Yeah.

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.240]
OK.

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.580]
You just got it.

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.120]
See you.

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.420]
Open line of dates.

[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.180]
751 100, Broward 524.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.080]
What is this thing?

[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.740]
Yeah, but let me say something for.

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.580]
Let me say something.

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.960]
All right.

[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.140]
OK.

[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.680]
All right.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.580]
OK.

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.680]
But the, the, the, all right.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.240]
Did you, are you, are you sure?

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.860]
Yeah, but wait.

[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.880]
But wait a second.

[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.500]
Boy, yeah.

[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.620]
All right.

[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.920]
There it is.

[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.380]
Just a little preview of the Phil Henry show from two to six.

[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.180]
Got your hockey tickets here.

[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.120]
Phil, that's your reward for doing that great hour between two and three yesterday.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.020]
And in the tip off on his town like that woman was asked,

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.200]
asking what's this all about?

[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.060]
The article about Margaret and Phil.

[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.880]
It's in the, uh, hero living today section on page 80.

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.540]
There's a sentence in here that should give you an idea.

[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.720]
It says we should let you know.

[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.520]
We think Margaret is a disgrace.

[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.920]
Apparently, however, you don't enough of you tune into make Henry show two to six

[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.060]
PM weekdays, one of the top rated English language talk shows in South Florida.

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.140]
Where else in the United States of America?

[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.200]
Could you find a newspaper column about a radio guy?

[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.400]
And it would say his show is one of the top rated English language shows in South

[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.780]
Florida.

[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.200]
Stop and think about it.

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.800]
Ponder it.

[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.900]
But player, but I'm practicing in the afternoon.

[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.700]
I listen to Phil Henry to the six on W I O D.

[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.480]
He keeps me uplifted informed and stood.

[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.720]
Henry, two to six PM on news, talking entertainment radio, six 10 W I O D.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.780]
No solamente is Hank Goldberg.

[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.520]
Tamying es un equipo fotamo.

[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.280]
The manager told me.

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.620]
Yeah.

[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.320]
That I was right out of my head.

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.420]
And Danny said Phil Henry was using a voice instead.

[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.280]
Such lies.

[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.800]
I didn't listen to his jive.

[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.140]
I knew all along.

[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.660]
He was all wrong.

[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.060]
And I knew that he thought.

[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.680]
Are you sure?

[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.580]
That I was crazy, but I'm not.

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.240]
Oh, no.

[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.700]
Yeah, but wait a second.

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.920]
The manager told me.

[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.240]
Yeah.

[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.780]
That I was a little confused.

[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.120]
And I said, hey, Bobby.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.680]
I didn't call to get abused this way.

[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.100]
I heard a show just the other day.

[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.100]
I think you ought to know what he did on his show.

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.880]
I was very up all.

[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.220]
That's the reason why I call.

[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.800]
Yeah, but let me say something, Frist.

[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.580]
Let me say something.

[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.380]
This woman named Margaret calls her show quite a lot.

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.220]
And I don't want to listen to the suck up voice.

[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.160]
Not I know you think Phil is a genius.

[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.680]
And that is okay.

[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.500]
I just feel that way.

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.340]
But here what I say.

[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.280]
I didn't think it was a bit funny.

[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.560]
Especially when he talked about the aborted baby fetuses.

[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.680]
With the cock that saws on top.

[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.560]
Yeah, but did you, are you, are you, are you sure?

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.820]
The manager told me.

[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.120]
Yeah.

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.880]
That I could use some couch time, but I should have made me.

[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.140]
Yeah.

[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.840]
You'd let me speak my mind.

[00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.560]
You'll find.

[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.380]
I didn't think it was very kind.

[00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.090]
One baseball was played by the crippled and blind.

[00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.810]
And to make matters worse.

[00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.250]
Yeah.

[00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.130]
Passion phones with Sonny Hirsch.

[00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.750]
Oh no.

[00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.190]
All right, all right.

[00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.290]
The manager told me.

[00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.710]
Yeah.

[00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.250]
That I was right out of my head.

[00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.370]
And then he said, lady.

[00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.610]
Your two easily misled because you should know Phil Henry shows you naked new.

[00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.550]
So why don't you relax and have a value more too?

[00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.550]
Cause you don't know if you've got to talk to Bobby Green or not.

[00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.790]
And you know three voices are better than one.

[00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.670]
Use son of a bitch.

[00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.770]
Probably 18 at WI DSC lunchman is here with our lunch today,

[00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.350]
which is outstanding from Stan's stage.

[00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.570]
Delhi where they got great stuff.

[00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.710]
They got all the Atkins stuff.

[00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.630]
They got these special hot dogs and they got the cheese cake and they got great stuff.

[00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.410]
We love Carol.

[00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.070]
We love Stan.

[00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.930]
We love the Adele.

[00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.730]
Okay, we love everybody.

[00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.730]
We love the lunch man.

[00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.470]
Two open lines in day.

[00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.550]
7519463 751 WI even Annie's finagling free lunch every day.

[00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.450]
Here's a lady in the Hollywood.

[00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.830]
Hello.

[00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:58.750]
Hello.

[00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.870]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.610]
Now you worked at the FASCIS Prison Women that were sitting out there doing absolutely nothing.

[00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.050]
And even though I'm working, I decided to go ahead and call you.

[00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.050]
Well listen, that grace.

[00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.830]
You answered my plea.

[00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.830]
I answered your plea.

[00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.290]
Great.

[00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.130]
Well, what do you want to talk about?

[00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.510]
OJ or the...

[00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.330]
Anything that tickles your fancy?

[00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.010]
Did you were impressed by the fact that OJ didn't attend his birthday?

[00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.290]
His daughter's 10th birthday party, isn't it?

[00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.650]
I think it's absolutely disgusting.

[00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:29.170]
I mean, if he claims to be such a good father and all this and not only that he didn't attend,

[00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.630]
but the fact that he was out there with this Paula one last year.

[00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.230]
It's going around.

[00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:32.550]
Yeah.

[00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.110]
Right.

[00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.450]
It's absolutely disgusting.

[00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.850]
Right.

[00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.330]
So, but...

[00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.010]
And it's not even a claim that the grandparents didn't want to let him have the kids.

[00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.790]
I haven't heard that anywhere either.

[00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.150]
Yeah.

[00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.770]
So he doesn't even have a defense in that respect.

[00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.230]
Right.

[00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:51.930]
So, and with regard to the Paula woman hanging around with him, I agree with the call this morning that in the work of FUDs,

[00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.050]
she's safe.

[00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.770]
He's not gonna touch her.

[00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.030]
You sure?

[00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.510]
Positive.

[00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.090]
Positive.

[00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.090]
Well, there's nothing positive in this world, Paula.

[00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.710]
Yeah, but there's a lot of talk about him moving to another country.

[00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:09.070]
And I mean, Panama City, that's close to another country, but there is a lot of talk that they want to pick up and move to a foreign country

[00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.770]
because he can't escape all the derision here and all the psychosis.

[00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.250]
And of course, if...

[00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.330]
If they can't escape it anywhere, I mean, this was worldwide.

[00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.170]
Yeah.

[00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.610]
So, I don't think they paid too much attention, a lot of other places.

[00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.490]
You'd be surprised.

[00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.450]
Didn't really care that much.

[00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.410]
Oh, it really wasn't that important.

[00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.790]
The only thing that was going out of proportion.

[00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.010]
So, she pisses him off if he catches her screwing around.

[00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.370]
They might just be hopping on a plane.

[00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.270]
That's why I always carries that passport.

[00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.810]
Yeah.

[00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.970]
That's probably true.

[00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.890]
But I still think if they stay here, she's safe because he's got to prove to the world that he is squeaky clean and pretried.

[00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.630]
Yeah, he's fine.

[00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.890]
Wouldn't you think that after they spent all that money and they got him off that he would...

[00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.810]
That would be satisfactory, but instead it's like he's still trying to prove it.

[00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.590]
Like he denies that we don't believe it, but in his mind he knows none of us believe it.

[00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.750]
Yeah.

[00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.050]
Now let me tell you something.

[00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.390]
I don't believe he didn't do it.

[00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.090]
All right.

[00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.690]
I believe he probably did do it.

[00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.030]
Yeah.

[00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.670]
But I do agree that because of the system, the way it's set up nowadays.

[00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.570]
Because it sucks, yeah.

[00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.770]
Which it sucks.

[00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.110]
And I work within the system, so I know it better than maybe some other people.

[00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:07.950]

[00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.690]
And I still think it was a good verdict because it shows the reasonable doubt that it works.

[00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.150]
So, let's assume he hadn't done it.

[00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.090]
And everything was pointing in his direction.

[00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:17.390]
Yeah.

[00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.570]
At least he got off and there was some reasonable doubt just because of the evidence.

[00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.410]
Now, I do believe he probably did it.

[00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:25.750]
Yeah.

[00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.250]
But it was a good verdict.

[00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.170]
It was a good verdict even though it's probably not the truth.

[00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.030]
Okay.

[00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.770]
And of course the tabloid chose to agree with it because if he wouldn't have got off they would have no material now.

[00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.150]
Right?

[00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:36.690]
It's true.

[00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.710]
Okay. Have a great day.

[00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:38.590]

Open line of Broward 5249463.

[00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.330]
What are you frowning about in there?

[00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.330]
She says it was a good verdict based on the way the evidence.

[00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.710]
The evidence, you know, they did a crappy job.

[00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.570]
So let's let him go out there and play golf.

[00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.150]
He's out there playing golf.

[00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.490]
His daughters have an or 10th birthday party back in Brentwood and L.A.

[00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.750]
And he's playing golf and screwed around with Pauli and Panama City.

[00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.630]
And looking in the camera and laughing.

[00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.410]
And he's just laughing at all of you, baby.

[00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.670]
He's laughing at us.

[00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.890]

[00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.210]
Over the years the tradition of Lorenzo's Italian center in North Miami Beach has continued to grow.

[00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.210]
And now, good news, especially for all of us in Broward.

[00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:21.370]
Now that tradition and commitment to freshness and service comes to Broward announcing the opening of Ben and Bob's in Western.

[00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.390]
Ben and Bob's not to be confused with Don and Bob's, by the way, if you're from Rochester.

[00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.490]
But close, Ben and Bob's is a market in the same tradition of Lorenzo's with a fabulous wine selection.

[00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.130]
The best meat under the sun.

[00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.570]
Great Delhi department, incredible produce department.

[00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.030]
The freshest seafood in South Florida.

[00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.410]
Fresh pasta sauces and lots more.

[00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.110]
Ben and Bob's is also going to have all of the Dr. Radkin's diet foods available.

[00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.550]
Plus catering services and gourmet food baskets as well.

[00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.210]
So instead of schlepping all the way down to North Miami Beach.

[00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:56.370]
Now the tradition and commitment to freshness and service of Lorenzo's Italian center comes to Broward at Ben and Bob's fresh produce and seafood market.

[00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:02.230]
It's in the Indian Trace Shopping Center that's a 1368 Southwest 160th Avenue in Western.

[00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.330]
Called 389-6169. 389-6169.

[00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.770]

[00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.490]
The 96 Toyota's are rolling in by the truckload at Phil Smith Toyota.

[00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.570]
The eight is to the streets with deals with nobody.

[00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.190]
The peace and nobody.

[00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.010]
Peace and deal be there.

[00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:25.090]
Other dealers may be caught short on 96 Toyota's but not Phil Smith Toyota.

[00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.570]
Choose from over 200 in stock with more rolling and daily.

[00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:37.010]
Why buy that deer field dealer's leftover 95 yourself for 89.95 when Phil Smith is rolling back prices on every 96.

[00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.130]
That dealer in Coconut Creek wants to unload 95 avalanches for 2399.

[00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.010]
But Phil Smith has unbeatable prices on every 96.

[00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.750]
So why buy a 95?

[00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:55.650]
During the 96 rollout the deal beaders are rolling back prices on factory fresh 96 Toyota right now.

[00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:03.870]
Catch one before it rolls away at Phil Smith Toyota on Sunrise Boulevard next to the Swap Shop between 441 and I 95.

[00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:09.390]

Yes, sir.

[00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.730]
I'm just starting that access to the diet.

[00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.370]

I need to know if you need to get on that all those vitamins when you first started.

You got the book?

Yes.

[00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.150]
Yeah.

[00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.650]
I don't understand.

[00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.730]
Do I need to get on the diet?

[00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:53.850]
The vitamins right away?

[00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.790]

[00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.010]
See ya.

[00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.930]
See, the whole world is on the Atkins diet.

[00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.930]
They're not too crazy about admitting it, but they're on it.

[00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.870]
Oh, and then my mother yesterday, she's hucking a Chinese about, well, your brother had a stroke

[00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.110]
when he was on that diet.

[00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.750]
He was standing there in the office one day, feeling fine.

[00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.590]
And the next minute, he was on the floor with his mouth all twisted.

[00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.310]
I said, just serve up the law, honey, unless you want to be the next one on the floor with your mouth all twisted.

[00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:21.890]
Okay, honey?

[00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.630]
Cut the crap.

[00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.990]
No matter what it is, she knows better.

[00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:26.990]
She's the expert.

[00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.670]
Of course, she's fat, but she's the expert.

[00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.750]
We have an open line in date, 751 WIWD.

[00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.910]

[00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.230]
Wait a minute.

[00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:38.890]
On five?

[00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:39.390]
Hello?

[00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.730]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.270]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.510]
Yeah, that blimp, that panther blimp?

[00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.210]
What is it?

[00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.310]
They've got a pair of pounds.

[00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:51.230]
I think I might own it because you've got the panther on one side, and you've got the dolphin down the other side of the pipe.

[00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.250]
And what does it mean?

[00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.670]
And what's your advertising of games, I guess?

[00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.210]
Because then when the Marlins are playing, they put the marlins on the one.

[00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.710]
I went by gas this morning.

[00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.470]

[00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:11.950]
Sure.

[00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.170]
It's a Starvin Marvin, Miramar Parkway in 60-second Avenue.

[00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:23.130]
They got 78, 79, 9, 89, and 99 for gas.

[00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.390]
All right, everybody head for Starvin Marvin's, fill it up.

Yes, sir.

[00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.170]
You are God.

[00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:39.950]
Yes, I am.

[00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.590]
And Phil has got two, Phil.

[00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:42.690]
What else is new?

[00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:44.770]
Listen to that.

[00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.770]
That's really good.

[00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.290]
Yeah?

[00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.270]
That's what you're saying yesterday.

[00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.570]
You're right.

[00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:15.970]

[00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:45.950]

uh...

[00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.350]
down the road

uh this is gonna be my second week no yeah my second week and you have a lost anyway i would say two

[00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:48.050]
pounds at the most really yes and you know i just had a baby though about six months ago yeah

[00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:54.510]
but i don't know what i'm doing long and i've read the book over and over again i'm even

[00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:00.470]
how much do you have to lose um i'd say about 15 pounds well it's gonna be slow see if you're

[00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.110]
only got 15 to lose all together and you've already lost a couple it's gonna be slow but if you

[00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.790]
stick with it i pretty much guarantee it's gonna happen you might be real resistant like a lot of us

[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:15.550]
i am too so i'd stick to because it took me about a week to get into the into the purple right yeah

[00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.150]
so you're real resistant so you just got to you got to stick with it that's all be patient should i

[00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:26.810]
should i uh go on a lower fat because i've been eating but my appetite is really not great now you

[00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.370]
know it's good yeah that's great see i told you on this diet you're not hungry all the time yeah i know

[00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.070]
and i go to Lorenzo's too there you go oh it's wonderful don't eat more than don't eat more than

[00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.650]
three or four of those cheesecakes today that might be holding you back no no i haven't even had one

[00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.450]
a day good but they are great though oh no i i would just stick with it it'll happen trust me when

[00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:50.590]
i tell you okay stick with it okay keep it i see you yeah it slows down for a lot of us i mean i'm

[00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:55.310]
down to a crawl but i'm not worried about it because this morning i get up my blood sugar is 98 98

[00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:03.490]
with no medication around nice outstanding and a blood pressure was like a hundred over 60 and my

[00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.290]
medication is like way down to a fraction of what it was before and i still got about 25 30 pounds

[00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:13.510]
35 maybe to go but what the hell so big deal it'll happen and let me tell you another thing the

[00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:18.010]
longer you take to lose it the longer you're going to keep it off i know that's an old cliche

[00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.310]
and we're all impatient but if you get out one of these quack things and it was like 40 pounds in

[00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.710]
five minutes you're going to gain it back just like Oprah you're going to be like a god damn accordion

[00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:32.190]
you know what i'm saying you're going to be fat one day skinny the next like a balloon the next

[00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:37.970]
who the hell wants that that's very unhealthy too by the way so just take your time and eat your

[00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.870]
steaks in your lobster and your ab atkin's cheesecake and have a great life

[00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.990]
saddle i know there's a couple of systems out there yeah yes warning is the rca the best

[00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:56.790]
no i think the sony is the best from what people tell me even though i of course have the rca

[00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.730]
because i got it first before the sony came out but they said the sony has got like uh more

[00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.930]
capability of doing more things etc and so on and in the long run it's going to be better and i

[00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.750]
think it's about the same price oh really uh just one other question yeah can you get the local

[00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.890]
channels with that or you need a separate antenna why do you need a separate antenna or if you

[00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.930]
want to get the networks you can lie about where you live and tell them that you can't get cable

[00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.870]
reception at local channels and you can pick up the network of fillets like wabc in new york and

[00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:13.490]

uh luke faircans good buddy in top and the best part of it is he's the uh national youth minister

he's the head of the nazi bund for the ferrican people cannell x national youth minister for the nation

[00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:39.410]
of islam and by the way another thing that i'm seeing and this is spreading all over the country by the

[00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.610]
way in public schools we've had some talk about it here i'm not sure if there any schools here

[00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.590]
doing it where they put the kids in these uniforms you know with the white shirt and the pants and

[00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.510]
the tie and they all look the same so they don't have to fight about who's got the best designer

[00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:56.170]
clothing and who's got the more money i am going to tell you man i can see the nazi youth out

[00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.670]
there marching with their fists and their arms up in the air it is the most scary god damn thing

[00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.510]
let's take away everybody's individuality let's all dress them up the same brain wash them and

[00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.810]
dutch landu buralus baby it's disgusting and a lot of parents think oh that's a great idea

[00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:25.110]
out the same god damn cookie cutter all right here's for a lot of day hello hello real yes sir

[00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:30.530]
yeah first time caller long time listener okay i want to call your attention to something i

[00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:36.410]
saw in this wonderful newspaper that Melissa rujeri works for the sun the slum sentinel that's the one

[00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:42.830]
bitch yesterday's paper Wednesday October 18 yeah they've got the same article on

[00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:50.050]
two different pages in the same section here the local section they got an article headline

[00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:58.090]
halondale wants to fire contractor oh and on the very next page yeah they got the same identical

[00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:04.610]
article under a slightly different headline halondale moves to dump contract well it's big

[00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.730]
knows you got to understand in addition to which their readers in halondale are all brain dead

[00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:13.410]
anyway so they probably missed it the first 20 or 30 times maybe put it on every page i thought

[00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.230]
this was just emblematic of the wonderful uh... hey listen we got two bush league newspapers in

[00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.310]
this town we don't have anything that even resembles a real newspaper and it's perfect it's a

[00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:26.650]
perfect fit you know you go to filly you get to the inquirer i mean with an eye or real paper you

[00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.270]
go to boss didn't get the globe or the hero which are two real newspapers in a chicago you get the

[00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:35.290]
well the tribute in the sun times which come close but i mean here you don't have a newspaper that

[00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:40.030]
even comes close to being a real newspaper right i i can read my son sent a little morning

[00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:44.870]
between the time i pick it up outside and take the guy damn soggy a plastic oven i can walk back

[00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.970]
to the toilet sit down for two minutes and that's it it's a real bush league paper yeah i just

[00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:56.330]
like to say to Melissa Rudjari that nil is the deity and that's all good and up her ass okay now

[00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.890]
have a great life yeah but you know they're just waiting in the course if we do have a good book

[00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:04.870]
and bounce back which probably will happen someday well i i see talk radio is coming back somebody

[00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:10.530]
lifted that dark cloud over wio day are you fooling somebody Melissa are you trying to fool somebody

[00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:15.110]

you got over your ass where you hate all of us over here like poison never even mention rick and

[00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:24.430]
suds of course like they don't even exist and then she throws in that great line i did you read

[00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:31.150]
that sarcastic line she's got in there uh talk amongst yourselves the simpson trial could have

[00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:36.930]
been should have won wion z blockbuster ratings but but they stuck the joint out at the more irreverent

[00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:45.590]
wio d6 10 a m there seems to be a black cloud hanging a black cloud not a white cloud you racist bitch

[00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.650]
for the second book in a row the stations 25 to 54 age group ratings have slipped in every

[00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.770]
times slot except for its nightly passion phone show hosted by irons summers

while summers edged from a two six to a three three whoo three three heavy duty sweetheart at night

[00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:08.230]

Jewish like the edition just fun and a food and all that stuff it's just fun to be Jewish plus

[01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:42.570]

[01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:46.430]
positive thing if they would just discard all the bubble mice as you don't want to say and don't

[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:23.610]
phenomenal well i i wanted a first ball agree with you on the uh...

[01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:28.450]
luis paracan march on washington yeah it's a shame to see them make such a big

[01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:32.390]
fool out of themselves it's a real shame and it's a shame to be some people to watch some

[01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:37.290]
people in the media trying somehow desperately to legitimize the son of a bitch he is the most

[01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:41.390]
virulent the most obnoxious the most dangerous character on a face of the earth right now

[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:45.090]
and there are people try to give him legitimacy and say well you're taking things out of context

[01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:48.530]
like all you just can go straight to hell if they don't understand

[01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:53.610]
that this guy uh... everything he stands for when he gets up there and talks

[01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:59.210]
no matter what he says is a fraud yeah then they just don't have they don't get it they don't get it

[01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:03.610]
they don't get it the other thing was i was listening to um... hank goldberg

[01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.990]
yes he had a lot of your son depressed and uh...

[01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:09.650]
hank was uh... asked about the practice squad

[01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:12.530]
some somebody called him up and asked about the practice squad

[01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:17.970]
hey stupid yeah and he had no idea he first said it wrong on the air and then he couldn't

[01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:23.430]
admit that he was wrong and somebody from the NFL called to clarify and he still wasn't right

[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:28.330]
yeah and he kept insisting that he was right the entire time he was completely wrong

[01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:32.630]
this guy's supposed to be an NFL expert well call him up and ask him who the goalie for the

[01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:36.710]
capitals is let's see what it comes up with maybe maybe he figured out who Jim Kerri was with a mask

[01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:39.450]
have a great day pal material see uh

[01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.710]
yeah in fact somebody told me that that show he does on the douche that he was on a couple of

[01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:47.690]
nights ago i think divo was telling me and also rumour that hank was on there with his little hammer

[01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:52.910]
with his ball penny hammer and uh... he was interviewing Kelly Rudy the gold tender with the L.A.

[01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:58.110]
kings and i and i'm thinking of myself having hank interview a Kelly Rudy would be like having

[01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:02.550]
Andy calb interview uh... westbrook van vore he's about journalism you know what i'm saying it just

[01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:06.330]
i just don't get it i'm sorry but i'm missing something somewhere

[01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:12.470]
w-i-o-d oh sorry we missed you Georgia's putting cards away which is probably just as well because

[01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:16.270]
if you're only going to let it ring that many times who needs you anyway here's uh...

[01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:21.250]
curl gables all wow the all of the credit go in another direction while you're all over the play we

[01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:25.570]
got you splattered all over now talking about hang goldberg you know it shows a geek he was full

[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.670]
in there for him a couple days ago i heard a little that going to the hockey game is a third

[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.910]
we heard here's some hockey talk and we didn't

[01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:32.590]
he was getting there uh...

[01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:38.350]
that was he actually said that nobody's been closer to jimmy johnson in the last four years

[01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:43.390]
then he joe zagiki oh really okay yeah i don't know how close he meant all right yeah

[01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:46.530]
that that's why jimmy jimmy's hair is grow maybe a rubbed off from joe zagui

[01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:51.030]
he said jj was an interest in the dolphin coaching job and that he knows because

[01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:57.370]
him joe zagiki has been close joe zagaki sucks okay i'm gonna tell you right now i know a guy

[01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:02.070]
who does work i can't say what kind of work in jimmy johnson's homes both in Dallas and down here

[01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:08.330]
and you can tell joe zagaki he's full of crap i know i know for a fact i know for a fact that jimmy

[01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:13.490]
johnson is salivating waiting for shula to fall on his ass absolutely anybody that's why he

[01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:17.570]
that's why he's how did the dolphin so big at the start of the season and has been touting him

[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:21.250]
all along because he's setting him up for the big fall absolutely anybody who thinks otherwise

[01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:27.630]
the thing he said he said that he knows he's got the inside line that's got coming ten we'll be

[01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.730]
starting for you and this year about two hours later put your Davis announces that right

[01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:01.210]
yeah one good slice deserves another right okay well the other thing is i think you're a little

[01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:05.550]
hard on the blacks man i think we we came along with this country and uh i don't think the

[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:10.670]
kind of messed up right now but i i i think your form yeah but wait a minute if i'm so hard on

[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:15.210]
the blacks how come i'm the only person talking about the thing about racials cousin that got murdered

[01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:20.150]
by the cops in pittsburg it was on cbs evening news last night for some reason whatever it is it's not

[01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:24.430]
in any of the newspapers except a little column yesterday this is a major story it's part of the

[01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:29.530]
craft that's been going on for forever and ever and it's got to stop that's one of the biggest

[01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:33.230]
gripes you got is police brutality in all these young blacks who are in jail most of them probably

[01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:37.750]
or many of whom shouldn't be there yeah well that's true that's true i'm trying to be fair i'm just

[01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:41.890]
i'm just very agitated i know there are a lot of desperate black people out there but don't look

[01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:45.490]
to demagogues to solve the problems don't look to lewis ferricons at a world because they're out

[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:50.170]
the answer no well i don't i don't believe see now the majority of blacks i don't believe that look

[01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:58.430]
to look to lewis farcons uh to find a way out but um well like i said uh out lewis farcons is not

[01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:04.090]
the god of the black people i hope not no he's not that and and i think and one a little off the

[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:10.450]
subject i believe that a black person will quicker accept a white person than a white person can

[01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:15.290]
accept a black no i don't believe that you know i know i think there's plenty of racism on both

[01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:19.270]
sides and there's plenty of decent broad-minded people on both sides i think there's plenty of

[01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:23.550]
hate in this country to go around i don't think we have to like try to get into a contest to see who

[01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:29.570]
i'm embarrassed at the united states man that hate their racism here it's it's outrageous it's

[01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:34.790]
making us look bad everywhere i mean everybody's laughing at us that's right what uh you got to get

[01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:39.090]
our crap together man that's right we need to million of people march not black or white people just

[01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:43.930]
uh just all people everyone that uh agree with that there you go well uh i don't think you're a

[01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.910]
racist or sometimes some of your comments make me wonder you know uh well you know i'm i'm

[01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.970]
white so i see things from a white person's perspective but i deal with people as individuals and

[01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:57.290]
when people tell me i'm a racist maybe i am to a little degree like everybody's a racist to some

[01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:01.330]
minor degree but in terms of being a bigot i am not and anybody who says that can jam it up their ass

to the summer books when i have two weeks that i'm gone and the rick was sick for two weeks it's

[01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:48.710]
it's deadly if they could just find some living person to be on other than default by the way i know

[01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:52.550]
they can find a living person to fill in who i could do a little talk and i think we'd uh... you

[01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:57.170]
know hold our own i agree with you totally right they got a work on that it's a little talent that should

[01:21:57.170 --> 01:22:01.170]
