and I'm just a person called pound IOD at no charge now the Neil Roger show

[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.000]
I got you to use talking entertainment radio 610 W IOD Jimmy Carter is looking for a miracle the former president is trying to push

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.440]
push in Bosnia and my biggest problem is I own a ball since the 70s revival it's a common scene in many doctors offices

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.500]
you gotta tell me please why can't I dance well I'm afraid you have white man in

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.420]
jidus white man in jidus a tragic affliction causing so many to give up trying to get down

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.460]
the symptoms are easy to spot the inability to snap your fingers or clap your hands

[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:25.840]
anywhere near the beat of music or singing causes an instant gag reaction to all those standing next to you

[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.580]
oh my god and of course when you're out no one wants to stand next to you

[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.880]
hi guys wait wait up we wish we could say there's hope for white man in jidus

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.800]
but there is it the only recommended course of action in rhythmic abstinence

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.880]
well there must be something you can do no just stop what you're doing you're embarrassing that hell out of us

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.400]
at 1007 a W I do you're welcome and happy Tuesday to you man we're gonna be burning it today I'll guarantee you that

[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.580]
just like what's his name Warren sap and James Stewart they were burning a few

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.240]
I mean how smart do you have to be like go for a drug test this is your big chance in life

[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.860]
you're gonna be a big star in an NFL baby you're gonna make millions of dollars and now you got to go to your drug test

[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.900]
of course you don't really make any difference because as it says later in the article here in the paper

[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.700]
it says well testing positive for drugs does not prevent a player from entering the league it just makes them look like a real dummy

[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.800]
which we knew in the first place anyway so the u.m. scandal continues everybody who goes through that nut house

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.000]
that crap factory over there is just another piece of walking to it and like I said what are they gonna do now

[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.940]
what's Deon gonna do when all these other hot shots now that they banned the schmattas from the NFL

[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.760]
are you aware of that that this coming season they have banned all those banned Danas and schmattas and all that stuff

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.240]
even wellie Nelson's pithed off about it he not too happy so how are they gonna have that same old spirit without wearing

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.960]
M schmattas I don't get it now we're gonna zip through these calls today man like Grant took Richmond hello

[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.300]
hello yes sir I shot when he the pool yeah okay you sound like you're full of it too man he shot when he the pool

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.980]
alright speaking of who shot when he the pool that thing yesterday the one point that nobody wants to talk about

[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.880]
because all they're watching is whether airfully Bailey is as brilliant as everybody said or Mark Ferman is gonna crumble under the pressure

[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.380]
and start making racist comments the thing about him talking and walking at 5 30 in the morning in the middle of June in LA

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.020]
and I don't care what anybody says it's just not that light out at 5 30 in the morning in the middle of the summertime anywhere

[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.460]
and from a distance from yards away he spies this small spec above the I said spec above the door handle on a Bronco

[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.580]
and he goes over to further investigate and has to use his flashlight to look like inside it's so dark that he can't see inside

[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.780]
but it's light enough so that from yards away he can see this little spec which turns out to be blood above the door handle

[00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:03.160]
is anybody buying it WIOD yes sir I wanted to ask you a question yes I've ever been to St. Louis very briefly very briefly

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.080]
I want to go I'm going to go this weekend to see the arch yeah yeah you're going to go to see the arch

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:23.760]
once you just go to McDonald's and say a lot of money man to same damn arch it's just bigger there's nothing to see man

[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.620]
going to middle of the summertime when humanity's about 140 percent it's a swerveering it's a festering you'll have a great time there

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:43.340]
what's the second question I've ever been asked no I have not been down under yeah okay any chance any place you get to go man from here just grab it don't pass the chance

[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.300]

seriously I said direct this morning and I wasn't joking I don't think the transmitter is on I

[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.020]
think whatever calls we're getting are just a few loyal people who have no life whatsoever and are just calling out

[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.020]
a force of ram it I don't think the guy that I'm stationed is on the year the last two days I got Friday

[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.380]
stick it in an empty net and they're getting 41 shots on goal they stink they got

[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.440]
there's no there is no there's no team there are no consistent lines there's no

[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.940]
nothing they screwed up the chemistry of a great team that was in the final four

[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.860]
two years in a row right and as much as I like Matt Sundine this team without

[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.320]
Wendell Clark it'll a favor Bob Rouse and this team has got no balls it just a

[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.420]
bunch of riddly is out there and then my crank is out there for two minutes and

[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.660]
Dixon Ward whose belongs in Montgomery Ward this they screwed up a just they

[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.380]
remind me of the station man they screwed up a good thing there's no continuity

[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.640]
that's right right what about this other kid there are 500 team and they look like crap

[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.480]

[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.020]
net yeah and they had 40 on Saturday and you only scored two goals they can't they

[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.660]

[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.540]
who's coming to town if Roger Nielsen doesn't discover that you got to score

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.900]
some goals to win a game you can't keep playing hard for an Ottawa every game

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.240]
but the only real team that we beat all season was Boston the two games up

[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.300]
there got their little rank because we got them frustrated as hell and they

[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.360]
and put him into a coma including Fred Q6 and we're never going to be playing

[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.160]

[00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:40.330]
hello yes ma'am um listen kneel yes i just have a real problem with these people taken over in my

[00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:46.230]
amie and with these people taking over my amie who are these people in her home talking about you

[00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:52.090]
address them quite frequently who are these people well the people from Cuba the Haitians uh

[00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:58.870]
foreigners the foreigners okay when are they coming to town foreigner yeah well you know what

[00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:06.890]
yeah well sounds as cold as ice listen yeah uh so what does that mean taking over let me tell you

[00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:11.590]
something when people move out you know why the whole area right up the street here at 79th in

[00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.790]
biscayne you know why that area is the way it is today because everybody else moved out that's why

[00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.270]
no because we have weak representation no it's got nothing to do with representation of anything

[00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:25.390]
it's got to do with people running away and moving out okay and moving up to places like a plantation

[00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:31.110]
acres way out west there well which by the way it's pretty nice there yeah believe it i like it but a small

[00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.730]
solution to something that i read it and guess what if you think you're going to move away from anything

[00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.430]
go out of the saw grass mall which is right next door to my house and you'll find every foreigner

[00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.030]
who's ever been born nobody in their speaks of the ingles so what are you talking about well this

[00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:48.470]
is a small solution that i came up with i read it in an article it's great cater to them there

[00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:53.050]

[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.900]
on the list i'm not saying that there aren't some nice german people i haven't met too many but i'm

[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:58.040]
sure in fact when i was a little kid we had germans their name was shults lived right on the corner

[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.740]
next door to our house those shults as they had a even their little dog was an ozzi i'm serious

they had a little nasty uh what they'll kind of a dog was it a German shepherd no no little

[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.740]
dog little like kind of like tiny only a more obnoxious if that's possible a little white dog and

[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:20.360]
that he would bark out and it would sound like seagulls you could you could hear it in a barking

[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:25.680]
the dog was trained to be a god damn not saying used to put his paw at a 45 degree angle up in the

[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.240]
air as you would come outside and make anti-semitic slurs because we happen to be and the people

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.640]
live next door to us their name was flyshire which is a very Jewish name and it was a very uncomfortable

[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.660]

[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.860]
penalty box in the game keeps going on they stop play right right generally when there's a penalty

[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.100]
when the one team gets the power play another team is short handed there's always almost always a

[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.120]
shift change because you know you want to put on your penalty killers and they want to put on

[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.540]
their big line if they're not out there already okay that ain't okay we have an open line on

all my friends are discussing this although i'm quite attracted him and perhaps may allow him to do

it next time he tries what do you think your friend andi in bonna venture you think andi should

[00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:10.110]
get together with gregg maybe that might work out their frustrations together

[00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:15.570]

minds a meeting of the meat here's my me beach hello hello yeah yes i am i'm very disturbed you know

[00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:52.150]
that that obviously that bitch that called up about the Germans you know i was a POW in germany

[00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:58.150]

[00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:03.630]
boy yeah watch out be honest with you that i was in berlin once and i never saw anybody smile

[00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:09.090]
well they felt very confident they smile but believe me they they don't like it

[00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:14.030]
they they may think that we're good and they tell us how good we are what do you mean us

[00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:19.790]
either the Jews or the american well i could do that yeah well i you know the man i was a

[00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:26.290]
Jew in germany in POW camp and believe me it was not comfortable yeah anyways about uh that's

what andi from bonniventure city said it was not comfortable oh yeah you know about uh oh jay

[00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:37.990]

that it's in the bag man yeah well as the bag man killed in the coliol i don't know i i doubt very

[00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:55.650]
much of he could do it that fast because what do you mean if he had a shovel and a big plastic sack in

[00:54:55.650 --> 00:55:01.330]
the uh bronco why is it unreasonable to believe that he had a duffel bag well that's possible

[00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:05.270]
yeah yeah that's possible that he had a change when he was driving back because there's very short

[00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:11.290]
time frame right between the act and when he was back to his house in the in the limousine right

[00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:17.130]
about 15 minutes yeah well that's you know that's a 20 minutes to clean up you know yeah they must have

[00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:20.810]
been blood all over this well there was a bloody sock upstairs he kind of left a little trail you

[00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:25.250]
know he went outside and he tried to bury the he tossed the glove and he went into a panic and

[00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:30.250]
then he ran inside and by that time he'd obviously taken all the stuff off and the tossed the sweater

[00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:34.730]
whatever he was wearing in the sack yeah well you know that also the tossing the glove that that

[00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:39.410]
that's no sense i mean what the hell i mean he didn't toss it he just to probably dropped it

[00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:44.170]
you think he really dropped it he dropped it or who down those what he did because that's that's

[00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:48.710]
the stirris me i know i know he's guilty but you know how do you get these facts together that's

[00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:52.330]
i think that's going to be a problem he's going to get off anyway so i don't worry about he's

[00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:56.610]
going to he's going to walk you right yeah and then he's going to run like a son of a bitch trust me

[00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.930]
well he's going to make a lot of money he always could run like hell even with those bad

[00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:02.730]
arthritic knees you watch him run yeah he's going to make a lot of money too much damn thing in

[00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:06.670]
the book you'll have a movie he'll have his own god damn show he'll be bigger than Jenny Jones

[00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:10.010]

sandy paint in a while okay and about how all the people that worked here including Roger McElan

[00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.410]
and Mike Reneerie they probably wouldn't admit it now because they're over there with her on on

[00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:48.390]
waxy on waxy junior but boy when she was here they hated that bitch like the producers hated her

[00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:53.090]
the engineers hated her because on the air she came up with this real sweet sugar coated

[00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:58.070]
phony image but in person fact the only person that liked her was a sharel was the only person

[00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:04.090]
to build an actor and that's because jabs of a feather go shopping together so 11 22 at wio

[00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:10.830]
there's no reason 16 wio d listen longer and you'll get an attitude too don't

[00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.590]
then listen and i would jump in front of a bullet from the cold

[00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:42.470]

but the the um

[00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:58.830]
that night when she turned off all the lights there's no place where she could hide

I'm going to get you tonight

[00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.990]
OK, I love it 28 and WI.

[00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:05.350]
We got a little dilemma here because I guess Mark Furman, the German, is going to be back on a witness stand today before he takes off for Northern Idaho.

[01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:14.870]
It's really interesting by the time the trial is over, Rosaló Pez will be in El Salvador, Mary Ann Gurches who will not even testify, she'll have a race in the federal prison somewhere.

[01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:18.570]
Mark Furman, he'll be in North Idaho with the area nation.

[01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.710]
And of course, oh, Jay, he slipped out again.

[01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:22.930]
Jay, we forgot about him.

[01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:25.470]
We're trying to keep track just like when he was in the house that day.

[01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.450]
Remember that famous day in Vegas?

[01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.930]
We're all out there on our Vegas trip last year.

[01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:35.150]
You know, something it was our trip with Bob Lincoln to Vegas that incited this entire event to take place.

[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:39.570]
It was the inspiration for America for the OJ business was our trip to Vegas.

[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:46.270]
And I'm sitting there in my room sick as a dog and I turn on the TV and there's this car chase up and down the freeway.

[01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:47.170]
And I said, what the hell is that?

[01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.830]
Where's Piggit?

[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:48.570]
There's the freeway.

[01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.750]
And it just went on and on and back and forth.

[01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:56.630]
And then the next day we had the thing at Bobby Shapiro was in there and he's making this plea.

[01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.550]
Oh, oh, Jay, give yourself up.

[01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.510]
What's this all about?

[01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:00.530]
Come out of my house.

[01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.750]
It was a beautiful thing.

[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:07.250]
And here we are months and months and months later and we're still, so I don't know what I'm going to do when Eddam things starts.

[01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.010]
Because Eiffelie Bailey is going to be grilling him again.

[01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:14.490]
They say that Eiffelie might actually take a little oxygen because his performance yesterday was a little on the stale side.

[01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:16.470]
Here's what Bob Shapiro said.

[01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:17.070]
Here's plantation.

[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:17.530]
Hello.

[01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:19.010]
Hey, Neil, how you doing, buddy?

[01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.650]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:26.710]
Hey, I factually last night because I'm going to be at the Panthers game tonight and usually during the daytime, you know, I lay tile and marble.

[01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:29.650]
It's real hard to call you, but you lay pipe during the daytime, you know.

[01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:31.350]
Yeah, I lay pipe in the daytime also.

[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:32.010]
I believe it.

[01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:38.030]
But besides that tonight I've come by and check you out at the game, you know, because I've been wanting to come to the game and see you.

[01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:46.470]
And I'm a loyal listener, you know, I'm only 23, but I listen to you every day at work and I just think it shows the greatest and need to wake this city up, man.

[01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:48.690]
That's right. They need a goddamn animos what they need.

[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.150]
They need a blueberry anima.

[01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:55.170]
They would know definitely if that came around for a wall because they need something.

[01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:58.050]
They need somebody to squeeze their bag tight, hard and fast.

[01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:00.950]
There's nothing like tight, hard and fast. Believe me.

[01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:07.490]
You know, and I've come tonight and I'm going to come say hello to you with my girlfriend and I'm going to be very rudy.

[01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.710]
You know, show it's Florida, what it's all about at the game.

[01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:10.770]
All right. All right.

[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.350]
So you have a good day and see you tonight.

find that they take it away from us again let's do a Miami hello

[01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:13.490]
hey Neil this is a young Cuban and nearly in Miami

[01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:19.750]
all right a miracle out of the closet baby and into the streets by the way that lady that

[01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:24.390]
German lady sounded kind of sexy i wanted to see if Georgia traced her phone number to give her a call

[01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.810]
yes she said she likes cheese

[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:31.630]
hey Neil i wanted to talk about a martyramans testimony yesterday yes sir

[01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:37.450]
the reason why he needed to lie a little bit was because they were supposed to be there for

[01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:44.030]
notification now for investigation investigation or palpitation or masturbation right because

[01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:49.830]
they jumped offence because after he saw the blood they thought that there might be a victim inside

[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:56.530]
and they didn't wait for the search warrant so right it's also interesting that he he just

[01:07:56.530 --> 01:08:02.290]
just went around the corner to look at the at the other gate but the the spec of blood was on

[01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:09.330]
the street side of the uh of the uh broncos and yet to be in the street um to see that side of

[01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:16.230]
the broncos but still i they're just lying about a procedural investigating a prognol policy rather

[01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:23.670]
than guilt yeah i think uh oh jay is guilty to begin with guilty itself but he'll walk he will walk

[01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:27.730]
so let everybody worried about see everybody we know he's guilty number one and all the people

[01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:31.250]
who want to apologize for him and make an excuse is even though the evidence is overwhelmed

[01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.610]
i mean keep it mine they haven't even come close to gated the blood evidence yet to the

[01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:39.750]
dna and the rna and the spc a they haven't even come close to that that that's right but i have

[01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:45.110]
a feeling that that jury is just uh if they say that uh superman uh committed the murders and

[01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:50.570]
floor out of there that's why he didn't leave uh any uh footprint uh they say you see that's it

[01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:55.670]
that that's the reason it was superman and he's not guilty so whatever i think Clark can't

[01:08:55.670 --> 01:09:00.630]
was there on the night that's what marie and gritchis said all right Neil have a great day of me go

getting nervous because it's getting close to noon time they're starting to rearrange their lives

[01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:20.270]
now and as i was saying to rick this morning you know i keep blaming the women which we have very

[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:24.450]
few women callers anyway on a whole radio station so what's the logic in that they're ain't none

[01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:29.210]
i keep saying well it's the women in this oj thing if it's only the women then how come a 95

[01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:33.750]
percent of our callers are male and they're all disappearing too every day like yesterday it was

[01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:38.490]
weak okay it was a bad Monday for everybody here but it was really weak as soon as the god damn

[01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:43.170]
eftley baili started cross examining mark firm and you you can just watch the phone and see

[01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:46.610]
what these people are doing so don't lie to me and tell me that you don't care and you're not

[01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:51.970]
watching it you're watching every god damn second your whole life revolves around it this is

[01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:56.590]
another closet past time in america it's not just a Greg and Andy up there are doing each other

[01:11:56.590 --> 01:12:00.790]
up there in the bon event you're aware of it is that they're in the closet right now doing

[01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:04.770]
each other playing little grab ass with their radio cranked up real out getting sexual excitement

[01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:09.430]
from the good vibrations that's not bad enough but we have all these closet oj watchers

[01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:15.830]
and when you get the small dish by the way you'll be in heaven because it's on court tv it's on cnn

[01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:20.950]
it's on e it's on a it's on i it's on oh it's on you it's it's on like a half a dozen different

[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:26.570]
channels constantly so when cnn goes to commercial have no fear just slipped down from two o2 to

[01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:31.230]
two o3 next channel over there's court tv and you get to see Fred Graham with his white here at

[01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:38.510]
no extra charge here's hollywood hello hey nil yes sir nil two thoughts on what did you think about

[01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:44.490]
that kaya yocho first of all the the crowd they were saying was like a million an hour i wasn't

[01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:49.490]
invited so i didn't go there no but here's here's the thing that i thought was most amazing is

[01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:53.290]
that there was like one girl got cracked on the head with a bottle somebody was throwing it

[01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:58.750]
yeah and there was like thirty seven arrests which to me is like an incredibly low number considering

[01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:02.810]
all the but wise there was slosh and around that's right while you deal with some very civilized

[01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:08.070]
people well i don't know that part of the other part when i get pissed off they just you know drop

[01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:12.010]
a bomb somewhere that's all they don't go around shooting people yeah well i'm just saying that

[01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:16.230]
though that number of people okay a pipe bomb here in there like maybe in your mail box you know

[01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:22.010]
the other thing is that have you any comments on what the state has got

[01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:28.050]
with their sentencing guidelines that they've just reduced some of these things like pretty

[01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:33.510]
incredible like if you have one second a person convicted of grand theft with six prior felony

[01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:39.170]
convictions including aggravated assault yeah are you okay one year county jail maximum

[01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:44.630]
mm-hmm what's your thoughts on that what's my thoughts on it yeah what do you want me to give you

[01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:48.310]
my thoughts and what is there to think well i mean what do you want you kind of a question

[01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:52.430]
that what are my thoughts on that our rapes convicted in three separate arm sexual

[01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:57.250]
batteries yeah arm he gets what a half half an hour in there i mean if i can

[01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.950]
well they don't want them doing danger the other inmates think we have cut it as close to the

[01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:05.570]
bone as we possibly can there you go there's your governor man how about two counts of how

[01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:45.750]
hello yes sir hey nia how you doing good listen i mentioned i heard you mentioned something

[01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:49.490]
about your dog getting out from underneath the fence this morning yeah no exactly what you're

[01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:53.650]
talking about i got a call last night about three thirty in the morning waking the dead in my house

[01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:58.970]
and uh telling me my dog is out in the middle of sunset of course i live right on sunset dry nice

[01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:03.830]
yeah exactly i like to put my dog out in the middle of sunset right in rush hour would be a good idea

[01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:08.230]
well you know my first mistake was i going to chase after the dog here i am at three thirty in the

[01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:13.470]
morning no showed about thirty pounds overweight yeah couldn't find my shoe chasing after this little

[01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:18.390]
dog i couldn't find so i uh decided to go back and get my bicycle look around for

[01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:24.370]
well if i couldn't find a dog for about uh about an hour i decided to return home well i'm put

[01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:31.810]
pulling my bike into the uh gate what do i find is stupid little dog is in step back inside the gate

[01:40:31.810 --> 01:40:35.990]
oh yeah they always do that that's what my dog does if you just ignore him if you chase him he

[01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:39.550]
just keeps going if we just ignore him and threaten the pain of attention he comes running back

[01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:43.110]
you just leave the door open he runs back in the house well you know i'm getting a little nervous

[01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:47.550]
once the dog gets about two or three blocks away i figured i get nervous is why i seem coming back

[01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:52.730]
in the direction of the house i get very nervous yeah well i figured their brains are so small that

[01:40:52.730 --> 01:40:58.510]
once he gets two three blocks away probably wouldn't find his way back no chance but if it wasn't

[01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:02.050]
for the kid i'd tell you i would have let that dog just run in the damn street but i'm play have a

[01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:07.630]
good time if he lives great and if not uh you pack him a sandwich right exactly i got three you

[01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:12.090]
know i got three more i know the thing uh well you know the people that put your fences in when i

[01:41:12.090 --> 01:41:15.670]
bought my house and i spent a lot of money to put a big beautiful wooden fence in there and they did

[01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:20.610]
generally speaking a pretty good job however they really and i you know you tell them i have they

[01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:24.550]
can see you got two dogs one's a big one which you don't have to worry about one's a very tiny little

[01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:29.230]
dog that weighs about ten pounds you have to make sure that every one of those slats is down

[01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:34.550]
into the ground not not several inches above the ground not an inch above the ground but down flush

[01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:38.710]
like right into the ground so the dog can't dig his the way and i'm going to tell you every few

[01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:43.090]
months he finds another spot i take boulders i take rocks i take every damn thing that's ever been

[01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:46.790]
invented and then a few months later he finds another guy damn spot where they did a crappy job

[01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:51.390]
sure well i did that you know i went and i bought my my bags of sand and i put them all along the

[01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:56.110]
fence and then the association now for creek association decides they're going to dig a pipeline

[01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:01.930]
right behind my fence yeah nice force with trench when they fill it back in they must have left

[01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:07.630]
ten new new gaps of holes with this dog can get out beautiful like you said every time i fill one

[01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:12.570]
in the dog gets out from from another damn hole yeah so what i what i have to do now is i get i

[01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:18.230]
lock the damn small dogs into so small i have to lock them up in the cat box in the cat box and i

[01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:21.610]
tell you a little about half hour in a microwave is always a good idea not with it turned on

[01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:25.430]
necessarily but just as kind of a warning i don't think he'll do it again yeah well you know i

[01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:29.130]
kind of got improvement in this damn dog if i leave him out of the doesn't get out he barks all

[01:42:29.130 --> 01:42:33.590]
freaking night yeah okay well good luck to pal okay okay back to you we have an open line

[01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:41.030]

[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:44.950]
a little dog if you have a big dog then everybody looks at it and they're proud if you have a little

[01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:52.510]

happened to uh... be listening to your show and then i had to get out of my car but while i was

[01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:15.890]
listening on uh... um... hold here i happen to think that there's uh what's called an electric

[01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:20.230]
that you can get for a small dog like that because they do have a tendency to turn around and it's

[01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:24.250]
like that they put a special collar on the dog and then until all very low voltage

[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:29.350]
wire that they can't have a hybrid did you know if you don't like your dog i guess i would work

[01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:34.490]
anyway uh... the reason why i call this to the well one thing that i want to tell you another

[01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:40.490]
thing they're trying to make i think uh... don't you know uh... national celebrity at the uh...

[01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:45.630]
really both fight thirty-night they were showing jack nickles and and a number of other

actors and celebrities and then they also showed down to you we need some help

[01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:53.470]
so you know everybody got a big thrill out of the end on to our

[01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:57.070]
yeah but the reason why i call you since it's you know my spot

[01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:01.070]
exactly but it only depends on what direction that you're going

[01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:05.110]
mm-hmm uh... but the reason why i call this just as i got out of the car i heard you talking about

[01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:09.630]
california and somebody had told me once that california is like a granola bar if you take

[01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:14.510]
out all the fruits and that's all you know that's older than that's older than my great great-great-grandmother

oh now you're dreaming there

[01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:31.830]
you're dreaming no california at least is got to agree with you i absolutely

[01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:35.810]
not well for you i'm not talking about living there but just in terms of the people there at least in

[01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.370]
california got a few million people

[01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:41.770]
that they got an IQ bigger than their jox eyes florida manage just a bunch of uh...

[01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:43.310]

[01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:48.530]
you know rubber rafters and uh... mister it's about like maybe maybe 15% of the people in florida

[01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:52.570]
got like some intelligence and the rest of the people here are moron i got to agree with you

[01:46:52.570 --> 01:46:56.770]
to the point where this this this state is uh... this state is a thousand years behind the behind

[01:46:56.770 --> 01:47:02.110]
the stone age maybe that's why i get along so well with people up north

[01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:07.490]

your honor let's go home and let the jury think about that about that lie

[01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:17.350]
speaking of having a good memory let's test now first of all remember how they lie to you when

[01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:21.550]
they come in and they buy a station and they say oh we're not going to change anything your job is

[01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:27.070]

[01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:35.350]
it's an he did this

[01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:42.310]
he left the job man running up and down courts of the young man wearing really tight

[01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:46.810]
mower what a mammary man when they jump but when i heard how bad this was

[01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:47.990]
all done by the media

[01:51:48.810 --> 01:51:50.630]
is another way

[01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:51.950]
where my man

[01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:54.550]
it's time again for some

[01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:56.310]
way and be

[01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:58.210]
can't wait to watch a more

[01:51:58.210 --> 01:52:00.010]
way and be

[01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:04.690]
they think it's all gonna watch a play

[01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:07.010]
oh i'm so happy that it's

[01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:09.410]
the ball it's time again for some

[01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:11.170]
way and be

[01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:11.470]
okay

[01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:13.090]
can't wait to watch a more

[01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:14.890]
way and be

[01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:19.210]
so to make a long story short they lied that they have everybody in the building knew they were lying they hated them like

[01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:22.710]
poison they blew his ass out of here then they gave Rodney the morning show who was doing real great they

[01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:27.230]

[01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:28.790]
that they have to uh... get citizens now they're running to get citizenship status

[01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:34.390]
and complaining saying well we've been residents for ten twenty years and we paid our taxes but why do we have to become citizens

[01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:38.110]

all the jury see the now this is all four play again good thing that cnn at least gives you a little uh

[01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:54.470]
something on there it says issues are being discussed without the jury in the courtroom

[01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:58.890]
so when a jury gets in there when we stick uh... firm in the uh... german back on the stand

[01:54:58.890 --> 01:55:01.830]

[02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:05.310]
and if we was getting picked up because he ain't getting paid for this anyway

[02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.750]

about ten feet away they got little flyers for the new little dish thirty nine

[02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:32.910]
dollars

[02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:36.230]
oh that's for that prime star cred

[02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:41.890]
is this yeah thirty nine dollars yeah what do you know i want to see this is

[02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:44.990]
the deal that the cable companies are involved in this prime start thing

[02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:46.530]
is that available now

[02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:48.410]
uh... i guess all

[02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:50.650]
are they peddling it

[02:03:50.650 --> 02:03:54.770]
god i sure like to see one of those flyers if you get hold of one for me

[02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:57.370]
i sure uh... you're wearing uh...

[02:03:57.370 --> 02:03:58.610]
but just mail it to me

[02:03:58.610 --> 02:04:01.790]
all right w-i-o-d-my-me three three one four one

[02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:05.190]
because that see this is a deal where they loan you it's like a microwave

[02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:08.470]
uh... micro like a micro relay thing

[02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:12.110]
where they microwave you the mind why do i keep saying microwave well that

[02:04:12.110 --> 02:04:14.550]
that's correct but it just sounds like my dog in the office correct

[02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:17.450]
the microwave you the uh... the signal

[02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:21.870]
and uh... you don't own the equipment otherwise they just put it in there it's a

[02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:25.790]
three and a half-foot dish and the problem is that most people who can have

[02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:28.870]
like a big dish a six or seven foot dish they're not also going to be able to have

[02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:32.250]
a three and a half foot dish so what's the big deal see the dss the uh...

[02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:34.790]
direct-tv thing that's an eighteen inch dish

[02:04:35.290 --> 02:04:39.290]

no more crappy pictures people are not going to continue paying for crappy

[02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:59.270]
service for snow for all kinds of garbage and uh... for all kinds of outage

[02:04:59.270 --> 02:05:03.790]
to downtime when uh... you know they can have alternatives so they got together

[02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:07.650]
these cable these grave robbers t-c-i and cocks and all these other assholes

[02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:09.630]
and they started this prime star bit

[02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:14.570]
but i haven't seen any uh... tangible evidence that anybody has got it here yet

[02:05:14.570 --> 02:05:17.290]
have they this is probably like the dss the same thing

[02:05:17.290 --> 02:05:20.970]
remember how long that was oh my god we had all those verbal brawl on the

[02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:23.650]

[02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:22.150]
hey but it's it's the one to two hour

[02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:42.430]
hey man what's the 70 sound that we're hearing we travel around town don't you know man

[02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:49.890]
so days were as I think we all live through water take now color

[02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:57.530]
one of the main presidents Jimmy Hopper found a very cement polyester

[02:07:58.490 --> 02:08:04.770]
was on every behind as we sat in real long gas lines

[02:08:06.810 --> 02:08:12.310]
it makes me wonder just why are they back the 70s are going

[02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:14.610]
no bring them back

[02:08:15.690 --> 02:08:20.450]
big and wasted with hot oxygen water is rude people speaking

[02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:21.710]
the

[02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:29.930]
wonder just why are they back I can't believe the stories they have come back

[02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:36.930]
I am talking with me Billy bill is the joke and we all had to watch it

[02:08:39.450 --> 02:08:43.550]
Jason screaming I know my future Nixon

[02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:50.590]
through the words and that right telling lady to speak around me that night but those

[02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:54.410]
two's made up two all right

[02:08:56.270 --> 02:09:04.270]
and now I understand why they are back I'm going to cook it down all day I'm back

[02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:11.490]
I put my chances to go hope I don't ring my neck cause I get to do one step

[02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:20.730]
I'm trying to cook it down now that is time I'm trying to do one away to W.I.O.D. all the rocket scientists all the time baby and of course

[02:09:20.730 --> 02:09:25.250]
oh Jay no coincidence by the way that it all happened around the same time because Kathleen Bell

[02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:30.550]
Andrea Terry Phil Coleman and Max Cordoba all worked in the same area and knew each other

[02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:35.210]
and so it's not a real surprise that they've all cooked up wonderful and a lot of stuff not at all

[02:09:35.210 --> 02:09:39.810]
and what you will see really test it by trust me your honor is going to be very different from what's

[02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:45.850]
been offered today at some point this gets cumulative and it gets ridiculous we have Andrea Terry

[02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:50.690]
statement that isn't even probative because it does not go to the issue that loud and

[02:09:50.690 --> 02:09:54.350]
well the court compelled the court to say that's the word that he's got the Elymphanis Bell statement

[02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:58.450]
he's missing that probative value Philip Coleman has nothing but your safe

[02:09:58.450 --> 02:10:04.250]
probative my ass folded arms to offer which is under 352 of no probative value whatsoever

[02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:09.830]
she goes into them big probative baby gesture invests it ever believed by the way which it will

[02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:17.830]
not be too much knowledge and with respect to the statement by alleged by Max Cordoba we have zero

[02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:22.130]
reliability to that we have no statement we have no notes we have no take and every

[02:10:22.130 --> 02:10:26.670]
mister hot shot mister multi-millionaire mister the most famous one in the world he says oh well

[02:10:26.670 --> 02:10:30.490]
I don't have any notes on that conversation because I don't ever take any notes there is a man

[02:10:30.490 --> 02:10:34.150]
there's your typical lawyer man and he says as marine to marine I'll get him up there and

[02:10:34.150 --> 02:10:37.990]
to stand and I'll tell the truth and he'll tell the truth in the adi adi adi adi

[02:14:43.690 --> 02:14:49.830]

statements unless and until you've had the opportunity to review this i'll give you the opportunity

[02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:16.210]
to talk to mr mccanon uh to see if there are any other notes and my my recollection is that this

[02:15:16.210 --> 02:15:22.130]
is listed in the discovery index and with regards to availability notes and other things so we can

[02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:27.110]

[02:15:27.110 --> 02:15:31.590]
perfectly be to since i'm recruiting cross examination on that issue anyway at this point

[02:15:32.210 --> 02:15:38.750]
why don't we just move along your little jab okay let's go to uh Jupiter hello hello nil

[02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:42.350]
yes sir i'd like to straighten out that caller from the continental get these guys and went in

[02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:47.250]
the continental they saw their little flyers it was t-c-i all these saw same difference

[02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:51.750]
always saw was uh they keep the tv book in there and they have a flyer from national

[02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:57.830]
habitives thirty dollars thirty nine dollars a month for the prime prime star that's all

[02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:05.070]
it's not the prime star it's the dss it's not all i see thirty nine bucks a month that that is uh

[02:16:05.070 --> 02:16:10.510]
the dss right and uh well why do they have that in there they they just keep the tv book in there

[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:14.890]
because it's um cableized oh i see so in other words they uh probably don't even know that's in

[02:16:14.890 --> 02:16:19.370]
there so they don't have to print tv books for themselves they just use some sentinel tv books

[02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:23.690]
got it and one more question about that the uh user talking about a hockey game on the uh this

[02:16:23.690 --> 02:16:27.850]
last night right all four of them aren't they uh isn't that in the package you got to that's

[02:16:27.850 --> 02:16:31.490]

[02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:55.350]
that was it's okay you know you could have yes

[02:26:57.290 --> 02:27:03.090]
did you decide and he and his environment as a detective to try to resolve the issue

[02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:06.750]
as to what it was and how it got there

[02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:13.550]
at that point i was just looking for a person that left it okay now let's talk about the person

[02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:20.650]
left yeah i'm sure that as you stood there looking at an instrumentality of a brutal murder

[02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:26.070]
who seen you had just visited a short time before i killed the cold again to think about the

[02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:33.570]
nature of the person that might have had control and custody of that glove correct control and

[02:27:33.570 --> 02:27:38.330]
custody how do you get custody of a glove no you have to go to court for that well did you think

[02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:43.230]
a big some victim you probably have to interrupt after the custody hearing on a glove scene of the

[02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:49.030]
crime and deposited on oj sentence property sorry i had no knowledge of anything at that point did you

[02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:56.690]
think that no okay did you think that possibly someone who had been involved as a killer might

[02:27:56.690 --> 02:28:03.830]
have deposited that glove wittingly or unwittingly on mr. simpson's property i did not think of any of

[02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:09.790]
these things at that time you didn't think of any of these no did you think that possibly

[02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:15.730]
whoever put that glove there if it was put there with somebody dangerous

[02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:25.510]
possibly what training do you have about what to do when you sense danger what's your first

[02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:32.990]
out of the oh my god i don't really understand that you don't know the safety of the officer i believe

[02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:38.850]
you said yes is a paramount consideration in police work if you could praise it like that and

[02:28:38.850 --> 02:28:42.690]
it's big of Warner brothers too okay let's do a break here because this is really ponderous and

[02:28:42.690 --> 02:28:46.430]
he's basically doing the same thing he's brow-beating and like he did yesterday and saying how come

[02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:50.230]
you were out there for 15 minutes and you didn't draw your peace and you were like you're just

[02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:54.850]
wandering around and matting up the grass and the leaves and all this he's patching around the same

[02:28:54.850 --> 02:29:00.010]
stuff he was patching with yesterday and it's really ponderous man two open lines and date and

[02:29:00.010 --> 02:29:04.370]
to it brides see what i mean about these people we have been smoking here today and i was about to

[02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:08.410]
congratulate the audience on their phenomenal comeback even some of the colors have had something

[02:29:08.410 --> 02:29:12.970]
almost interesting to say today it's been almost a real goddamn radio show after yesterday the

[02:29:12.970 --> 02:29:18.430]
worst the most depressing day all day long on this radio station we felt unloved and uncared we

[02:29:18.430 --> 02:29:22.550]
felt like we were going out of business yesterday and all of a sudden today they make this big glorious

[02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:27.110]
comeback and now that we got this firm in the German on a stand in this old fart standing up there

[02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:33.170]
pretending to be a hot shot lawyer which he was 40 years ago now all of a sudden well now we got

[02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:41.170]
other a fish to fry baby open line and date 751 and a two and brown or two and brown or five two

[02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:46.690]

[02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:54.190]
610 WIOD soon to be the unofficial radio station of the Miami Hurricanes

[02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:59.910]

[02:29:59.910 --> 02:30:04.690]
don't you go back to New York you want bastard 22 till two at WIOD so i go through my little

[02:30:04.690 --> 02:30:08.310]
spiel there and as soon as i finish that like half of the people around there drop off again

[02:30:08.850 --> 02:30:14.430]
so who down are you kidding here's a note here it says please excuse the impersonal form of my

[02:30:14.430 --> 02:30:17.710]
communication with you but i'm afraid if i called in my ex husband heard my question he would

[02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:22.510]
flip out on april 7th i'm heading to Las Vegas with 16 friends to get married was wondering if

[02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:35.510]
propriety of your actions no did you realize when you hurtled the wall that you were inexorably

[02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:40.270]

[02:37:55.630 --> 02:38:01.830]
blacks out there who think that he's not guilty and uh huh that's a given right it's it's a racial

[02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:05.410]
thing it's a racial thing and it's a superstar thing he's a black guy who happened to have been a

[02:38:05.410 --> 02:38:09.510]
big superstar therefore there's a whole bunch of people out there if he stood up and he said it

[02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:13.330]
right now like i've been telling you for weeks they still won't believe it you think he's gonna be

[02:38:13.330 --> 02:38:18.570]

[02:38:45.330 --> 02:38:49.270]
to know if mr. Simpson was home it was important to you it was

[02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:54.370]
