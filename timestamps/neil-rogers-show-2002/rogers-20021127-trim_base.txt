[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]
me that are, you know, half-couldering and, uh, and I just don't like to hear someone say,

[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.640]
pissed off on my way to work. Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that,

[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.880]
and I don't think it's appropriate. You know, if you're going to have to enance a little program

[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.100]
in the middle of your day, leave it there. To make the other program, it's, it's, it's

[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.960]
demeaned us in it, and it really invokes my intelligence and, you know, if that's not clear,

[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.520]
I don't know what is, I'll talk to you later.

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.280]
It puts the notion in the basket. Yeah.

[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.360]
Thanksgiving's here again. It seems like yesterday that we were at it.

[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.640]
Martha's followed Jolly Holiday.

[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.280]
Yeah.

[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.180]
Forget it.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.940]
The way he packed that food away must take 50 plates to feed my brother.

[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.620]
She's on the spot, Josh.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.860]
She's nice up to spam, Sam.

[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.080]
Fasten that salt, Paul.

[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.800]
And then cut this meat.

[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.600]
I need some fried dough, Joe.

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.060]
So get it over here.

[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.700]
I'm cold.

[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.020]
And then you better step back, Jack.

[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.900]
And watch me eat.

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.360]
I love and dearly, I don't want him to be hurt.

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.980]
But we'd be saying grace and he'd be halfway through dessert and it's pathetic.

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.080]
The way he dribbles on his shirt, it's always 50 plates to feed my brother.

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.780]
Yeah!

[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.540]
Big fast thing, Jake.

[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.800]
She can buy that guy.

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.040]
Oh, slavety, please.

[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.880]
And a root beer float.

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.580]
Let go of the fork, dog.

[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.720]
Get away from that most poor.

[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.020]
Sing about that, man, man.

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.840]
It's going down my throat.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.500]
So grab another plate, Nick.

[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.720]
Open up the fridge, baby.

[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.960]
Disappear the spot, bud.

[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.800]
And make room for me.

[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.420]
Got a little love to through.

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480]
It's going to be a sweet tooth.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.920]
Together again, man.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.780]
Thanks, given the meat.

[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.760]
Happy Thanksgiving to you to us, to all.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.480]
Exactly.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.000]
That's so interesting.

[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.380]
904-560-WDQA, I am happy Wednesday to it.

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.040]
And thanks, given the app, but we're getting close enough.

[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.280]
Plus, we're not of us going to be working at Marx, have Carlos.

[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.960]
Now, what happened there at the end of Mojo?

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.480]
I have no idea.

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.280]
Their board had a little glitch.

[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.080]
Their board had a little bitch.

[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.580]
I know that.

[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.020]
And there must be Robert you're talking about.

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.120]
That little bitch.

[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.360]
Speaking of little bitch, boy, yesterday we talked about it.

[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.360]
And thanks to Miguel, who contributed something.

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.060]
It was about time.

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.440]
He had two great moments, which in four hours ain't a lot.

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.760]
But that line about the Chicago, what state is that?

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.460]
And that was pretty good.

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.260]
That was amusing.

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.180]
Thanks.

[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.220]
But the other thing that he reminded us of course,

[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.780]
being the professional Cuban that he is,

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.980]
that yesterday was the third anniversary of Alien washing up on shore.

[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.460]
All right.

[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.480]
Which prompted me to play all that alien stuff, at least most of it.

[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.300]
And wouldn't you know?

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.820]
Five Cubans concealed a board of disabled 21-foot motor boat

[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.660]
towed into port by the US Coast Guard,

[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.120]
popped out of their hiding place and scampered out of a doppy

[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.600]
before they could be stopped virtually

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.840]
winning the right to remain in the country.

[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.460]
But left on the boat,

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.700]
unable to manage the few steps from the boat to dry land,

[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.400]
was the teenage son of one of their Cubans.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.620]
And for most of the day yesterday,

[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.200]
US authorities wrestled with a question of what to do with the 14-year-old,

[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.220]
who under normal circumstances were likely have been taken back to Cuba.

[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.940]
Don't do that.

[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.880]
In the end, US Justice Department officials defused a potential controversy

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.740]
when they ordered the boy brought to shore.

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.780]
The reason the boy has to be a witness against two minemen who allegedly

[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.320]
parliated the boat in our accused of attempting to smuggle him

[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.100]
in along with his father and four others.

[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.760]
The upshot is the boy's father and their companions,

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.880]
like all Cubans whose feet touch US soil,

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.860]
will now likely be allowed to stay in the US,

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.020]
those detained at Sierra Ruchini repatriated,

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.200]
sent back where they come from.

[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.780]
Right now, the decision to drive food him has been made as a prosecutor

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.860]
or a decision that he's a material witness to Jacqueline Verera,

[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.380]
Vassara, whatever the hell her name is,

[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.580]
a spokeswoman for the US Attorney's Office in Miami.

[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.900]
Vassara said Tuesday night that the boy was not yet reunited with his father

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.380]
who was being held with the other boat passengers by federal authorities.

[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.640]
The case may have another wrinkle.

[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.120]
Relatives of the alleged smugglers identified as Elizardo Ries Alvarez

[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.740]
and Martin Mendez Diaz said the people that were accused of smuggling

[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.660]
are smuggling yet other relatives.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.440]
Martha Mendez, who said she's Martin Mendez's wife, said the 14-year-old is her nephew

[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.280]
and his father whom she referred to as laying all his her brother.

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.280]
Other relatives said Ries's girlfriend, D'Aileen Abro,

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.180]
was the lone woman among the passengers.

[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.580]
Luis Crespo, who identified him, said, are you following all these relatives?

[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.280]
The Cubans are the...

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.980]
But you know, but you better write them down because this is going to be as famous as Maris Grissiace

[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.260]
and Lazaro and all those others.

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.060]
Maybe?

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.820]
Luis Crespo, who identified himself as a cousin of Ries's, said it was a not for a

[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.660]
for-profit smuggling operation that were trying to save their families.

[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.840]
He said outside the Cromed Attentance and Center, West Miami-Dade,

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.820]
where family mothers gathered to wait for developments.

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.700]
There was no money involved.

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.680]
The boy whose name was not released last night was flown last evening by

[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.900]
helicopter from Key West to Miami, where authorities held a closed hearing

[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.600]
and federal court.

[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.840]
Later, the teenager was expected to be turned over to the INS for placement,

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.860]
temporarily in a facility for minors until Abuela can come up and check if his penis is growing.

[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.660]
Well, don't you think?

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.420]
I have a good report.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.720]
I have a good report.

[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.740]
Then if Abuela comes and squeezes his penis, then am I growing a little bit?

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.200]
That must be only in their family.

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.280]
Yeah, all right.

[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.360]
I have a very nice report.

[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.500]
One day, surprised this embarkation was especially...

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.440]
By the way, today is our Thanksgiving show, so I don't bother to call on us.

[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.800]
I saw a couple of flashes on there.

[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.940]
It's a nice, easy day for everybody.

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.480]
We're going to play all kinds of great stuff.

[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.240]
It's gonna be a piece of cake a little turkey a little stuffing a little uh, whatever. Hall of ah

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.520]
Monday surprised this embarkation was especially charged because it came on the third anniversary of the rescue

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.060]
It's even other Cuban boy alien Gonzalez

[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.120]
Who's in suing plate touched off an international custody dispute as we all know far too well between his father and Cuba and his

[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.360]
Relatives in the US the so-called Miami family

[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.820]
The I and S to climb to come out of the new boy situation yesterday saying was part of an ongoing investigation

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.060]
But agency spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez ignores that officials did not fail to notice the coincidence of the date with aliens arrival

[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.020]
Don't you think it's an active?

[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.780]
Huh

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.880]
Sure, you don't think these people planned this in advance to you

[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.820]
Of course not US authorities believe the boys mother may still be in Cuba though

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.300]
The father reportedly is claiming custody of the boy. Oh, no, here we go again

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.720]
Even if his mother should try to press a custody claim legal experts say he's too old enough at 14 to a successfully assert his desire to stay that he is old enough

[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.120]
Unlike alien who'd age five was too young to apply for asylum without his father's agreement

[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.980]
The arrival of the scrupper Cubans also comes in the wake of the controversy surrounding the intention of those

[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.320]
235 Haitians who spilled out of a boat of the Rick and backer Cosway last month

[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.300]
How do you like that the heralds as they spilled out of a boat under the Rick and backer Cosway?

[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.520]
What what up what what what what kind of language is that they spilled out of a boat under the Cosway

[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.640]
19 Haitian men were repatriated because they were picked out of the water by Costa before they could be sure

[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.020]
They to Miami-Dade men accused the smuggling in the Cuban world will appear before you had just magistrate today

[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.740]
Ellie Elizarta Ruiz record sure was the owner of a 21 foot well-craft boat and it goes out about this

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.080]
Chris Bo that and that Cresco this and Ruiz and Gonzalez, etc.

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.320]
And so on how do you like that man?

[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.300]
Okay, there you go. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Oh, I love it

[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.640]
I'm that poor come out yesterday go out tell you

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.860]
You people out there. It's a good thing that we're not taking any calls are gonna put any pressure on the audience

[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.360]
Just let him hop on the pool

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.700]
Well, you did the new pool in the second which I know you're low even though we draw the line at nine

[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.940]
Based on what you know which country should the US be attacking now?

[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.980]
We asked yesterday we had 1150 votes some of them were even real

[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.420]
About a few hundred and more even real votes and the rest of them just went more like that

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.460]
They went nuts when they saw this Saudi Arabia wins hands down

[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.600]
240

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.160]
Shake your booty baby

[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.000]
340 said Saudi Arabia were to be attacking

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.100]
None any attack will lead to total chaos 269 people said that

[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.080]
Iraq 177 and there's a Richard Butler. Oh, out while we're there. It's well Paula

[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.900]
Pakistan 161 they're right on Iraq's ass

Canada for calling W moron 110 that brought up she resigned yesterday under enormous pressure

[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.460]
We'll get to that North Korea 40 and Iran only eight only eight for Iran

[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.940]

Got a lot of stuff today girl admits leaving a threatening note on plain and West Palm Lefair de moron a fini

[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.400]

[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.920]
WGNA is moving. They're swapping with LVJ in Palm Beach County

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.860]
GNA is moving from 1040 to 640

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.980]
But GNA is not an all these station in the genre of magic

[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.440]
Their oldies are like more all these I mean more old than the other ones oldie and moldy

[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.840]

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.500]

[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.120]
God, I love that thing

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.380]
Anyway, almost all men sooner or later start singing that song where the hell did it go?

[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.540]
It's vanishing. It's doing a disappearing act

[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.180]

920 to 560 WK happy Thanksgiving it's our annual Thanksgiving show which I finally

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.800]
Wized up this year because you know I could have worked tomorrow

[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.580]
It would have been happy to have like one regular on tomorrow

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.380]
And I said I thought about it for a couple of seconds and I said no

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.100]
I don't think so why don't I do that my a moron or what

[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.160]
Pulles up the brand new pull is up there who would you like to hear six to nine aim on WQM

Rick and suds four

[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.500]
The old first team Joe Gellie and D4 one

[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.800]
This pull just went up there only moments ago

[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.680]
These are the early returns run and run one

[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.180]
I wouldn't listen no matter what one

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.960]
Classical music one

[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.540]
I'm happy with Mo

[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:43.840]
Zero and Paul castinova zero so far but those are the very early returns. Okay. Don't get too emotional about that

[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.640]
Don't also forget 1230 give me the reminder give me a little nudge by long distance

[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.140]
Okay, for the football game. No seriously don't let me forget about that

[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.720]
Got the Patriots and the Lions remember the Lions will beat the Bears on Sunday according to Miguel

[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.680]
Uh-huh the Patriots and the Lions are playing our words that game is that a Detroit

[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.740]
Now you know the usually are those games usually are because it's a Thanksgiving uh, it's a tradition

[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.000]
You always have Dallas and Washington play which they're playing the late game at 405

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.640]
1230 it's the Patriots and the Lions were a bit of a plan probably in the Pontiac no doubt

[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.900]
Far enough away from the inner city to be safe at any rate

[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.040]
So that game will be on CBS and I'll be you know just sitting here. I'm not gonna like ignore the show for that half hour

[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.220]
Am I yes

[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.680]
That's heavy duty stuff. This is a big game

[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.800]
Even though it's a girls team that they're playing nevertheless

[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.120]
It's a very very big game for the Patriots who were like wobbly in the second half of that game against the Vikings

[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.380]
Vikings have won a game on a road since before Abe Lincoln was a child

[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:51.120]
And the Patriots tried like held a blow it a 15-year-old girl traveling with her soccer team admitted believing a threatening note on an airplane as a prank officials in West Palm Beach said

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.740]
Brilliant

[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.860]
What are we gonna do with that bit with that little girl, huh?

[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.260]
The girl whose name was not released by FBI investigators will not face federal charges

[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:05.200]
She may however be subject to state prosecution. All right said Palm Beach County Sheriff spokesman Paul Miller

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:12.120]
The note which read there is a bomb under seat 19c death is a coming was found tucked inside a window shade on the plane

[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.140]
What a sense of humor, huh?

[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.840]
The girl who's from Palm Beach County had returned home from Atlanta for the Monday morning flight official said

[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.840]
The note was discovered early Monday afternoons about 200 passengers

[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.680]
Reboarding for the planes we turned to Atlanta officials from Delta Airlines said

[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:34.240]
The plane was searched and its boarding passengers were we screened Miller said TSA spokesman Brian Dural said the flight to Atlanta was delayed from about two hours

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.180]
It's believed to be the first red made by a juvenile at the Palm Beach airport Miller said and hopefully the last

[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:47.400]
You know what I'm saying? I don't we got a lies a lot of wise punks out there, but this ain't the time to be screwing around about the bomb threats

[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.120]
Bitch

[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.620]
Look at that rick and suds are off to the races on that pool. How do you like that? Huh?

[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.180]
Whoo, have you taken a peek at that 24 votes good galley miss Molly. I love this show get out of here

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.060]
Here's the news you've been waiting for was just a matter of time a

[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:13.600]
Prime Minister Jean Critch-ends come communication director resigned yesterday over that counterviz because by her private comment last week that president bushes a moron

[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.500]
Correct

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.620]
Francois ducro who initially offered to quit but was kept on by Critch-ends leaving the Prime Minister's office after all

[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.300]
According to a statement issued by Critch-ends chief of staff

[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.520]
What a surprise, huh?

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:34.240]
I need help in a letter of resignation to Critch-end ducro wrote is very apparent to me that the controversy will make it impossible for me to do my job

[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.380]
I would therefore like to leave my position as director communications immediately the letter said

[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.840]
I'm grateful for the support you've given me during this difficult time

[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.460]
Critch-end accepted the resignation this time responding in a letter in your almost four years as director communications

[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.880]
You serve the government as a whole that's with the w and me personally with extraordinary skill and dedication

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.000]
I wonder which side of his mouth he said that out of the comment made in the discussion with the radio reporter last week at the

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.900]
Nato Summit and project as the wide-check for public has dominated Canadian media and opposition politicians have called for a resignation

[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:10.840]
What a moron is the co-determinated to do co-ordering what she called a private conversation with a reporter that was over her by the reporters who wrote about it

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.760]
She apologized last week, but the fewer has continued in Canada a on Monday some opposition members of parliament

[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.460]
No to the coming appeared in any racking newspaper editorial characterized as Western opposition to mr

[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.920]
Bush

[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.160]
Critch-end initially tried to play down the incident telling your prognosed conference the comment was unfortunate

[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.600]
That mr

[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.140]
Bush was a friend of his in Nato moron at all you should see some of the letters to the editor newspapers here

[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.160]
There was a cute one yesterday in the star that said isn't it possible that mr

[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.220]
Bush could be Critch-end's friend animal run also

[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.080]
That's great. Yeah

[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:47.020]
Because birds of a feather you know morons of a feather hang out together is what he said out of the right side of his mouth

[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.940]
Oh, I've had a he's something that Critch-end they got billboards around town here doing it count down to when he leaves office

[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.260]
Like I think he's got six months to go or something like that in the bottom of the billboard. It says why wait leave now

[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.120]
It's beautiful. He also denied Critch-end that the comment harmed relations with Washington seeing him

[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.860]
He received no official complaints from the US officials at the summit

[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.240]
Probably because they all know that the president is

[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.280]
Palm Beach radio station swap spots on the dial. Let's get this right and who better to turn to than our good close-balled head friend

[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.640]
Little Tommy jico at least wrote something about radio

[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.160]
It's not about a station in data browser released at least it's something about radio

[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.360]
That's a start Tommy at least it's something about the local scene as opposed to another one of those 8,000 puff pieces

[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.720]
About some network TV show like that crampy movie you were valuing that Martin Lewis thing that was a real piece of it turret

[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.800]
It says Thanksgiving won't be a day rest in Palm Beach radio

[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.160]
W.J. NA home of adult standards by adult standards

[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.640]

[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.200]
To make it easy for listeners to remember the transition will take place at 6 40

[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.400]
Tomorrow night

[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.060]
We'll see this is dated November 28th, which is tomorrow

[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.680]
On the website and it says tonight. So I'm assuming that means tomorrow Thanksgiving night whatever

[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.700]
WLVJ which currently offers Christian programming on 6 40 a.m

[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.060]
We'll change its base of operations to 10 40 a.m

[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.700]
Or worse signal cuz who the hell wants here that

[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.980]
Both stations which will retain their current call letters are owned by James crystal broadcasting

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.820]
The switches being made to expand the reach of the music stations. 6 40 is a more powerful signal in 10 40

[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.880]
When the transition is complete WJNAs expected to be available from southern parts of Dave County Deport Saint loosely

[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.160]
Despite the switch to less potent dial position WLVJ will be available throughout broad and poverty counties

[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.080]
Acquiring in general manage your Steve Lapa

[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.480]

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.340]
You

[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.340]
We need a leader who will give us back on track

[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.920]
Maybe it's time we had a present

[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.820]
Oh

[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:33.200]
I see them on TV dressed up in it so close

[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.940]
I heard his writing make my just be change girl John

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.600]
His name is colon how he happens to people at

[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.840]
The latest home safety leaders of the past

Some folks close in my day

[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.800]
Say there ain't no way

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.880]
What the time they change you know that next one

[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.800]
I'm

[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.600]
930 205 60 WQM this fact you just sent me is one of the most amusing of all time

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.060]
It goes to sure at times the case usual is full of crap because the five to choose between

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.940]
Believing the facts or believing little Tommy bald headed jica. I think you'll go with the facts. I'll go with the facts

[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.920]
It says dear Neil please have faith in this fact so while I heard jikas comments on the radio station WJNA

[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.920]
I must totally disagree with his column

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.300]
I'm the writer who wrote you yesterday and someone who drives a truck with an AM radio

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.200]
I listen to 1040 AM each day for about five hours

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.560]
I certainly hope those five hours aren't like around 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at any because obviously

[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.760]
Now he's not ladies listen to must

[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.100]
While only on occasion they will slip in a real moldy oldie

[00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:02.340]
They play mostly 60 stuff with plenty of eagles fleetwood max Chicago vogue's etc. A very refreshing change proving once again

[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:10.100]
In reference to Tom jica proving once again any asshole who thought alpha is entertaining should probably start begging groceries for a living

[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:15.280]
I stand by yesterday's letter. Thanks and we thank you profusely for giving us the facts on your facts

[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.840]
Frank Sinatra and Barbara strives to N. My S. He when he writes a column like that it gives the impression that it's one of those stations

[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.260]
It's like a throwback. I mean that's stuff when I would nickers and high-button shoes man

[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.060]
That went out with like men's two-piece bathing suits

[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.580]
And you guys didn't even see smallville last night shame on you shame on you

[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.060]
That was pretty emotional and Clark actually was kissing at the wolf while she was a wolf

[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.220]
She's a wolf in hot babes clothing

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.220]
And of course we we went to commercial there

[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.780]
We didn't actually see what happened after that emotional kiss in the cave got only knows what happened in there

[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.580]
Squirt Squirt I doubted and then at the end of the show Lana just weeping falls into Clark's arms

[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.980]
Because she got the car all at what's his name so you do know what's his name Whitney Whitney

[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.900]
See it goes got a thing for Whitney like splong guys yeah Whitney

[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.520]
Whitney is missing an action. He's am I a

[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.800]
I'm saving this facts. I'm at a frame it

[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.280]
And that's gonna be the assignment for Carlos

[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.260]
Can you remember this? Sure go on your way home today

[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.680]
I'll let's see 1040 it's still I haven't changed frequencies yet

And you're gonna have to do it today because otherwise they're gonna be playing just holiday me christmas music starting like tomorrow tomorrow night

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.540]
So on your way home today tune in 1040 wjn a

[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.100]
Sounds like a Canadian station to me and

[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.340]
Just give us a report on Friday of what they're playing okay

[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:48.020]
No, mark that down and mark it right underneath it to think you got noted in 1230 reminded old man that the football games on already got that up on CBS

[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:54.380]
You got it up all right speaking of Thanksgiving the first Thanksgiving a career and I'm just getting my stuff out of the way here right now

[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.380]
Okay, once I clear the deck which I don't have all that much that is I got a pile here halfway to the ceiling

[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.280]
Dude, it's really sad the stuff. I'm never gonna I know I'll never get to a lot of this stuff

[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.960]
But it's just it's there's a lot of good stuff in here, but I'll never get to it

[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.160]
But at any rate uh the important stuff the really earth-shaking earth-shattering like that kid that washed up

[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.440]
I'm sure with those other acubans

[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:22.600]
I'm sure alien is just very emotional about that back in Cuba probably wants to come back here and buy the kid a happy meal. Wouldn't you think?

[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.860]
Let's celebrate Christmas together. Yeah, let's celebrate Christmas by having a bubble come over and check out your penis

[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.620]
See I keep mentioning that because both of these guys both Carlos and Miguel are

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.060]
And George as well if he were there today, which he's not

[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.240]
Incredibly embarrassed because back during those days when that nasty crap was going on

[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.520]
It was suggested. Oh, this is a this is a common thing in Cuban families

[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:52.580]
This is a custom. I had never heard of that before that day that grand that grandmothers check out little kids penises to see if they're growing, you know

[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.640]
Never before ever ever ever before had ever even heard of any such thing father of tool thought he said he thought it was pretty good idea

[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.840]
First Thanksgiving occurred in Florida researchers says let's hear it. Oh, right. Something good for Florida maybe

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:16.380]
Michael Ganon says he is known in Massachusetts as the Grinch who stole Thanksgiving after declaring it was the Spanish and not the Pilgrims who first celebrated Thanksgiving in the New World

[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:27.100]
Ganon a University of Florida history professor a Geeder said the first Thanksgiving in a permanent settlement occurred in September 8th 1565 in St. Augustine

[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.620]
Pedro Manendez de Avales and 800 Spanish settlers celebrated a massive Thanksgiving and invited the native

[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.940]
Sealoid tribe who occupied the site. He said did I tell you say in Augustine is older than sawdust

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.560]
ancient

[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.460]
It was the first community active religion and Thanksgiving in the first permanent European settlement in the land

[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.000]
Ganon wrote his 1965 book The Cross and the Sand the Pilgrims didn't have their first Thanksgiving

[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.780]
We'll fill 1621 a full 56 years after the Spanish

[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.880]
Manendez and his father was probably

[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.640]
Died on Cucito of stu-mate from salted pork and garbanzo beans laced with garlic seasoning

[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.820]
Hard sea biscuits and red wine said Ganon based on what the Spanish had aboard their five ships

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.940]
Cucito, you ever heard that?

[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.620]
Nope. No

[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:20.440]
If the Ciro Indians contributed food that the menu could have included wild turkey venison go for tortoise

[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:27.280]
Mullet corn beans and squash Ganon said and just think they didn't even have bino back in those days

[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.660]
Go for tortoise

[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.980]
Go for tortoise or go for the gold

[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.600]
Father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza gráhales. Oh, I love that. I'd like to say that about a hundred times today

[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.800]
Father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza gráhales. That's with the J. Am I saying that right?

[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.900]
That's right

[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.980]
Celebrated the first mass on that day and he reflected in his personal chronicle that the Indians

[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.460]
imitated all they saw done

[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.320]
The first nice giving is recounted by Ganon and we gathered together an article published in his in this month's in Augustine

[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.360]
Catlick the publication of the Catholic diocese of Saint Augustine

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.440]
The 1565 celebration wasn't the first time's giving Ganon said numerous thanks giveings for a safe voyage and landing

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.520]
Had been made in Florida by such explorers as one Paz de Lioz in 1513 and 1521

[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.440]
Penn Philor de Navarés in 1528 for an end of the Soto in 1529

[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.120]
Father Luis concerted Barbarco in 1549 and Tristan de Luna in 1559

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.900]
But none of them had a name like father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza gráhales

[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.700]
I love I'm saving this oh I gotta have this father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza gráhales

[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.520]
The French who came to the St. John's River interjectsville in 1562 and Renee de la la la de Nier in

[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.460]
1564 also offered prayers of thanksgiving well before the pilgrims get in so the pilgrims were Johnny come lately

[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.200]
They took credit for the whole thing, but they were like way down the line

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.600]
Here's something I predicted on his show months and months and months a long time ago

[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.020]
While other people were touting it on his station, which since we draw the line at Nier and I won't much in no names

[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.580]
Look at the way Rickon says they're pulling away from the pack on our poll

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.320]
Who would you like to hear six to nine a.m. on Q.A. and Rickon says 49

[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.300]
Is that incredible?

[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.820]
I'm not surprised

[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.540]
40 guy for Rickon said so far

[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.820]
Out of the first 115 votes. I wouldn't listen no matter what 21

[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:23.320]
Now I'd say those probably would be how it spurms people, but I don't know because he's still on now

[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.400]
The first team Joe Gellie and Defo 15 maybe how it ran out of Lisbon this morning

[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.960]
Uh, the poll casted over 13. Oh, hey listen Paul no matter how much you tried a lot I load up this

[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.080]

We'll get to the assault even and momentarily and that is sad note the soul are going out of business. They're leaving

[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.880]
That's fuck yep. We have no soul. Oh, we have no soul and Miami. Dyke basketball leaves town

[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.100]
My and loco

[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.100]
This is for real by 60

[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.260]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase

[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.680]
I

[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.700]
Like the park in his face

[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:18.980]
That's why we take what gives him the right. Oh, I think his wife what a bite it off tonight

[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.060]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase

[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.220]
This grace to the human race

[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.500]

Riley stole my briefcase

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.480]
I like a part in his face

[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.040]
Hell

[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.520]
Rick Riley you're an asshole

[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.880]
Yeah, go now

[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:56.480]
From the twisted minds who brought you hollow wing comes an entirely new dimension in horror

[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.720]
Don't look in the oven or you'll experience the stock naked terror that is

[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.740]
Thanks to me

[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:12.140]
A family just like yours eats a bird that was once alive

[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.520]
Mm-hmm, and they eat until they feel like they're going to explode

[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.140]
But it doesn't stop there

[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.020]
Uncle Luther

[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.540]
No, it's time to entertain the inlaw

[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:37.020]
Is that fish I smell of a dog? I'm allergic enough and you'll think they're never going to leave

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:43.740]
So uh, where do I put these suitcases and just when you thought you could escape by watching TV

[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:52.680]
You discover there is no way out now game number two of our holiday NFL quadruple header

[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:53.940]

[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.020]
The annual terror is back

[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.840]
Plus that a good way

[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.780]
Stop playing in a dining room near you 946 and 560 wqm

[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.140]
You know what they say these are the times the try men's soul

[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.380]
Okay, isn't that what they said

[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.280]
Yeah, that's what they said financial was forced the soul out of my head

[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.580]
No, maybe we could use a good exercise now

[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.160]
The son has said on the soul says the son sentinel

[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.060]
Signing financial difficulties and need to concentrate on my amies nva team Eric Woolworth the heat groups president of business operations

[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.640]
Is expected to announce today that the organization and the wnva have decided to see a cease operations

[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.500]
And my me as predicted on this show probably right around the time they started did not tell you that the dyke ball would never make it in this town

[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.640]
Yes, you did

[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:48.720]
Woolworth spent most of the day on the phone with the wnva office owner Mickey Ererson referred all questions to Woolworth during two tenets heat game against the LA Lakers

[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.360]
Woolworth Eric Woolworth all we used to like his a five-and-dime store is a lot

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.920]
Woolworth said he was instructed by wn do they still have Woolworth are they out of business

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.560]
Not down here anyways. I haven't seen him

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:05.660]
Woolworth said he was instructed by wnva officials not to release any information on the heat group returning to the franchise to the league

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.720]
Which will relocate the team we were told by the board of governors not to make any comment Woolworth said

[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.740]
Neither the six-year-old women's basketball league nor the three-year-old soul have ever turned a profit

[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:18.880]
The league officials wouldn't say how much money the team lost since its inaugural season 2000 you can bet your bottom dollar

[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.440]
It's a bundle

[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.080]
It is estimated the company spent two million dollars this year

[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.000]
Then included coaches salaries plus the players house in car rental travel to food expenses

[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.840]
The league paid the players salaries the league is owned collectively by the NBA owners

[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.180]
We knew that the team ownership felt the team had run its course in Miami with Emmett the helm

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.860]
Didn't we also lose the our good buddy Ray Hudson and the soccer team the fusion huh not too long ago

[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860]
The order soccer oh

[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.600]
How do you like that? What is going on in that town for crying out loud?

[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:53.960]
Susere Hudson Miami fusions head coach and I love the queen of South Florida Neil Rogers should be in Brooklyn in palace

[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:59.120]
But we'll keep him here. Oh too bad. We couldn't keep you here, right? We know of the team, but he had a good sense of humor

[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:05.800]
My Amy is the second team to be cut loose by an NBA franchise this year the Orlando miracle was

[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.260]
Dispainted earlier this year their model was if anybody comes to see us play it's a miracle

[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:15.520]
Several other wnva franchise have been rumored to be considering relocating to San Antonio including the Detroit shock

[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.740]
The Charlotte sting and the Utah stars that's with two Z's the stars is

[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.360]
The soul was never mentioned making today's expected announcement more stunning. How do you like them apples? Huh?

[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.980]
Miami loses its soul that should have been a headline on the front page of the paper right under the new Ileon

[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.040]
Better than that sunset stink

[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.400]
Hi jack-or-confessed under threat of castration. I like this story

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.040]
This is from the UK independent newspaper

[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:51.400]
The Arab Israeli citizen accused of attempting to hijack an aircraft and fly it into a building said yesterday that he never tried to seize the controls

[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.280]
Toffy Fuchsarade

[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.260]
All said he confessed when Turkish police threatened to castrate him

[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:07.160]
Mr. Fukra that's for short a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship as being held in a Turkish prison after being accused of tried to hijack an LL flight from

[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.040]
Tel Aviv to Istanbul on November 17

[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.400]
Allowed portrayed the incident as proof of the efficiency of its security

[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.820]
Mr. Fukra was wrestled on the floor by two security guards posing as passengers

[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.180]
Mr. Fukra climbed and interviewed with Israel's Ha'aret's newspaper that never tried to hijack the aircraft

[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.900]
He said he instead had an altercation with the stewardess

[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:30.300]
Mr. Fukra told Ha'aret he was angry because as an Arab he had to indirect the security checks in Tel Aviv airport

[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.960]
I was nervous on the flight. He said it was the first time I ever flew

[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.360]
I got up before landing in the stewardess yelled at me

[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.440]
I shouted back on the security guard's pounced on me. I felt at the ground

[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.500]
I don't have any more memory of what happened after that

[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.540]
There were wildly differing versions of the events on the flight Mr. Fukra's version

[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.840]
Tellies with some of the early accounts but several passengers said they saw him try to break into the cockpit

[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.660]
Last week the Israeli government described the incident as a terror attack

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.160]
Mr. Fukra said he confessed under duress from Turkish interrogators

[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.360]
They told me that they castrate anyone who doesn't cooperate with them

[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.240]
So I told them anything they wanted to hear he said that's the way to do it

[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.280]
We ought to be doing that down there and give him with al-Qaeda

[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.420]
You either answer the questions or we'll cut your balls off right?

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.560]
I thought I'd do it

[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.040]
Still this pussy footing around

[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.320]
Is it 12.30? It is the Patriot game on five or a minute. Okay

[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.460]
No sir. I'm very serious about that because you know me when you get old and people like me. Oh

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.500]
Can't you remember to put your shirt on in the morning? That's why I'm sitting here in my shorts. No socks

[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.680]
Nice and comfy. I'm gonna make it almost a 28 degrees today. The sun is shining blue sky. It's beautiful

[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.100]
Every time somebody gets on there before the show like Tristra effort. Oh, you freezing your ass off up there. No

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.160]
Got a whole bunch of snow. No none

[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.020]
It's it's beautiful. It's so high as they say

[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.600]
Is they saying Turkey it's a real much higher

[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.680]

Vote so far Rick and suds pulling away 72 votes

[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.220]
I would listen no matter what you prize put on 24

[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.700]
The first team Joe Geldy and D for 18 people want that back

[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.180]
Paul Castronoba. Isn't that interesting?

[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.380]
Isn't that something he still stuck there at 13

[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.860]
Now that was about 20 minutes ago and I said don't bother trying to load up the poll poly because no matter

[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.300]
What you're not getting hired on this station all of a sudden I guess he went away

[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.680]
Don't take it personal Paul unless you want to

[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.820]

Wait before about the counters by if ever there was a guy qualified to be a counters by us Robert the group band boy

[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.160]
He's all over the place even and the best part of it is even he doesn't know which side he's on

[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.600]
Because he enjoys it so much he enjoys all the backstabbing so much

[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.920]
At least 85 people fall ill aboard cruise ship. This isn't the same old story. This is a new one

[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.700]
I don't know what am I ever gonna have to say to get you people to stop wasting your money on those cruises

[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.280]
There is nothing good going to happen on a cruise ship. So okay

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.620]
You're gonna get sick you're gonna get caught in a hurricane somewhere some crap you're gonna fall overboard

You're gonna get seasick all these things

Your wife or girlfriend is gonna get raped

[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:43.680]
Disney cruise line said yesterday at least 85 people are reporting flu-like symptoms four days into a seven-day cruise to the western carabine aboard the cruise ship magic

[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.640]
Maybe they can rename it tragic

[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.740]
Disney spokesman Mark Joronsky said the former head of these centers for disease control and prevention vessel sanitation program

[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.800]
Don Turner has been hired in Florida to come in islands to join the ship today

[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.700]
How about those least by the way?

[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.100]
Pulled it out of their ass. Boy, I tell you any of the beagle played pretty weak last night

[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.680]
But they wanted five before we watched in last night Panthers in LA the night. We're carrying that game you bet you we are

[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.640]

Anyway, he's there because of his years of expertise and overseeing clean up to Ronsky said he can work with our experts aboard the ship

[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.880]
To make sure everything is safe and get this thing out of control. Yeah, right

[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.100]
Yeah, they're gonna have a meeting at Louise in the Bronx where he'll be safe

[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.980]
The Disney spokesman described the sickness as like the flu and said the symptoms are mostly vomiting

[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.480]
Oh lovely on diarrhea

[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.940]
The CDC tells us it appears to be spread by person-to-person contact

[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.580]
You're on skis said but the cruise line said the CDC is not excluded other possible sources including food or water contamination

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:14.200]
Yeah, Disney also dispatched two Walt Disney World microbiologist help oversee steps to sanitize the ship

[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.960]
How do you like them apples? I just keep sapping like an epidemic of these and of course we had that

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.180]
Holland that I'm stood on deal that ship the ship from hell

[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:31.360]
There's only two more important things that I definitely about maybe three that I definitely got to get to here before I unleash all of this

[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.020]
Good and you notice a lot of the stuff most of the stuff I'm playing today. We haven't heard about a hundred years

[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.340]
If you notice that or not yeah, well, what's wrong with that?

[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.480]
You don't sound too enthusiastic about it

[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.840]
Well, I haven't gotten to the good I haven't gotten to the real good stuff. Yeah, I'm holding back

[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.760]
Just a little bit of a tease

[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.420]
Teeth

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.780]
Okay, this Miguel man. It's pretty obvious to me that the Georgia's gotten to him

[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.100]
Now seriously when he told you that business about wow, you're not getting paid for this anyways

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.260]
So I'm pretty soon. He's gonna want to get paid for by the word

[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.800]
50 cents

[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.140]
Like John Davidson a hockey guy wants to get paid by the word

[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.120]
Seck shop makes religious conversion sells bibles instead. Let's hear it. Oh

Putney Kentucky

named after our close personal friend Michael puttley at channel 10

[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.120]
In this mountain community made up of largely conservative Christians

[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.900]
Michael breath weight and his adult novelty shop didn't fit in

[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.700]
Church-going neighbors did everything. It could have closed him down

[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.220]
Nothing worked until a higher power intervened

[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.200]
breath weight with tears pooling in his eyes

[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:44.200]
Have got persuaded him to close the shop burn the sex toys he had in stock and open a Bible bookstore in its place. Oh, right

[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:51.180]
A pile of ashes in his parking lot is all that remains of the vibrators leather goods books another porn paraphernator

[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.180]
I sure hope the women that come in there don't confuse them bibles with the

[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.880]
vibrators, you know what?

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.560]
Remember that scene in the exorcist

[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:07.900]
Let's Jesus morally I couldn't sell the name longer he said it's something you can't do when you're saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost

[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:16.100]
Holy crap now neighbors are embracing breath weight helping him to restock his five-year-old store with Christian merchandise and buying groceries for him his wife and daughter

[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.940]
Until his new business begins to turn a profit. Let's hear it

[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.400]
But that good the best business in the world baby that good old-time religion

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:28.980]
You

[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.280]
How it dated sentenced to die for a crime he didn't commit

[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.300]
Now on the lap he seeks to clear his name

[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.040]
Only the one-on-one knows the truth

[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.520]
You

[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.680]
T. I could have been free

[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:59.160]
Where he goes the police are at his here very engine chuckle and charge with a violent grudge

[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.680]
The stupid

[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.920]
I want to wear that lung head his slurring hot as the one armed man

[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.700]
Curly Howard

[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:15.660]
The stupidity right at our

[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.500]
I told you there was good stuff coming tonight

[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.700]

I'm lost

[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.980]
I don't think I've ever done this before I'm doing a show today began you know why because of the habit

[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.460]
This is made sound like an excuse which it is but other habit of doing those shows on Thanksgiving every year

[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.660]
So I've convinced myself that this is Thanksgiving day. It's not Thanksgiving day

[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:46.420]
There's no football game on today and you assholes there you both going along with it. Yeah

[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.640]
You guys let the football game was today you guys

[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.180]
No, you both you both

[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.240]
Both of you were saying oh yeah, we'll remind you 12 30. It's on CBS. You don't know what what's going on

[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.320]
The day we were over so we can't remind you tomorrow

[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.860]
You both are doing so many drugs before you get started every morning and by the time it gets to be 9 o'clock

[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.740]
You haven't had any idea what planet you're on much less what day it is no

[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:15.620]
I thought you wanted us to remind you for tomorrow. I wrote the note down nudge at 12 30 for the juice. Okay, nudge this

[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.860]
Thanks, give me get a put a credit for that and also and and by Eric

[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.360]
We don't want to bother you. I know it's the day before Thanksgiving. You're probably in training for tomorrow

[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.260]
But we do have to make I didn't mean run and run. I meant Bob and Tom and again. I'm just I'm lost today

[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.200]
Just had a brain fart sorry

[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.300]
So thanks to my close to personal friend here who's a chronic factor for reminding me and of course

[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.520]
Probably said I noticed a lot of phones flash in earlier and we're not answering the phones because we don't want to put

[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.400]
You know pressure on the audience after calling today on this holiday show

[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.980]
But they're probably saying hey idiot asshole. Why don't you get it right? Okay, so I didn't mean the right

[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.100]
That's me now I got at least I fessed up to it. I'm a moron

[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.160]
Maybe it isn't the president. Maybe it's me. She was talking about

[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.980]
I don't think you thought you wanted us to remind you tomorrow. You want to meet her might you tomorrow

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.580]
No, I thought it was today. We need to shut up for a quick while you're behind

[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.140]
How about Bob and Tom? We don't want run and run on there although they well leave him on there and then put

[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.580]
Bob and Tom on also

[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.340]
We can leave run and run they got 12 votes

[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.620]
There's certainly not in last place

[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.700]
Anyway, who would you like to hear six to nine a.m. I'm wc and be sure and get Bob and Tom on there

[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.040]
I kind of want to get push. I know you're under a lot of pressure

[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.520]
You're not getting any sleep. You're about being worked like I overworked like crazy

[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.000]
By the way, do you ever get that stuff from him about those links?

[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.480]
No, the only links he knows about are the Jimmy Deans those are the only links he cares about

[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.440]
He can eat about three four packages that before he gets out of the second morning

[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:50.760]
Rick and suds 95. I wouldn't listen no matter what 29 the first team Joe Gildey and Diffo they want the boys back 23

[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.400]
Classical music 15. I think that would be appropriate for the show to be following

[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:03.120]
They told it and that stuff don't you? Yeah, Paul Castron over 14. He voted again run and run 12 and I'm happy with Mo

[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:08.320]
Boy, we draw the line at the eye and that's how many votes he's got to boy

[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.060]
So thanks for reminding me because how could I have met Bob and Tom?

[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.920]
I didn't mean Ron and Rob but since they got a few votes and even though they don't exist anymore leave them on there just for kicks

[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.160]
I hear this story. I've been meaning to get to because you know what a dog lover I am and I feel really bad

[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.520]
We're not doing a fundraiser this year

[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.360]
For what would it help the name of that place pet animal pet rescue a band that abandoned whatever hell of his abandoned pet rescue

[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.240]
And that's because Miguel is lazy and because he doesn't get any help from fat to reen back there

[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.620]
Who's the busy eating Doritos and and the Twinkies

[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.880]
And so he didn't want to like take the whole project on by himself this year plus it just I don't know

[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.120]
It's just that one had no

[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.080]
What you're the one who said no that no that was the second time that was after I said let's go ahead and do it anyway

[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:56.420]
No originally where I was told no I was told you don't really want to do this do you you don't want to do it do you we're not doing it do you by who who told you that you

[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.260]
In George no

[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:02.860]
Well George told me that directly. He said he said you were the one didn't want to be bothered with it because you have to do all the work

[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.520]
No

[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.220]
So either you're calling George a liar while doing more liars on the air

[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.320]
I love it

[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.060]
That was great in Amsterdam. That was that was some good times

[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.140]
What did I do two shows from there some good? Yeah, wasn't really such good times because I was sick the whole damn time with that

[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.400]
Oh

[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.520]
That's sinus infection, but those were pretty interesting because Miguel and George were like

[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.680]
hostile just

[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.600]
Ripping each other like crazy. I just had to sit back and you know

[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.100]
And watch the spectacle

[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.880]
15,000 years with man's best friend

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.400]
tight bond between dogs and masters unless you research surprises according to CNN.com

[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.340]
About 15,000 years of friendship between man and dog have helped man's best friend to develop the unique ways of understanding humans

[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.780]
Abilities that still are some of the scariest to scientists and dog lovers several studies released this week

[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.700]
Found don't forget remind me that football game

[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:05.340]
Okay, whether it's a big old but send you your bass at home scientists say dogs all over the globe

[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:09.720]
They send it from one common ancestor probably somewhere in East Asia about 15,000 years ago

[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.300]
And they have followed man through his migrations over the earth

[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.900]
Dogs are an important part of our human history and until now there hasn't been much common knowledge

[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:23.180]
Only a lot of common guessing about their origins said Peter Sevalinen a geneticist at the Royal Institute of Technology and Stock on Sweden

[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:31.260]
You know that Hans blicks they cheap weapons inspector but in Iraq right he's a sweet did you know that I thought he was dutch that name sounds very dutch to me

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.240]
Hans blicks

[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.020]
He's a Shweed

[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.040]
Which means he probably don't like to juice too much but then again who does

[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:44.180]
Three studies in this week science magazine provide evidence that early humans had domesticated great wolves by the time they crossed the

[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.480]
Bering Strait to settle a new world 12 to 14,000 years ago

[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.860]
DNA analysis of dogs worldwide showed the most genetic diversity in East Asia

[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:58.440]
Meaning dogs would likely been domesticated. They're the longest another study that compared old and new world dogs found that keen eyes in North and South America

[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.800]
Also descended from that same Eurasian mother

[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:07.300]
We know the dogs re what what to say about whose mother? I said you mama

[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:13.840]
We know that dogs were useful for lots of things in stone age culture as draft animals as in hunting for warmth and protection

[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.280]
So Jennifer led it a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian institutions

[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:25.060]
National Museum of Natural History and ensuring food shelter survival and play modern dogs have somehow genetically required an inside about humans

[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.240]
That is earned in the title of man's best friend

[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.320]
It looks like dogs really do understand what we're trying to tell them that they're thinking about what we want

[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.760]
And they understand what that we're trying to communicate said Brian here of Harvard University. You author one of the studies

[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.160]
Do you ever wonder that what dogs are thinking?

[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.460]
Seriously, we ever want now to come on

[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.100]
Then what where did that come from?

[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.960]
That sounded like one of the things that would drop in on one of the sports nerd shows the real bushly

[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.760]
droppings, okay, come on. It's in there. It's in where to the DCS

[00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:01.240]
It is in the DCS under what dog bark SFX dash dog get out of here. I've never seen that in my life

[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:02.740]
SFX

[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.140]
I'm gonna even have SFX that must be something that

[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.020]
Shrimp would put in there after I left that's it's not in here

[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.040]
Now I don't have any of that good thank goodness

[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.600]
Not only did the dogs here tested pickup on what human researchers are trying to convey

[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.780]
They surprise scientists by doing it much better than other species even chimpanzees

[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.800]
Here's experiment worked in the following manner a researcher stood near two containers one of which had food inside

[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.160]
Testing dogs puppies wolves and chimpanzees the researcher would send some QE thereby looking at or tapping

[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.880]
Now or putting some mark on the food container

[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:42.080]
The adult dogs and puppies picked the correct container farmer often they did the chimps of the wolves did and farmer often than

[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:47.820]
Chance levels controls ruled out the possibility that the animals smelled the food by doing so that dogs defied the

[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.240]
Expectations of a lot of scientists

[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:55.460]
Wolves have bigger brains than dogs so it was thought the wolves would do better here said and chimpanzees are primates closer to humans

[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.480]
So it was thought that they would do better, but they didn't

[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.960]
Even the theory that the adult dogs would outperform the puppies because they had spent more time with humans was quashed

[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.580]
When puppies as young as nine weeks old successfully picked up on subtle cues from human researchers

[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.620]
Dogs have a talent for reading social cues in a very sophisticated way here said

[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:18.480]
These results are not so surprising the zoology professor and dog behavior expert Patricia McConnell

[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.100]
The domestic dogs follow humans like a laser and watch the behavior of their humans with a focus that is astounding

[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:29.260]
Said McConnell a professor at University of Wisconsin and Madison this opens up big and interesting questions about our

[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.180]
Social intelligence is passed on genetically

[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:37.100]
But McConnell said what not what's not yet understood is which of the cues that humans give are the ones dogs pick out as relevant

[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:42.360]
Perhaps you've taught your dog to sit and you want to show this off to your friends McConnell say you say sit, but he just looks at you

[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.040]
What do you think Brian Murray says to his dog when he wants it to sit

[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.280]
The dog she said might have learned to sit not by words

[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.640]
But by how your head was turned to what your body language was when he was learning if those things are different in the room

[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.060]
People the commands sit may not do the trick

[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.300]
These visual clues can be critical said McConnell often's work with their works with aggressive dogs and difference of a quarter of an

[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.960]
Ancient human's head movement can be the difference between a calm dog and one that attacks

[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.920]
How do you like that?

[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:18.180]
Scary but with one common ancestor why the vast differences in size shape and skills between shepherds and shitsuz bullmastiffs and border collis that asks

[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.760]
And I didn't make that up. It says shitsuz right here

[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:26.640]
That's all the work of humans not genetics it says people started creating designer dogs about 500 years ago

[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.380]
Sad self-uniting in the geneticist at the r.i.t

[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:34.340]
That's the world instituted technology not the Rochester Institute technology right across the lake

[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.720]
Upper classes started breeding better hunting and hurting dogs and cuter lap dogs

[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.140]
The American kettle club now recognizes 150 breeds and they're all keeping a watchful eye over there

[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.640]
They're humans that says here and they kind of like a nice little piece on dogs during the holidays

[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.400]
Then we love our dog and too bad we didn't raise a whole lot of money for dogs this year

[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.280]
For abandoned peresky, but Miguel was just you know

[00:53:55.220 --> 00:54:02.240]
Right, I think you're right. It's Georgia's fault lazy spick spilt defaults. No, I know it's Georgia's fault because he's not there today

[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:02.840]
True

[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.500]
No seriously he's lazy. He don't want to be bothered with it

[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:13.940]
What he's the first one to say he's lazy right? So I'm not talking behind his back out on the same thing when he comes back next week

[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.800]
He's a lazy spick who's gotten like you know

[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.540]
He always knows that I'll be there like to go to bad form when somebody the unmancible one try to get his ass

[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.100]
Can I'm always there to go to baton screaming holler when he needs a new contract

[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:30.480]
I'll get my lawyer to go in this screaming holler and try to get a hold of Greg and get him like another couple of cents an hour stuff like that

[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.080]
Nothing worse than spoiling the people around your Carlos

[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.340]
So as a result of that just to use you as an example

[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.480]
This paycheck you got the other day in the 25th on Monday, right? That was the last one for a while

[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.360]
Thank you

[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.060]
It's okay. We're in a little bit of respect

[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:56.820]

[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.360]
They want to wish me a soul that is

[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.680]
That's why they have to call me over this

[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.120]
They stay in the jobs making sure that there's no other miles

[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.540]
In my car

[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.660]
They want to wish me a soul that is

[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.920]
That's why they have to call me over this

[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.340]
They stay in the jobs making sure that there's no open miles

[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.320]
In my car

[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.160]
Police roll their black

[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.560]
Police roll their black

[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.780]

Police roll their black

[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.520]
I is now their donor set this mail in my breath

[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.340]
They want to wish me a soul that is

[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.640]
That's why they have to call me over this

[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.300]
They don't allow me out on day

[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.100]
This is my Sunday param

[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.080]

[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.000]
Police love me out

[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.480]
Police love me out

[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.620]
They police love me out

[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:37.100]

10, 19, 5, 60, WQM

[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.220]
Even though he's on vacation this week

[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:43.280]
George still needs to catch

[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.840]
And it's still hoping to get lucky

[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.040]
That's why Carlos will be there

[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.080]
And Miguel will be there two of night at Treasure Island

[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.160]
Low budget crappy embarrassing prizes

[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.660]
And enjoy drinks specials too

[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.340]
Treasure Island just north of the 120 seconds

[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.280]
We exit off the Palmeiro

[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.300]
No special hot babe there tonight

[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.140]

[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.920]
They're all hot babes

[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.360]
How about the fat boy

[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.460]
Can't get much hotter than that

[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.240]
237 votes on the pool

[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.520]

Ricken says 111 47% of this crowd

[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.660]
Shocking

[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.940]
Like I said it just changed again

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.500]

46.5% of this crowd

[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.040]

Guys that don't even they don't even work together anymore

They got 16 votes

[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.100]
What does that tell you

[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.700]
Classical music 16

[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.420]
I'm happy with Mo 11

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.300]
And Bob and Tom already have got

[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.640]

[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.940]
Don't forget why me that football game 1230

[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.940]
Pre-game show it now

[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.320]
Okay on CBS

[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.320]
You've got foul memories

[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.780]
There must be

[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.920]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.720]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.300]
You just slap it on red

[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:25.820]
Ted

[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.140]
How about Thanksgiving's

[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:28.460]
All the

[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.600]
Now you've got foul memories

[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.840]
There must be

[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.380]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.100]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.500]
You just slap it on red

[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:41.960]
Ted

[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.780]
How about a souffle

[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.520]
Ray

[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.800]
Check your part by a guy

[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.720]
Don't flip to me

[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.860]
Put it on stick

[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.380]
Dick

[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.360]
And get it up quickly

[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.580]
Don't care what you do

[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:55.940]
Stu

[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.080]
Don't give it to me

[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.900]
Somehow inside the fridge

[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.100]
You took your multiple plans

[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.840]
I've beaten so much that it's coming out

[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.780]
My eyes

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.020]
When some thighs and legs and breasts

[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.280]
That just won't die

[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.640]
I must be

[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.920]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.700]
50 ways to meet leftovers

[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:22.920]
You're

[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.580]
You're cooking ice to me, Lou

[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.040]
Make it a shake and shake

[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.480]
Turkey can't carnivore me

[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.260]
Don't give it to me

[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.020]
It's nothing but swillabill

[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.900]
It's making my section

[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.220]
I'm way over bed

[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:38.700]
Fred

[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.520]
Don't give it to me

[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.860]
You just slap it on red

[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.340]
Ted

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.180]
How about a souffle

[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:45.860]
Ray

[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.160]
The problem is on inside

[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.360]
Out that she said to me

[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.760]
But the answer is easy

[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.900]
If you practice or relieve

[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.260]
You must enhance your full play

[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.760]
Connolly would leave

[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.600]
It must be

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.280]
50 ways to meet your lover

[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.500]
50 ways to meet your lover

[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.420]
Lie a flat on a bed

[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:17.960]
Jack

[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.400]
Go down to the clam cell

[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.240]
Use a vibrating toy

[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:22.660]
Roll

[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.620]
Just listen to me

[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.160]
Roll

[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.520]
Hit the alphabet

[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:27.800]
Shit

[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.280]
Don't get your mouth out of the suit

[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:29.720]
Where

[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.660]
You got more capital T

[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.240]
Too much for me

[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.540]
I said I treat that act with the unmost disdain

[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.800]
To go south with the mouth

[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.700]
I'm sorry

[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.940]
I'm a frame

[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.420]
For the few insist

[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.820]
Then would you please explain about them

[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:53.180]
50 ways to meet your lover

[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.180]
50 ways to meet your lover

[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.240]
All right

[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.400]
Just kiss on a trim

[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.240]
Jim

[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.540]
Fuck her up on a bee steam

[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.560]
Eat me so that my guy

[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.540]
Now listen to me

[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.400]
Down on a muffin dough

[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.840]
Just give it enough touch

[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.560]
More capital T

[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.560]
Too much for me

[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.080]
It can strike any of us

[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:22.260]
Chop

[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.320]
Chop

[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:23.660]
Chop

[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.480]
The tragedy of sexual stuttering

[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.960]
It frustrates you

[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.580]
And it infuriates the guy in the apartment next door

[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.120]
Would you say it's same already

[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.640]
You're making me sick over here

[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.840]
Your sexual stuttering afflicts you

[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.200]
Take heart

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.400]
Chop

[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:43.940]
Chop

[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.100]
I said it

[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:45.760]
Chop

[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.320]
Sure

[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.900]
My name is Bob

[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.400]
To get on the road to recovery

[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.860]
Call the sexual stuttering hotline

[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.500]
At 1-800-0000

[01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.320]
Yes

[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.280]
Oh

[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.000]
Oh

[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:16.780]
Please

[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.540]
Don't put out this turn

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:24.640]
Oh

[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.640]
You've turned

[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.320]
It's a piece of crap to me

[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.720]
Can hardly ever

[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.180]
Words

[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.000]
Whatever happened to you

[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040]
The rights you love me do

[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.480]
We made my protection one

[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.280]
Reach my love

[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.660]
You're John Wooden like this much

[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.060]
We use him as a grudge

[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.280]
And now he feels so cheap

[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.580]
So

[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.020]
He

[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.320]
His songs that tear

[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.360]
I'm not the champion

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.600]
Will be the reason

[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:32.300]
Which should not be your end

[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.440]
And living all the burden

[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.660]
Turned out like a piece of crap

[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.240]
So

[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.180]
Who do you think you're going to be next

[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.540]
Is going to be Paul McCartney or Ringo

[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.000]
What do you think

[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.320]
Hopefully Ringo

[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.340]
I think that was Carlos who said that

[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.620]
And he don't like the drummers

[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.080]
Okay look what happened to Dennis Wilson

[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:11.520]
He's dead

[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.440]
Let's talk about famous drummers

[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.380]
Who are dead to show him

[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:15.920]
Instead of playing the silly comedy bits

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.960]
Let's play comedy bits

[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.180]
So what a clock is what we're going to do

[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]
Because it's Thanksgiving day

[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.120]
Don't forget about that football game

[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.740]
I'm serious I sat here thinking that

It was Thanksgiving day

[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.800]
Not when I started but as we got into this

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.280]
You know about like 30 seconds into what

[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.560]
And I'm thinking about the football game

[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.000]

In fact, I'm sure have one to help your mind

[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.180]

The feces of a species collection is going fast

[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.180]
There was no farmer who lived on a rock

[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.320]
He sat in the middle just shaking

[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.980]
His fists at some boys who were down by the prick

[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.120]
They're feeding the water

[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.140]
Their hands on their marbles

[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.920]
And play things and at half past four

[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.900]
There came a young lady

[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.860]
She looked like a pretty young creature

[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.640]
She sat on the grass

[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.520]
She pulled up her dress

[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.660]
And she showed them her ruffles and laces

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.380]
And white fluffy duck

[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:51.700]
She said she was learning a new way

[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.480]
To bring up her children

[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.300]
So they would not spin

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.500]
While the boys in the barnyard

[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.260]
Were shoveling repucing litter

[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.020]
From yesterday's hunt

[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:05.580]
While the girl in the middle was rubbing her

[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.180]
Eyes at the fellow

[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.820]
Down by the dot

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.800]
He looked like a man with a size of a home

[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.780]
In the country with a big fence out front

[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.620]
If he asked her for a light

[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.680]
Lays she'd show him her little pet dog

[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.560]
Who was subject to fist

[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.920]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender

[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.320]
Hands with a movement so quick

[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.480]
And then she'd bend over

[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.400]
And suck down his candy

[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.100]
So tasty made of butter Scot

[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:40.200]
And then he spread whipped cream all over her cookies

[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.920]
That she had left out on her shelf

[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.040]
If you think this is dirty

[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.820]
You can go f**k yourself

[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.680]
As I was watching my TV one day

[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:20.840]
A man came out of the tube and told me

[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.540]
Nature and the search were firing shots

[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:32.020]
Again and I said

[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.040]
Does anybody really know where Bosnia is

[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.060]
Can anybody tell me where

[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.680]
But God keeps changing all the time

[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.820]
I can't keep up so I don't try

[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:56.020]
I thought that world was off so late these days

[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:02.580]
The Russians packed it in MCN

[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.380]
And this is all no watch all night at night

[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.580]
So I say

[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.620]
Does anybody really know where Bosnia is

[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:19.860]
No

[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.440]
Can anybody tell me where

[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:22.840]
No

[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.780]
You know I'm most apologize

[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:27.760]
No

[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.220]
But I'm not trying to be wise guys

[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.820]
Can anybody tell me where

[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.260]
I don't know

[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.240]
Bosnia is

[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.400]
But I don't know

[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.180]
I don't know

[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:48.380]
No

[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.060]
No

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.060]

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.060]

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.860]
No

[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:01.780]
No

[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.220]
No

[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.080]
Don't lie

[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.440]
All the hard burn

[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.180]
Don't go

[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.280]

They want to watch us

[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.740]
I'm tracking the campus over

[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.960]
And it's just the asses

[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.980]
A little movement like that

[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.500]
And it's been all hyperventilating

[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.760]
The only French

[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.500]
Canyon jet out of the way to

[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.360]
Friends is sitting at the end of the runway

[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:09.700]
In the Lyon

[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.360]
And the plane

[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.660]
Right to the police station in

[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.140]
Lyon

[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.220]
Jet was headed from

[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.160]
Bologna to a party and a stop in

[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.640]
Lyon and landed everybody safe

[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.680]
And everything they got the gun

[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.100]
Custody

[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.900]
And it's not a terrorist hijacking

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.780]
It don't look like it's a

[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.840]
Little crazy person, how unusual it is

[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.620]
But of course it's breaking news

[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.340]
Because CNN is going to hyperventilate

[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.360]
And so does everybody else

[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.520]
Every news there is breaking news.

[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.000]
Right

[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.200]
Happy Thanksgiving to the city of North

Go wash that hat by the way

[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.820]

[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:11.200]
Who do you think is washed their hat most recently

[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.440]

[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.020]
That car loaf here

[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.220]
Oh it's about to say it

[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.560]

[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.940]
I never even looked at you that close to notice that

[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.620]
Even we're ahead

[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.940]
Anybody that looks like you

[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.060]

I think about Chicago and Illinois whatever the hell I was

[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.740]
That was a great line

[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.140]
Then you got all emotional about this

[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.800]

Hey hang this up baby

[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.800]
Here's my story said but true

[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.560]
About a girl called Sifle and Sue

[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.700]
Had a bug and ran it around

[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.460]
Gave it to every guy in town

[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:44.460]
Hey hey

[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.660]
Oh oh oh

[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.160]
Hey

[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:53.580]
Oh oh oh

[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:53.580]

[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.420]
Not like that

[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.120]
Hey hey

[01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:01.080]
Oh oh oh oh

[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:01.240]
Hey

[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.360]
I shouldn't order from the spot on her head

[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.400]
I end up with an urinary grip

[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.740]
I'm part of all always be with you

[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.480]
So stay away from the simplest suit

[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.180]
It took me far so I should have seen her tie

[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.200]
She's an almost end to her friend of mine

[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.240]
He got infected now I've got it too

[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.080]
So keep away from the simplest suit

[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.760]
Hey hey

[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.960]
Keep away from that girl

[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.340]
Hope that I'm still in for a tune now

[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.260]
Keep away from the suit

[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.940]
She likes to sleep around

[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.100]
Yeah, it's dinner with my best friend now

[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.160]
We didn't finish our trip come

[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.480]
Now I'm afraid of falling off here tomorrow

[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.740]
I'm a story from a guy who knows

[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.720]
He used to have a hose where this fungus grows

[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.700]
And skinny food that she ever knew

[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.600]
A keeper away from the simplest suit

[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.400]
Keep away from that girl

[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.760]
Okay so anyway this was it

[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.760]
It looks like really a serious hijacking

[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.860]
This guy's like a little little and he didn't have a gun

[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.440]
See talk about the networks jumping to gun

[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.180]
He had a remote control

[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.020]
Is what they're saying now

[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.200]
You know like a TV remote control

[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.000]
Dangerous maybe he wanted to change channels

[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.240]
And they got pissed off or panic

[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.180]
I don't know what that was

[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.300]
But talk about everybody a little bit on edge

[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.280]
Okay especially during the holidays

[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.320]
Is what's going on?

[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.200]
Speaking of on edge

[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.460]
Henry Kissinger is back again

[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.820]
Maybe we can have peace in our hand

[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.120]
You want to have a peace in your hand

[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.380]
President Bush today named former secretary

[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.540]
State Henry Kissinger had a new independent investigation

[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.200]
Of intelligence failures before the 9-11 terrorist attacks

[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.780]
The announcement came as the president

[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.160]
Inside the Bill authorizing the commission

[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.700]
Which the White House resisted until just two months ago

[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.580]
Dr. Kissinger will be in broad experience

[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.960]
Clear thinking and careful judgment of this important thing

[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.040]
Mr. Bush said of the signing ceremony

[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.000]
And a Roosevelt room of the White House

[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.560]
Mr. Secretary thank you for returning to the service of your nation

[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.340]
He be saying

[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.100]
The commission dubbed the national commission on terrorist attack

[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:14.720]
Upon the US has a broad mandate building on the limited joint inquiry conducted by the House and Senate Intelligence committees

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.760]
The independent panel will have 18 months to examine the issues such as aviation security

[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.180]
Diplomacy, terrorist financing, and border problems along with intelligence

[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.120]
You're that Miguel border problems

[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.000]
Like all those people washing up on our shore lately

[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.700]
The right thing to do is get to the bottom of all the circumstances that led to the 9-11 attacks

[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.340]
And to see how we can strengthen and improve the West ability to protect our country

[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.780]
White House Minister of Information Ariflaxer said

[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.420]
How do you like that? So Henry Kissinger, he just freaking won't go away

[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.560]
Here's Andrew Dice Clay

[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.280]
For Dice Aroni

[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.720]
Alright, let's say you're eaten

[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.500]
You sick and f***ing tired of f***ing potatoes

[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.840]
And that stove top s***

[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.880]
Do like me honey eat this

[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.160]
Dice Aroni, come on it's almost as simple as you

[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.340]
Put the f***ing bag in the f***ing pot and you turn on the f***ing stove

[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.440]
You think you can manage that honey

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.100]
Hey, what a f***ing thing's done

[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.960]
So remember, Yankee Doodle came to town

[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.740]
Right none of Pony, stuck up further off is a f***ing thing called it Dice Aroni

[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.600]
Dice Aroni, the tap me tastes like street

[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.060]
Ow

[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:35.280]
Did you ever think when you're in Chinese?

[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.540]
It ain't pork or chicken but a fat simeese

[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.280]
Get the food taste grade so you don't complain

[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.680]
But that's not chicken and your chicken chow mein

[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.820]
Seems to me I ought to sweeten sour pork

[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.280]
But Garfield's on my fork

[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.520]
He's f***ing here on my fork

[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.820]
There's a cat in the kettle at the begin move

[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.020]
A place that I eat every day at noon

[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.020]
You think it feeds a cat and you'll never know

[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.520]
Once they're out there, they'll up in no void

[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:11.800]
They fried real Christendot

[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:19.120]
A chowlin' asked if I wanted more

[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.620]
As he was dialing up his buddy at the old

[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.300]
That star said not today I lost my appetite

[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.580]
That's two cats in my belly and they want to fight

[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.660]
I was sucking on her wallet and the thumbs are two

[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.260]
When I swear I heard it new

[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.960]
And that is when I knew

[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.940]
There's a cat in the kettle at the begin move

[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.020]
Think I got to stop feeding there at noon

[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.960]
They say that it's beef or fish or pork

[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.720]
But it's per and there on my fork

[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.940]
There's a hairball on my fork

[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:06.980]
They're funky, they're old, they're the California proof

[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.620]
So then you get thing old and clay

[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:14.400]
And your time's to pay your everyday

[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.800]
Give us a relief and that's what you're

[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.840]
And so for you we got the cure

[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.300]
Just eat some of us, eat us every day

[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.400]
And then flush your clothes away

[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.600]
Don't you want that they're ankle and they're tasty

[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.600]
Better use the whistle, tasty

[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.600]
The X-Lax is nice but it don't wake fast

[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.600]
Just eat some food, let me up last

[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.500]
I'm a party, yes

[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:54.500]
I'm a party if you eat us all the smarty pants

[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.540]
I'm a party, I'm a party, yes

[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.600]
California proof

[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.500]
What a way to go

[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:03.940]
This is Debbie

[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.680]
Hello Debbie, I'm interested in getting some operations done

[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.320]
Okay

[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.680]
And some body contouring and some liposuction

[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.460]
And I was wondering if you had some tummy talk

[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.700]
And lip augmentation cosmetic breast surgery

[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.700]
Face tip for all of these things

[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.320]
And I was wondering

[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.920]
Well I need to get everything done

[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.680]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing

[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.980]
Okay we don't do that

[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.500]
No could you do breast implants though?

[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.440]
Uh, I can't be done

[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.900]
It would be the lotion in the basket

[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.060]
How much?

[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.560]
Uh, 5,000

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.440]
Excellent, I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too

[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.500]
Laser surgery

[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.320]
Uh-huh

[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.820]
Have the lamb stop crying yet?

[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.780]
Mommy, excuse me

[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.640]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby

[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.160]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.960]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV

[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.820]
Okay

[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.080]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:04.600]
Well we'll have to see you first

[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.040]
And if I'm looking at you we can tell you that when we see you

[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.680]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts?

[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.120]
Mommy

[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.860]
Uh, if you'd like to

Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:17.640]
Yes

Okay, um, there is a $100 consultation fee

[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.200]
That's fine

[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.300]
Okay

[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:26.780]
Okay, um

[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.980]
My name is Buffalo Bill

[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.000]
Okay, let me give you a little information from you

[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:31.880]
Okay, just one moment

[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.460]

I understand

[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.920]

[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.800]

[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:31.800]

[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:31.800]

[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.140]
That's a few six and five sixty-one eighty-two-and

[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:40.940]
Yeah, exactly. So, how are we making a little progress now or what?

[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:42.360]
What?

[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:50.700]
Well, no earlier, it seemed that you were like non-plus by the stuff I was playing. Now I think we're like starting to come along a little bit.

[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:53.480]
Okay

[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:55.540]
Okay

[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:55.540]

[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.180]
Join George for Happy Hour tonight at Treasure Island

[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:09.000]
From five to seven. Miguel's going to be there. Maybe he'll be in a better mood at that time. Okay? Maybe he'll get lucky. Maybe he'll get drunk.

[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.320]
And what was that farting noise that Carlos made on the earlier?

[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:19.100]
I took something at a program. It for some reason the board went crazy when I did that. Nice. Don't do it again. Stop

[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:23.040]
I had to win prizes and enjoyed drinks, specials. In fact, I bet you George is going to be telling about it any moment now.

[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.200]
My life and locals. This is 430560.

[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:28.840]
Way to go.

[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.180]
Kill Nicole

[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:39.540]
He's walking. Yes indeed. He's walking. Most importantly, I'm betting.

[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:48.220]
Four days full and free. And I killed it. That's the reason for doing it. With those campaign scenes he's skating.

[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:56.300]
Four days will soon be free. Watch him every day on a TV trial. The other day I saw him crack a smile.

[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:01.320]
Waiting for the motion for the big mistriple. When human John the Cartoon do it a big high five. He's walking.

[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:08.820]
Tank scene. I'm talking. Both J.B. Green and Hewie. Right back. Don't A.B. Scenes.

[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:22.220]
Welcome back, babies. It's Monday night football. We're trying to outbound for this old friend. Just straight into the body.

[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.260]
We're trying to have your mind. We're trying to have some of those jobs. We're not following so we're going to say.

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.540]
I don't want that. I don't want that. I don't want that. How's that new Renekar 3?

[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.720]
It's nice. This time I got the red and giri. Let's go get to the stage.

[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:35.580]
He's walking.

[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.580]
Garing G's spent millions. For those legal fees. So we owe him a big apology.

[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:50.420]
He's walking. Yes indeed. I'm hoping that he'll never be. I'm talking. His ex-wife number three.

[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.580]
Hello, that's my mother. Hello, that's my mother.

[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.180]
He's a musician. He's a musician. What is it now? Oh, it's nothing. I'm going to be your wife's daughter.

[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.520]
If you love those great songs from those great mafia movies, you'll slip over real mob hits.

[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:24.740]
Not only does real mob hits give you more of that great mob music, but you also get awesome sounds of real mob hits.

[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:31.520]
Like Luca the Icepick Fyama getting hit is at the 106th Street barbershop. Forget about it.

[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:38.180]
Or who can forget solid fish getting the old piano wire across the trope.

[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:50.380]
If I remember correctly, it was a B flat. So what a real mob hits now if you know what's good for you just by dialing 1-800-Bata-Bing.

[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.220]
Real mob hits. Hey, it's real. Forget about it.

[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:02.520]
Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Rambo Ford 5.

[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.760]
Oh, you.

[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:19.560]
John Rambo still alive. I want to make movies for him 5. My life ain't going great plan. Hollywood's broke. Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke.

[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:30.480]
First blood came in 82. That's when I heard my penis and it never ever grew. Rambo 2 wasn't 85 late. Rambo 3 was in 88.

[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:40.900]
She was. And to it. Like I did not make this movie with my son. He never sang. She was in Rocky 5 and they liked the total movie.

[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:56.980]
A little big cash is what I mean. I gotta get a roll from the power cream. I gotta have another movie. Or Broadway show like Geno Gees. I guess nobody ever swung hot plan. It was stupid. I guess I understand.

[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:09.060]
My whole life is about to come in. All I got left is Jennifer Flayvin. Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rambo 4 and 5.

[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:25.260]
Take it out. So call me up. I really need a script. I can do dialogue or keep it zip. They like comedy, action, adventure and drama. The only thing I will undo is have sex with a llama.

[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:32.760]
So give me a break for good news. I used to be an upper and I can't get a Ricky Lake right now. I got a one man showing.

[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:51.600]
I got a little bit of cash is what I need. I gotta get a roll from the power cream. I gotta have another movie. Or Broadway show like Melanie. I guess nobody ever saw a cop land. It was stupid. So I understand.

[01:36:52.620 --> 01:37:04.460]
My whole life is about to come in. All I got left is Jennifer Flayvin. That's why ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rambo 4 and 5.

[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:12.980]
But I'm higher. Absolutely. Don't get in that Mercedes. Princess Diwere begging please.

[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:23.600]
This paparazzi is coming after you. You're gonna crash if you will. No more rich guys for you. Princess Diwere is gone.

[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.900]
Oh Princess Diwere. Princess Diwere is gone. She's really gone.

[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:32.520]
We need to get her. Hello.

[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.120]
They say I love his tap.

[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:50.660]
That what we're doing is wrong. But I don't care what they say.

[01:37:51.540 --> 01:38:01.600]
Because my love is so strong. They tell us we should be ashamed. We're not husband and wife.

[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:10.080]
But I cherish each moment with you. This is how I'm so glad you're in my life.

[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:32.280]
You're my prison bitch. My prison bitch. You're not like of a man. I'm glad we share a prison cell. When lights go out at 10.

[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:43.560]
I can't take away a bill. Now that would be a prize. As long as I am doing you. I don't mind doing time.

[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:57.060]
Because you're my prison bitch. My prison bitch. And I have no regrets. I got you for a candy bar and a pack of cigarettes.

[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:06.940]
At first you were resistant. But now you are my friend. I knew that I would give you in the end.

[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.520]
Welcome.

[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:48.460]
You're my prison bitch. My prison bitch. I'll never say goodbye. You're not like of the others. Too bad they had to die.

[01:40:48.460 --> 01:41:01.660]
On the second thought I'd live outstack if you want me to. Your prison bitch is never leaving you.

[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:17.020]
I don't know. Now I know what they call you. Hard criminal.

[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:20.700]
I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka.

[01:41:50.700 --> 01:42:20.680]
I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka. I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka.

[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:50.660]
I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka. I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka.

[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:20.580]
I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka. I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka. I know you're about to find out when you call this the polka.

[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:30.740]

[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.980]
William, welcome to Jack in the box.

[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.780]
I'm Jack, can I be happy to fill your order if you know what I mean?

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.320]
I'd like a Jack burger and a large fries.

[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.160]
Sorry, pal, we're cleaning the grease fryer.

[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.420]
We don't have any French fries today.

[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.320]
Okay, uh, they're just gonna be a small order of fries, please.

[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.940]
Look, Chief, maybe you didn't hear me.

[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.840]
I said we don't have any f***ing fries today, so how about something else?

[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.220]
Okay, then, uh, just give me an order of fries.

[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.100]
Listen up, pal.

[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.280]
Who put the straw and straw, Barry?

[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.240]
That you did.

[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.740]
That's right, nature did.

[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.660]
Who put the ape and ape ricotta?

[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:39.960]
That you did.

[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:41.340]
That's right, nature did.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.660]
Now listen carefully.

[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:45.380]
Who put the freak in French fries?

[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.380]
There ain't no freak in French fries.

[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.700]
That's what I've been trying to tell you, but breath.

[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.820]
There ain't no freak in French fries.

[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:58.160]
Don't get out of my sight before I shove your teeth so far down your f***ing throat.

[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.840]
You'll have to sit on the Jack Burger to eat it.

[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.620]
No, I'm gonna have a nice day.

[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:21.780]
Let me take you down to the station where strawberry fields

[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:27.560]
while making dry keels.

[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:31.320]
And nothing seems to dry mouth.

[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:35.880]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:41.800]
Living is easy for sports, proud.

[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:46.540]
Who put the families in the seats?

[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:53.080]
I'm super stock and get messed up, but he can still cash out.

[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:57.100]
If he can hit 293.

[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:04.540]
And he won't come down, because he loves his tool.

[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:12.400]
When strawberry fields, he's making dry keels.

[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.900]
As long as he can hit about, strawberry stash last forever.

[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.560]
Now when he's swinging at strike three,

[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.540]
I'll bet he must be high on blow.

[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:39.060]
And all the little kids will think that it's alright

[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:43.160]
to get real high and grab a bat.

[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:52.880]
Let me take you down to the station where strawberry fields

[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:57.940]
while making dry keels.

[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:01.440]
They're never gonna take him out.

[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:05.300]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.800]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:13.500]
He'll probably relapse forever.

[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.240]
Hello, girl, how are you?

[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.660]
I'm doing good.

[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:40.820]
I'm doing good.

[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:43.940]
I'm doing good.

[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:44.260]

[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:44.940]
I'm doing good.

[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.260]
I'm doing good.

[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.680]
I'm doing good.

[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.240]
I'm doing good.

[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:03.280]
I'm doing good.

[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:09.340]
Ladies and gentlemen,

[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.460]
please welcome the two newest New York Yankees

[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.120]
Darrell Strawberry.

[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.640]
I'm the Doctor Gooden.

[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.400]
And the personal coach, Steve Howell.

[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.520]
Howell.

[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.900]
That's what I'd like to know.

[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.040]
That goodens in the wind up.

[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:34.180]
The strawman snorts the line up.

[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.860]
He's drooling like a dog who heard a bell.

[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.140]
He's high as a lab rat from smoking the cracket of bat.

[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.140]
He doesn't like cocaine just likes the way it smells.

[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.460]
Snort and A ball.

[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:52.640]
Darrell's rolling up a 20 snort and A ball.

[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.820]
And he's giving good and planning.

[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.760]
They lick the 20 dollar bill.

[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.740]
Their teeth are grinding like a peppermil.

[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.360]
Going A ball.

[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:08.380]
Out the hole and pills.

[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.700]
Steve Howell is in the bullpen.

[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.740]
His nostrils are wide open.

[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.040]
He's so fucked up.

[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.000]
He thinks he's on the braves.

[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.720]
He gets advice from Doc.

[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.980]
And Doc prescribed some rock.

[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:27.120]
So first he blew a line into any bluda.

[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:27.820]
Safe.

[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.060]
Snort and A ball.

[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.300]
They abused the magic powder snort and A ball.

[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.700]
Sprinkle it on that clam chowder.

[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.260]
Prescription, scuffle, pet you will refill.

[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.740]
They do it in the pool if they had gills.

[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.920]
Going A ball.

[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.100]
Out the hole and pills.

[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:52.680]
For that money.

[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.260]
A ball.

[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.340]
Out the hole and pills.

[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.460]
I like to welcome you all aboard.

[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:01.720]
This is your manager.

[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:04.540]
Hi, blocker.

[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.760]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:30.760]

[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.220]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:33.220]

[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:34.820]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:41.600]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.780]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:45.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:49.140]
I'm not a bad guy.

[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.740]
Sworse and disco.

[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.640]
Sworse and Aiki breaking fever, too.

[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.900]
This is Ella and me.

[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:08.060]
If I got a hit, a stupid little song will get on die.

[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.440]
But it's all next to me out of nowhere.

[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.760]
Looks like it's shell-frozen, nothing.

[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:16.500]
This song's sure of people.

[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.180]
And I'm sure it's catchy.

[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:19.520]
It's gotta be making money.

[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.780]
But it's for Christmas and me.

[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.660]
And I wonder if I hear it every day.

[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:27.460]
The rest of my whole life.

[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.500]
When a snappy DJ and rose this song.

[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:36.280]
I'm dangerous because to a radio squad.

[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.900]
But I turned it off quick with a score bar.

[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:43.260]
All I wanna do is dash this song.

[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:47.840]
I gotta feel it and I'm not the only one.

[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:51.220]
But I wanna do is load my gun.

[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.440]
Get me an SCD.

[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.640]
I'll put some home one.

[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:57.400]
It's load on the news.

[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.300]
It's over done.

[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.280]
It gives me a headache.

[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:03.640]
And I'm not the only one.

[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.340]
All I wanna do is dash this tune.

[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:10.540]
And when this song comes on,

[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.240]
It's a stereo right out of my car.

[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:18.520]
And if my home is one,

[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.040]
With my hair right out and kicked me real hard.

[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:29.840]
I wanna feel it and I'm not the only one.

[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.820]
I wanna feel it and I'm not the only one.

[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.380]
Cause I can't get back to sleep.

[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.680]
Yeah, it's been a long time.

[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:40.300]
Channet Chances really we.

[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.060]
But I gotta do something.

[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.700]
Sort of not at all in law.

[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.420]
Now you're asking me why.

[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.280]
And it's making you cry for.

[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.500]
So you know you know I said it and why.

[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.400]
And you down every reason you say I'm a boy.

[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:00.780]
I try to go to when you try in the high.

[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.480]
So I can give you a feeling for it and for.

[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.020]
I wanna fiddle in the night.

[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.500]
I won't let you go to sleep.

[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:10.700]
If you make me a beat,

[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:13.640]
I won't make another beat.

[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.100]
I want some rabbit and growth.

[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.660]
Cause I'm out of control.

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.620]
You're and we are new.

[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.400]
We don't have the same goal.

[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.680]
I turn a whole lot of back into night.

I'm not.

[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.180]
It's all the bloody blood.

[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:46.820]
Simpson and Kato back from a burger in fries and a restaurant near.

[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:51.560]
A noise in the rear of James Nathbyn.

[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.500]
Dropping his socks near the bed but there's so many things.

[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.460]
Clatching some hair from the surface.

[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.160]
What's the blood come from?

[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:11.460]
All the so much blood come from the blood.

[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:18.480]
New King Rich does the hanky paint.

[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.880]
New King Rich has a spanky wanky.

[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:26.200]
New King Rich does the hanky paint.

[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.180]
New King Rich does the hanky paint.

[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:33.760]
We thought he always found his blood.

[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:41.540]
He's built Clinton about it all the time.

[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:45.180]
They call it womanizing low life slime.

[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:49.020]
But newbies chase and billies all around the nest.

[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:52.760]
That's why the shirts are talking his hair as a mess.

[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:59.480]
All right, here we go on the deck.

[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.620]
Let's go.

[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:05.300]
Oh, Mr. Speaker.

[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:10.940]
Mr. Speaker, the committee would like to know, are those hot your shoes sticking out from

[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:11.460]
money to death?

[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:13.640]

[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:15.620]
Oh, okay.

[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:16.060]
They're not.

[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.760]
Oh, the committee sees no impropriety.

[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.980]
They'll be no further destiny.

[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.240]
I saw him working on his pick up life.

[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.820]
You come here often, baby.

[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.100]
Watch your side.

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:35.240]
I'm pretty, I'm Republican and all alone.

[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:36.980]
Ain't funny, baby.

[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.740]
Can I give you the phone?

[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:43.200]
Who would have thought I'd never would have thought that?

[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:44.540]
Come here, baby.

[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.380]
You mean the Jewish and big rubber band?

[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:50.960]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.720]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:58.520]
Blue King has his hanky wanky?

[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:01.540]
Blue King, which does the hanky?

[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.100]
We bar, we always thank his mother's name.

[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:13.740]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.000]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:00.980]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:02.260]

[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.320]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.700]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:20.900]
Blue King, which does the hanky panky?

[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.760]
Short and balanced and safely,

[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:34.420]
The girl with empty steam keeps smoking

[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:38.700]
And when she passes, she flips her ass and goes

[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:45.420]
When she smokes, she's like the chimney

[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:49.120]
That shoots up clouds on smear, so nasty

[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.280]
That when she passes, she passes gas and goes

[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:01.720]
Oh, but she wants to quit badly

[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:10.600]
Caught, finger-picked, chunky, longers

[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:16.260]
Yes, she would give them a gladly

[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:21.420]
But each day when she has to go pee

[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:25.480]
She sits on the can and lives free

[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.400]
Short and balanced and safely,

[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.040]
The girl with empty steam muggles smoking

[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:38.920]
And when she passes, she smiles with big yellow teeth

[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:01.920]
Oh, but she will miss her smoky

[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.660]
Oh, gas she tells where she's going

[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:14.960]
Yeah, she would give them a gladly

[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.300]
But each day when she has to go pee

[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:24.140]
She sits on the can and lives free

[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.280]
Short and balanced and safely,

[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.920]
The girl with empty steam muggles smoking

[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.720]
And then she flashes that smile with big yellow teeth

[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.680]
And dunk on the need

[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:48.020]
She just cannot breathe, it's only a week

[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.540]
Can I have a life please?

[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.200]
No

[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.400]
11.32 till noon at 5.60 WQA

[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.200]

And then tomorrow after Hagen and Curtis

[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.020]
And how come my Dave Hagen's got his last name on here?

[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.520]
Is there a special reason for that?

[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:36.840]
He's moving up in the world?

[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.600]
No, seriously, how come it just says Hagen?

[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.860]
It's got Curtis and Vlad and Hagen like I don't get it.

[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:44.500]
Maybe it's Tom Hagen.

[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.140]
Anyway, they're going to be on 6 to 9 tomorrow morning

[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.200]

[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:08.780]

But as they get older they all give it out

[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.000]
We're hiding our latency

[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:28.060]

[02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:59.420]
How much for a kiss?

[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:02.600]
How much for a kiss?

[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:04.080]
Could I get it for a nickel?

[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.320]
Could I get it for a quarter?

[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:07.620]
It costs more money than I'll miss?

[02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:10.460]
How much for a hug?

[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:14.700]
Could I get it for a nickel?

[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.000]
Could I get it for a quarter?

[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:18.240]
It costs more money than I've got?

[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.260]
How much for a quick feel?

[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:23.460]
How much for a quick feel?

[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.440]
Could I get it for a nickel?

[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:26.760]
Could I get it for a quarter?

[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.260]
And would I get a good deal?

[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:31.720]
Can I touch your eye me?

[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.300]
Can I touch your eye me?

[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:34.640]
Okay!

[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.180]
Could I touch it for a nickel?

[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.500]
Could I touch it for a quarter?

[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.860]
You wouldn't have to remind me!

[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:40.380]
No.

[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:41.740]

Ha ha ha.

[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:53.220]
Time could take us far.

[02:12:54.220 --> 02:13:01.740]
If you'll please get in my car and I'll say, do you?

[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:06.540]
How much for a job?

[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:09.260]
How much for a job?

[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:10.940]
Could I get it for a nickel?

[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.220]
Could I get it for a quarter?

[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:14.420]
Can I have for a job?

A home job.

[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:22.820]
Return to Santa.

Return to Santa.

[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:30.960]
I got a sweater from my grand one.

[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.780]
It was pink and black.

[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:38.260]
I don't worry be a heartbeat.

[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:41.360]
What's been said on the back?

[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:43.260]
He wrote a heart attack.

[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.260]
Return to Santa.

[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:49.140]
I just sent me cash.

[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:52.760]
Your tanky sweater.

[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:56.580]
Okay, me or Ash?

[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:01.360]
I got a fruit cake and some plant plants.

[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:04.220]
Her clip is for my nose.

[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.400]
A null bottle of old spice.

[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.620]
Borted iron holes.

[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:12.880]
He wrote a thunder.

[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.120]
Return to Santa.

[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:18.800]
Who needs this junk?

[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.740]
Or this year's Christmas?

[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:26.420]
A realy stung.

[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:27.820]
He wrote a thunder.

[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:30.120]
Return to Santa.

[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:33.940]
Don't need to be rude.

[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.720]
But this Christmas,

[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:41.720]
I got scroozed.

[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:45.140]
Return to Santa.

[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:48.860]
Return to Santa.

[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.440]
Return to Santa.

[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:59.480]
Oh, yeah, I'm old and grumpy.

[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:07.020]
But try to understand that I have a problem.

[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:10.960]
Because I can use my hand.

[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:14.540]
I only have one hand.

[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.140]
I only have one hand.

[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.140]
I'd like to take my pen and stick it inside.

[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.600]
Despite my comfort, rip it something.

[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:32.500]
I can't hide.

[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.160]
I can't hide.

[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:36.380]
I can't hide.

[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.840]
So please vote for me.

[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:43.460]
A cranky bitter old man.

[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:47.860]
And if you will make one of me,

[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.300]
I'll slap you like a man.

[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.620]
But only with my good hand.

[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:58.480]
I only have one hand.

[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:01.760]
I only have one hand.

[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:03.660]
Doc, get off this instant.

[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:09.040]
She looks like a lady.

[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:12.920]
Walk like a lady.

[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:16.540]
Talk like a lady.

[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.020]
But I got wise.

[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:23.140]
There's a difference between the thighs.

[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:27.300]
Oh, yes, there is a difference between the thighs.

[02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:33.400]
Oh, you showered me with kisses.

[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:36.960]
I thought you were my queen.

[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:40.920]
But I noticed something funny.

[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:44.260]
I saw the bulls in your jeans.

[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.760]
She looked like a lady.

[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:50.560]
Walk like a lady.

[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:54.260]
Talk like a lady.

[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.360]
But I got wise.

[02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:00.860]
There's a difference between the thighs.

[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.880]
Oh, yes, there is a difference between the thighs.

[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:11.180]
You were my perfect lover.

[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.740]
But how I was surprised.

[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:18.840]
Not only do you have one,

[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:21.620]
but you're not circumcised.

[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:24.520]
Oh, she looked like a lady.

[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.260]
Walk like a lady.

[02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:32.040]
Talk like a lady.

[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.040]
But I got wise.

[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:38.680]
There's a difference between the thighs.

[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:42.620]
Oh, yes, there is a difference between the thighs.

[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.000]
But critics agree.

[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:51.940]
This collection of holiday songs may very well be the most moving and memorable of all time.

[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.500]
I'm the wing of a white Christmas.

[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.360]
Just like the words I used to know.

[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:06.420]
Yes, Candlewax music presents,

[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.020]

had a very shiny nose,

[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.640]
and if you ever saw it,

[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.000]
you would even say it was.

[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:41.460]
Ilmer funds, Christmas classics,

[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:42.840]

Santa Claus is coming to town.

[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:03.240]
It's 1156 at 560 W.A.

[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:04.040]
I'm happy Thanksgiving.

[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:05.620]
It's a big yearly extravaganza.

[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:05.900]

[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.700]
What would you like to hear on QA in between 6 and 9 in the morning?

[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.060]
Ricken says 180.

[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:18.000]
I wouldn't listen no matter what.

[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:18.460]
71.

[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:21.060]
The first team got 71 for Joe Gellie and D.

[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:23.640]
And then it's way down.

[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:25.260]

[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:34.580]

[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.400]
Yes, 21 for Paul Castorinovo.

[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:39.680]

[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:40.900]
No.

[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:44.360]
Thanksgiving is tomorrow

[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.940]
if you're traveling or the family is coming to you.

[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:49.540]
The last thing you want is to go to the airport and have to start looking for a place to park.

[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:51.200]
And when you finally find one,

[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:53.600]
it's usually about 20 miles to where you have to go.

[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.000]
Nationalimos can change all of that for you.

[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:58.020]
They'll arrive at your location on time

[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.260]

[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.080]

And for your sports fans out there,

[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:29.640]
there's no better way to get to and from the game than in one of Nationalimos Superstretch limousines or luxury coaches,

[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.880]
when everybody else is going nuts fighting the traffic.

[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.100]
So don't forget, if you're looking for way to get to the airport,

[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:35.780]
the game will just night around town.

[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:38.140]

1-877-376-3200 for Nationalimos.

[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:55.020]
I can go.

[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:57.360]
This is sports waiting on bicycle.

[02:20:58.240 --> 02:20:58.880]
QAM.

[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:05.720]
Where are it beaded 12-1 hour on WQAM?

[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:08.860]
Hello.

[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:12.260]
Hello, I was calling about the wab at your half assail in a paper.

[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:13.720]
OK.

[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:15.460]
What kind of wab at your are they?

[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.740]
OK, I have some lost.

[02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:18.840]
Yeah.

[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:20.540]
And I have some lost.

[02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:22.360]
Some spotted lost.

[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:23.740]
And some solid colored lost.

[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:25.140]
Oh, wonderful.

[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:28.240]
And I have a straight ear show.

[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:29.780]
And I have two dwarfs.

[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:30.940]
What a dwarf.

[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:32.480]
Here's small reddy.

[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:33.340]
Oh, OK.

[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:34.880]
We have a farm.

[02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:38.040]
And we like to play with the wab at your farm.

[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:43.300]
You wouldn't have any like little wab at handcuffs.

[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:45.360]
Any what?

[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:48.220]
Little handcuffs for the wab at.

[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:49.500]
Oh, handcuffs.

[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:49.960]
Yes.

[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:52.220]
Oh, so I never heard of it.

[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:52.460]
But what?

[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.700]
Well, we use them when we hunt them on the farm.

[02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:58.420]
We like to hunt the wab at.

[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.740]
And we take them and nail them to a tree by their ears and skin them alive.

[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.080]
There was.

[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:10.140]
Hello.

[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:14.860]
And now I think that's what you go to a taste rabbit, sir.

[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.080]
I couldn't say you're rabbit.

[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:20.240]
We have a little game we play called all wabits must die.

[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:23.360]
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir.

[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:25.740]
I wouldn't say you're rabbit.

[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.360]
A fuzz, fifty dollars.

[02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.820]
I like to hunt the wab at.

[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:30.680]
Well, it's OK.

[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.020]
You go out in the wild and you hunt rabbits.

[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:34.220]
The phase aren't to kill.

[02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:37.040]
I like to put them in a little pin and then hunt them down unmasively.

[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:39.380]
No, sir, I'm sorry.

[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:40.840]
And say you're rabbit.

[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:44.560]
Sometimes we even spare them to the head with a rusty water.

[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.380]
Thank you for going to Santa Claus' eyeline.

[02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:00.060]
To hear what Santa does to the elves during the offseason,

[02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:03.560]
press one to try to miss his class, press two to...

[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:05.560]
Oh, Santa!

[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.820]
Squeeze my toys.

[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:09.540]
Oh, yes.

[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.560]
I love your long, hard, sleigh.

[02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:17.860]
I want to fondle your balls of holly.

[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:20.860]
Eat my fruitcake.

[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:22.100]
Oh, yes.

[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.040]
Yes.

[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:25.680]
Let me ride your reindeer.

[02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:28.780]
Ride him, Christmas cowboy.

[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:34.160]
This Santa Claus is coming to town.

[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:34.740]
Oh, yeah.

[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:35.540]
Ah!

[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:35.820]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.360]

[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:39.900]

[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:48.240]
Well, I bought some new potato chips because they ain't got any fat.

[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:52.140]
But an hour after I ate them in the John I sat,

[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:56.340]
I knew they had some side of fix, but I thought I'd take a chance.

[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:00.060]
But right after I swallowed them, I felt my colon dance.

[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:04.120]
I ate all this junk, my bowels began to seize.

[02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:08.100]
I'm in the canus, squatting with my pants around my knees.

[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:11.860]
I ate all this junk, now I'm afraid it's knees.

[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:15.800]
Because of my feels, I've been disgusting running down my knees.

[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:19.720]
Well, I should've seen that morning that they put on the bag.

[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:23.580]
And I should've been suspicious when the clerk gave me a rag.

[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.420]
So if you eat them, don't be surprised if your belly hurts.

[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:31.420]
And in about an hour you'll have the Eulestra Scourts.

[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:35.280]
I ate all this junk, my bowels began to seize.

[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:39.280]
I'm in the canus, squatting with my pants around my knees.

[02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:43.160]
I ate all this junk, now I'm afraid it's knees.

[02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:47.180]
Because of my feels, I've been disgusting running down my knees.

[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:52.640]
This holiday season, it's the classic story of how one mean old person

[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:55.460]
who hated this time of year had a change of heart.

[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.560]
The JCC proudly presents.

[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:03.100]
How the Shmuckstoll Hanukkah, every Jew down in Jewville,

[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:06.760]
liked Hanukkah a bunch, except the guy who lived just off.

[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:09.080]
Who they all called the Shmuck.

[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:12.320]
The Shmuck needed Hanukkah since the day he was born.

[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.140]
If you ask him why, he'd just say, get off my lawn!

[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:19.060]
No one knew why, he was full of this mush.

[02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:22.980]
But if you ask me, it was because he had a bolt of his douche.

[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.060]
Yes, the classic story of Dr. Shoes comes to life.

[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:29.400]
See how he hatches his sinister plan.

[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:31.860]
Then with a grin, the Shmuck yield out.

[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:35.240]
Here it comes, I'll go down to Jewville and steal Hella Weeka.

[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:36.700]
Hey, it rhymes.

[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:40.380]
So he took all the presents, it days with the boxes,

[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:43.920]
and he took all their canals, and he took all their loxies.

[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:48.040]
Weakness the magic, as the Shmuck sees the true meaning of Hanukkah.

[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:51.120]
But the Jews were crying, though the Jews still was gone.

[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:54.780]
He thought they'd be sad, but the Shmuck he was wrong.

[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.180]
Then the Shmuck smiled brightly as he looked at them.

[02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:01.100]
Maybe Hanukkah means more than just candles and fling.

[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:04.400]
So the Shmuck came down to Jewville, with presents in hand,

[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:07.740]
and every Jew came to greet him, every Jew in the land.

[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.340]
I brought back your gifts, I hope you're not sorrow.

[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:13.020]
I brought back your dreitos, your ties and menores.

[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.460]
The Jews pondered about what they wanted to do,

[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:18.100]
and then the Mayor Jew said, I'd guide them soon.

[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:19.820]
They said they'd sue for so much.

[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:21.580]
The list was real high.

[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:23.900]
We all say, you Shmuck, we all need you to die.

[02:26:24.260 --> 02:26:25.740]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:28.620]
But then they all laughed, showing they were good sports.

[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:29.980]
See, we were just joking.

[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:34.100]
Swoaked a judge, Mr. Shlops, then the Shmuck sang with the Jews

[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:39.300]
and danced until late, and at the end of the night, he lit candle eight.

[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:42.860]
So don't miss, how the Shmuck stall, Hanukkah.

[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:44.860]

[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:53.820]
The Shmuck stall, Hanukkah.

[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:55.380]
The Shmuck stall, Hanukkah.

[02:26:55.380 --> 02:27:00.360]
Her breath smells like bile, she got crust in her eye.

[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:04.820]
She smells like a urinal, that attracts lots of flies.

[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:10.840]
When she sits on the porch, she picks the scab underneath.

[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:18.460]
Her teeth are brown, when she smiles, she's a trailer trash woman for me.

[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:25.800]
She has lies up above, she's got crabs down beneath.

[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.200]
I called a trailer and woke the family.

[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:35.620]
Her father's her brother, her uncle's her grapese,

[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:42.600]
but I don't care, she's the trailer trash woman for me.

[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:55.280]
Oh, she never bathes herself, she looks like a smile.

[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:59.920]
Her nose is running so slow.

[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:15.300]
Oh, her hairy gun hangs out, she has twelfth teeth, she has sweaty behind.

[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:17.720]
Brackdom.

[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:23.360]
She wipes her mouth on a shirt when she's beaten.

[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:27.640]
She stings at the time of the month that she's bleeding.

[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:32.620]
She has a hairier chest than lube from taxi.

[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:39.960]
I can't put this love on the shelf, she's the trailer trash woman for me.

[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:43.700]
All right, girl, you know what I mean?

[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:44.680]
It's from the bottom of my heart.

[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:46.340]
No one is as special as you to me.

[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.220]
That's why you are mine.

[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.000]
Trailer trash woman in me.

[02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:54.040]
Brings it to your eye, donut.

[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.520]

What would you like to hear, 6.9 A.M. on W.A.M.?

[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:07.140]
Ricken suds 182 over 40%.

[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:08.200]
How do you like that?

[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.720]
Oh, I wouldn't listen no matter what, 75.

[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:12.760]
They're a busy, they're doing something else.

[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:15.680]
The first team, Joe Gellie in D.F.O. 73,

[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.980]
and after that it's like small potatoes.

[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:19.220]
It's erased for last place.

[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:21.480]
Classical music 29.

[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.660]
Ron and Ron 24, we don't even exist.

[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.400]
I'm happy with mode 24, Bob and Tom 23, and Paul Kat.

[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:30.360]
Oh, I see a gag, try to say it.

[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:31.440]
Paul Katz to it.

[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:31.560]
No.

[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:33.000]
Bo, he's in last place.

[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:34.900]
Your second win, Paul 22.

[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.980]
Tight battle for Lansdow.

[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:39.860]
Don't forget tonight's a big night at Treasure Island,

[02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:42.720]
George's office week, he's on vacation, but it's never a rally,

[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.460]
no matter what.

[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:47.240]
pneumonia, vacation, nothing keeps him away from Treasure Island.

[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:48.860]
Carlos will be there, praying it.

[02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:51.360]
Pull my hat down over your head, Carlos, that couldn't hurt.

[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.080]
And Miguel will be there, who I'm sure will be in a better place.

[02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:55.620]
He's still there.

[02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:56.400]
I don't have any.

[02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:57.120]
Okay.

[02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:01.300]
Well, I see you're probably is upset because he's got such a tough assignment today.

[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.280]
Now, if you guys were smart, you would have had food brung in.

[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:06.380]
Do you get food in there?

[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:06.860]
Huh?

[02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:07.540]
Brung in.

[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.140]
Maybe had it brung in.

[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:10.440]
Drug in.

[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:12.180]
You'd have had drugs in food brung in.

[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:14.540]
Anyway, five to seven at Treasure Island night,

[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:16.240]
they'll all be there, all the horny and desparado's,

[02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:19.680]
and Miguel too, because he wants the free booze, and wants to get paid too.

[02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:23.000]

So it's time to blow those B ones up on their eyes.

If your toothpaste doesn't taste great, your kids don't brush long enough.

[02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:06.920]

[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.100]

Garded by a snake.

[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:08.420]
Red goose.

[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:10.860]
Grandpa, I don't want to play this game anymore.

[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:11.520]
Okay.

[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:14.040]

[03:03:07.220 --> 03:03:10.900]
What's it crack for me, chairing, canna, men, and barrison, sand?

[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:17.240]
Give one everyone over, eat, the sand is coming from all the rain.

[03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:21.460]
There's answers to a number of Jimin, Grandpa Charlie.

[03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:24.380]
Mom and dad, little sister, Grandma Molly.

[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:28.680]
Stratlite on your own, feet, with a family crowd.

[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:31.720]
Oh, yeah, thanks, Thanksgiving Day.

[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:38.680]
T-A-S Thanksgiving Day.

[03:03:43.380 --> 03:03:45.340]
Well, if you know, I'd actually just about go to kill it.

[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:46.160]
Now, what are you saying, Miguel?

[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:47.200]
It's with painless, wasn't it?

[03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:48.200]
Pretty much.

[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:50.300]
What call does that mean?

[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:50.920]
Pretty much.

[03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:56.700]
You are a real join the Georgia and the guys tonight at Treasure Island in 7 and 5 to 7.

[03:03:56.700 --> 03:03:58.180]
Carl also be there, he'll be in a great mood.

[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:00.500]
See if Miguel is in a better mood by tonight, okay?

[03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:02.440]
Why not?

[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:04.600]
I don't know.

[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:07.360]
Somebody must have, he's still upset about that poor human kid.

[03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:12.320]
As a matter of fact, he's going to take in the whole family in his house just because he's so devoted.

[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:16.860]
Anyway, we got the mad dog coming up next and then we got the humpword 3.

[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:19.840]
Now listen, tomorrow we've got to give instructions to the audience, right?

[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:22.320]
Because the beast is going to be on him, from 9 to 1.

[03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:27.000]
And it's going to be, if there's one word I'm trying to think about, it's going to be tomorrow?

[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:28.340]
Uh-huh.

[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:29.280]
Roodle.

[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:31.560]
I mean, it's going to be great.

[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:34.060]
It's going to be sensational, right?

[03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:34.580]
Right.

[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:41.000]
And he'll have all those stories to tell about how he got canned off the morning show and about losing the weight and how Troy would be great.

[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:41.020]
That would be great.

[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:44.300]
Yeah, he could make it interesting if he grows a pair.

[03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:47.260]
So, through the end of our morning and see if the beast grows a pair by 9.

[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:47.980]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:49.100]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:53.860]
Then the alleged show on Climb's TV is on the QAM, Miami for Notre Dame.

[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.160]
I don't have a penis.
