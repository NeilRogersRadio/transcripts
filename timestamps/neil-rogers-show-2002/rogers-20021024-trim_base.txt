[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.740]
There one of them was kind of anyway.

[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.960]
What are you talking about?

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.140]
You start nothing with that stuff.

[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.760]
Now the two guys that brought the stuff in my mailbox in that little car, if they want

[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.080]
to deliver, I'll call them all the time.

[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.120]
They want to bring it inside, deliver what?

[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.640]
Meet on a bun.

[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.900]
Anyway we got a lot of votes on here.

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.680]
I'd like to take a bunch of calls today.

[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.180]
Okay, because I'm just, I don't know, I'm worn out from too many damn periodical audio.

[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.260]
What is he calling audio?

[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.320]
I can't remember that.

[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.800]
Although I do have a lot of stuff.

[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.780]
Case at chickenpox puts town on alert for smallpox.

[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.000]
Not that we're panicking, you understand in this country.

[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.900]
But, Cain's a city.

[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.620]
Did you hear the story?

[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.900]
No.

[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.660]
Will you well now?

[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.560]
Of course, when I ask you, did you hear it?

[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.260]
That doesn't really mean that much because you're out of touch.

[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.500]
That's right.

[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.260]
I mean, between all the drug deals and getting a little action on the side from Miguel.

[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.780]
Kansas City, Missouri, officials at St. John Hospital in Levyworth, Kansas quarantined

[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.860]
their emergency room for more than five hours Monday.

[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.560]
Hey, guess what?

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.420]
It's Thursday already.

[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.280]
Okay, this is from the Kansas City star.

[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.380]
After meeting a patient with chickenpox symptoms, so severe, they resembled smallpox.

[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.220]
Although a test later confirmed that his disease was chickenpox, suspicions that they

[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.100]
potentially fatal smallpox were enough to put down put the town of Levyworth on alert.

[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.300]
Levyworth's about 40 miles northwest of Kansas City, Missouri.

[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.420]
I can only imagine what kind of a place that must be.

[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.820]
Kansas City, you ever been there?

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.140]
No.

[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.880]
Have driven through it.

[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.660]
And maybe it's a fine place.

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.280]
I don't see why my judgmental like that.

[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.120]
Don't make judgments on things you know nothing about.

[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.400]
Kansas City might be a wonderful town, but I don't think so.

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.560]
Under the quarantine, no one was allowed to the emergency room and no one was allowed

[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.900]
out from noon to 5.30 pm.

[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.500]
Ambulances were diverted to Cushing Memorial Hospital, also in Levyworth.

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.600]
I wonder if it's named after the famous Michigan Harness driver, Ron Cushing.

[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.640]
St. John employees who possibly would come in contact with the patient Don Gloves, Protective

[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.140]
Breeding Mask, and Glasses or Face Shields.

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.600]
Speaking of harness, sir, drivers, I want to make this announcement okay?

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.660]
With all due respect to my good close personal friends, Kevin Wallace and Wally Hennessey, Bruce

[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.340]
Ranger is the best driver at Pompo Park.

[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.500]
He just is.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.820]
Okay?

[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.820]
All right.

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.540]
I don't think he's that crazy about me, but I don't care.

[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.640]
I don't take it personal, Bruce.

[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.920]
I'm Wally Hennessey.

[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.760]
I just said, with due apologies to my friend Wally, hey Wally, how's it going, eh?

[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.980]
And the great Kevin Wallace, Bruce Ranger is just, he is phenomenal.

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.720]
A portion of the Levyworth justice center was briefly closed after a police office, a

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.000]
report coming in contact with an emergency medical worker who transported the patient.

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.800]
Levyworth Health officials said they didn't think they overreacted.

[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.240]
You never know nowadays, said Alan Humphrey's a minister in the Levyworth County Health

[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.940]
Department 9-11, Ottawa, taught us that.

[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.600]
And he's right.

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.080]
Don't take nothing for granted.

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.740]
The patient and then made that the you, the worst, Lucy man, you know, they keep promising

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.520]
he's going to be on it.

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.920]
I guess now he's going to make like a grand appearance, you know, now that they got these

[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.600]
two scumbags.

[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.180]
Now he's going to come out like with a band and with like a whole, you know, marching band

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.160]
and they're going to have a palm.

[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.260]
Hey, you go, boy.

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.820]
Nice going, Lucy man.

[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.160]
We done it together.

[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.120]
Anyway, this whole thing goes on about Kansas City to this and Levyworth today.

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.800]
Isn't that where the federal penitentiary is in Levyworth and seems to be?

[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.340]
That's what I heard.

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.300]
Good place for it.

[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.940]
Just like that state prison in Jackson, Michigan, Jackson state prison right near the racetrack.

[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.820]
Not too far from it.

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.740]
And believe me, a lot of those drivers ought to be in it.

[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.160]
Poll numbers are just pouring in here.

[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.580]
If we can get numbers under ratings as good as we do on some of these polls, we'd have

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.280]
a 45-year, 331 votes already.

[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.540]
It's not even a love at a clock, George.

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.380]
They've got a keen interest in you.

[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.000]
They're monitoring you.

[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.060]
Why were George's ratings so weak this summer?

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.900]
His shows are boring 71.

[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.540]
I love George 88.

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.820]
20 and a half percent.

[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.240]
Oh!

[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.320]
And the number moving up.

[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.900]
His show blows 45.

[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.860]
Moe is a brutal lead in.

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.680]
I'll change it again.

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040]
Just what I got to moe.

[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.700]
It's our change in again.

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.400]
45 say Moe is a brutal lead in.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.540]
That's the same number as his show blows.

[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.280]
So there's many people who think your show blows blame Moe for the blow.

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.040]
Too much Ash talk 26.

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.200]
He's an anti-semitical little spict 24.

[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.380]
It was Miguel's fault.

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.560]
He's on the way up to 15.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.180]
Oh!

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.960]
Nice going, Miguel.

[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.800]
He can't compete with Howard Spurm 13.

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.440]
He can't compete with Howard or Rush 10.

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.420]
He mumbles 10.

[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.740]
He can't compete with Rush only four.

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560]
I don't really know what this is on MTV.

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.760]
Meaning what?

[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.660]
Barney Kid people?

[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.000]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.100]
Hey, we got to watch Leon Harris here.

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.480]
He might say Kirby a pucker here.

[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.740]
Well, they're naked.

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.520]
Yeah, I'm running for it.

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.120]
Well, the only contact didn't be a phone.

[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.160]
What channel is that?

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.780]
57.

[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.700]
57 has got a bunch of hot naked people.

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.700]
Like, guys running around.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.520]
He's not doing well.

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.480]
He's not doing well.

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.120]
I wouldn't touch him when you were a hand.

[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.140]
They had a whole swath.

[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.580]
I wouldn't lick him with your tongue.

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.440]
I don't see anybody interesting.

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.560]
Well, you missed it.

[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.480]
They had a parade of fun.

[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]
Well, I don't want to miss it.

[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.160]
I want to see the good people on there naked and erect and firm

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.100]
and running around like having a good time.

[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.280]
Yeah, I'm squeezing a little bit.

[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.060]
What was going on?

[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.860]
Do you see what was in that bull's in his pants?

[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.600]
He was ugly though.

[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.580]
I don't want to see any ugly guys with bulls in their pants.

[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.100]
Anyway, nice, false alarm, George.

[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.320]
Don't worry about your men MTV.

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.720]
There's nothing but scabby people.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.540]
There you go.

[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.520]
There's a real hot look here.

[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.000]
Hey, Moe can tell you where you can get a good piecepele.

[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.920]
Maybe hello and you want to his.

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.620]
I'm so sorry I turned this on.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.460]
Great expectations.

[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.900]
Now, the obvious question is,

[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.860]
do I check out the double chocolate chunk brownie?

[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.180]
There's all of this food here.

[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.620]
You know what?

[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.900]
I know I'm going to get rid of it.

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.100]
No, you're not.

[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.220]
What did I eat?

[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.420]
What do you mean you're going to get rid of it?

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.160]
Make it up to the kitchen.

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.640]
Are you the goddamn food police?

[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.920]
Yes.

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.060]
You'll take anything to the kitchen.

[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.340]
You'll take into the kitchen when we're done with it.

[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.960]
Are we done with it?

[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.220]
No.

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.320]
I haven't even had a chance to get up out of the chair yet.

[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.740]
By the way, that's not a great thing.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.080]
You're very nice to people from Quiz No.

[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.980]
They were excellent, right?

[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.760]
They loved us.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.300]
They loved us.

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.280]
They were just friendly.

[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.940]
Took my hand to food too many times.

[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.700]
But, huh?

[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.400]
Taken pictures.

[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.440]
I autographed a couple of pictures.

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.460]
They're putting us on a, uh,

[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.680]
they're putting you on a hall of fame and me on the hall of flame.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.500]
No, I thought that they were like big fans,

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.720]
but then the one guy in the background,

[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.060]
then you hear what he said?

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.440]
The one I was standing on.

[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.300]
The McCornie looked at me and said,

[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.540]
BAAAMING!

[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.540]
Something like that.

[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.540]
WQAM.

[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.420]
That was the one line I was reading.

[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.080]
And I thought I'd give them a great chance at the line.

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.580]
That was the raspberry line too, that made it.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.160]
But it's not him.

[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.160]
Did we miss the raspberry?

[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.220]
There you go.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.340]
Just in case we missed out.

[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.800]
5, 6, 7,

[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.660]
I'm waiting for your analysis on the Sniper guy's being arrested.

[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.560]

No, the Arabs would bind call fast train 1 866 fast train. How about Hamburg Buffalo raceway?

dot com and that was what's his name that was Matt drudge here the other day

[00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.430]
Go

[00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.470]
. He's

[00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.650]
I didn't do it, but I know

[00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.310]
oh

[00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.510]
Funny

[00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:50.990]
So the rabbi says that when I run you is getting scared, but everyone's disgusted and scared.

[00:18:51.930 --> 00:19:00.270]
Walks through hallway sideways, and he's covered with gorilla air.

[00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:06.230]
Mama says he's off air. He's stuck hanging and some young ladies leave in the room.

[00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.750]
We're not too sure what's going on there. Stay away from me.

[00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.690]
Josh is free for.

[00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.770]
I feel things seem funny, but he's no stand major. I'm funny and then he...

[00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.930]
Don't come near me!

[00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:29.210]
Josh is free for. He's no making speed with Steve and a high belly button and celibide the pound.

[00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.890]
That's it!

[00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.410]
Got so bad his guts exploded!

[00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.970]
Stay away from me.

[00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.790]
Do we wretch it while all over the room?

[00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.430]
There's staples of pants down his foot.

[00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.070]
Just to hold in all that greasy old food.

[00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.510]
Stay away from me.

[00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.350]
Josh is free for.

[00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.090]
I think I'm here at Chris Moore, though, like me. I think he does.

[00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.690]
Don't come near me.

[00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.670]
Josh is free for.

[00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.230]
Come here!

[00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.530]
Go into the scrotum, do you see it?

[00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.990]
Yeah, that was a thing with how much quality it has.

[00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.030]
How could he still be here? That's one of the great mysteries of all time.

[00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.090]
11, 16 at 5, 60 WQIN.

[00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.150]
That's the chocolate. I'm just going to taste the oatmeal.

[00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.550]
Don't you love oatmeal cookies?

[00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.210]
I do. I said I'm just going to taste it.

[00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.630]
So I can give Quiznose another nice plug.

[00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:30.970]
Hmm.

[00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.170]
Huh?

[00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.890]
No, it's not like that double chocolate.

[00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.930]
No, whatever.

[00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.850]
You know who doesn't like chocolate?

[00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.810]
Who's that?

[00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.130]
Carlos.

[00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.690]
Carlos? Maybe that's why he's got such a pasty complexion.

[00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.530]
I never ever met anybody that did that.

[00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.630]
Maybe that's why he can't get laid.

[00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.370]
I thought it was because he was ugly.

[00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.610]
Well, see now you're the kind of bastard that would say that.

[00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.190]
Then you're going to say because he's ugly and smells but you notice how I just reached in the waist

[00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.950]
basket and pulled the rest of the oatmeal raisin cookie?

[00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.530]
No, I don't want to throw it out.

[00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.930]
I know.

[00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.970]
When you know what it is, when you get the raisin, yeah.

[00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.570]
And then you start chewing on it and then the full taste of the cookie starts like exploding in your mouth like a word swear.

[00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.490]
Oh yeah, it all comes together in your mouth.

[00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.590]
Hello, George.

[00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.730]
Get out of here you perverted old fart.

[00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.050]
Here's a fact from somebody who's not too fond of you, which is what we like.

[00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.170]
We like to mix it up a little bit.

[00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.290]
We don't like all that ass sucking on a show.

[00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.850]
You know, ass eating, that's okay, but ass sucking.

[00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.530]
Please have captured the snipers by the way in case you missed it.

[00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.270]
Two Jamaican's, two will want to be Muslim Jamaican's.

[00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.090]
Says Neil, the biggest problem George has in carrying the torch you passed to him is none of the above.

[00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.890]
But rather the fact that he can't read.

[00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.710]
Well, then you talk about that that you can't read.

[00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:46.790]
I can't read aloud.

[00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.170]
I'm bad at it.

[00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:48.890]
Why is that?

[00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.770]
I just stand.

[00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.990]
Probably because you mumble and fumble and bumble.

[00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.590]
It says he brings no current events to the table because it's very great.

[00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.550]
When you stop and let me finish, please, and before you rip this poor bastard and ask with the phony name on here.

[00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:09.690]
He brings no current events to the table because his third grade abilities are best suited to ass eating and stupid smit like cartoon discussions.

[00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.970]
You really need to get somebody else to train to take your spot when you be gone.

[00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.010]
I can take an hour of his Bible class even an hour of his Israeli pali talk.

[00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.210]
But after that, well, the glass is not half empty.

[00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.910]
It's just empty.

[00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:21.930]
Says Cben Jones.

[00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.410]
Cben Run.

[00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.050]
PS Evelyn Woods will be calling PSS.

[00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.390]
Maybe it's all of above two.

[00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.250]
Well, there you go. One of your friends. One of your admirers who says you can't read.

[00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.310]
You bring nothing to the table but eating ass.

[00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.450]
And the cards to the table may be different.

[00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.650]
See if it's one time I'll bring ass to the table other than maybe my own.

[00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.390]
But I don't bring an ass to the table at lunchtime.

[00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.190]
Here's another fact that says,

[00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.870]
oh, should we take a caller too? They ought to be really good. WQAM.

[00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.630]
WQAM.

[00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.650]
Neil.

[00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.190]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.570]
You are God. How you doing?

[00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.930]
Okay.

[00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:58.830]
Good. Well, my comment on the sniper is no comment because when the media starts getting in a frenzy like that, I sort of bury my head.

[00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.710]
Good. Good thinking.

[00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.950]
And I've got the ostrich like stance.

[00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.350]
Exactly. Because it's just ridiculous. There's nothing to learn there.

[00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.630]
And the other thing I wanted to talk about was an article actually was an ad in the USA today.

[00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.150]
A couple of weeks ago, maybe a week ago.

[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.810]
And it's an organization called Not in Our Name. Are you familiar with that?

[00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.630]
Not in our name. Sounds vaguely familiar.

[00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:29.330]
Well, they're basically slanted towards opposed the new policies of the Bush regime ever since September 11th, you know, with taking people here.

[00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.750]
Yeah, I think I've seen it on the website. Yeah.

[00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.130]
And anyway, it's something in that ilk.

[00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.630]
I thought you might be interested in checking it out.

[00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:36.390]
Okay.

[00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:37.310]
Not in our name.

[00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.750]
I've been on it.

[00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.470]
Okay. Great.

[00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.670]
It's excellent. Thanks a lot.

[00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.050]
Take care.

[00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.610]
There was like a real call right there.

[00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.550]
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, 20 after 11, it's October 24th, 2002.

[00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:47.510]
Mark it down.

[00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.690]
There was a real call from a real person right there.

[00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.850]
Holy crap.

[00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.370]
See how we told you if you take like a thousand calls, you get to a couple of other.

[00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.230]
Okay. And we've had a couple of ladies that call that were okay.

[00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.630]
And then we had a one guy before that was looking me a little bit too hard.

[00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:02.770]
I got tongue burned.

[00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.570]
But this guy actually had something to say.

[00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.650]
Boy, that is shocking.

[00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.810]
This fax set, Polar Police believe that Slippers have been captured.

[00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.230]
How long can that be breaking news?

[00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.470]
You maniacs it's certainly not news network.

[00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.250]
You wonder why people are watching that right when fax is Fox News?

[00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.990]
Because at least they're entertaining in their own faxistic way.

[00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.090]
They don't want to watch you back.

[00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.650]
It's because you're certainly not news.

[00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.530]
You're just exploiting every human tragedy and misery and desperation.

[00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.570]
How much if I turn on Fox right now?

[00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.450]
They'll be talking about cartoons or something.

[00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.050]
What's Fox?

[00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.630]
Sixty three?

[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.630]
Sixty three? I don't think so.

[00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.210]
Oh no, it's Ricky Tickie Sanchez.

[00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.890]
He's a source in this office.

[00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.370]
Oh, and I asked him.

[00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.550]
I'll come, he's wearing a priest collar today.

[00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.470]
Back at me and said things look very good.

[00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:55.550]
He was also able to tell me that indeed the confirmation of that rifle

[00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.010]
that you were just talking about that Pete Williams hadn't reported is true,

[00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.470]
that the rifle had been found.

[00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.690]
And when I asked him specifically what they needed to be able to

[00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:11.810]
come out and tell this community that indeed they had the two people who they thought were responsible for these sniper attacks,

[00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.070]
he said they just need to make that forensics match.

[00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.870]
So with more on that, let's bring in Clint Vazant, somebody who knows an awful lot about this.

[00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:27.590]
Fill our viewers in Clint if you would on what officials are saying or what they mean when they say that and why it's so dog-god-important.

[00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:32.430]
I already have a homosexual relationship with Niel, so I might as well have one with you too.

[00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.390]
Thanks a lot Rick.

[00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.810]
Like I said at 8.63 that's MSNBC, although they need just to be watching, you know.

[00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.790]
The fact that you and I are both watching that like doubles their rating.

[00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.690]
Kind of like the other sports stations so-called, hey by the way Jim Sarni,

[00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.550]
have somebody read the book to you Jim, have a little Tommy Jikka sit on your lap and read you the book.

[00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.210]
It's sure that the Fox sports whatever they change the call letters to.

[00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.610]
And that's sad. They even changed the call letters.

[00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:55.170]
Yeah.

[00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:55.530]
Yeah.

[00:25:55.650 --> 00:26:00.250]
That only took that great frequency 940 with 50,000 watts smack in the middle of your AM dial.

[00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.750]
But they changed to WRFX Fox.

[00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.130]
It should have been R-S-X, sucks is what it should be.

[00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.610]
This is what we need is another sports station in this town.

[00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.310]
Hey, I hope the Cains go out there.

[00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.170]
I don't want my team to just go out there and like, you know, push you foot around.

[00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.130]
I want them to go out there really kick some ass.

[00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.610]
That caller to Joe yesterday, I wanted to vomit.

[00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.170]
I was cleaning up dog crap by the way at the time when I heard it.

[00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.170]
And I wanted to make my own pile right next to it.

[00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.870]
Fox, yeah, just look at that storm that's my Wednesday night at Moscow time.

[00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.950]
As we say, as an audience, we're covering that Russian watch popular music.

[00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:43.290]
A lot of people are just looking for a couple of Americans might be among those hostages being held.

[00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:48.030]
And again, the attention rebels demand they would like to see an end to the war with Russia.

[00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.990]
They have said they've indicated once again that they are willing to die for that.

[00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.090]
And that if Russia did not begin withdrawing its troops, they would blow up the theater.

[00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.590]
And in fact, a little bit earlier this morning, there have been some reports of explosions at that theater.

[00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.330]
We'll continue to keep you posted on this developing international story.

[00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:04.850]
Thank you.

[00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.370]
Like I said, or anything like Fox News Network.

[00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.110]
No, seriously, at least they got something different on there beside that same crap.

[00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.390]
Although they're back to it now.

[00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.550]
Well, they're back to it now.

[00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.030]
Yeah, but at least they got that on there.

[00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.670]
What have we seen this morning about around the end?

[00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.230]

[00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.470]
Just a whole thing on the crawler there.

[00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.730]
What?

[00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.370]
Nothing.

[00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:22.850]
Nothing.

[00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.370]
You can't eat with an oatmeal cookie in your mouth.

[00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.310]
That's why I'm swallowing it.

[00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.150]
Anyway, this fact, oh look at that, I'm mung-gun.

[00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.090]
The fact, mmm.

[00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:36.070]
It says now that the alleged authorities have possibly put into the VCs snap or murder episode,

[00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.970]
let's not lose sight of the fact that nationwide, 89 Americans die every day due to rifles, guns and handguns.

[00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.310]
That's 623.

[00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.550]
You see, I understand all of this.

[00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.490]
But whoever wrote me this, I hate to break the news to you.

[00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:51.010]
It's too late.

[00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.450]
Like Carol King said, way too late.

[00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:54.790]
Not only is the horse out of the barn.

[00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.730]
Now when you got 200 million guns,

[00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.470]
down the loose out there.

[00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:00.330]
Ah!

[00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.910]
Whatever self-respecting American has got a whole bunch of guns.

[00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.170]
What even the darkies have got guns, like in this case in the DC area?

[00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.570]
Then there's no hope.

[00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:16.730]
This country is crazy people with guns and crazy people politicians who love guns and embrace guns and embrace the people who love guns.

[00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.730]
And that's what it's all about.

[00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.070]
PS Forget the Larry Coker bottle heads, one of the new Rajas bottles had those going on.

[00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.990]
Now, Bokar Bryan was talking about that, too.

[00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.630]
They, but see, we got a lot of people around here talking a big game.

[00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.750]
You know, they talk a real good game.

[00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.550]
The only problem with that is that nobody around here wants to do the work to involve the doing of these things.

[00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.410]
Or spend the money?

[00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.490]
Or spend the money.

[00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.390]
Well, even when I put up the money, like for the RCD every year, which we're not doing one this year,

[00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.970]
you want to put up the front money to get it going.

[00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:46.730]
They still don't want to do it because we got a lot of people who want to kind of wander around here and lolly gag around, dick around.

[00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.330]
They don't want to do the work required.

[00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.750]
And so as a result, you know, I'm just kind of left to my own resources here.

[00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.970]
So if you're worried about any of Rajas' bottle held, held dial, forget about it.

[00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.030]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:02.290]
Ain't going to happen.

[00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.810]
We have no promotional...

[00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.030]
Well, yeah, I tell you what we need around here.

[00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.370]
Another train monkey.

[00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.170]
That's what we need.

[00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.690]
We just can't find one.

[00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.570]
WQAM.

[00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.430]
Hey, George, I want to talk to Neil.

[00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.530]
Hang on, so where you call from?

[00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:15.790]
Uh, Bokeh.

[00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.290]
Here's a call from Bokeh.

[00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.510]
Hello.

[00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.090]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:19.490]
Pretty good.

[00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.650]
Hey, I'm waiting for my Bokeh Brian CD's.

[00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:23.650]
I think they're going to be outrageous.

[00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.430]
They are outrageous.

[00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.790]
In fact, I think the Moe you're hearing, the Moe you're going to like them.

[00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.590]
Correct.

[00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.490]
I ordered five from Bokeh Brian.

[00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:31.890]
Great.

[00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:40.210]
Um, but just think, if Moe didn't fight you, we would never have all these bits.

[00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.010]
Right.

[00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.190]
If you were just a little bit along.

[00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.150]
No, but there's something you don't understand.

[00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.770]
We could be having a good time with it if he understood it.

[00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.830]
He could be enjoying it too.

[00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.950]
See, as opposed to being uptight and psychotic and having a nervous breakdown.

[00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.370]
We could be going...

[00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.890]
If I don't want to say if he would go with the flow, old Moe.

[00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.490]
Absolutely.

[00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.450]
Yeah, but he don't.

[00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.530]
Old Moe ain't going with the home-moe flow.

[00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.610]
He's what he's saying.

[00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:03.990]
Yeah, I love you Neil.

[00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.490]
Thanks.

[00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.070]
He's got a good point.

[00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.690]
And I said that we could be having a blast here instead of this hostility.

[00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.330]
Do you realize that from seven o'clock in the morning till it's your wincey won't come out of there?

[00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.150]
No, I did not realize.

[00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.270]
Because you know, I come in here in the morning and I drink all the time.

[00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.290]
I've taken all my vitamins and drank a whole bunch of water.

[00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.530]
And so I go and take a couple of leaks.

[00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.290]
As opposed to you that goes out, takes a couple of crafts in there.

[00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.410]
I've got to get it out of here.

[00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:26.570]
Wow.

[00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.890]
So I take care of that at home.

[00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.310]
I don't like taking a crap at work.

[00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.450]
I mean, not that I haven't done it.

[00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.370]
I don't want to go into old crap or work, man.

[00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.630]
I know the paper sealed it.

[00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.670]
Fat boy's been in there.

[00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.910]
I want to make sure that seat is her medically sealed, knowing that fat boy and Josh freedom been in it.

[00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.550]
I know for a fact that fat boy only uses the handicrapers.

[00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.610]
And then when I started finding some of Moe's toaches hanging around the tea room in there, then I said to myself,

[00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.210]
I'm not coming in here too often.

[00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.310]
But at any rate, he even didn't come out of there because he might actually...

[00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.950]
He might interact with me in the hallway.

[00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:54.710]
Bump into it.

[00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.970]
Yeah.

[00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.890]
Like that they nearly knocked you down.

[00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.430]
Yeah.

[00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.130]
See, that's not the kind of person you want to be working with.

[00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.070]
I thought I was going to get a forearm to the chest.

[00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.910]
And I do want to make it very clear that virtually, I don't want to say completely,

[00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.690]
but virtually everybody in this building detests him like point.

[00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:11.610]
They're on to you, okay?

[00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:12.870]
They're on to you.

[00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.850]
They're on to you.

[00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.910]
The people out at the stadium around you, the dolphin organization, they're all on to you.

[00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.590]
You're not fooling anybody with your arrogance and your imperious attitude

[00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.750]
and being a pompous ass, which won the poig yesterday by the way, pompous ass.

[00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.670]
That to me is the definitive line.

[00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.570]
That's it.

[00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:29.670]
Pompous ass.

[00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.530]
Forget about the content of the show, forget about the play-by-play work, forget about anything else.

[00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.690]
I'm talking about on a very, very gut level, a pompous ass.

[00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.230]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.910]
I'm like...

[00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.390]
He's stupid.

[00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.550]
28 past 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.170]
Hey, also forget about the hair piece.

[00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:48.550]
Woo!

[00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.990]
There's that thing smell bad.

[00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:51.910]
Do you want to go around looking like that?

[00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:52.490]
Be my guest.

[00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:58.690]
If you want to look great, younger and better than you have at a coon's age, pick up the phone and call my good close personal buddy, Charles Alfieri,

[00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:02.150]
who's been helping the famous and the infamous look their best for over 25 years.

[00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:10.010]
And even like I said, Bob Eisenberg is looking damn near human, thanks to the fact that Charlie took away that dead red muskrat and gave him like a great hit of here.

[00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.270]
He looks a hell of a lot better.

[00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.070]
And you can't, too.

[00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.230]
Take away that bald spot, get some hair.

[00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.330]
The natural hair line system looks like it's going out of your scalp, which is the key.

[00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:21.010]
And if you call Charles Alfieri, mention the Arrogers, he'll like 200 bucks off the regular price.

[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.350]
1-800-32124...what is it?

[00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.790]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.730]
Slow down, just relax.

[00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.770]
You got a long way to go.

[00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.050]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.370]
And don't forget Charlie also services and repairs.

[00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.310]
All kinds of hair systems, while you wait for only 25 to 30 bucks.

[00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.950]
If he sees like a dead muskrat on your head, you might actually kill it for you.

[00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:45.410]
1-800-321-2413 or log on to his infamous worldwide website at Charles Alfieri.com.

If you'll be what you do, be let tokens do.

[00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:50.030]
Yes, wonder why you be flippin' pancake, you may realize.

[00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.930]
That they're treating you just like you're as the wrong.

[00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:03.110]
That's when your head will move from side to side, from the lilo.

[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.030]
Yama!

[00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:09.110]
It's your push and rummage, they be crackin' assholes.

[00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:16.190]
Love a 35 and 560, don't forget to go to neararchers.com and pick up restitution and mo bits, volume 1, vocabrine.

[00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.530]
That's not on there by the way, kinda leave it, that'll be on the next one.

[00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.130]
Mark, it was too brand new.

[00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.930]
But it's well worth it at the 10 times the price, those are moving like hotcakes by the way.

[00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.750]
On our poll today on neararchers.com, while you're in there by and vocabrine and CDs, you can also cast your vote.

[00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:34.370]
Why were Georgia's ratings so weak, so dismal, so bitterly disappointing this summer.

[00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:44.310]
I love Georgia 87, 21.4% is in first place, unlike the meager 4.5% that Mo got when we asked the same question about his horrible ratings yesterday.

[00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.990]
4.5%?

[00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.110]
Well, he has other trained monkeys like me, so what do you know?

[00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.990]
Oh, I assume.

[00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.770]
Yeah, mine!

[00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.490]
His shows are boring, 84.

[00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.930]
Mo was a brutal lead in 57.

[00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.990]
His show blows 56.

[00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.310]
He's an anti-semitic little stick 30.

[00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.390]
Too much ass talk, 27.

[00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.070]
It was Miguel's fault, 21!

[00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.350]
Oh!

[00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:03.350]
Nice going Miguel.

[00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.770]
He can't compete with Howard Spur 18.

[00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.050]
He can't compete with Howard or Rush 11.

[00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:10.370]
He mumbles 11.

[00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:11.770]
He can't compete with Rush only 4.

[00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.130]
How do you like that?

[00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.830]
So you match up with Rush, although I guess your hearing's probably a little bit better.

[00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:18.050]
What?

[00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.790]
Speaking of that, oh, what a great lead in Condoleezza, Rice, and the president have lost their way.

[00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.690]
What a tremendous lead, a nice job, Neil.

[00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.150]
Thank you.

[00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:32.350]
By Alan Gilbert on theaccomandreams.org website, which is a real good one.

[00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.450]
25 years ago when I started to teach at the University of Denver, he writes,

[00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:44.090]
Condoleezza writes to five seminars with me, including Justin Unjust Wars, Joseph Corbell, Madeline Albright's father and I,

[00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.930]
also supervised her year-long independent project on music and politics in the Soviet Union.

[00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:52.410]
Rice was a thoughtful and bold student whom I thought it was a privilege to teach.

[00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:59.690]
As National Security Advisor today, Condoleezza writes has spoken forcefully for discarding outmoded Cold War doctrines.

[00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.970]
She defended President Bush's scrapping of the anti-ballistic missile treaty,

[00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:08.770]
on the grounds that Rush is no longer the enemy of the U.S., abandoning that treaty occasions no direct harm to either Russians or Americans.

[00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.230]
President Bush is new for a strike doctrine, similarly attempts to abandon an older approach,

[00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.430]
but here the National Security Advisor and the President have lost their way.

[00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.610]
The main crime of war is aggression.

[00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.190]
It's initiating a deliberate armed attack against another state, putting its people to the sword.

[00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.010]
Over more than 2,000 years, diverse cultures, ancient Greek, Christian, Jewish, Islamic,

[00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.910]
have rightly named aggression as the central crime of war.

[00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:36.250]
Article 51 of the UN Charter enshrined self-defense against aggression in international law.

[00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:43.010]
In the New York Times, September 22nd, Professor Bruce Ackerman noted that through assigning the founding documents of the UN,

[00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.990]
the United States is also a legally outlawed aggression as the highest law of the land.

[00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.790]
But to bar aggression mass murder by the state is no more controversial than the prohibit murder.

[00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:58.470]
Professor Ackerman spoke of Bush's errors, only one of legal unilateralism, a violation of two generations of international law,

[00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.330]
to which the U.S. is a signatory.

[00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:06.330]
More deeply, however, the central moral judgment made historically by every culture about the horrors of war underlies these treaties.

[00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:15.510]
Secretary of State Powell has defended a supposed American right to take out Sodom Hussein as part of a presidential repertoire of tools, a preemptive war.

[00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:21.910]
But the idea of a preemptive war is to head off the immediate threat of armed aggression, no showing of immediacy or for that matter significant new evidence,

[00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.850]
has been produced by the Bush administration or British Prime Minister Blair.

[00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:33.230]
If President Hussein threatened to nuclear attack on Tel Aviv next week, if he had provided Al Qaeda with nuclear or chemical weapons to be involved in a likely attack on LA this November,

[00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:40.270]
the Bush administration would still have to show that wiping out Baghdad, taking several hundred thousand innocent lives, would be an effective measure of prevention.

[00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.850]
For that vast taking of life would be a crime equivalent to the horrors supposedly seeks to prevent.

[00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:52.090]
Nonetheless, with significant evidence and serious argument, a preemptive strike despite its horrors could potentially be justified as self-defense.

[00:38:52.890 --> 00:39:00.730]
Now Sodom Hussein is a brutal dictator, he's used chemical and biological weapons supplied to him by the U.S., and with U.S. officials turning a blind eye and attacking Iran and the Kurds.

[00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:07.690]
But for more than a decade defeated Iraq has been subjected to famine and impoverishment through UN Boycott and a purging of weapons through UN inspections.

[00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.870]
Neither evidence nor plausible argument exists that Hussein is an immediate danger to the U.S.

[00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:18.310]
Under the First President Bush, the U.S. created an international coalition to reverse Iraq's aggression against Kuwait.

[00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:23.450]
But the Second President Bush proposes international coalition or not to wage aggression against Iraq.

[00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:30.190]
Further, the Bush doctrine announces this aggression as a prelude to the potentially unending string of future aggressions.

[00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.910]
Bush policies already licensed the Russian oppression of Chechnya, which the U.S. government used to condemn.

[00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:42.010]
It might justify Indian invasion of Pakistan or the opposite. It destroys the most significant moral as well as legal feature of international law.

[00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:54.590]
This past weekend in London several hundred thousand people demonstrated against the Bush War in Iraq in Italy 50,000 and Washington 20,000 in Denver 3,000, but even internationally many people have not yet found the right name for their unease at the war.

[00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:59.510]
When they realize that aggression and not unilateralism is that name, this movement will become much more massive.

[00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:10.130]
If there's still time for the Bush administration water its relentless plans for belligerence to renew serious weapons inspections in Iraq to proceed with a decent respect for international law and the opinion of humankind.

[00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:22.410]
As the overwhelming military power into world of Bush administration proposes a doctrine of unending aggression against sovereign states and arrogant military superiority, this policy won't make any of us feel more secure getting on an airplane or walking your public building.

[00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.790]
Worse yet will have on our hands the blood of a large number of innocents.

[00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:31.850]
Alan Gilbert is a democratic theorist and author most recently of musk global politics constrained democracy.

[00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.830]
He's John Evans professor of international studies at the University of Denver. How do you like that?

[00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:42.950]
And he wrote that piece saying condolese and the president have lost their way. Get him a compass in a road map.

[00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.950]
God damn it. They know exactly what they're doing.

[00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.350]
He said it's in the bag, dead.

[00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.710]
20 till noon at 5.60 we got the mad dog at one.

[00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.450]
Josie and Donnie, I almost said Donnie B. Well that's a Donnie B Jr.

[00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.650]
Huh? That's his name Donnie B. Jr.

[00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.970]
Are going to be on from 3 to 630 with Bino.

[00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.990]
Oh, Josie Gackie and Bino, I'm leaving. I'm out.

[00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:08.450]
Wow.

[00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:10.450]
Josie Gackie.

[00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.970]
You know that before we played that one way, yeah.

[00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.010]
I'm doing it. Yeah, this is Don Bailey Jr. I'm Josie Gackie.

[00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.930]
Wow. Man, can't complain about his personality. He ain't got one.

[00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.730]
Sick goes Panther, preview 630, 7 o'clock. The Panthers at the Alators.

[00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.310]
Wow, on a pond.

[00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.310]
After that thrashing of the pathetic Mape Believes last night in Toronto.

[00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.570]
Boy, that city, they must be crappin' their pants.

[00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.690]
They must be having voodoo dolls of Bill Waters and Ken Dryden and Pat Quinn.

[00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:40.230]
They must be going up and down Young Street screaming for blood in Toronto, eh?

[00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.970]
Eddie K. after the hockey game, Jo and Mark overnight with more ass talk.

[00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.050]
That's why they had that bad number, man. Too much ass.

[00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.250]
Everybody likes a little ass, but too much ass bad ass.

[00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.670]
Oh, starts distinct to join out like their numbers.

[00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.430]
Are they aware? Did you speak to Jo?

[00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.970]
No, not since we found out.

[00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.450]
Hmm. He probably, and remember he was a wake every time I tried to come up with him.

[00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.790]
Remember he was in here the other day, very, and I asked him about that on Tuesday.

[00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.070]
And he was very laid back. He must have had a premonition that the numbers were going to suck.

[00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.990]
He must have had like one, like they're always having on passions, like sure he's always having these premonitions of evil things going to happen.

[00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.910]
I think the evil spirits got to their show.

[00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:20.290]
Because, man, you couldn't find their audience with the same compass and road map were loaning the Condoleezans.

[00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:21.610]
Sorry, Jo, they got dibs on it.

[00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.630]
Hey, you want to find a great Chinese buffet? Look no further than the Emerald Coast.

[00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.090]
Boy, is this a great place.

[00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.430]
If you're frustrated, if you're desperate, if you're tired of all the crap in this town, just go over there and pick out.

[00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.490]
Just get a trough full of food.

[00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.530]
They have three locations for you. They're in sunrise, north by me.

[00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.870]
Beats in a new location in Pember 5. Just like me with that cookie, those cookies I just ate. I feel great.

[00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:44.490]
You believe me? No.

[00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.150]
Now my blood sugar's starting to go up. It was damn good, though.

[00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.830]
Thank you again to Quiz-No's, man. Good lunch.

[00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.470]
Right? Excellent.

[00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.730]
Can Maldon's having a little bit in there? Muff is having 20 or 30 sandwiches.

[00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.190]
Put a platter in the kitchen. There's a platter in the kitchen, by the way.

[00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.050]
For the staff.

[00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.410]
There's a platter in the kitchen. There's some great Quiz-No's staff. All you stiff stuff.

[00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:07.030]
People start your mouth-watering experience at the Emerald Coast with six different mouth-watering soups.

[00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.770]
Sample dozens of succulent entrees. Not just Oriental stuff, but all kinds of other goodies, too.

[00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.130]
Oriental surf and tear-founder weekends with the last-kin King Crab New York strip steak.

[00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:23.250]
Made to order, believe it or not, the gourmet center of that sizzling Asian grill, featuring teriyaki steak, shrimp, chicken, seafood, even hand-carb prime rib that melts in your old puss.

[00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:29.650]
The Emerald Coast buffet promotes healthy living, too, and can all of their fine cuisine with cholesterol-free oils, no MSG, no cramp.

[00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.910]
There were faith features of full salad bar, a new sushi bar, and fresh shrimp cocktail.

[00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:39.270]
One requirement, take a long crowbar, mix them in your pants for dessert, because they got a dessert bar that's outstanding.

[00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:45.030]
Featuring pies, cakes, pastry, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings, even watermelon, baby.

[00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:52.250]
Don't forget to spit out the seeds. Emerald Coast, their sunrise at Pine Island of 44th, Collins Avenue, just north of 162nd, North Miami Beach,

[00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.830]
and at the intersection of Flamingo and Pepper Crote in Pemberp Pines.

[00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:00.470]
They accept reservations, take out and delivery available as well, call 954-57238-22.

[00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:07.770]
That's 954-57238-22 for more info on the Emerald Coast and look for their new Oriental Chicken Salad, too.

[00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:14.250]
My life and love, this is 420560, the way you am.

[00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.070]
Get Ricky a blow.

[00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.210]
George, George, Jorge, Rodriguez, Bigfoot, to Sir Guy.

[00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.470]
He's on circumcised.

[00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.330]
George, George, Jorge, Rodriguez, cryptic son of a bitch.

[00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.250]
Don't give him no sh**.

[00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.790]
With the pups like me, he's got a great deal of free food and a brand new set of wheels.

[00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:52.970]
If you got the pups to give them a call, just remember that he won't take your crap.

[00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:59.230]
He's George, George, Jorge, Rodriguez, queen as he can be.

[00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:06.670]
You won't find no cheese. Don't give him no.

[00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.890]
You am. What do you want?

[00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:14.170]
George, George, Jorge, Rodriguez, cryptic son of a bitch.

[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:19.590]
I'm on the 560's, I would just think, you know, I'm amazed at what a great guy can sometimes be.

[00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.870]
Because even after he tried to get you fired, I'm up in Toronto.

[00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:29.910]
All that hysteria that went on, might happen to be desperately on the phone with Moth, but this one and that one and Norm Kent and back and forth.

[00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:36.590]
Even after that whole episode, I came back to town on June 3rd on his birthday and he sent the beast in here as his messenger.

[00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:37.750]
Remember the beast? Right.

[00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.310]
Oh, you know, Howard would invite you to come and wish him a happy birthday.

[00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.290]
Talk about a self-serving old fart, man. Invites me to come and wish him a happy birthday.

[00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:52.550]
And then I walk in and he sits there with his head down in his papers like he's going to do me a favor to look up.

[00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:58.430]
I extend the hand of friendship. I wish him a happy birthday because I got to work with the old Fuddy-Dutty, you know?

[00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:03.570]
So I made an effort and then he invites me to sit on the air with them. You remember that morning?

[00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:08.110]
I thought it was kind of amusing and had a little fun with them. And right away, he took action. Well, I don't know what it was.

[00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.630]
Took exception or whatever that was all about because I was having some fun with them. Right.

[00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.890]
Oh, you're not allowed to. I see because I didn't genuinely like to kiss his goddamn hair piece.

[00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:22.270]
So he came and he recalled he came in here while we were getting ready to do the show during one of their breaks and he said to me with a straight face.

[00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:26.550]
I heard from one of the lower levels that very out.

[00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:32.070]
Lower. Yeah. Not by names because there can't be any names because everything has to be cloak and dagger with people like him.

[00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.630]
I heard from one of the lower level people that you wanted to have a truce.

[00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:42.070]
I said a truce about what? In other words, how do you have a truce if you're not fighting a war? He's fighting a one sided war against the whole world of sky.

[00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.070]
I'm not fighting anymore. I said, I said, you mean Greg to it? I know there was some lower level person.

[00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:54.730]
And there's no way it could be a lower level person who he was referring to was the call from Greg and the station attorney to our attorney, Norman Elliott Kent.

[00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.990]
Bigging me to lay off because he couldn't handle it and his wife couldn't handle it. Remember those days. That's nice to hide behind your wife. Yeah.

[00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:11.810]
And so I laid off for a couple of days and I come back down here and even try to like, you know, make the best of it of a bad situation. They still couldn't do it.

[00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:18.530]
And then when he looked me straight to the eye when I went in and says, you know, with George, you know why you still here? I said, why is that?

[00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:28.430]
Howard should have said mo. And he and by the way, it drives him up the wall when people call him mo. It drives him just like when the guy called in yesterday morning, called Goldie, Goldie.

[00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:34.270]
What did you call him? Another one of them trained monkeys. It's Goldie.

[00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:44.950]
So you know one thing he don't have like Joe Rose used to call him Gold. You know that that used to send me. Hey, Goldie, you know the sports, the hand on the ass, the towel snapping locker room kind of stuff.

[00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:56.050]
But in any rate, even I've got him upset. But when he looked me in the eye and said, because I did the right thing, I backed off. And right there, that was the smoking gun. That's all I needed. That was like coming right out and saying, hey, guess what?

[00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.630]
I was really, really did try to get George fired in spite of all the miles by people who want to be in the rubber rooms for a couple of months.

[00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:14.270]
That's right. So you're not fooling anybody. Mo. Okay. Everybody hears on to you. And even spite of that, we still hope you throw a number in there every once in a while. So maybe we can make a few bucks off your pathetic show.

[00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:24.950]
Mo. Well, we beat up on him yesterday. They were letting you beat up on George beat up on me all the time. So that's nothing new.

[00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:30.930]
No, we want the calls. We think this song, you know, I take a minute. Don't don't ever accuse me of not doing that.

[00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.750]
And then of course, I do whatever I want anyway.

[00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.530]
442 votes. It's not even noon yet. We're going over 500 during the show.

[00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.690]
Put that mode of shame. You got 950 votes yesterday. I think you go over 1000.

[00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:53.910]
Why were George's rating so dismal the summer so weak so lame so disappointing. Marginal, especially that 9 o'clock hour.

[00:48:54.010 --> 00:49:05.850]
I love George 95 21.4% is leading. His shows are boring 92. His shows blow or his show blows. His show be blown 65.

[00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:15.450]
Mo is a brutal lead in 61. He's an anti-Semitic little stick 31. Too much ass talk 28.

[00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:25.330]
There was Miguel's fault 23. Miguel's doing pretty good on here. He can't compete with Howard Spur 19. He can't compete with Howard or Rush 12. He mumbles 11.

[00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:33.630]
He can't compete with Rush 5. Now here's the facts. Now watch your look at the handwriting. Chronic. Chronic.

[00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:43.070]
This is the most chronic factor in the history of the human race. Usually complimentary toward me anyway. But that holds no water.

[00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:49.790]
In fact, this is I think the one I got all upset last time. Did the one hit Wonder Thing? Remember? Oh yeah. When I was here.

[00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:56.730]
Oh, this is terminal. Not doing it like he's going to direct the whole goddamn show. That's what I love about so many of the people out there in the audience.

[00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:04.550]
They're the program director. They're the orchestrator. They're pulling all the strings. You know, just just you know, step and goose along to whatever I tell you. No thanks.

[00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:13.210]
Anyway, he said and look at the long list. This will take us up till midnight. Neil White George really sucks a true list. There's honest opinion.

[00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:20.090]
In a chronic fax is honest opinion. Chronic. Talk about having too much time on your hand to write a a missive like this.

[00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:30.350]
Even the guy damn sniper didn't leave a message this long. One, most considered Georgia, Cabana Boy type a slightly chunky bag dude. What?

[00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:40.350]
Slightly chunky bag dude. He's not bag. He's not chunky. He's not the Cabana Boy or any of these things were Cabana Boy.

[00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.950]
Maybe have a band of boy not Cabana Boy. I think that's what he's got to do.

[00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:53.970]
George's voice is good for talking up elevator music. Three. I see this is just this is just crap. This is pathetic.

[00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:05.130]
Just a few thoughts George. Make us a sandwich. Very weak don't ever fax me again. Okay, because you're writing a so tell tale.

[00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:09.830]
It'll go right into your old trash can. I mean you rip your joy you want, but do a good job of it. This stuff ain't even funny.

[00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:19.890]
It's not even like Louis Nye. It's not even up to that standard. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on 8. Oh, what's this?

[00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:31.190]
Oh, it says, dear Mr. Rogers, I believe you're mistaken about the reason for the failure of the QM morning drive show. How did I miss this? Oh, this is another chronic faxer.

[00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:45.670]
It is not how we're David that's bringing the show to grinding halt by 606 AM every day. His professionalism is unquestionable. This business about professionalism boring. See, somebody can be very professional but be boring at the same time. Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:52.530]
When there's centaurion in the delivery can be very boring, but anyway, it goes on to say his voice rings true with every point he's successfully makes.

[00:51:52.870 --> 00:52:01.130]
Mr. David's character is without a doubt beyond a modicum of criticism. His character is this somebody that knows him now. This is one of our chronic faxers. I think it's him.

[00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:11.630]
The real reason for the show is that truly little sidekick of his Stevie, Len will his nads drop Goldstein. I cringe every time he pips up to say something, especially if it goes against towers. Always correct opinion.

[00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:24.490]
Mrs. Goldstein is the one needs to be replaced immediately if not sooner since you're in anonymous here. This is just trying to be cute. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And on the back. See, I didn't look at a bottom. It is cute because on the bottom it's written from the desk of H David.

[00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.630]
Thank you, sir. I knew it had to be going somewhere because it's from one of our good faxers.

[00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:39.870]
Did you see the graphics on the thing? I don't know. Could you see? Very fancy. Excellent job. You're forgiven.

[00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:51.330]
Oh, the one guy that called earlier, he had a right on the head. I mean, even the listeners can see it. If he just was having fun, this would be fantastic.

[00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:58.890]
Like the one day, you remember the first day when Greg brought him in here. I was back from Toronto for one of my very short, but still too long visits.

[00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:15.090]
And he brought him in here. And at that point, we've been making fun about the plaid pants and the bad wig. And you had mentioned all of these things. And I made, I imposed him a little bit. Anyway, Greg brings the man introduces me. He stands right there in front of that microphone and Bokobriner just on a new bit about him.

[00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:26.370]
And I fired it up and he stood there. He laughed so hard. I thought his piece was going to fly off. I mean, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and Greg was laughing and showing like we just all made up and kissed, you know.

[00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:34.730]
Remember that? Of course. See, that's how it could be. But don't shoot there. Call me that by that name. And it's a golden shield.

[00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:40.490]
I told you you were talking about earlier, which I listened to. I thought it was great. It sounded like you were both having fun and bonding and everything.

[00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.590]
That's what I thought. And then you come back in here and the reports that we get, he was psychotic.

[00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:54.810]
You know, that would be like having sex with somebody for the first time. And you thought it was the greatest lay ever had in your life. And then like an hour later, you find out that she's saying, that was the worst piece of ass I ever had in my life. Yeah, what is that?

[00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.170]
While you're telling yourself off.

[00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:06.130]
Man, three minutes till noon at 560 speaking, I asked, well, I'll tell you Jeff Cohen. He's the ass man at pizza. Love if you don't believe me, just go over there and ask him. He'll tell you.

[00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:16.810]
And we got two locations of the pizza love now. No, I don't want to downplay the original one in Broward County because that's the mainstay on university drive right behind Pierwinn imports with acres and acres of free parking up there.

[00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:23.770]
They keep adding more tables. The place keeps getting bigger and better all the time. I saw there a banner on the way to the track last night. The pizza love banner. Kids eat free Wednesday night.

[00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:40.690]
And anyway, the number four take out delivery at the pizza loft in Davy is 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 3 different kinds of great pizza. All kinds of great pasta. All your favorites are delicious and fresh, gigantic portions. The best garlic rolls in the world. And even Marcy tells us that's the case.

[00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:51.850]
Every Monday is lasagna night at the loft. Every Tuesday is eggplant night. Buy one of these dinners on the evenings. Get the second for only 5 bucks. Wednesday like I just said, only moments ago kids eat free with it else. They can see Jeff's famous magic show as they whip it out for him.

[00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:58.910]
And Thursday like tonight is bike night at the loft. Come on a motorcycle buy one dinner. Get the second for app price. And all of these specials are good at both locations.

[00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:15.310]
The second the newest location in plantation right behind Walgreens corner of Navhill and sunrise in the famous Walgreens Plaza there, whatever the hell we call it. And the number for take out delivery there is 9 5 4 3 8 2 9 9 9 3 8 2 9 9 9 and like I told you the day after Marcy and I hit our famous meal in there.

[00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:20.950]
Food is the same great quality. It's all fresh. The portions are unbelievably gigantic and you're absolutely going to love it.

[00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:26.890]
Now what is this thing about bomb? We'll find out because when Skippy comes back, I'm sure he'll get right on top of that.

[00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:36.250]
So when I doubt check it out, the brand new world famous pizza loft on the corner of Navhill and sunrise right beyond Walgreens in prestigious plantation where some people still speak English but not too many.

[00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:42.710]
My life and love this is 4 3 0 5 6 8 8 2 8 8

[00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:51.810]
This tape called steam but you can call me Caldy whenever I'm in town I listen to wait a minute I am in town. It's the 12 to 1 hour.

[00:55:52.130 --> 00:56:00.450]
And that's why I think the gentle have a chip bean. Good talk. This is the beast. I said shut up that's all that you're like a father to me.

[00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:09.550]
You don't talk to l'm done talking. When I'm done talking then you talk. Okay. I'll be coming. Come here. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Mr. Golf Club.

[00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:14.850]
Why I heard it. I've got to show you the business entities. Come here.

[00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:22.150]
This court sentences you to 20 years in ours.

[00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:28.770]
Would you info? I had ordered tag off my mattress. Look like we'll be your bunk mates.

[00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:34.290]
The name is more hall of David'sください state screen of tharadise with your nicoeko.

[00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:50.150]
You got so I'm calling mid acrony here. I'm going to make you my Game and musical and all God to the family.

[00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:51.030]
I got ten minutes.

[00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:52.570]
Well, it was to be safe in Heath.

[00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:53.790]
No, both of us.

[00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:54.350]
No, man.

[00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:56.350]
In Lora, New Linda Blah over that.

[00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:57.550]
It's so pretty.

[00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:58.430]
Okay.

[00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.150]
Call the virus to me like that.

[00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.290]
You know who I am?

[00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.150]
No, come in, then don't pick it up now.

[00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:04.250]
I'll be a part of my head.

[00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:05.030]
All right.

[00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.830]
But I expect a print in the apology of my customer.

[00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:09.650]
That room had a both-time error.

[00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:11.330]
I'll take the truck.

[00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.470]
Lord, we'll see you now.

[00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.130]
Thank you.

[00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.170]
Well, Mr. David.

[00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:21.970]
Hello, Warren.

[00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:23.990]
Don't jack, jack, Warren.

[00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:25.170]
How can it help you?

[00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:25.830]
You see, Warren?

[00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:26.390]
Yeah.

[00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.450]
I keep getting raped.

[00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.050]
So is that a shame?

[00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.870]
I look into it right away.

[00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:32.430]
Thanks, Warren.

[00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:33.950]
So, I've tied some button.

[00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.410]
But it's out.

[00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:35.290]
Drop your pad.

[00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:37.370]
I said drop your pad.

[00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:38.250]
This was odd.

[00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.470]
Favours don't come to you.

[00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:42.410]
No, no, no.

[00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.010]
Let's rape, oh.

[00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.570]
Radio big shot.

[00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:49.410]
There's now we've asked the time

[00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:53.030]
O' Wake in the Gale, Jail, Loo, Hards.

[00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.350]
From 03 at 560 WDQM, the man

[00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.790]
dog will be back from Michigan today

[00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:58.750]
after a well-deserved day off yesterday.

[00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:00.430]
It's always well-deserved, and it's very often.

[00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:00.870]
Nice going.

[00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:03.810]
Bushmaster 223 rifle was found behind the

[00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.010]
affront seat of that car, by the way.

[00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:06.610]
The suspects vehicle, which they just towed away.

[00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.370]
You see it?

[00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:08.330]
The vehicle?

[00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.750]
That B-up made up old Chevy Caprice vehicle.

[00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.750]
Bushmaster 223 rifle.

[00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:14.830]
Did they figure something symbolic

[00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:16.010]
like that it was a Bushmaster?

[00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:16.810]
How do you like that?

[00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:18.970]
Maybe the Bushmaster knows about that

[00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.450]
Bushmaster, but at any rate, here's a

[00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:22.170]
disgusting story.

[00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.070]
Somebody just facts in another one of our

[00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:24.910]
bedtime stories.

[00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:26.950]
Berglard van der Leises Durham, what you

[00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:27.210]
am.

[00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:28.910]
You'll love this.

[00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.030]
Upon returning to his room at 530 AM Sunday

[00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.330]
at the Hectorms, is this from the, what's

[00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:34.770]
from the Harold?

[00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.710]
At the Hectorms on the U of M campus,

[00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:40.730]
student Brian Onkst smelled a foul odor.

[00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:42.630]
I guess he gave Brian Onkst some angst when

[00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:43.090]
he smelled it.

[00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.570]
Smelt it.

[00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:45.450]
He looked around and noticed that

[00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.030]
someone had entered the room and

[00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.910]
defecated and urinated in his bed and

[00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:49.730]
the room in the hallway.

[00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.570]
Ah, those college kids, what about your

[00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:51.950]
kidders?

[00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.210]
His roommate, Jeff Grant, was sleeping

[00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:55.370]
while the incident took place.

[00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:57.170]
Onkst was unable to tell if anything had

[00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.610]
been stolen.

[00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.490]
His roommate was sleeping while the

[00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.150]
incident took place.

[00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.170]
Somebody came in and took a crack and

[00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:03.810]
peed on his bed and his roommate was

[00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:04.290]
sleeping.

[00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:04.990]
Right.

[00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:08.130]
I guess they're going to probably have to

[00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:11.110]
test the stool to find out that you do

[00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:11.950]
a D-day test.

[00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.810]
And if it turns out to be your stool,

[00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:15.130]
I think you kicked out of school.

[00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:17.250]
Huh?

[00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:19.310]
Is not the deal.

[00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.250]
I mean, we know this is bogus to begin with

[00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.610]
because there is no university of Miami.

[00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:23.530]
There are no dorms.

[00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:24.390]
There are no students.

[00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:25.170]
There are no classes.

[00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.110]
There are no textbooks.

[00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:27.650]
There's only a bunch of ball clubs.

[00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:29.030]
Mainly the football team.

[00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:31.070]
And I want my team to go out there and

[00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:32.510]
really kick some ass on Saturday.

[00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:34.130]
I don't want some maybe, Pabicar.

[00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.850]
That guy yesterday, man, he's so

[00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:37.130]
typically you sports nerds.

[00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:39.450]
You guys, man, I think I'm hung like a

[00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:39.670]
butterfly.

[00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:41.450]
These guys must be hung like a mosquito.

[00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.230]
Talk about lack of any kind of

[00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.490]
self worth or respect or anything.

[00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:49.390]
Their whole value in life.

[00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.790]
And by the way, now that I was really

[00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:53.370]
remiss on Monday, not mentioning this.

[00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.930]
Remember how blessed we were last week

[00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:56.630]
to be in South Florida?

[00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:58.750]
I guess after the Dolphin shellacking

[00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.410]
and then embarrassing performance by

[01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.310]
Raidol Kami, homie Lucas on Sunday.

[01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:05.750]
I guess we're not quite as blessed

[01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.810]
as we were the week before,

[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.530]
especially since the Huracuns had a

[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:09.970]
biweek didn't play no games against

[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:10.810]
no girl school.

[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.710]
So there were no victories last weekend.

[01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.190]
I guess we're not as blessed as we

[01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.870]
used to be, you know,

[01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:18.970]
cursed.

[01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:20.210]
Yeah, we're cursed.

[01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.650]
Aren't we?

[01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:21.650]
We're cursed down here.

[01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.890]
I talked to people all over the

[01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:23.110]
country.

[01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.770]
You know what they said?

[01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:24.710]
We're cursed down here.

[01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.510]
And in that case, I said,

[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.310]
you know, you got a point.

[01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:28.630]
I think you're on to something.

[01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.450]
The imminent death of American

[01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:32.890]
democracy starting in Missouri,

[01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.150]
writes Harvey Wasserman.

[01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.290]
Who's Harvey Wasserman?

[01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:40.850]
Some guy who writes on common dreams

[01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:41.430]
dot org.

[01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:42.650]
Well, I'm looking on the bottom to

[01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:43.610]
see if it says who he is,

[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.310]
which he usually says,

[01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.750]
I don't see it at any rate.

[01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:48.550]
He's got a good point.

[01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:49.470]
In fact, maybe there's another

[01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:50.150]
page to this.

[01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.830]
Do you think I threw it out?

[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.810]
Maybe on the bottom,

[01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:54.790]
the next page on the bottom

[01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:55.690]
would say who he is,

[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:56.330]
went and doubt.

[01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:57.750]
Oh, look at this.

[01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:58.890]
I had a lot of faxes.

[01:00:59.050 --> 01:00:59.670]
By the way, here's one says,

[01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:00.170]
Rest in Peace.

[01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.090]
Happy Purim Lady.

[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.090]
We're all very upset about that.

[01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.750]
She was wonderful.

[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.170]
Everybody loved her and we're upset,

[01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:08.310]
but one of those things that seems to be

[01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.310]
going around these days,

[01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.790]
you know what part of life people

[01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:11.350]
die in.

[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.690]
It happens anyway,

[01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:16.710]
200 years of American democracy

[01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:18.290]
could definitively end November 5,

[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.110]
starting in Missouri.

[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.650]
No matter what happens in the overall election,

[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.510]
the race for the US Senate

[01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:23.450]
seat from Missouri will determine

[01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.110]
who controls the Congress on November 6.

[01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:26.450]
Should incumbent Democrat

[01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.210]
Jean Carnahan lose the Republicans

[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.110]
will immediately take control of the US Senate.

[01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:32.470]
They could then use a lame duck session to destroy

[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.110]
the last vestiges of the American system

[01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:34.910]
of checks and balances.

[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:36.530]
They're confident this will happen

[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.070]
and are spending millions of dollars

[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.810]
to make sure it does.

[01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:40.870]
The upper chamber is now divided

[01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.910]
between 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans

[01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.870]
and one brave independent.

[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.290]
Elected as a Republican

[01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:47.010]
Vermont's Jim Jeffords chose independence

[01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:48.790]
and face of the Bush Blitzkrieg.

[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.570]
His profile and courage is stamped

[01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:51.570]
on the last check and balance

[01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:52.430]
in American government.

[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:54.130]
With a ruthless hard-right cabal

[01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:55.450]
in charge of the executive branch,

[01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:56.890]
the Republicans have moved to complete

[01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:57.890]
their definitive conquest

[01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.130]
of the judiciary and the media.

[01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:01.150]
The US court system is now

[01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.070]
thoroughly dominated by conservative Republicans.

[01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.610]
Their Supreme Court installed Bush

[01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:05.770]
in the White House after the dispute

[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:07.730]
in 2000 election, which was lost

[01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.450]
by more than a half a million votes nationwide.

[01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:11.950]
Another horticrospective right-wing judges

[01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:13.490]
are now poised to finish transforming

[01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:15.610]
the judiciary from the civil liberties safety

[01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.070]
that it was just a few decades ago

[01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.210]
to a hollow rubber stamp for executive privilege.

[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.970]
The National Media is a mirror image

[01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:23.770]
dominated by six major corporations.

[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.590]
They made your print TV and radio

[01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.090]
while let's convey a ceaseless barrage

[01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:28.690]
of right-wing bio.

[01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:29.430]
What's that?

[01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:31.130]
Oh, blow, blow-viators.

[01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:33.610]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:34.510]
The print's not too good.

[01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:36.510]
Right-wing blow-viators, I love that.

[01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:38.930]
What minor balance remains comes to the Internet

[01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.510]
and the few isolated talk radio shows.

[01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:41.390]
Like good old...

[01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.050]
Damn, God.

[01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.490]
That's right.

[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.990]
There have been many times in US history,

[01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:46.050]
especially during the Civil War

[01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:47.030]
and World War I and II,

[01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.770]
when executive power has been close to absolute.

[01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:50.790]
In each case, the public understood

[01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.310]
the problem would be temporary and so it was.

[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.850]
But today's GOP is declared as permanent

[01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.070]
its anti-terrorist assault on individual freedoms.

[01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.670]
The US Patriot Act has extinguished the Bill of Rights

[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.610]
and gave American democracy...

[01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:03.330]
That gave the American democracy its birth.

[01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:06.230]
The administration holds sacred only to Second Amendment

[01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.590]
which guarantees the right of the sniper

[01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:10.030]
who's been terrorizing the nation's capital to bear arms.

[01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.850]
Bush's commitment to other traditional American liberties

[01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.410]
is expressed by mass anti-terror imprisons in Cuba

[01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:17.270]
and elsewhere without identifying the victims,

[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:19.230]
charging them or allowing them legal counsel.

[01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:21.310]
The administration's relentless attack

[01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.450]
on traditional American freedoms has been somewhat slowed

[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.570]
by the Democrats' razor-thin Senate majority.

[01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:26.790]
They've controlled the committees.

[01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:27.790]
The majority leaves shipping

[01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:29.310]
and thus the Senate's basic agenda.

[01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:31.350]
But that could end on election day.

[01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:33.990]
If Carnahan loses to Republican former representative

[01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.690]
James M. Talent, Talent will immediately take her seat.

[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.090]
On November 6th, the Senate would be compromised

[01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.050]
of comprised rather of 50 Republicans

[01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.750]
and 49 Democrats plus Jeffords,

[01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:44.450]
the Thai-brain-vote-breaking vote

[01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.250]
of course will be owned by Vice President Dick Cheney.

[01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.190]
Republican activists can barely contain themselves.

[01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.390]
Ironically, the seat was contested

[01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.290]
in 2000 by John Ascroft,

[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.090]
the current hard-right attorney general,

[01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.250]
Ascroft lost to Mel Carnahan,

[01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.110]
the Democratic ex-governor who died in a plane crash

[01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:00.330]
shortly before the election,

[01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.730]
Jean Carnahan was then appointed

[01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:03.190]
to fill the seat on an interim basis.

[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:05.750]
Should she lose November 5th,

[01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.890]
the Republicans will immediately call a lame duck session.

[01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:10.850]
The push for right-wing judiciary appointments would proceed,

[01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.930]
so would new tax cuts for the very rich

[01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.610]
and severe restrictions on liability lawsuits

[01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.410]
by victims of corporate negligence.

[01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:18.810]
Also on the duck, it might be an energy bill including

[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.690]
major subsidies for nuclear power and fossil fuels

[01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.870]
drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge

[01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:26.230]
and other anti-planetary assaults.

[01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:28.530]
The lame duck agenda would technically be subject

[01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.850]
to filibuster in today's Senate

[01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.290]
that takes 60 votes to get closer

[01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:32.750]
and pass any legislation.

[01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.590]
But if the Republicans could use their regained committee

[01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.490]
control, they could force-stall right-wing appointments

[01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:38.590]
onto the floor of the Senate.

[01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:40.510]
Filibuster and could block their final approval

[01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.450]
in the lame duck session,

[01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.490]
but holding them back in the future would not be easy.

[01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.630]
And with control of the both houses of Congress,

[01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.530]
even for a relatively brief lame duck session,

[01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:49.370]
the Republicans will hold absolute power

[01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.250]
over the American government.

[01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.190]
Already, the Republican routed a feeble

[01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.210]
national Gibbhart leadership is virtually complete.

[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.590]
The Democrats on willingness to support Senator Robert

[01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.850]
Burd's filibuster against Bush's Iraqi war powers

[01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:02.430]
sealed that victory as did the Democratic's failure

[01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.150]
to investigate Bush-Chainy stock abuses

[01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.650]
at Harkin and Halliburton.

[01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:08.310]
Bush's ruthless mastery of the Iraqi war card

[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:10.210]
shut the collapse of the American economy out of the

[01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.770]
2000-to-Election debate,

[01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:13.910]
protecting the GOP from the usual midterm gains

[01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:14.910]
of the opposition party.

[01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:16.890]
This year, the anemic Democrats will be lucky

[01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:17.550]
to hold their own.

[01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.010]
Whether Bush actually attacks the back remains

[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:21.330]
to be seen, at the very least,

[01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.670]
he's helped reignite a global anti-war movement.

[01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.990]
But the Democrats have already handed him a blank check

[01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.550]
to make war on whoever he wants to abroad

[01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.350]
and against the Constitution at home.

[01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:32.130]
If Gene Carnahan loses in Missouri November 5,

[01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.230]
the last vestige of American democracy will be gone.

[01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.170]
And a tear forms in your eye in the corner of your eye.

[01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:40.850]
And you start singing,

[01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.250]
Oh, Canada, something like that.

[01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.110]
Ish bin An Canadian.

[01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.730]
It's 11 after a noon, at 560 WQM,

[01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:52.230]
you know, I really didn't want to get out of bed this morning

[01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:53.190]
because I knew I had to come here.

[01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.910]
Well, also because I had a really super night sleep

[01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.830]
on my bed last night from the island mattress.

[01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:59.130]
That's where I get my mattresses.

[01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.590]
If you woke up this morning feeling cranky, nasty.

[01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.450]
Maybe you heard some emotional or maybe like you didn't sleep at all

[01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.310]
then do what I always do call 1-800 mattress.

[01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.550]
That's the number four, the island mattress.

[01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:10.250]
Hello, George.

[01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:11.770]
When you call 1-800 mattress,

[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:13.110]
you'll be guaranteed a great night's sleep.

[01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:15.650]
The island mattress carries the top brand brands

[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:17.750]
and the world like Cele, services, King Kua.

[01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:19.610]
I'll tell you, I'm not eating on it anymore, okay?

[01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.730]
That's another reason why the show's so good in Toronto.

[01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.950]
I don't eat on the air and I lose weight.

[01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:26.550]
Thanks again to Quiz Nose, but don't do it again.

[01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.730]
That means the mattress you want is in stock

[01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.430]
available for immediate delivery of dial amateurs.

[01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.450]
Recently they set up the lovely Miguel with the new bed.

[01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.230]
He's loving it.

[01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.510]
And by the way, while they were there,

[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.090]
they set up a secret camera in the corner of Miguel

[01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:36.990]
and they sent me the pictures.

[01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.730]
Oh, he didn't know that.

[01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:40.810]
The folks at dial amateurs did what they said.

[01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:42.970]
They would know BS, no excuses, no bait and swish,

[01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.750]
just comfortable relaxing night's sleep for Miguel

[01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.590]
and his personal friends every night, all of them.

[01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:49.570]
When the crew from dial amateurs got to Miguel's house,

[01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:50.850]
they took away the crappy old bedding,

[01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.950]
set up the great new mattress.

[01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:53.670]
So don't be tempted by stores going out of business

[01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.710]
who can't deliver because now through the end of the month

[01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.810]
dial amateurs offers you free delivery.

[01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.610]
You can get free dial amateurs delivery in just two hours

[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.250]
or in any given to our window you provide

[01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.010]
depending on where you live.

[01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.670]
Like 11 to 1, noon to 2, 1 to 3, 2 to 4,

[01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:07.470]
3 30 to 5 30, etc.

[01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:09.250]
And don't forget now for limited time

[01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.430]
like I said, delivery is free.

[01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.550]
So sleep like a baby like me and Miguel do.

[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:13.870]
Unfortunately, very far apart.

[01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.190]
Call one least couple of feet.

[01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:16.790]
Call one 800 mattress right now.

[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:20.150]
1 800 MATTR ES for dial amateurs.

[01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.530]
Brand name beds for busy hot people.

[01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:23.890]
Five and a local.

[01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:25.750]
This is 560.

[01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:27.590]
Three of those yours now.

[01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.850]
You and you go back to Canada.

[01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.970]
You keep bastards.

[01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:42.130]
So cannabis are home and need a friend.

[01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.410]
All day the tree.

[01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:19.830]
Gloria's and tree.

[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:29.050]
Oh, cannabis is as best home to me.

[01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:39.170]
Oh, cannabis is as best home to me.

[01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.690]
I pick the bad date of quitsnith and glued.

[01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:45.950]
1217 at 560 WQM.

[01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:46.930]
Happy Thursday too.

[01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:49.430]
We got the mad dog who had those big numbers

[01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:51.530]
in the summer book and George ain't too happy about that.

[01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:52.770]
Why wouldn't I be happy about that?

[01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.230]
Because you were rather than that he would have had a decent book

[01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.710]
but you would have had the bigger number in there.

[01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.130]
I love that.

[01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:58.670]
I love how to big number but I love the mad dog.

[01:08:58.830 --> 01:08:59.490]
I wanted to have tens.

[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.830]
Don't start the same on the air where you didn't see off here.

[01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.050]
You said he was a real backstair.

[01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:06.590]
I'm just kidding about that.

[01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.430]
Did you just relax?

[01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.070]
Just relax.

[01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:11.170]
We all love the big bag.

[01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:12.230]
The big bag.

[01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:15.690]
But it's just that if he would have had like maybe a point lower

[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:17.130]
and you would have had those two points in there

[01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:18.970]
would have like maybe goose this up to the top there.

[01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:21.710]
Instead of you losing our bonus for the second year in the row.

[01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:22.870]
God, I'm sorry.

[01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.390]
Man, I don't think I'm going to be able to scrape

[01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:26.750]
an up mind together and get out of town.

[01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:30.370]
Mad dog, 1 to 3, Joe Z and Donnie B.

[01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:31.990]
A junior, Don Bailey Jr.

[01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.050]
The flying carpet guy.

[01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.110]
They'll be on from 3 to 630.

[01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:37.010]
If that isn't exciting enough as part of that extrav

[01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:39.430]
against them from 5 to 6, you got the Bino Meister.

[01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:41.050]
Probably the worst radio in history.

[01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.590]
Sick goes Panther, Preview, 630 to 7.

[01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.830]
The Panthers at the Islanders to try to make a 3 in a row

[01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.170]
at 7 and lighten out that the Panthers are beating up on all

[01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:49.850]
of them girls teams at Lanta and the Maple Leaf.

[01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:53.170]
Eddie K. after the hockey game and Joe and Mark overnight.

[01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.430]
You notice the NHL is actually living up to their promise.

[01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.810]
They have followed the call out of penalties.

[01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.830]
They're doing what they're doing.

[01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:03.290]
They're opening up the game and the games are like fast,

[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:05.930]
2 hours and 15, 2 hours and 20 minutes and it's great.

[01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:08.550]
Nobody's going to a lot of them but that's beside the point.

[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.970]
I just don't think that for the foreseeable future

[01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:14.290]
based on all the stuff that's been going on last year plus.

[01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:17.070]
Spectators sports aren't quite what they used to be

[01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.350]
and even look at the trouble ahead to sell not the build game

[01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:20.610]
here right up to the last minute channel.

[01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:21.450]
Four head about to last.

[01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:25.590]
Whatever, I think a thousand seats to sell out the dolphin

[01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:26.230]
builds game.

[01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:28.330]
I mean football where the people down here would tell you,

[01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:30.810]
oh man, this is we living by yeah, right.

[01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:32.010]
Yeah, tell me another one.

[01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:32.370]
Okay.

[01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.650]
All they got to do is lose one game and right away

[01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:37.830]
they're finger pointing and crying and emoji.

[01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.010]
We used to be so blessed down here and now we're cursed.

[01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:46.270]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 and Verizon.

[01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:47.590]
I took some calls today.

[01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:48.810]
We had a couple of pretty good ones right.

[01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:53.230]
One couple couple and then we had a few mouth breather's just

[01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:55.410]
a little variety of the spice alive and that's what these people

[01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.930]
like because they basically have nothing to say.

[01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:57.930]
So they make noises.

[01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:00.050]
W Q a n.

[01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:02.910]
How would you but it's a reincarnation of eight off head work.

[01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.090]
I see what is that is that clever was it cute.

[01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:09.810]
I mean if you want to take a shot at mode that's fine,

[01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.070]
but that's that's below the belt.

[01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.650]
Okay below the belt.

[01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:13.510]
So guess what sir?

[01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:15.150]
You're an asshole.

[01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:21.710]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and it just the voice.

[01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:23.910]
The tone and the voice that's how Florida I wish I would

[01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:24.530]
left that on here.

[01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:28.390]
That's the this town dead head dead head chronic dead head.

[01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.570]
Like that 60 cycle tone like the sandy patent show.

[01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.910]
That's it.

[01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.710]
That's this town.

[01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.210]
W Q a n.

[01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:41.090]
Yeah, can I get out with Neil?

[01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.610]
You're on with him.

[01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:43.770]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:44.050]
Great.

[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.910]
I just wanted to know about this Iraqi thing about three weeks ago.

[01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:53.270]
I saw George Bush on TV and he finally came out with it and said

[01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:56.210]
after all this is a guy who wanted to kill my father.

[01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:56.910]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:57.510]
Did you see that?

[01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.350]
My dad.

[01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.870]
My dad.

[01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:00.050]
I killed daddy.

[01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:01.230]
Yeah, I seen it.

[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.290]
All right, thanks Neil.

[01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.030]
And I lost two wheels over to thank you.

[01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:05.670]
Yeah, you got to try to kill daddy.

[01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:07.470]
Now we got to get even.

[01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.150]
We'll show you a thing or two.

[01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.710]
Pissant.

[01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:12.210]
WQ I am.

[01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:15.030]
Q I M.

[01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:15.270]
Hello.

[01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:21.790]
See that the phone calls you just it's an exercise in stupidity and morbidity.

[01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:22.890]
WQ I M.

[01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.650]
Hello, Neil.

[01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:24.130]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.710]
How you doing?

[01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:25.050]
Good.

[01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:27.490]
Listen, what's going on with the bin Laden?

[01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:28.270]
You know where he is?

[01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:29.590]
Yeah, he's right next door.

[01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:31.530]
WQ I M.

[01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.890]
You won't be happy until he's over at the Donut shop.

[01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.450]
Yeah, that's three times for him.

[01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.110]
WQ I M.

[01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:40.710]
Q I M.

[01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:43.610]
WQ I M.

[01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:44.810]
Hello.

[01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:45.530]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.910]
Yes, I just wanted to let you know that your balance is apparently on the vocal Brian

[01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:59.230]
bits between the voice and the music sometimes completely makes it impossible to understand what they're saying on the

[01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:00.190]
O-Canada bits.

[01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:01.610]
We couldn't hear anything.

[01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:06.290]
WQ First of all, that wasn't the vocal Brian bit that I just played the O-Canabas.

[01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:07.530]
WQ I didn't know.

[01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:11.610]
WQ In addition to which I understand every word I've played it a thousand times I understand every word

[01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.750]
and it's so I don't know what you mean.

[01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:13.610]
Maybe you need a new radio.

[01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:16.310]
WQ Well, maybe some of the brand new radio.

[01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:18.950]
WQ Hey, listen, look on the back.

[01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:19.910]
Was it made in China?

[01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:21.750]
By a bunch of little communist.

[01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.110]
Yeah, watch out for that, sir.

[01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.650]
Watch out every time they'll do it to you.

[01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.850]
They probably swung away off to the far left.

[01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:27.810]
So let me adjust that.

[01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:28.470]
Yeah.

[01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.830]
O-Canabas.

[01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:31.610]
Like that.

[01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:32.450]
Oh, in stereo.

[01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.230]
And then vocal Brian has to get a shot for that's not his bit.

[01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:37.670]
And that's not like vocal Brian to us.

[01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:37.930]
No.

[01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:38.210]
No.

[01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.710]
Maybe when somebody squeezing his nuts a little bit WQ I M.

[01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:44.770]
My balls, it's WQ I M.

[01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:46.090]
I M.

[01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:48.290]
WQ I M.

[01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:49.650]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:50.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.590]
I wanted to ask you about the game last night.

[01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:56.510]
I didn't get to see much of it but I know you'd be loving it with us to the panthers.

[01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:56.870]
Yeah.

[01:13:58.090 --> 01:13:59.150]
And what's wrong with them?

[01:13:59.290 --> 01:13:59.630]
They suck.

[01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:02.510]
Well, they got to get better.

[01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:03.270]
They're better.

[01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:04.810]
They're not going to get any better sir.

[01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:05.270]
They're not going to get any better sir.

[01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.070]
They're not going to go tending his week.

[01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.170]
The defense is not existing.

[01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.890]
They stink.

[01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:09.470]
We want Trevor kid.

[01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:10.530]
He should be playing every other word.

[01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.130]
Trevor kid.

[01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.170]
Hello sir.

[01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.930]
Trevor kid is like a human suit.

[01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:15.230]
There's another hockey expert.

[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:16.510]
What about Trevor kid?

[01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:18.190]
Yeah, you should have seen Trevor kid.

[01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.710]
Bel for a stanch and he's phenomenal compared to Trevor kid.

[01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.390]
They got a couple of washed up husbands.

[01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.410]
They couldn't keep Kujo.

[01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:25.910]
You know, he did a little bit too good of a job.

[01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:28.330]
They couldn't give him the deal he wanted and you know, take care of it.

[01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:30.410]
This is what the organization is famous for.

[01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:31.810]
They don't care care of their own people.

[01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.950]
Kuri Schwab when Kujo broke his thumb.

[01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.370]
Kuri Schwab comes in and surprises all and did a hell of a job.

[01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:38.410]
Did they resign him?

[01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:38.690]
No.

[01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.450]
No, they bring in a couple of old hacks.

[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:44.790]
Couldn't stop a bowling ball from 100 yards away on a sidewalk.

[01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:47.910]
Not to mention the defense man.

[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:49.990]
Oh my god.

[01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:51.210]
Pathetic.

[01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.530]
Not to mention Anders Erickson was playing in St. John's

[01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:57.210]
for 4.3 million for three years.

[01:14:57.290 --> 01:15:00.670]
It couldn't make the Panther defense two years ago to worst defense and league.

[01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.630]
So they signed him.

[01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:01.970]
The rocket.

[01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.150]
Who's estimating the talent up there?

[01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:05.790]
What kind of a moron's doing at it?

[01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:08.770]
I guarantee the articles in the news going, I get home.

[01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.610]
That's the first thing I'm going to do is go online and check out the Toronto Sun and Star

[01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:13.650]
and read the articles just ripping them in ass.

[01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.410]
Because just like down here, the people claim to have passion about football.

[01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:20.650]
They think they know something about passion, right?

[01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.330]
Up there they got passion, baby.

[01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:25.730]
1100 standing remotely for every hockey game.

[01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:26.890]
They live and breathe it.

[01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:27.530]
They suck it.

[01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:28.690]
They suck hockey pucks.

[01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:29.550]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:32.570]
Here's a good short article.

[01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.490]
Look how short that is.

[01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:34.150]
But right on.

[01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:38.610]
From Com from the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday by Harry Wolf.

[01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:41.350]
You know where he Wolf is?

[01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.990]
No.

[01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.010]
Harry Wolf lives in rights and callings with PA.

[01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:44.910]
That's all you need to know.

[01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:47.490]
It says, don't worry Osama.

[01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:48.210]
You'll get your war.

[01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.990]
It says, why don't we hurry up and invade Iraq?

[01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:53.930]
Osama's been waiting for this all of his life.

[01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:55.010]
Let's not keep the man waiting.

[01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:56.910]
Don't lose sleep over it, Osama.

[01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.770]
We will attack Iraq.

[01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.910]
Your Islamic world will have its G-Hod.

[01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:03.370]
Your September 11th attack wasn't intended just to kill almost 3,000 people.

[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:06.130]
We know that you meant to change the world and maybe someday control it.

[01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:09.230]
This time it'll be so much easier than the Gulf War.

[01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:11.150]
I'll just visit your own TV and your own CNN.

[01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:12.950]
We'll stir up the hatred among all Muslims.

[01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:16.890]
They'll become enraged that seeing the first civilians killed by the godless soldiers from the West.

[01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:19.990]
The missiles, Israel fires and retaliation will Zionize the war.

[01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:24.990]
The martial law occupation of a Muslim country by America, the Satan of the West will never be accepted.

[01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:27.410]
They didn't even try to create a nation out of Afghanistan.

[01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.490]
The fall of Baghdad will lead to chaos.

[01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:33.330]
Your terrorist cells will more than triple just as you were decentralizing al-Qaeda.

[01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:34.390]
What a perfect plan.

[01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.550]
The fall of Iraq will not hurt you.

[01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:38.610]
Weapons are available in so many other places.

[01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:42.290]
Just be thankful we consider Saudi Arabia's crown prince Abdullah our ally.

[01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:46.690]
Saudi Arabia is where you started al-Qaeda after the Gulf War, gifts from charitable organizations

[01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:49.030]
and from wealthy individuals were helping support your cause.

[01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:53.090]
A pesky task force sponsored by the council on foreign relations pointed that out.

[01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:55.410]
Luckily for you the Bush administration wasn't listening.

[01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:59.670]
Your hometown and your friends are safe Osama, and the rest of the world will be terrorized.

[01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:04.230]
And you'll sit back like the chairman of the board and survey all the gif conquered when they attack Iraq.

[01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:05.790]
Right Terry Wolf.

[01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:09.430]
And Tuesdays Philadelphia and Quirer, how do you like that?

[01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:11.810]
Because inquiring minds want to know what is all about?

[01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:13.710]
You know every wolf I've seen?

[01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.910]
Yeah.

[01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.630]
It's been Harry.

[01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:17.890]
How about Mike Wolf? He's pretty hairy.

[01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:19.110]
Never seen it.

[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:21.070]
I've ever seen it hardly with what's her name?

[01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:22.630]
Faerana, Rana, think Wolf.

[01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.710]
Think.

[01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:26.250]
Man, is she make me nauseous?

[01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.170]
I'll let Maharlay's pretty big.

[01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.430]
Yeah.

[01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:32.330]
26 past noon at 560 WDQ.

[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:35.710]
Oh my god. The sniper is two scumbag around arrested to Jamaica.

[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:39.290]
Huns, Muslims, Jamaica, and wannabes, whatever the hell they are.

[01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.290]
117 years old, one about 40 years old.

[01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:51.210]
And they're old beat up Chevy Purple Caprice with the Bush Wacker 223 behind the front seat.

[01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:57.210]
And the fact that they showed up at that payphone.

[01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:02.310]
It took them three weeks to catch these guys who are a dumber than sawdust.

[01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.050]
And they showed up at the payphone with the cops missed them by 10 minutes.

[01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:06.490]
But we got the beaters.

[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:06.730]
Oh!

[01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:08.530]
So now, see, we got these guys.

[01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:09.610]
And we got the beaters.

[01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:11.450]
That's for for the price of two.

[01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.790]
Did I mention 1226 and QM?

[01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.350]
I think we did.

[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.850]
Let me tell you right now about Oliumeth and having you pop some in your mouth.

[01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:21.190]
Oliumeth's Mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.710]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:29.770]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:29.770]

[01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:29.770]

[01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:29.770]

[01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:29.770]

[01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:30.370]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:31.290]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.510]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:33.930]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:35.810]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:37.130]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.730]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.890]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.150]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.050]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:47.550]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:51.170]
And they're advanced combinations of all caprice.

[01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:19.970]

[01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:23.070]
I'm a real boss.

[01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:25.410]
We're sports radio 560.

[01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:27.050]
You A.M.

[01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.870]
Prover optimum, man.

[01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:36.630]
Well, I never thought I'd find the kind of ride that I've been doing around this today.

[01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:42.210]
I, the classic city wheels, fixed up the way a brother would like it.

[01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:48.690]
Now, with the keen and charnic and the trimmer's cool, then the dyes of the mousy.

[01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:50.890]
I got the cantalic with Jerry Yo.

[01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:53.110]
Da baby.

[01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:57.690]
Open up for daughter Jerry Jerry and the baby Bruce.

[01:19:58.170 --> 01:19:59.710]
Da baby.

[01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:03.210]
Shiny middle-ville, little-village, little-village.

[01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:04.870]
If this is red, kid.

[01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:07.650]
Now, so I've bounced out the road in a bit.

[01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:09.390]
That is super-powering.

[01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:12.550]
Now, with the authors, doc, no big deals.

[01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:15.090]
A day I'll get around the pizza for praise.

[01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:20.170]
A 1979, homeboat, Catalina.

[01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.650]
She's your looking butt.

[01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.790]
Now, it's my baby, Cadillac.

[01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:25.850]
Da baby.

[01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:30.010]
Open up for daughter Jerry and the baby.

[01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:32.370]
Da baby.

[01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.250]
Shiny middle-village, little-village, little-village.

[01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.730]
Yo.

[01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:05.690]
I grab my way and those down on the hearts of the day.

[01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.110]
Cause the case he don't want no way.

[01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:13.950]
Sweating fresh with all seeds starts to smell and gets the touchy work in over time.

[01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:17.330]
Now, my back's a new find.

[01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:19.850]
The shiny grand as the lag light hangs my coffee.

[01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:22.750]
Giant duper's how they wash in it with all the roads.

[01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.070]
Don't all behave here.

[01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:28.370]
Open up for daughter Jerry Jerry.

[01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:29.350]
You be here, baby.

[01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:31.410]
Da baby.

[01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:35.990]
Michael Shaftek wins, going over Steve Fox, ain't too soon.

[01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:37.870]
Da baby.

[01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:42.230]
Fresh malore and fear, you'll be fancy to be here, baby.

[01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:44.510]
Da baby.

[01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.470]
Say it, baby.

[01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:49.990]
Talked for me three, five, six, if we got a very disturbing story.

[01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.570]
I thought a big story, but it could have been.

[01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:56.610]
Secret service agents with their weapons drawn, detained a man today in the White House grounds,

[01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:00.970]
between a fence surrounded in a complex, and the North entrance to the president's residence.

[01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:05.630]
The man was handcuffed by the agents and led away according to Reuters eyewitnesses.

[01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:11.730]
Secret service spokesman Brian Marseid, an individual black male, came over the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue,

[01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:15.830]
and was taken into custody by Secret Service uniformed division officers,

[01:22:16.090 --> 01:22:18.290]
and is currently being interviewed by agents from the service.

[01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:19.590]
Other trained monkey.

[01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:22.790]
President Bush was speaking in North Carolina at the time of the incident he went there.

[01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:23.550]
He went home.

[01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:25.350]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:28.510]
Another darky running around loose out there by the White House,

[01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.330]
and still a lot of confidence in me, I'll tell you.

[01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:33.430]
Darky's run mad.

[01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:35.490]
How's that pull coming?

[01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.990]
Why were Georgia's ratings so weak this summer?

[01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:42.010]
So bitterly disappointing, costing us bonus money again for the second year in a row.

[01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:46.350]
Making us only pray that we could have like rigged some diaries.

[01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.910]
552 votes, which is 552 votes?

[01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:55.150]
Man, you're going to bust through that thousand marker by tomorrow morning, like it's standing still.

[01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:58.590]
His shows are boring as moved into first place, 120.

[01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:59.550]
You're boring, George.

[01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:00.930]
Yeah, just look at you.

[01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:01.350]
I know.

[01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:02.650]
Look at yourself in a mirror.

[01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:05.330]
If some of you people are pointing their finger, look at yourselves in a mirror.

[01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:10.190]
Do you think that his piece like, seriously, it's not a joke question.

[01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:15.610]
Guys who wear like a wig, I'm not talking about a wig that they're like interchangeable.

[01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:16.970]
How do they keep them in place?

[01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:18.150]
And don't say snaps again.

[01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.170]
How do they stay in place?

[01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:20.070]
Spirit gum.

[01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:23.810]
Wrigley's spirit gum.

[01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:26.650]
His shows are boring, 120.

[01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:28.210]
I love George 107.

[01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:29.510]
It's 19.3%.

[01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:31.330]
His show blows 100.

[01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:33.970]
Moe is a brutal lead in 69.

[01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:36.070]
What a great number from a old 69.

[01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:38.850]
Too bad he's got those varicose veins.

[01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:41.690]
He's an anti-semitical little spec 36.

[01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:43.770]
Too much astalk 31.

[01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:45.910]
It was Miguel's fall 25.

[01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:48.510]
He can't compete with Howard Spurm 23.

[01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.790]
He can't compete with Howard or Rush 21.

[01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:54.370]
He mumbles 11 and he can't compete with Rush 9.

[01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.030]
Is where it's at.

[01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:58.830]
Of course, Rush is on right now.

[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.170]
You think our audience has listened to Rush?

[01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.390]
Oh.

[01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:03.270]
Now, maybe a few of them write wingers out there.

[01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.630]
Like there.

[01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:04.230]
Look there, look there.

[01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:04.730]
That same thing.

[01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:05.670]
The ditto heads.

[01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:06.550]
The ditto heads.

[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:08.030]
The same people listen to Art Bell at night.

[01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:09.350]
Just doing the commercial.

[01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:10.450]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:12.750]
Anybody listen to Art Bell needs to be put in a rubber room.

[01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.950]
I'm going to tell you that right now.

[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:15.870]
I'm driving home from the track last night.

[01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.510]
And what do we have?

[01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:17.710]
We had the World Series game on.

[01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:19.690]
That has been a great series.

[01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:21.050]
But it's in between the things.

[01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:23.550]
So I punch you over to see what I would ease got on after Phil.

[01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.610]
Okay?

[01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:26.790]
Because I thought Art Bell started at midnight, didn't you?

[01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:28.410]
I had no idea what to do.

[01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:29.710]
I guess he starts at 10.

[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.450]
And sure enough, they're talking flying saucers again.

[01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:35.750]
I'm listening and I'm listening and he's talking to the guy.

[01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:40.190]
And about the ship landing in Alamaguardia, New Mexico.

[01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:44.850]
And I'm thinking to myself, this is a program for crazy people.

[01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:47.170]
Not that we have any shortage of crazy people.

[01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:50.770]
But you've got to be off your rocker to be listening to Art Bell.

[01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:53.290]
And he's got an audience.

[01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:57.130]
And we don't want to mention Carlos or Boka Brian who listened to that show.

[01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:02.030]
But like I said, anybody who listened to that show for more than 30 seconds needs to be in a rubber room.

[01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.590]
There's got to be something wrong with you.

[01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.550]
If I was you, I'd look myself in a mirror and start pointing the finger and saying,

[01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.290]
you must be crazy.

[01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:12.550]
Yeah, do a John Henry for Cronon out loud, okay?

[01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:15.750]
Just standing there pointing at the mirror, I can't even type the goddamn thing.

[01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:16.590]
I'm so worked up about it.

[01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:17.190]
It was so bad.

[01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:18.790]
It was just awful.

[01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:19.650]
I must be crazy.

[01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:20.370]
I must be nuts.

[01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:22.370]
Right, to be listening to Art Bell.

[01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.390]
Man.

[01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:28.930]
I've listened to Moe for 25 hours straight before I listened to Art Bell.

[01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:30.650]
That's how bad that show is.

[01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:32.010]
You know what?

[01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:33.650]
In fact, see, I just tipped it off.

[01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:35.790]
You know what they're going to do to these two snipers?

[01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:38.030]
Remember clockwork orange?

[01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:38.590]
Oh, yeah.

[01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:40.270]
They're going to lock them in a small room.

[01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:43.870]
Tie their hands behind their back, put each one in a different corner.

[01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:46.510]
And they're going to crank up not a little bit of a living van.

[01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:48.670]
They're going to crank up the moe Howard David of the show.

[01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.750]
On tape, over and over and over.

[01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:55.330]
Talking about the Christian and Aronde and Aronde and Chris.

[01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:56.130]
He doesn't know Chris.

[01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:57.150]
Well, that's too bad.

[01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:59.490]
He will after the first 40 hours of it.

[01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:01.270]
Aronde and Chris and Chris and Aronde.

[01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:04.450]
22 till one.

[01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:05.610]
The mad dog Jim.

[01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:06.470]
Man, it should be long.

[01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.010]
I want to clap for one of his rare working days, which we are.

[01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:11.710]
Well, I'm starting to get jealous of myself.

[01:26:12.450 --> 01:26:15.170]
I think he's cutting out himself a better deal than all the rest of us.

[01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:16.310]
Man works for two hours.

[01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:18.790]
Shows up about three days out of every five.

[01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:23.610]
Gets to go on a year on the ball games on a weekend and scream and shout and carry on like a wild man.

[01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:24.250]
It's great.

[01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:25.370]

Is this sports waiting for bikes?

[01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:51.130]
You way, yeah.

[01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:54.450]
The guy is falling.

[01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.890]
Maybe launch a couple missiles.

[01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:00.290]
Tour to place we know.

[01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:03.850]
And aim a madame fella.

[01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:07.190]
Whose first name begins with old.

[01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:12.150]
There's one thing we all understand.

[01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:20.810]
Alcatta won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.

[01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:22.730]
Yes.

[01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:30.050]
We could chase him round forever with our tanks and all our troops.

[01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:37.230]
But special forces are so tired of jumping through them hooves.

[01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:42.350]
You know we need another plane.

[01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:50.070]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.

[01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.970]
All right.

[01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:57.590]
Alcatta needs a nuclear tank.

[01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:00.070]
Jesus Christ.

[01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:07.070]
Why don't we stop pussyfoot and go blow up Pakistan?

[01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:21.170]
I'm working at those numbers in Joe and Mark Boy.

[01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:22.230]
You think he's awake by now?

[01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:23.570]
Joe Castellan.

[01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:23.850]
Four.

[01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:25.850]
He don't get up till four?

[01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.550]
That's my guess.

[01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.870]
Why would that be?

[01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:33.010]
They get off at six a couple hours to like you know have breakfast, screw around, get some things done.

[01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:33.230]
Yeah.

[01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:33.350]
Yeah.

[01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.530]

[01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:33.570]

[01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:33.670]
Yeah.

[01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:34.310]
Eight hours.

[01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.030]
When you're that age and you're working overnight, you don't sleep no eight hours.

[01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:42.650]
When you're working at schedule, I'm just rounding up four.

[01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.390]
Well then we don't have to be afraid of saying that they really had a desperate situation there overnight.

[01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.730]
After that good start too, you know what a shame.

[01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:52.490]
And again you should take a message from there because they're like they know they're just in training.

[01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:54.510]
They got their training bras over to microphone.

[01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:56.590]
Too much ass talk.

[01:29:58.010 --> 01:30:01.730]
See I know this comes as a great shock to people who are considering themselves experts on radio,

[01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:03.210]
which usually are people who don't work in it.

[01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:05.290]
There's no such thing as shock radio.

[01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:08.270]
They never was in the first place, but if there ever was that's that's history.

[01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:09.730]
Nothing is shocking anymore.

[01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:13.870]
That's why you got assholes doing like opian anthony and not doing these things and getting camped

[01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:18.310]
because they're desperate to try to do something new and I'll rate them when trying to outrageous each other.

[01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.350]
So it's like Jackass on MTV.

[01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.090]
Same thing.

[01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.810]
See what?

[01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:23.770]
Talking about ass.

[01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:27.030]
I said Jackass not more ass.

[01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:29.810]
Anyway that's the bottom line.

[01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:32.030]
So the idea about a eating isn't so passe.

[01:30:32.650 --> 01:30:33.930]
It's like honey bears.

[01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:35.470]
It's like freaking honey bears.

[01:30:35.490 --> 01:30:36.830]
We backed into it one day.

[01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:38.290]
Yeah you backed into it all right.

[01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:39.390]
And it's the problem.

[01:30:39.610 --> 01:30:40.810]
It probably was Dwight's tongue.

[01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:43.970]
Senators question agents bad review.

[01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:46.470]
This really pisses me off from the Washington Post yesterday.

[01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:48.870]
Another one of my bedtime stories.

[01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:50.890]
It's enough to put me to bed under the covers.

[01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:57.310]
A Minneapolis FBI agent accused your colleagues of steaming antiphany crystal globe from the ruins of New York's World Trade Center

[01:30:57.310 --> 01:31:05.690]
was informed yesterday that her work was not satisfactory official said prompting two US senators to question whether the FBI was retaliating against a whistleblower.

[01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:09.490]
See them politicians they like a good blower but not a whistleblower.

[01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:13.570]
The agent Jane Turner a 24 year old FBI veteran,

[01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:21.510]
complaining letters to members of the Senate judiciary committee last month that she discovered they slightly damaged paperweight on a secretary's desk in the Minneapolis field orifice.

[01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:27.850]
She wrote that she believed the globe had been taken by an evidence recovery team from the rubble of ground zero after 9-11 terrorist attacks.

[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:38.390]
The allegations along with Turner's decision to announce the help of senators Charles Grassley and Patrick Leahy were an embarrassment for the FBI and had prompted an investigation by the Justice Department's Inspector General's orifice.

[01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:50.810]
The claims also caused the FBI's Minneapolis orifice to lose jurisdiction of an unrelated case that was run by Turner which sent an allegations that a Minnesota company was involved in thefts from World Trade Center rubble on a site in stat and island sources said.

[01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:56.530]
The Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA is handling that probe to avoid conflict of interest concerns.

[01:31:57.170 --> 01:32:07.810]
Yesterday Turner supervisor and former that her job performance does not meet expectations on a critical element which is the first step toward removal from the FBI according to Turner's Washington-based attorney and others from India with the case.

[01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:16.810]
The attorney Stephen Cohns that Turner's always received satisfactory reviews from the FBI in the past she believes that her role in calling attention to the globe theft is the reason for the poor review.

[01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:23.070]
How do you like that? They don't like the whistleblowers, maybe they'll destroy your life. She probably pretty soon become a person of interest.

[01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:25.130]
When you think?

[01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:26.330]
Already.

[01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:30.290]
White House downplays internet attack, read the sigh relief.

[01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:34.250]
And by the way tell Eric that he's not doing such a wonderful job getting those.

[01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:36.690]
He screwed up my statistics page something fierce.

[01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.250]
He doesn't seem to realize it. I study that thing religiously.

[01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:44.430]
Hey Eric, I'm a student of my statistics page.

[01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:45.450]
Yeah.

[01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:47.850]
So don't be dickin' to my get it back the way it used to be.

[01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.450]
Okay sweetheart?

[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:50.550]
In between feedings I'm sure you can find time.

[01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:52.650]
And we never had any problems before.

[01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:56.110]
It's been that way for how many years have we been doing this about 75 out of computer?

[01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:59.670]
Always looking to try to blame something that isn't the problem.

[01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:01.730]
Okay, you're trying to create problems where there aren't one Eric.

[01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:04.670]
I understand you're frustrated when you can't get your blood sugar below 600.

[01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:07.330]
I can relate to it, especially after those two cookies today.

[01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:08.730]
What do you do with the rest of them?

[01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:13.870]
The White House saw today to relate concerns about an unusual attack this week against the 13 computer servers

[01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:17.230]
that managed global internet traffic stressing that disruption was minimal

[01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:19.150]
and the FBI was working to trace the attackers.

[01:33:19.530 --> 01:33:22.310]
I don't care what you did with them. They weren't that the chocolate one was good,

[01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.970]
but there aren't any more of those. Damn it.

[01:33:24.970 --> 01:33:27.550]
Is that, is that probably Eric right there? Isn't that see what I'm saying?

[01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.510]
Tell him to calm down. Tell him just to get the guy.

[01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:32.330]
And also, why do you got him on there?

[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:34.870]
Tell him don't be concerning with Boca Bryan behind our back.

[01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:37.190]
Boca Bryan doesn't control what goes on with the show.

[01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:41.670]
Boca Bryan is not a decision maker. He's a bit maker and a good one too and a great guy.

[01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:43.150]
But he's not a decision maker.

[01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:47.390]
So don't be concerning with any right wing lunatic fringe groups based on Boca Bryan.

[01:33:47.690 --> 01:33:50.550]
In other words, if he can't get us to approve some sinister deed there,

[01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:54.150]
he's there calling on Boca Bryan to try. Boca Bryan can't approve his activities.

[01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:57.830]
Okay. Tell him if you don't watch it, we'll send a sick John Askrop down.

[01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:00.630]
They'll be on there. His ass likes stink on Mo.

[01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:05.410]
Most internet users didn't notice any effects from Monday's attack because it lasted only one hour

[01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:09.570]
because the internet's architecture was designed to tolerate such short-term disruptions experts said.

[01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:12.210]
The White House said it was unclear where the attack originated,

[01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.850]
who might be responsible, or whether the attack could be considered cyber terrorism.

[01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.350]
We don't know. They don't know anything.

[01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:21.470]
We'll take a look to see if there are any signs of who it may be or may not be.

[01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:24.710]
Folks, Minister of Information, Ari Flaascher said,

[01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:27.190]
I'm not aware there's anything that would lead anybody in that direction.

[01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:30.570]
History has shown that many of these attacks actually come from the hacker community,

[01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:31.830]
but that's why the best days in underway.

[01:34:32.130 --> 01:34:33.790]
They don't know. It might be this. It might be that.

[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:35.710]
Osama might be dead. He might be alive.

[01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:39.330]
Stephen Hatville might be a person of interest. He might not be so interested.

[01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:44.030]
The anthrax guy might be domestic. It might be foreign. It might be terrorism. It might be who knows.

[01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:47.550]
Like Harry Currier would say, it might be. It could be. And look at him. He now he's dead.

[01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:53.550]
Very sad. Very, very sad. You're choked up about it.

[01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:56.470]
What is he giving you a song in advance? Okay.

[01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:58.730]
I don't know. What do you grabber now? What do you grabber?

[01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:02.310]
How come he didn't invite me to the arosmith concert that dickhead?

[01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:06.750]
I'm sure because it was a coral sky and he knew what the answer is.

[01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:09.150]
You know something? He did not know what the answer would be.

[01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:11.950]
Arosmith, you don't think I'd drive up to West Palm to see Arosmith?

[01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:12.430]
No. You're right.

[01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:17.230]
I don't know. I'm not into concerts. There's a bunch of drugies there.

[01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:21.070]
Now the Baxbury boys concert that was in the rain. It was promised by pneumonia.

[01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.630]
But it's still had its moment. It had its moment. It's glorious moment.

[01:35:25.690 --> 01:35:29.210]
But nevertheless, I wouldn't go back up there if he paid me by the minute.

[01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:32.610]
That is the worst goddamn play. Go on a see a concert in a cow pasture.

[01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.210]
It's one thing if it's up there in there. You know, he's living in a past.

[01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:36.990]
Woodstock. That's what he's living in.

[01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.230]
You didn't have the seats when you weren't.

[01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:43.410]
But it's in a cow pasture. What do you mean does it have seats?

[01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:46.530]
I know it has seats. It has seats out in the middle of the pouring rain.

[01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:49.330]
Even the Greeks were going to be the shelter. I thought I was safe.

[01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:51.130]
Yeah, shelter. They poured water on it.

[01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:53.890]
Oh, and speaking of Gimmi's shelter, the stones. How was that concert, dude?

[01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:55.910]
And you know, Jeff Cohen wanted me to go to that?

[01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:56.870]
Yeah, I know.

[01:35:57.190 --> 01:35:58.170]
What is wrong with him?

[01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:02.030]
I'm not into being all drugged up, boozed up.

[01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.130]
I'm not into going to stupid concerts with a bunch of sloppy drunk,

[01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:07.170]
slavinly people. That sounds wonderful.

[01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:09.650]
No, it does not sound like a great time.

[01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.950]
Drugged up, boozed up, locked in slavinly.

[01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:11.910]
But not slavinly.

[01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:15.790]
They were hot and great like that one fine young man at the back street voice concert.

[01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:18.430]
We decided that the rainy was going to take almost all his clothes off out there.

[01:36:19.230 --> 01:36:22.010]
In fact, let's go back there again and sin. We live that moment, okay?

[01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:25.410]
We'll check ID just to make sure. But I think it was okay.

[01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:29.290]
Nine before one. Oh, and yesterday I'm watching L. Presidente Oner.

[01:36:29.370 --> 01:36:31.130]
Did you see me yesterday afternoon when he was doing this thing about...

[01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:31.730]
Hey, don't.

[01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:32.810]
...porn on the internet.

[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:33.630]
And you see that thing?

[01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:34.950]
No. And how they got to crack down.

[01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:37.110]
And he was going on this emotional thing about...

[01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:38.770]
And he's almost...

[01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:40.490]
Is that inarticulous, the moosey man.

[01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:41.690]
It's very scary.

[01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:44.730]
And I was thinking with the two of them in charge, we had to feel real safe.

[01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:48.250]
But he was going on about how we have to protect children all costs.

[01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.850]
And I was asking myself,

[01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:51.830]
does that include these pedophile freets, by the way?

[01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:53.750]
Which I know, does he don't make any more mention of that?

[01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:58.210]
He made a very brief peripheral mention months ago when I was hot news,

[01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:59.790]
you know, before all this other stuff started.

[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:02.470]
Probably got a call from his brother saying, hey, watch it, Jack.

[01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:03.190]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:07.010]
Take that goddamn rosary beat and stick it right up your butt.

[01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:09.250]
You'll have anal butt beads if you don't watch it.

[01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.030]
Well, speaking of Jeff Cohen,

[01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:13.470]
8-B4-1 at 560 WQM.

[01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:16.810]
Let me tell you about a great place to take care of your feet, your tootsies.

[01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:18.050]
And that's Brandy's and Pomato Beach.

[01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.850]
There are two great things in Pomato Beach.

[01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.370]
Pomato Park and Pomato and Brandy's shoes.

[01:37:23.490 --> 01:37:25.210]
Is there anything else that's great in Pomato Beach?

[01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:26.610]
Well, win more.

[01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:31.750]
Anyway, get over to Brandy's and get you some of the top name brand shoes in the universe.

[01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:35.190]
Rockports, SAS, Spirit, Timberland, Naturalizer, and lots more.

[01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:37.770]
And believe me, they got exactly what you're looking for in your size

[01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.470]
because they have an unbeatable selection.

[01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:41.490]
They got salespeople that know your feet inside and out.

[01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:43.210]
And they have unbeatable prices.

[01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:44.430]
That's the bottom line.

[01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:48.110]
Brandy's is open every day of your life from 9 to 9 every Sunday 10 to 5.

[01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:50.950]
And you'll find them at a great location where they've been for a long, long,

[01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:54.270]
for a coon's age, 12, 19, or a federal highway in Pomato Beach.

[01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:58.230]
Like I said, for price selection and service, Brandy's always is unbeatable.

[01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.610]
And all this week for the second week of the row, the special goes on.

[01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:02.430]
Thank you, Troy. Pund your guts out.

[01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:04.930]
All this week at Brandy's Rockports are on sale.

[01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:09.290]
Men's boaches are only $44.90 and men's pro walkers only $49.90.

[01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.830]
Only this week at Brandy's in Pomato Beach.

[01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:13.730]
Slide in local.

[01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:15.610]
Here's sports video 560's.

[01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:16.590]
You ain't.

[01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:17.950]
You ain't.

[01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:20.370]
Have a penis.

[01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:21.550]
I've never had one.

[01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:22.170]
I swear.

[01:38:28.130 --> 01:38:30.870]
They want us to find a way.

[01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:40.430]
They reimbursed for back pay from 200 years ago when they were slaves.

[01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:48.670]
When I only have a mobile home, a pickle and a pinch of skull.

[01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:54.070]
So if you wanna ask me how, here's what I gotta say.

[01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:59.610]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:03.990]
You're telling that you're sorry for its slave of the mong.

[01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:07.710]
Kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:11.970]
And that forever money to his dead end call.

[01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:16.970]
If I was born in 1802,

[01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:20.890]
Oh, it's like saying something I do.

[01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.490]
But what were dead people dead to you?

[01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.510]
I have to take the plane.

[01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:31.810]
When you see it all for an old money act.

[01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:35.290]
With a can of spallet cherry intact,

[01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:38.910]
Instead of 40 acres and a mule,

[01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:40.710]
I have a better way.

[01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:46.230]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:50.530]
When born on how we fare a forgatraiment to.

[01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:54.290]
Kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:39:55.130 --> 01:39:58.570]
And that's your restitution for its slave of you.

[01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.430]
Kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:40:02.710 --> 01:40:03.170]
Oh, right.

[01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:06.670]
If you're telling that you're sorry for its slave of the mong.

[01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:10.430]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:14.730]
And that forever money to his dead end call.

[01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.010]
Two minutes to one at five sixty W.D.C.

[01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.770]
Am I telling you one thing?

[01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:22.450]
I'm watching a little bit more here on the snipers on these two scumbags.

[01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:25.470]
Everything that all these talking heads said.

[01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:26.950]
Everything was all wrong.

[01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:27.350]
Right.

[01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:29.950]
There wasn't one single point that any of them had right.

[01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:32.790]
Neither one of these that were trained as a sniper.

[01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:33.550]
That's number one.

[01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:35.970]
And we could go down a whole list.

[01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:37.870]
There was nothing that they had that it was accurate.

[01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:42.710]
And as far as being clever and devious and it.

[01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.250]
All I can say is where is the moosey man?

[01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:48.050]
You notice we haven't seen him yet at all today.

[01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:48.610]
The moosey man.

[01:40:48.610 --> 01:40:49.590]
He's probably exhausted.

[01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:53.210]
And plus he has to take them English refresher courses.

[01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:56.170]
I don't want to say he's inarticular.

[01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:57.850]
That could be a good pull question one day.

[01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:58.850]
Who's more inarticular?

[01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:00.870]
El Presidente or the moosey man?

[01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.030]
That's a tough battle.

[01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:04.890]
I see very little difference.

[01:41:04.890 --> 01:41:06.050]
Except the ears.

[01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:10.710]
Why were George's rating so putrid the summer we asked?

[01:41:11.010 --> 01:41:12.010]
So damn weak.

[01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:14.570]
595 votes.

[01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:17.030]
You came close to six hundred votes during the course of the show,

[01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.630]
which is almost unprecedented.

[01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:20.450]
His shows are boring.

[01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:21.090]
128.

[01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:22.010]
I love George.

[01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:22.610]
114.

[01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:23.870]
That's 19.1%.

[01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:25.410]
That's pretty good.

[01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:26.970]
His show blows 111.

[01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:29.830]
And 1319.1 is a lot better than 4.5%.

[01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:31.330]
Oh, the moe mighter.

[01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:33.590]
The moe mighter sucked the big one yesterday, man.

[01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:35.310]
His show blows 111.

[01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.890]
Moe is a brutal lead in 76.

[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:38.930]
Oh, I never knew if the true word's been spoken.

[01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:41.570]
And not just a brutal lead in no lead in.

[01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:44.230]
We could have like the test pattern on for three hours

[01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:45.450]
and probably have it a better number.

[01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.790]
He's an anti-semitic little spec 36.

[01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:49.410]
Too much ass talk 35.

[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.570]
He can't compete with Howard Spurm 26.

[01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:53.230]
It was Miguel's fault 25.

[01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.130]
Can't compete with Howard or Rice 23.

[01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:56.890]
He's a mumble 11.

[01:41:57.450 --> 01:41:58.370]
Can't compete with Rush 10.

[01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:02.430]
Man, the pressure I just, you can almost smell it.

[01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:04.430]
Bye, bye, bye!

[01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:06.930]
The middle rush is show on 5.6.

[01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:09.210]
In QA, I'm playing for Lardale.

[01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:11.190]
I picked a bad date of quitsniff and glude.
