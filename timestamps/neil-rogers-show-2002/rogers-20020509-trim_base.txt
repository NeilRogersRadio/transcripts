[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060]
Now the Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM.

[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.300]
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy.

[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.560]
You'll see the movie, listen to the soundtrack,

[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840]
wear the t-shirt, and read the comic book.

[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.160]
And now, just in time for Father's Day,

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.420]
you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie,

[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.240]
the soundtrack, the t-shirt, and the comic book.

[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.240]
New Dick Tracy Cologne.

[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.060]
Why smell like other guys?

[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.480]
Now you can smell like Dick.

[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.500]
Oh, right.

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.520]
Never watched his hair or seem to have a car, Kobe.

[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.220]
His name was Kurt.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.500]
Now he's pushing up dirt, Kobe.

[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.400]
Oh, right.

[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.440]
Wiping drew from his chin, doing heroin, Kobe.

[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.620]
Nirvana was hot, and now it's Kurt.

[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.440]
They ain't got Kobe.

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.880]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.500]
Kobe.

[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.960]
Made a million an hour, never took a shower, Kobe.

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.940]
He's a number one hit in Heavens, Big Mach Pit, Kobe.

[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.900]
He'll be Elvis the King, and say grunge with my thing, Kobe.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.260]
Kurt.

[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.900]
So with your fill without, don't take Kurt's way out, Kobe.

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.220]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.

[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.940]
Kobe.

[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.960]
It is punk yesterday, Luke John Matthew Mark, and whatever Paul Walker, Linde Hut Helder.

[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060]
He was wearing a Kurt Cobain t-shirt when he arrested him, and he said, yeah, just like that.

[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.200]
I don't want to try to oversimplify anything, but the problem in the world is that there are just too many assholes who don't know right from wrong.

[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.300]
Just basic simple things, like right from wrong.

[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.360]
We're not talking about religion, about the Ten Commandments, because that doesn't seem to be working too well.

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.320]
Just basic common sense things, you know, like you don't kill people for starters.

[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.640]
You don't put pipe bombs in people's mailboxes, and the best part of the deal is this kid is such a symbol, and in spite of the fact everybody said, oh, he was so sweet and such a wonderful young man.

[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.820]
He told one of the arresting cops that he wanted to, he was trying to put the bombs in a pattern, a pattern of homes and states that when he finished, would resemble a happy face.

[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.160]
Cute. Yeah. A happy face. Yeah.

[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.520]
And they said when he arrested him, he seemed amused and carefree, and if you see the pictures they keep showing on TV every five seconds over and over again, as they're putting them in a car, he like as soon as he sees the cameras there.

[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.980]
Big joke. 21-year-old Simpleton who doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.

[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.760]
Seemed to have an epidemic of that. Last night after the hockey game, nice going there, by the way, Maple Leaf.

[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:38.720]
What I tell you, Pat, you predicted it yesterday. No, I did not predict that. See you wrong. I said whoever wins a game tonight will win the series. See, you better keep up on these things. Start taking notes. You're going to too many of those baseball games, rotting your mind with that crap with that direct that nobody cares about. But anyway, 6,900 people are last night.

[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.800]
And Pat says there must have really been at least 5,500. And that's pretty damn good on a weeknight.

[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.780]
I can just imagine going to a Panther game and seeing 5,500 people in that arena. You just pee in your pants. It's inconceivable. And nobody there cares about hockey.

[00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:06.140]
So if they're drawn like, you know, they're usual 11 or 12 or 13,000, you can just imagine how many people really care about that baseball team. But it sure takes up a lot of airtime and a station. I'll say that. But anyway, on all the shows, I should point out, except this one, because nobody cares.

[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:35.120]
So last night on a biography on A&E, they showed that Pam Smart Bitch and those three kids that killed her husband. Yep. And again, I keep thinking to myself. And they show that one, that real ugly one that she was a banging, whatever the hell is name was the one that was 15 when she was banging. At least take somebody that looks good. Okay, Pam, but she didn't. Of course, she didn't look all that good anyway. But she looked like a female Maddie Bell when you come right down to it. And I'm looking at these kids and I'm thinking to myself again. Don't you know the basic difference between right and wrong.

[00:04:35.120 --> 00:05:00.240]
No, you don't kill somebody. I mean, if it's in self defense, if they send you off the ward to kill the enemy, the evil doers, that's one thing. But you just don't kill people. Well, the 10 commandments, the good books said, well, like I said, they've been working too good because all those religious assholes. They've been killing each other since the beginning of recorded time. And of course, CNN breathlessly last night, gave us the word that, oh, that confrontation of standoff and Bethlehem was over. They're going to be coming out any second. And then they were hugging and kissing and oh, yeah, it's all over now. Guess what?

[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.760]
But not a little hang up. See, when you get the Israelis and the Palestinians together, there isn't anything that can't screw up. They could even screw up a Passover sater, even when it's Jesus was at.

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.800]
So they just couldn't get it right. In fact, you heard it like I told you before the show. There was one voice came from inside that church. And the guy said, just when we thought we were out and you know the rest of that. No, how does it go?

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.860]
It goes like, yeah, holy crap. We're not getting out. Well, there it's still in limbo. They're still working on that.

[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:38.300]
So you know, it's amazing to talk about psychic abilities again. The story that you just facts me that somebody sent from CNN about the heresy Irish priest. Yes, I had that was my first thing I had sitting right here. How do you like that?

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.100]
Oh, shocking. And Irish priest who was repeatedly stating he doesn't believe Jesus Christ with a son of God has resigned.

[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:53.900]
Anybody out there believe Jesus Christ was a son of God? No, anybody believe those fairy tales? Sure was a snappy dresser though. The resignation of Reverend Andrew Foulong 54.

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:04.940]
But this is pretty good right after the Kentucky Derby. But this is only one for long who was facing a church trial for heresy was accepted by church of Ireland Bishop Richard Clark Church official said yesterday. But it church seems to be having a lot of problems.

[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.020]
You know what? A lot of which we've only got about 6,000 of those stories today.

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:17.680]
Foulong's been unrepentant in the face of a furor sparked by his controversial views and is restated and repeatedly in emails sent to journalists and articles published on the internet Reuters news agency.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.260]
He repeated them again in article for new Irish pages. Journal will be published today. The Irish Times newspaper saved.

[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.720]
Foulong startled worshipers when his unconventional views on traditional Christian teachings were aired in articles published on his website.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.900]
I don't believe the traditional understanding of Christmas that God took human form and was born as a babe and Bethlehem. He told Reuters an interview last December.

[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.040]
So what have they gotten all been about about that church anyway? The church and the activity. There was no savior born in that church. In fact, I probably would nobody born in that church.

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:54.600]
But they sure have a lot of interesting get-sches with some snappy outfits in that place. Foulong 54 who was ordained in the Anglican Church of Ireland in the early 70s as said he has held his unorthodox beliefs for more than 30 years.

[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.140]
But hadn't shared them previously with his parish news church officials have declined to comment further.

[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:07.860]
Gee, that line just keeps popping up in every store we get. Everybody's mum. Well, let's see, we had a pool. I told yesterday this was not going to go over that big. They didn't like yesterday's pool.

[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.300]
And you want to know why? What did I tell you? A lot of it was too dated. Yeah.

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.880]
Hey, are you old far? So I want to talk about Captain Marvel. We don't know from that. And you're right. You're right. But you know something. What's wrong with once in a great while as old far? It's having a little fun. Nothing.

[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:34.240]
Which was your all time favorite cartoon or comic book action figure we asked over 900 votes on the survey and the survey said Superman. Oh, 240. I played that enough yesterday. I'm not going to slip that back out again. 240 winning hands down.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.140]
And the good news is that the top three came out just the way we anticipated that man who was like fell to third for a little while.

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:59.300]
Everybody climbed right back up that bad pool got back up in a second with 152 Spider-Man 137. The Hulk 49 wonder woman only 39. It was kind of weak poor Linda Carter. Nobody cares about her anymore. Silver surfer, which I have no idea what that is. 31. Yeah, you know what it is? Well, yeah, that was a late fact.

[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:07.860]
So I wrote them on the sheet before it faxed to Eric. He's a galactic. He surfs around on a surfboard and he's silver. It was big.

[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:18.440]
Dick Tracy 27 Captain American 22 space ghost had 21 green lantern. Another one I never heard of was tied with flash Gordon with 18 and the tick head 18.

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:29.080]
The flash head 17 Captain Marvel and the green hair net each had 16 Iron Man had 15 plastic man, which I voted for at only 14. That's that's not acceptable. That's a very low number for plastic man.

[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:39.020]
The fandom had 11 Aquaman 10 daredevil 9 supergl 8 ghost rider 5 Prince Vadion 5 Superboy 1 up with 2 with a pair. Superboy had a big pair and green arrow head only one.

[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.460]
So that's where it came out 900 plus votes, which is not that bad. But you could tell he just didn't have their heart in it yesterday. You know, it was just not up their alley.

[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:57.540]
There was nothing for them to monkey round with either. Here's our pool today, Eric. And it's similar to ones we've taken before, but I think in honor of Luke Helder, John Paul Matthew and whatever the other ones are.

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.940]
Isn't that interesting that he's got like such a religious name to you know, he's got all the apostles in there as many as they could jam in.

[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.440]
Too bad he wasn't his spatic. He could add a few more men there. He could have one of those, you know, eight part names, right?

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:14.620]
Three last names and a couple of days and does in there. So here's our pool today, Eric. Who would you most like to pull the switch on?

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:21.360]
Now see, last time we took a pool similar to this. All it was different, but you know, along the same lines, people pissed off out of their scumbag.

[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:31.220]
We took OJ out of there. I don't want to take away their fun. You want to know why one of the greatest outlets that the people are soft, Florida have and the people of America have is like, you know, doing their thing with OJ.

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:40.500]
Let's get him. Let's pull the switch. I'd pull the switch. I don't know, problem. Also he's on there, but also we got a very good list. I think today. Andrea Yates, Robert Blake and George is absolutely not.

[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:52.360]
George is still working on that statue. Susan Smith. See, the problem with this is they're not going to remember some of these people. Susan Smith, who drowned her two kids in a car because they were in the way of her affair trailer trash Susan Smith in South Carolina.

[00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:03.760]
The fact that she's still alive really frost my ass and Pamela smart, who I wouldn't put on her except I saw that thing on biography last night. Pamela smart, who had the affair with a 15 year old kid. She was a school teacher. He was a student.

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:15.720]
And then she enticed the three kids to kill her husband convincing the so she can get the insurance money number one and convincing the one kid that that was the way they could continue their affair and live happily ever after if they got her husband on the way. And so they shot him. They shot his ass.

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:31.240]
Interesting enough and watching the and watching at the trial, the segments they had on biography last night, the kid who did the shooting, the boyfriend. Yes. He started out with had a big, a huge kitchen knife and the prosecutor asked him, well, how come you didn't go through with it?

[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.900]
And of course he's crying and doing the thing with a clean X and having nervous breakdown. Well, I just couldn't get myself to do it. But of course a gun.

[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.860]
There's so much cleaner and neater and so much easier. You know, sure, no must know.

[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.060]
So thank God that John Ascroft and this administration is gun loving guns, squeezing gun toning. We'll get to that story a little later on.

[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:55.900]
Have even more reinforced that second end of bull crap about the right to a bear arms and people are up in arms about that. Anybody with a brain except a quest for Glenn and Miramar.

[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:04.400]
Go buy some more Glenn. Get some more. Of course, Luke Skywalker. He had a few guns on him and six more bombs to anyway, Pamela smart Luke Helder the mailbox bomber.

[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.480]
We better put that in parentheses. You're nobody know who that is and John Walker. Lined. There's a thing that's pretty good list. Sure.

[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.680]
Am I leaving anybody out who's obvious?

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:20.760]
Thinkin. I mean Paul and he was obvious to but he's dead. Who would you like to most pull the switch on? OJ and Reates Robert Blake Susan Smith, Pamela smart.

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:27.020]
Luke Helder the mailbox bomber. We better put that in parentheses or John Walker. Lined. That's come back from Afghanistan.

[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:33.240]
Of course, so abused by our government and treated so poorly. I say, you know, give me nice shaving a bath and then blow his brains out.

[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.960]
913 at 560 WQM summertime is already arrived early in South Florida. Man, it's how it's going to be 90 again today.

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don

[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:47.180]
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.520]
Orlando Man and Teen Boy in the death of Annamaria Angel.

[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.740]
The indictment charges each one with one kind of first-of-be murder, one kind of attempted

[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.940]
first-of-be murder, and one kind of sexual battery-slash armed gang rape, and two counts each

[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.800]
of robbery with a firearm and kidnapping with a weapon.

[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.220]
I think we'd all like to get together and pull the switch on them.

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.880]
Together.

[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.560]
The four men Victor Manuel Carbio, 34, his brother Hector Manuel Carbio, 30, Cesar Antonio

[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.380]
Mena, 22, and Joel G. Libron, 23, continue to be held without bond, thank goodness, in

[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.160]
the Dave County jail.

[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.740]
A judge has said, May 20th, the arrangements for Mena, Libron, and Hector Carbio, Victor

[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.920]
Carbio, will be arraigned on May 21th.

[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.300]
Just have a fast trial, that's all I say.

[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.120]
Fast trial, get it over with, and then, you know what we do with the rest.

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.540]
I think it's time to bring back Old Sparky, what do you say?

[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.820]
I don't want to sound like one of those real heavy-duty, gun-hoed, capital punishment people

[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.900]
because that makes you sound like some right-wing lunatic.

[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.720]
But what it does boil down to is that we're pissed off.

[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.640]
You know, pissed off gets me fired up when I hear that.

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.880]
And I think that this lethal injection is a little bit too, it's too sanitary, you know?

[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.920]
It's too medicinal, too antiseptic.

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.700]
You like to see them shimmer and shake?

[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.560]
Yeah!

[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.840]
We like to know that Old Sparky's going off.

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.240]
You see those, what was your movie?

[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.820]
They made a million of them.

[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.960]
No, no, you know the one I'm talking about.

[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.900]
The black guy that they fried, the green mile.

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.100]
Is that the one?

[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:00.960]
It was not the green mile.

[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.540]
I didn't think he would have seen that.

[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.340]
No, with Kevin Costner, whatever his name is.

[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:05.780]
Costner.

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.400]
Costner.

[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.760]
See, I can't even think of his name, I can't thank Kevin Costner.

[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.740]
No, he was in it.

[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.320]
And some big black guy, they fried in the South.

[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.500]
And anyway, you didn't hear him the movie I'm talking about?

[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:15.740]
No.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.380]
Well, somebody will, somebody will fax in.

[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.980]
They'll call in because Pat is absolutely not going to talk to you.

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.740]
He's not got no interest.

[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.900]
In fact, Pat begged me to play the old Bob Coulwood at least a second goal from last night

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.820]
because he was busy watching some stupid baseball game.

[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]
It's a pass to the corner.

[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.980]
Right in the head of his man, Carter.

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.940]
Holly is over there.

[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.040]
Arbor is in on him.

[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.760]
Ronald has it behind the neck.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.020]
Ronald is up front trying to jam it in.

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.640]
He's going.

[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.180]
Ronald has tried to jam it in on the back.

[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520]
It's a second goal of the game.

[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.680]
And it's a two on the board.

[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.440]
You're on the left.

[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.760]
Always love the Alan McCauley.

[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:50.620]
Not.

[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.100]
Well, hey, listen, it goes to show you when you're playing on the first line, instead on the fourth line,

[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.360]
your ability has actually come out.

[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.040]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.640]
Probably not.

[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.000]
Sorry.

[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.060]
Now let's get down to the meat of the matter.

[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.560]
As long as we're taking this pool on this,

[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.600]
and I know it sounds very simplistic, but let me say it again.

[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.260]
Just I want you to soak this in, okay?

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.320]
Very simple.

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.260]
Nothing complicated.

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:07.880]
Nothing.

[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.340]
You're not doing a good job of teaching your kids right from wrong.

[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.400]
You can go back to every one of these horrible, horrible, grotesque stories.

[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.820]
You can look at those suicide homicide bombers there in the Middle East.

[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.660]
You can look at what's happening all over the world.

[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.480]
And somewhere along the line, we're not doing a real good job.

[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.460]
Not a very effective job of teaching people the basic differences between right and wrong.

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.300]
We're not talking about absolute rights and absolute wrongs, but just plain common sense.

[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.760]
Common sense.

[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.620]
We don't have any common sense.

[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.780]
And this kid with these pipe bombs who had people crappin' in their pants all over the country,

[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.120]
especially male carriers, and people who were living in rural areas in the Midwest waiting to see

[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.280]
if they're going to get their hands or heads blown off when they opened up the mailbox,

[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.020]
he thought he was on a lark.

[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.500]
He thought he was having a great old time.

[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.580]
It was a hoot.

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.360]
Yeah, real hoot in a holler.

[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.320]
And when he talked to his parents on the phone yesterday morning for ten minutes,

[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.660]
he said, he asked them, oh, you think I'm going to spend jail time for this?

[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.600]
Oh, no, it only sounds like 18 counts of attempted murder to meet Luke Skywalker.

[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.480]
You think I'm going to spend any jail time for this?

[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.780]
Smart ass punks.

[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.540]
That's what we're dealing with in America, boys and girls.

[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.680]
Smart ass punks.

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.240]
You don't know the difference between right and wrong.

[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.540]
Like the ones who get on the, by the way, how about that stock market up?

[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:17.760]
Oh!

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.300]
You don't think it's going to happen again today, do you?

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:19.600]
No.

[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.520]
Do I dare turn that on for even just one second or they're in a spot right now?

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.560]
Just to see those futures.

[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.240]
Then I'll turn it off real quick, I promise.

[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.460]
You see how it wound up?

[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.180]
That one up to zero.

[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.340]
I know.

[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.880]
I know.

[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.180]
That one up 305 points and then I asked that 122.

[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.500]
Oh!

[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.660]
If we can just repeat that every day for the next six years, I might get my money back.

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.740]
It was a lot of other poor bastards out there too.

[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.020]
I can't, you know something, I can't even imagine.

[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.100]
For the life of me, I can't out imagine.

[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:44.760]
What?

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.420]
The people who had their life savings in like Enron.

[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.660]
And then some of those other high-flyer stocks that turned out to be like worthless.

[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.400]
Right.

[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.940]
The ones that were like 150 and 200 bucks a share during that bubble just getting blown up.

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.440]
And then they just, they did blow up.

[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.040]
They just thought, yes, the bottom fell out.

[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.080]
And all those people got nothing.

[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.840]
You work all your life and those people are now going to say, well, I've got to work another 20 years.

[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.320]
I'm only 75, but working another 20 years because all my return money is gone.

[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.460]
Makes me want to cry.

[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.680]
I know, it doesn't make me want to cry.

[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.020]
It makes me very, very angry.

[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.600]
It makes me wonder how to help people can be so passive about getting ripped off like that.

[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.100]
It makes you understand why they keep sending all their goddamn money.

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.920]
It makes you understand why people keep going back to church every Sunday.

[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.460]
So I'm going to tell you, you know, this business about why, you know, if you do drugs, you're supporting terrorism.

[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.160]
I'm going to tell you something right now that's beyond a shadow of a doubt.

[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.580]
If you go to church on Sunday, is Catholic Church is what I'm talking about.

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.700]
And you put money in a collection plate, you're contributing to this ongoing problem.

[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.960]
You're supporting a corrupt institution.

[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.060]
You're lending your tangible support to a corrupt, grotesque, child molesting institution.

[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.960]
That's what you're doing.

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.940]
And the best part of the whole deal is that in spite of the fact that donations are down,

[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.140]
there still are a ton of people, a smettload of people, given a smettload of money.

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.300]
I don't understand that.

[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.300]
It goes to show you how brainwashed, how deeply inculcated they are with this horse crap.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.140]
That's a good word.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.080]
I love inculcated. That's one of my favorite, what does it mean?

[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:06.780]
I don't know.

[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.200]
Sound good though.

[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.300]
I love it. I'd like to see if I could spell it.

[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.700]
Yeah, I could.

[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.880]
Pretty good spell, or I don't know what any of the words mean, but I spell them real good.

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.540]
926 at 560.

[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.800]
I like the tone of the show today.

[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.280]
You know what? I just like the tone of the show.

[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.760]
I don't know why I just have that feeling.

[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.900]
Maybe because I didn't eat any goddamn nestles, turtler, any crap yesterday.

[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.060]
I'm off all life crap.

[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.240]
Okay.

[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.320]
Wonderful talking about it.

[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.880]
It's a lot of fun.

[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.840]
I can't do that.

[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.660]
I just can't keep doing that.

[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.400]
Don't die.

[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.980]
Because I saw Mary Tyler Moore on King last night for about three seconds while I was channel surfing.

[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.580]
And you know, she's diabetic, but I think she's type one.

[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.140]
But she was talking about diabetes now.

[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.520]
Orondis it isn't about how the blood vessels in your eyes start leaking blood.

[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.840]
You know, when you're, uh, is she, uh, they found out she was diabetic when she was pregnant.

[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.920]
They put her in a hospital.

[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.220]
Her blood sugar was 750.

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.140]
I don't even know what that means.

[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.720]
750 when normal is like between 75 and 130.

[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:54.940]
750?

[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.640]
That's like sugar like.

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.360]
God.

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.020]
Yeah, it's like having sugar in your veins.

[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.140]
It's like eating that nestle.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.900]
He's turtler ice cream.

[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.300]
Hey, listen, if your hair is gone down the drain, here's the answer for you.

[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.160]
Boy, there's so many different things you can do.

[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.480]
Everybody in their brother saw all kinds of pills and they saw all kinds of mousey looking hair pieces.

[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.420]
If you know what?

[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.160]
You know, I'm not going to tell you what.

[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.540]

Today along the way to Luxus Blvdab, a house full of

[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:56.360]
wants to know your name

[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.740]
Neil Rogers God what kind of a father was Robert Blake not your average mother

[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.840]
What is that mean I was frightened and

[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:17.120]
Constantly in a fetal position was really horrible was he ever violent with you?

[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:17.640]
Yes

[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:24.840]
Absolutely, do you think there is any way that your father might have committed this crime or ordered this

[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.220]
time to be committed? Yes, has your father said to you? I'm guilty

[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.180]
Yeah, did he?

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.660]
Daddy's guilty. Is that correct?

[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:41.340]
Absolutely I have assigned piece of paper from him that says he did it and my father is severely guilty

[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.160]
And a worst part of the deal is he's long got one vote

[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.500]
He's tied for last with pan smart on our survey

[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:54.020]
We got 136 votes who would you more like to pull a switch on and a good old Bobby Blake and Pan Smarty

[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:58.940]
And I think you brainwashed the audience George with all that crap about the bitch had it coming the bitch had it coming and

[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.700]
Luke Helder the mailbox bomber that we've been talking a lot about today

[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.700]
He's only got four votes

[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:09.660]
I guarantee you that if he wouldn't have been planting his damn mailbox bombs out there in the Midwest and in Texas

[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:15.300]
And all those places distant from South Florida if he would have put him like in Perine and plantation in high Alia and in a

[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.760]
Fort Lauderdale and people would have been a crap and their pants about opening up their mailbox again and people would have

[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.340]
There are hands and heads maybe blown off. I guarantee you'd have more than four votes

[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:29.240]
See, but it's kind of a distant thing. He right nearly as exciting as alien in addition to which he's like, you know

[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:33.380]
He's harmless looking. He's like a nerdy looking. He looks like a nerd a nebish

[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.760]
Exactly couldn't have said a better myself like I said a nerd and

[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.680]
Probably smoked too much bad pot. Just look normal. I normally can't same thing smoke too much bad pot

[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.720]
There's a good lesson for all you kids

[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.560]
You're gonna start doing a lot of unacceptable things and destroy your life

[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:51.000]
So smoke some good pot that's the message on the meal Roger show if you're gonna smoke some wacky weed get some good crap

[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]
Georgia hook you up. No, I won't

[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.780]
Tom O.J. Simpson might give him some good numbers

[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.260]
Just like I can't what his bookies give him good numbers in fact when he heard Georgia's cell phone rang during the middle of the show

[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.700]
It's thanks bookie

[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.920]
When you know how we get how we get the faxes from the sports nerds all the time

[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:08.260]
We also get the bookies calling our cell phones, which really pisses me off

[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:12.360]
Oh, I'd rather hear from them to you Lenny now see O.J. Will win this hands down

[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.980]
But like I said, I put them on here so that a lot of people don't feel like they've had their their venue

[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:23.380]
They're taken away from the new to watch you whatever they want a vent they hate you like poison O.J. Go away

[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.560]
Move to Mississippi. Okay, go to Alabama with a banjo on your knee. Just get that out of here

[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.060]
We can't stand you about the only guy likes you is Roy

[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:34.900]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if even Phyllis and Scrooner getting a little sour on that piece of Drek all the way down it

[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.200]
I guess well, so this is a big fan I

[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:45.280]
Somebody that hates you loves O.J. Remember that call for him it break H.U. I just I don't want to bring up all the open up old wounds again

[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:55.840]
But the disgraceful chapter in a long long sad saga of the Q.A.M. Deal O.J. 55 Susan Smith 23 and creates 21 John Walker Limp 14 father

[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:03.300]
Shanley 11 father Gagan 10 Luke a hell there only four in Panis Martin Bobby Blake like I certainly want a piece as far as we

[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:09.840]
Love to pull the switch on well here's some good stuff. Okay for those of you slabs out there like me group fights for your right to eat that

[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.460]
Fatty burger all right always getting all these other groups these goody two shoes groups

[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.680]
And I think a lot of people are getting sick and tired of them because I know every time I mentioned about this is bad

[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.620]
For you and about diabetes and stuff the audience starts going into a coma. They don't want to hear that they want to be encouraged

[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.000]
Eat crap they like crap don't you agree?

[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.600]
You're right. Nobody wants to like somebody preach

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.560]
Don't want to hear about in summary and artichoke want to know what about good does it have a split?

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:40.220]
It's a field. You know right. They want to eat some good taste and crap a lot of fat dripping down their fat fingers and sugar onto their shirt

[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.020]
Like fat rich with a showing at least that way you can see what they had for lunch when they're wearing it on their shirt

[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.800]
You talk about wearing your feelings on your sleeve. We're talking about wearing your meals on your on the around your public

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.000]
Like a menu. Yeah like a road map to what I ate today

[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.660]
In fact, when surprised me if Eric sitting up there probably in his t-shirt and shorts up there in Orlando

[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.460]
He's probably sitting there were like several. I don't even want to think about it

[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:09.680]
Several remnants from this morning's breakfasts. There are groups in Washington lobbying for the environment for the environment in

[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:16.920]
Dangerous species public health and hundreds of other causes, but who looks out for junk food a group called the Center for consumer freedom is taken up the

[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.800]
Cause a coalition of more than 30,000 restaurant and tavern owners is standing tall and defensive fattening food

[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.880]
It's motto protecting personal responsibility and protecting consumer choice

[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:34.080]
The Center which was set up in 1995 sees itself on the front lines of the battle to defend Americans right to gorge on artery clogging burgers

[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.740]
Explorge on a waistline expanding doughnuts and guzzle liver hardening alcohol. Oh, it's big and doughnuts. Guess what they got up here now crispy cream

[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.620]
That's all you need. No, I have I have not had anything

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:50.700]
Yeah, I can't leave the only three the group is stepped up its efforts beginning with an advertising blin some Washington's radio airwaves

[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:59.120]
It says if hears government meddling in America's diets through the imposition of fat taxes on foods ranging from fatty meats to sugary treats fat tax

[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.000]
That's not a bad idea, you know what?

[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.480]
What took him so long?

[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.160]
Fat tax in fact just in that building alone we could help support the whole goddamn economy for about six years

[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:14.020]
Just in a week fat tax on Josh Friedman the beast me Hank who else and some other people we don't want to mention because we like them

[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.680]
What we like Hank too end of beast, but we're fat no specific proposals have been presented to Congress

[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:24.040]
But the center isn't taking any chances it plans to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars taking the ads to other cities soon

[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.900]
We're a coalition of restaurant and tavern operators allied to get the defiant to growing movement of food cups and

[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.360]
Public health sell its people a lot of time you basically want to eat and drink and how to live your life said Mike Burrito

[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:42.480]
Burrito the communications director what a cute name. I want to feed you to Taco Bell probably probably his favorite is that Burrito Supreme in one of its radio ads

[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.660]
The center warns a fat tax on such foods as nachos and doughnuts would make you all make all you weak snack food centers pay for your

[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.160]
Polly unsaturated transgressions the center's principal targets are the center for science in the public interest the CSPI

[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.340]
Which advocates healthier eating habits and you're very favorite your favorite in the world people for the ethical treatment of animals

[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.480]
Which urges people to stop eating meat peda file?

[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.680]
It's basically sophomore acknowledge propaganda that seems to be ended discouraging people from paying attention to the impact of diet on health said Michael Jacobson

[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.740]
The CSPI is executive director

[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:20.920]
They're trying to deny a huge body of scientific evidence that associates the high-chloric fat and salt content of restaurant foods with obesity

[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.720]
Heart disease and other health problems

[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:30.020]
Both the CSPI and peda endure a state of well taxes on fatty foods and other unhealthy now here's an interesting word. Yes

[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.980]
C.O.M.E.S.T.I.B.L.E.S.

[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.900]
Commissibles yes, what are my favorite? What all is that food?

[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.120]
Anything you can eat a mess toables anything that you could ingest is a

[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.820]
Commestible in the history of my life. I never heard or saw that word before I love that word

[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.860]
Not even 10 30 and we're learning again boys and girls more words

[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:52.620]
They never heard before on the Eurasia show commestibles. It's like vitals, but bigger. I see are they tender?

[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.160]
Both the CSPI and peda endure a federal tax on fatty foods and other health unhealthy

[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.740]
Commestibles, but they are concentrating the efforts at the state level where they see better chances for success

[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.600]
They reason that since states and the federal government tax alcohol and tobacco which can have health consequences

[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.920]
Why not tax junk food too? They're finding sympathetic ears in some state legislatures

[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.780]
California considering imposing a US two cents a can of tax on soda and other pop see it says US because this is the Canadian national post

[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.480]
Yes, so they always put in their US because can anyone eat worth of crap?

[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.500]
They're considering imposing two cents a can tax on soda and other pop and devoting the

[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.720]
350 million dollars it would raise to fighting childhood obesity. Did you say other pop?

[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:35.320]
Pop. No, that's what we call soda up here. I know well Rochester, Ontario Western New York

[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.600]
We call it pop in New York City to call it soda. You want a soda? See to me soda is like with ice cream and that's a soda

[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.040]
I know I've gotten into lots of arguments. I used to call it pop got a lot of crap for it

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.740]
Well, guess what you're right and they're all wrong. They're all full of crap. Let him go back to New York

[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.820]
Okay, let him pop this the move was abandoned after failed to win the supportive legislators

[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.020]
But the Center for Consumer Freedom Group season is just one battle in the war on junk food several other states already

[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.860]
Imposed additional taxes on soft drinks. How do you like that?

[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:08.760]
The government fraternity of food cops health enforcers militant activists meddling bureaucrats and violent radicals who think they can decide better for you

[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.840]
What's best for you are not just attacking restaurants?

[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.000]
They're attacking liberty the center warns on its website people should be making their own decisions about what products

[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.580]
They choose to consume I don't want anybody imposing their dietary beliefs on me

[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:25.720]
He be saying Lynn Beckwith who's the senior vice president of the National Association of convenience stores where they want to pedal a lot of that fattening crap

[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.220]
Because that's mostly what they sell convenience stores is booze a lot of retickets and crap

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:36.880]
F&A Amen. That's why we like convenience stores because it's convenient to a good lot of crap there 1026

[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.860]
So there's some good news for all new people out there that like just picking out

[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.180]
Don't be interfering with my Nestle's turtle. Okay. I'll leave whatever the hell I want and I'll suffer the consequences

[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.040]
And you'll all pay for it. Hey speaking of paying for it

[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.100]
You don't have to pay big bucks to get you a great name brand mattress

[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:56.060]
In fact, you can save a ton of cash and time and money isn't cash money the same thing like I said time cash money

[01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:00.760]
By calling one 800 mattress these are the best people in the world to do business with when selecting your next mattress

[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.900]
That's why I always use them because they make it a piece of cake to do it

[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.700]
It's easy just one easy phone call and that's all you have to do

[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:11.300]
You'll talk with people who read and know their crap and hook you up with exactly the type of mattress that you want and the brand

[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:17.140]
Name that you love the most they carry all the top brands like Serta and silly Simmons and King Coral and when you do business with dial

[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.260]

In other words when it's convenient for you when you're gonna be home

[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.960]
So instead of sitting around wasting even more time waiting for a delivery truck to show up

They'll be there on time and you also get a 30-day in-home comfort guarantee so you can test the mattress the right way

[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.420]
By sleeping on it and doing your thing on it

[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.540]
the spades of well in little life going on in the middle of the night.

[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.580]
You didn't know what didn't be.

[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.720]
Yeah, the TMA.

[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.320]
I don't know.

[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.580]
You didn't know what didn't be.

[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:58.920]
You can't stop.

[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.140]
Oh, he's mad.

[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.260]
I didn't say that.

[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.080]
He's not mad.

[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:04.700]
I just don't know.

[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.800]
But if you're not, I'll talk to him.

[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.640]
But he was so tall.

[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.280]
But he was.

[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.420]
Oh, I'm getting a girl.

[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.260]
People.

[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.140]
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:13.700]
I'm too.

[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.580]
Haven't heard that in the Coons age, aren't they, you know that?

[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.440]
Yeah.

[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.580]
And I figure as long as OJ is bearing the competition in our pool, he's got 68 votes.

[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.480]
He's the runaway leader.

[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.040]
Let's hear it.

[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.380]
Even when those are the riddick legs, OJ is still fine to the god they may report.

[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.760]
Probably trying to get away from those axiomers in the airport.

[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.280]
In fact, that's a good place for him.

[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.060]
Right in line with that last story, you're going to love this one.

[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:32.800]
Mom, maybe not.

[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.040]
Groups who's chocolate manufacturers.

[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.080]
Don't you just love chocolate?

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.120]
I love chocolate.

[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.240]
I think people who don't like chocolate are on American.

[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.360]
I think they're communists.

[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.480]
Communists, communists.

[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.700]
Are you as chocolate-bit with Cubans?

[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.140]
Yeah, you better believe it.

[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.860]
Well, maybe I don't believe it.

[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.600]
What does that mean?

[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.560]
I don't know any group that it's not big with.

[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.900]
Palestinians maybe think it gets them.

[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.600]
I don't think they can afford it.

[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.680]
Certainly not the good Belgian chocolate, like the diva.

[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.580]
Anyway, an environmental group sued chocolate manufacturers yesterday, containing chocolate

[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.920]
contains, waits in here, this.

[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.580]
Potentially, hazardous levels of lead and cadmium, and should carry warning labels, just

[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.240]
like cigarettes and other certain products that are forced to carry warning labels, like

[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.160]
this product is going to kill your ass dead.

[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.020]
D-E-D-Dead.

[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.120]
The suit by the nonprofit American Environmental Safety Institute leds his chocolate products

[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.940]
exposed consumers, especially children, to potentially dangerous levels of the metals.

[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.240]
A state investigation last year discounted the lawsuits, claims on the U.S. Food and Drug

[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.900]
Administration researchers have found children younger than six who eat lots of chocolate

[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:38.400]
taken six percent or less of the total daily amount of lead allowed by law.

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.200]
So even these kids are eating chocolate by the pound full.

[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.820]
They're still getting like six percent or less of the total daily amount of lead allowable

[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.280]
by law.

[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.000]
An attorney for the company's name in the suit, including Hershey Foods Corp, Nestle USA

[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.600]
Inc.

[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:51.480]
Uh-oh.

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.380]
And of course, you know what Nestle Turtle, what most of that is, beside the sugar.

[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.340]
Chocolate?

[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.260]
Chocolate.

[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.040]
And Kraft Foods North America Inc. said the lawsuit was baseless and attempt to extort a settlement.

[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.420]
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks in part to force the victims to

[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.920]
include warning labels on the products under Reckrobin of California's Proposition 65 that

[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.340]
individuals be warned before they're exposed to dangerous chemicals.

[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.380]
Scientific testing found lead in cadmium levels in products like M&Ms presented a clear

[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.900]
and present danger to the health of our children, said Roger Kirrick, an attorney for the Palo

[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.920]
Alto-based Institute.

[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.320]
M&Ms, according to this clown, create a clear and present danger to the health of our

[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:28.560]
children.

[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.780]
And maybe that's the reason why those strange people are out there in the streetcourt

[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.300]
is selling?

[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.480]
M&Ms.

[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.240]
Right.

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.240]
Absolutely correct.

[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.540]
Have you ever taken a look at those folks and we've tried to get the answers on a million

[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:38.800]
times?

[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.000]
I'm going to show what's that all about.

[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.780]
Who are those people and where did they steal?

[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.060]
I mean, where did they get those M&Ms?

[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:43.540]
It's about me.

[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.840]
Maybe they tried to poison your children.

[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.500]
Michelle Karrash, no relation to David, an attorney for the chocolate company, said the

[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.000]
two metals are present naturally in chocolate and other foods, but in levels too low to pose

[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.480]
any hazard.

[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.980]
In other words, you know, pass me to God, they're in Hershey bar.

[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.260]
Pass me the stickers.

[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.020]
Pass me the turtle candies.

[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.560]
Pass me the fish food.

[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.340]
Pass me the chocolate marshmallow.

[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.620]
Pass me the rocky, freaking road, baby.

[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.460]
Pass me that big, half thing of Cadbury's chocolate crunch.

[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.220]
Okay, you need to stop it.

[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:12.920]
Why?

[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.280]
Pass me the things.

[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.040]
Oh, and you're going to start hyperventilating when I tell you this.

[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:18.940]
Let me just finish this thing.

[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.460]
We will vigorously defend the safety of our products.

[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.840]
Karrash said that our greater concern is getting the word out that these things are totally

[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.860]
without basis and just designed to scare people, get them all worked up into a frenzy.

[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.380]
Just like that.

[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.640]
Anyway, I don't think you're ready to hear this.

[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:34.720]
I'm ready.

[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.520]
Yes, what kind, speaking of candy?

[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.800]
Wasn't we talking the other day?

[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.000]
See, we talked too much about fattening food on the show.

[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:41.840]
That's why I'm still fat.

[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.600]
Not that I'm eating any of it, but I am.

[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.380]
But remember, I was talking about how, no, it's really big weight.

[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.520]
I mean, they started this a few years ago, but now every kind of candy, whether it's

[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.880]
ever been invented, has got an ice cream that's loaded.

[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.360]
In fact, the ones up here, like in a leader, which is a little more than a court we figured

[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.760]
out, it shows you on the package more than two bars of whatever kind of candy it is

[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.220]
around here, two full bars, crunched up in the inner.

[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.800]
Yes, what candy?

[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.020]
Yes, what candy?

[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.660]
And I don't want to admit that I had any.

[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.400]
His got its own ice cream.

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:09.880]
Smarties.

[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.700]
That, they do have that, but I mentioned that the other day.

[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.280]
Score.

[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.160]
Oh, well, doesn't that going to be just like in the car?

[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.460]
And of course, there's a heat bar crunch ice cream that's been out for a long time.

[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:20.600]
Right.

[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.420]
The Ben and Jerry's thing.

[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.620]
So isn't that going to be like real similar to that?

[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.220]
No.

[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.940]
They had to change that name, didn't they?

[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:26.680]
To what?

[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.040]
To English, Ben and Josh?

[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.440]
Ben and Josh?

[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:29.580]
I don't know.

[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.060]
No, the flavor.

[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.920]
I think heat bar is better.

[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.100]
I know the one you're talking about.

[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:32.460]
It's pretty good.

[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.980]
You put it in a microwave and then all the toffee and air starts melting into the ice

[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:37.240]
cream.

[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.000]
Oh, my God.

[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.440]
About 35 seconds for a pint.

[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:40.820]
OK.

[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.740]
Take it from the expert.

[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.420]
35 seconds on high in your microwave.

[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.420]
And then you just, when you put your spoon in it, and the spoon starts like leaning over a

[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.320]
little bit, then you know it's cooked.

[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.200]
It's cooked.

[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.680]
It's melted into the thermometer.

[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.100]
That's right.

[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.220]
Stick it right in your...

[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.760]
Don't use the erectile thermometer.

[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.880]
Please, not in your ice cream.

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.500]
Not a good idea.

[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.840]
Ice cream, you scream.

[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.580]
We all scream when we found out it was the wrong thermometer.

[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:01.600]
Man.

[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.460]
Score ice cream.

[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.420]
An experience that will lead you breathless as Jerry Lee Lewis would say.

[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.360]
Guess who wrote breathless?

[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.120]
Otis Blackwell.

[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:10.880]

[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.840]
Well, who was?

[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:12.520]
Black.

[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.080]
Black and he's dead.

[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.240]
And he was dead.

[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:14.780]
He was dead.

[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.360]
He was great.

[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.520]
He wrote all of it.

[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:16.960]
Don't be cruel.

[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.000]
What was the other other stuff he wrote?

[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.160]
I forget, but he's dead anyway.

[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.040]
I forgot.

[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:20.820]
He was outstanding.

[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:21.500]
Otis Blackwell.

[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.440]
Those guys back there, and those days, fats, water, and fats, domino, and all those

[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.040]
all those farts.

[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.100]
They were the best.

[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.160]
They were the real, the R&B crowd.

[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.820]
See, Bill Haley had that little strange, uh, cruey-cute, there, what do they call those?

[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.040]
Spit the thing.

[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:35.740]
Spit curl.

[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:37.560]
Now, what they called him?

[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.640]
That's what it was, a spit curl.

[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.180]
Right.

[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.540]
Great ball of fire, fever.

[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.540]
I'm looking at this, oh, a bit again.

[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.100]
Yeah.

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.760]
Mother's spreading it out.

[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:45.440]
Okay.

[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.400]
Well, I think we, I think we covered that adequately.

[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.380]
Yes, though, you seem to be extremely worked up about this because you got all the stuff

[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.880]
and it turned out the guy is black.

[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.240]
But you know, some, it really don't make any difference one way or the other because

[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.460]
first of all, the music was still great.

[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.660]
And secondly, in spite of all your protestations, he still dead.

[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.220]
21 before 11 at 5.60 WQM, we got the mad dog, the hostile hound coming along at 1 o'clock

He'll have a lot of sectional to himself.

[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.800]
And so will you too.

[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.400]

They call it East Pop Palm Hill.

[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.780]

Houses went on the sale.

[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.340]
I was standing on a corner selling rap CDs.

[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.640]
When I met a little German jam.

[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.320]
I got it right in my tummy cause I didn't know I did.

[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.920]
It was the leader of a group club.

[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.140]
We f***ed on the bed.

[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.360]
F***ed on the pole.

[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.700]
So long I grew a f***ing afro.

[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.940]
Then I f***ed to the lab.

[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.180]
To the rise.

[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.680]
I suck my f***ed to the s*** termite.

[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.320]
I thought to myself and Steve the shitha.

[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.300]
Got my past lookin' like a zebra.

[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.680]
I put on my clothes and I was on my way.

[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.960]
I can do a dirty pool, do a pretty shabble.

[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.520]
So I ran, I jumped up the back window.

[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.280]

And I present you this dad.

[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.760]
That's the best damn f***ing y'all ever had.

[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.240]
I'm a bad leader and a bottle of wine.

[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.360]
I'm a f***ing bad man.

[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.380]
It's just one month.

[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.860]
Go f***ing five and two seasons.

[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.940]
Baby, that's all we need.

[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:28.480]
Come on.

[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.100]
We can go to the dog.

[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.000]
Got the dog.

[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.760]
Smoked that combo weed.

[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.760]
And as a marijuana bird, we can take our turn.

[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.040]
Singing in pretty raps, songs.

[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.020]
Stop it.

[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.400]
Hit the bun like teachings on the sale of tapes.

[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:42.720]
From hit-a-hump on.

[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.560]
So, whoa, whoa.

[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.560]
Roll my joint.

[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.540]
Pick out the season stings.

[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.000]
All right.

[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.260]
Fill in higher's hail.

[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.700]
Plenty of pompins.

[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.160]
Ain't no vaguenry.

[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:52.800]
Just come up.

[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.220]
So, whoa, whoa.

[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.180]
The 83.

[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.640]
Cadillac group.

[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.260]
The build.

[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.140]
Empotaped semi-stities.

[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.120]
Just don't sell.

[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.360]
I bet my caviar will be a nun.

[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.620]
I met this lady in Hollywood.

[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.580]
She ain't green hair but damn she look good

[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.920]
I took her to my house because she was smiling

[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.360]
But she whooped out of the f*** that was bigger than mine

[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.800]
I missed this penny from Japan

[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.000]
Never made love with an African

[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.480]
I f***ed her once

[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.700]
I f***ed her twice

[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.580]
Ain't that f***ing like shrimp from my stomp

[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.820]
Ain't that f***ing like stories I tell you

[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.960]
Tell you a woman in the heart of Osprey

[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.280]
You've had a big, good, and big titties too

[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.640]
So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo

[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.260]
See, I met this woman from Hawaii

[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.300]
Snuck it in her ass and she said

[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.140]
Ay, lips was breathless

[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.860]
F***ing was like dinner titties

[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.600]
Busted up in with a wide- your punks

[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.000]
That term of said was wife in a spade of Kentucky

[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.280]
Did she set up for us and chicken?

[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.720]
You just f***ing mean her mouth

[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.840]
It was a crisis

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.340]
I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices

[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.340]
Go fight five and two ZZ's

[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.740]
Baby, that's how we need

[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.060]
Oh!

[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.740]
We can go to golf

[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.380]
Got the dogs smoked at come weed

[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.520]
And at the marijuana burn we take our turn

[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.700]
Singing in burning rapsongs

[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.300]
Stop there, hit the long-like teachings on

[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.400]
The sale takes from here to Hong Kong

[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.220]
So roll, roll, roll my joy

[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.400]
Pick out the season stamps

[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.780]
And then highest hail, blind to pop

[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.240]
And we gotta come and enjoy it for a great job of editing that thing

[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.580]
I don't want to talk about what six years to get all the bleeps in there

[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.660]
It was a labor of love

[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.720]
You don't hear those sirens do you get out to my window?

[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.160]
We do

[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.140]
All right, good sound effects

[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:29.800]
Man, they're for real

[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.360]
Anyway, we got 205 votes on our survey

[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.020]
Which one of these people would you most like to pull to swish on?

[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:36.680]
OJ78

[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:38.160]
Andrey835

[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.020]
I mean there's no contest

[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.940]
We know in the beginning he'd win by a glans lie

[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:41.900]
But that's okay

[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.840]
We can never stick it to his ass enough

[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.360]
Andrey835

[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.500]
Susan Smith-33

[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.020]
John Walker-Lin-20

[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.540]
Father Shanley-17

[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.060]
Father Gagin-12

[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.800]
Lukeka Skywalker-Helder

[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:53.820]
The mailbox bomber

[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.780]
And I see most people don't know who that is still

[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.940]
They don't know who that is

[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.760]
Two guys

[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200]
And Pam Smart-yeah, he was a little too fresh

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.420]
Pam Smart and Robert Blake each have one

[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.920]
See, I got a perfect punishment by the way for Luke

[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.400]
Lock him in a room with Father Shanley and Father Gag

[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.260]
Hey, about six months

[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.320]
Yeah, although he's a little old for them, don't you think?

[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.780]
Well, he looked, he's 21 going on, he looks like about 16 I would say

[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:15.500]
I think he's like on the upper edge of their limit

[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.360]
On the outer limits

[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.860]
But of course if they're locked in there, I guess they'd have to make do

[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.340]
Maybe they could shave him up

[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.300]
Can't you see the hissy fight over that?

[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.040]
Haha, oh man

[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.500]
They could turn him into like a human sandwich

[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.340]
He could be like the meat in the middle of the sand wall anyway

[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.240]
You can just use your own imagination, but I don't think so

[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.780]
See, I don't have any sympathy and you know it's just a matter of time

[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.540]
Because already you're starting here and you are reading to me some of the stuff from different articles this morning before the show

[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:43.340]
About, well, he's seen so nice and he was laid back and never stole a freight train

[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:51.340]
And we have to examine you know what was in that weed that he was smoking and how did he listen to one too many Kurt Cobain records and all this other horse crap

[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:51.760]
You know

[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:58.060]
It's just so basic and simple and the fact is that this society takes things that are so elementary might your Watson

[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.080]
And making it like this big complex saw it, there's nothing complex about it

[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:05.520]
If you can't teach your children the basic difference between right and wrong

[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.140]
Whether without any religious holo ballu or consequences that go along with it

[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.420]
If you have to like have some threat in the threat of punishment then there's no hope for the human race

[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.420]
If you have to threaten that you're going to burn in hell if you break one of the commandments or some of that horse crap

[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.460]
Nobody believes that anyway that's got a brain

[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.260]
So that's what it really boils down to just knowing the basic difference

[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:27.140]
Like when a dog walks out in the middle of the road, it runs out in the road and you're driving

[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.840]
You don't like run it over you know you do your best to avoid it

[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.920]
There's just certain basic things just because you know it's common basic decency

[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:39.180]
God I think that was a good idea and we can also put cardinal law in here like supervise

[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.480]
Okay, since we got this story next

[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.920]
Cardinal law answers questions from victims lawyers and civil lawsuits today

[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.340]
He'll be back again tomorrow by the way for more for part two

[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.280]
And how come they're called and broonard now I thought his name was Bernard

[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.440]
People do that and I don't know why and I don't know if there's two ways of saying it but I've always heard that

[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.440]
You know I'm looking at this picture and this is from the Abustan Globe

[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.900]
He looks like a saint Bernard

[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.020]
Yes, got channels

[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.300]
He's got big fat jowls

[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:09.220]
Cardinal Bernard law maintained under oath yesterday they relied on the advice of doctors and subordinates when he approved the transfer of a priest

[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.720]
Accused of sexually abusing children to a new parish

[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.500]
There isn't one word that comes out of his mouth that I believe

[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:24.020]
Law was ordered to answer questions from the attorney for 86 people who filed civil lawsuits alleging law on the Boston Arts Dice which he heads was negligent and supervising

[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:31.540]
Pedophile defrock priest John Gagan and failed to prevent abuse which we all know everybody with an IQ larger than their goddamn thumbnail knows it's true

[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:37.440]
Including you Catholics out there who continue to subsidize this crap the deposition was ordered at the arched I see sliced

[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.320]
Week back out of a settlement with the Gagan victims that would have been worth up to 30 million dollars

[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:49.360]
Law who is withstood repeated calls for his resident resignation from people to say he's mishabiled the sex abuse cases arrived at the downtown court house amid heavy security

[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.740]
Can't imagine why can you know why I mean after all he's a man of the cloth

[01:22:53.740 --> 01:23:03.720]
The closed-door deposition opened with his attorney Wilson Rogers Jr. No relation by the way making a standing objection to the questioning saying the inquiry into the inner workings of the church was inappropriate

[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:10.120]
Oh brother the inquiry into the inner workings of the church was inappropriate

[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:18.660]
None of your business yeah or is the mad dog would say if you say something negative about Dan Marino it's disrespectful that's his favorite word this is inappropriate

[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:26.840]
Under questioning law explained that he was both a U.S. citizen and a citizen of the Vatican as a cardinal he is technically a prince he said he recently learned of that status

[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:32.420]
Maybe like to hang out with prince can't ask must macho prince or cardinal law that's going to be our poll question tomorrow

[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:41.000]
But I must say that it hasn't been something that I've been conscious of in the past 17 years law said according to an 88 page transcript of the morning session released by attorneys for the plaintiffs

[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.820]
It has been suggested that law could enjoy diplomatic immunity from civil law since because did you realize that he's a dual citizen?

[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:56.040]
No it did not until yes he's a citizen of the U.S. and he's citizen of a fraudulent country the Vatican which has its own national status you are aware of that the Vatican I have aware of that

[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:02.460]
Sue donation yes right a scale you could go there and have like diplomatic immunity and go out there and hang out and hide what a crop

[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:10.520]
Hang out probably hang out with a swish guard boy they sure are pretty William Gordon an attorney for the plaintiffs challenge see and you know I'm thinking about this what's his name again

[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:25.160]
See I don't know what his name is the kid the bomb holder. Oh Luke. Well that should be easy remember just take a star wars I'm thinking about Luke and I'm sure that somebody out there would be saying to me you know if he was like cute if he looked real cute if he looked like Tom Welling you wouldn't be talking about frying his ass

[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:32.940]
You talking about doing something else with it and maybe they might have a point then we'd fry his ass William Gordon an attorney for the plaintiffs challenge law about why he approved

[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:40.900]
Gagan transfer 1984 even though he'd received letters another evidence of abuse by Gagan see and what I just said was true though you know we we've talked about that we always sympathize more with people

[01:24:40.900 --> 01:25:01.260]
Look good right you know for example if Susan Smith or Anne creates either one of them in a real hot babe you wouldn't be having a real hostile attitude right now or Pamela smart no all I can't really

[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:11.800]
Letters warning about Gagan's behavior and that doctor said Gagan was not a threat I'm sure that the medical assurance was given law said whether it was subsequently put in writing in earlier form given or

[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:23.200]
I cannot say but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the letter would never been put before me for a signature have we not the assurance of someone competent to give that assurance that the assignment was safe

[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:33.780]
Right we're gonna send him somewhere where he'll be safe just like that meeting at Louise in the Bronx where we'll be safe he'll be known toward how so lots of doing

[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:42.520]
Klosski try to be a boy it's the best in the city he acknowledged however that the arts dices had no written policy on handling allegations of sex abuse by priest at the time

[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:50.160]
Gagan is currently serving a nine to ten year prison term after being convicted of sexual molesting a boy he's been accused of molesting more than 130 children

[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:56.960]
The deposition of law is a legal rarity for someone of such high church rank and look at that they're coming to take him away again there was another guy damn ambulance

[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:05.720]
Law said he didn't remember reading a letter from Margaret Gallon a relative of seven-ledged Gagan victims would express disbelief that the church gave him another chance to say Brennan's perish in Boston

[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.240]
Nornity recall a letter from Bishop John Darcy warning him that Gagan was unfit to be reassigned he doesn't remember that

[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:21.980]
Right however law did say he recognized his handwriting on a note forwarding one of the talents letters to Bishop Thomas daily one of his subordinates with instructions urgent please follow through

[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:27.680]
I wish we had that do have that foreigner and urgent you do have that do have that I'm too lazy to reach over and get it

[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:57.580]
In 1984 letter it's much easier to play it's a much harder reach in the 1984 letter Gallon alleged Gagan at abuse seven people while it's saying in his perish in Roxbury it's just impossible for him not to remember that letter said Gagan victim Mark Keen who attended that position I found that the cardinal had some selective amnesia oh I love that term we work for somebody like that who's always got selective amnesia don't say anything and I'm sure you won't oh and by the way Greg if you're listening I got the strawberries the ones you've been looking for

[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:03.520]
He's been running up and down the hall last two weeks rolling those steel balls in his hand looking for the strawberries I just had a few here during the last break

[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:12.300]
Slice strawberries God I just love strawberries you know I mean why don't you have to ice cream all the other crap for something sweet when you got delicious slice strawberries man I got him anyway

[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:23.020]
Mitch gear a beady in the attorney he's kind of a sleaze ball to that lawyer he looks like Maddie Bell on a bad day he's kind of an ambulance saser but nevertheless he happens to be right in this case he fell into a bucket of crap so you go boy

[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:27.480]
Mitchell gear a beady in attorney for the gagan victims had law have been quiet and seemed sad during the questioning

[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:35.820]
Law's deposition is scheduled to continue all day tomorrow and Monday at the art dice his chance to read in Boston he gave a lot of his standard speeches

[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:43.800]
His standard responses to the situation gear a beady and be saying laws lawyer declined to comment law repeatedly emphasized that he relied on the judgment of others

[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:53.040]
He said he was prompted to assign gagan to a new parish on the device of two doctors even though both lack proper credentials and sex abuse matters and what had been accused in the civil law suit of molesting one of his patients

[01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:01.520]
Oh please read that again I'm squeezing myself law repeatedly emphasize that he had relied on the judgment of others

[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:12.900]
Law has said he was prompted to assign gagan a new parish on the advice of two doctors even though both lack proper credentials and sex abuse matters and one had been accused in the civil law suit of molesting one of his patients

[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:21.100]
Let's hear it all right let's hear it for the father and the son and the holy ghost see if you get upset about these things you might as well just blow your brains out you know

[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:29.880]
1056 at 560 WQ I'm trying to refresh with a nice I bet it's coming today I bet you're gonna have a bunch of champion light when I get off the other be message down there you got some packages

[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:40.740]
That's right packages of delicious refreshing champion light if you're like overwhelmed and overcome not just by the South Florida heat but by all these pressing issues of the day by all this insanity in the world in which we live

[01:28:40.740 --> 01:29:10.160]
And cool off with champion light it's a great new sports drink and you know something I mentioned before about that Pepsi Blu they're coming out with this summer champion light beat him to the punch because they got that brand new blue raspberry which I'm sure is exactly what they're talking about without all the fizz in there there's no fizz in champion light so you don't have like your stomach turning all day just great delicious taste all the electrolytes you need after workout and no crap they're using sucrose now which really boost up the taste it tastes fantastic in all six flavors of champion light you've got orange and lemon lime and grape and fruit punch and brand new lemonade in that blue raspberry which is just delicious

[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:36.620]
So instead of drinking Gatorade and the other crap that's litter with all kinds of sugar and calories and carbs try champion light no sugar no carbs no calories no crap and certainly no sorbetal either pick it up at your favorite store if you want to find out where to get champion light all you got to do is get a hold of J. Feetler out there in the practice field are they practice and I sure hope not he's the spokesman that's right J. Feetler maybe someday you can make $25 million and get ears as big as his or just look up their website they'll tell you exactly where to be going champion light ill watch

[01:29:36.620 --> 01:30:05.520]

sequene and rhapsody overhead award London British rock band queens and during hit bohemian rhapsody's been named the nation's favorite single of all time oh that's not a surprise is it no

[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:52.320]
how about when we did that long that lengthy thing which we might have to do again very soon by the way I enjoyed that although I enjoyed the thing with the

[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:58.360]
themes that we did a couple days ago that went over like a pregnant pole pole vault around the 4th of July and Miami Beach wasn't that yesterday

[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:10.420]
we did yesterday on the pole with the themes right I thought you were just I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost no whatever was I'm just saying we we I tried to

[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:15.900]
reprise that by playing those themes and just that nobody would have any interest as I told you British rock band

[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:20.360]
queens and during hit bohemian rhapsody's been named the nation's favorite single of all time the song be

[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.220]
channeled and imagined to claim the top slot and to pull organized by the Guinness World Records British

[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:28.920]
a hit singles book what did you say I was just going to ask myself that question the

[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:36.760]
the Guinness World Records British hits singles book the Guinness World Records British it singles book

[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.700]
well they have to say it slowly you have to enunciate what was that word I learned before

[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:48.420]
comestibles oh I love that I thought that was the bill the people in the bill cause me show bohemian rhapsody a six-minute

[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:53.900]
epic which was eight and it's oh so I was starting to say before I interrupted myself with that crap which we both got lost on

[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:59.860]
when we did the pole on the music it was a stairway to heaven as usual came out on top right correct but wasn't bohemian

[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:05.000]
rhapsody way to hell up there also it ranked very well but stairway to heaven always wins in America whenever the rock

[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.180]
I don't want to hear stairway to heaven okay I don't hear it ever again no in fact you know something

[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.480]
I don't want to hear bohemian rhapsody again either I still like I mean it was it was great but I

[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:18.880]
just I don't want to hear it bohemian rhapsody a six-minute epic which was aidedness appeal by one

[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:24.160]
of the first videos first top the UK charts in 1975 and we've all seen it a million times back when

[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.440]
Freddie Mercury was still alive by the way I remember that it did so again in 1991 when a fundraising

[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.180]
version was released following death of the band singer Freddie Mercury there's my psychic powers

[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:37.700]
again acting up all the way did see that it also gained for the repeal in 1992 and appeared in one of

[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:42.680]
the most memorable scenes in the American comedy film Wayne's World Wayne's World the band's

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:47.520]
guitarist Brian May said it's become a classic phenomenon and no one and one which no one will

[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.780]
ever allow us to forget what they should get carried away don't they those brits too much in that

[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:56.180]
royalty crap too much pomp and circumcise they should get emotional just like with Diana and the

[01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:00.740]
queen mum they get so emotional about crap you know it's sad when somebody dies like that but when

[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:04.500]
somebody gets to be 101 there's nothing sad about it get over with already toward the end she

[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.780]
couldn't see a guy damn thing she couldn't hear she was like a like a breathing vegetable there

[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:13.380]
put her out of her misery bohemian rhapsody was the first single to go to number one twice in the

[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:18.760]
same version did you know that no followed earlier this year by George Harrison's My Sweet Lord

[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:24.420]
which is on a charts in Britain at 49 that's because he died see there's a good lesson for all

[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.720]
you would be musicians out there make yourself a pretty good record then if you die especially

[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:33.120]
prematurely then it'll come back and be bigger than ever like all Elvis's stuff bigger now than

[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.260]
everyone he was alive right me he had gigantic hits number ones etc but now it's like bigger than

[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:41.000]
life itself who the hell ever wanted to go to Graceland when he was alive when it could actually

[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000]
see him in the flesh when he was living nobody wanted to go there but now that he's dead everybody

[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.880]
slept in a Graceland anyway bohemian rhapsody is also the only song that I've hit the Christmas

[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.900]
number one slot twice and because it's straddle the new year period has been number one in four

[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.620]
different years wow it has spent a total of 14 weeks at the top of the charts again keep in mind

[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.880]
that's the bridge charts we're talking about I'm assuming because this is taken from

[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.520]
it's on CNN dot com but it's definitely a Brit thing may and queen drummer Roger Taylor were

[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:10.240]
presented with an award by British hits say oh see there you go again British hit singles book

[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.840]
editor David Roberts had London's Dominion theater yesterday well I said it right they were

[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.600]
presented in the award by British hit singles book editor did I do something wrong no

[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.700]
I didn't hear packet all been out of shit of course he's busy looking for the line up to the

[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.800]
baseball game to he's allowed his scorecard already he's getting ahead start leading off

[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:32.620]
yeah get out of here with that crap okay next to be doing Bob Shepherd imitation

[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.740]
and by the way you know Bob you're a great guy and we love the voice and everything but Bob

[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.140]
Shepherd just turned 103 is even older than the queen mum time to hang it up Bob okay and by

[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:44.760]
the way the Yankees are mediocre at best may said the song was apparently so far if of any rival

[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.120]
that even must before the deadline his position in the new pool was unimpeachable thank you people

[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.760]
for the memory in other words it was like oh gee on our survey today so far ahead that the result

[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.840]
is beyond doubt beyond question Robert said Queen is a band whose achievements are legendary no band

[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.920]
apart from the Beatles has had more top 10 hit singles now that wouldn't be true here though would it

[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:10.060]
no fat stomino Elvis Presley a lot of bands had more than I could look that up in a book maybe

[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:14.380]
I will during the break I don't want to waste your valuable time here oh by the way let me interrupt

[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:18.620]
myself because I almost forgot look for the QAM van from now to 1230 at Verizon Wireless at

[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:23.660]
132 56 this game Boulevard because Miguel Azari's got our usual crappy prizes maybe if you're

[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:29.340]
nice you'll let your spin it spin the QAM feel that's not a 1230 at Verizon Wireless 132 56 this

[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:33.640]
game Boulevard now what were you just gonna mumble I was gonna say yes you should look it up because

[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:39.600]
now I'm curious ah geez if you realized how far I had to reach for the book about two feet

[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:47.740]
how about Madonna mm since I just happened open to that page it's getting too close to lunch time

[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:52.400]
to talk about Madonna another classic example of hype don't give me a solid answer about Madonna okay

[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.120]
you're broken up the wrong tree if you're gonna pedal me Madonna queen here you go top 10 hits

[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.900]
position let's see bohemian rap city you know that that only got as high as number nine in the

[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.900]
states no I didn't know that yeah we we are the champions which if I have to hear that again oh

[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:17.720]
I'm gonna get four but crazy little thing called love was number one for four weeks another one

[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.220]
and David boy well that doesn't count does it yeah sure counts for both of them they we did

[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.560]
bohemian rap city made the number two for a week but that but they didn't have a whole bunch of

[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.520]
top what about what did I say again they had more top 10 hits than any other group than the Beatles

[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.720]
well not in the U.S. not in the states see in England they revere the queen here we like you know

[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.860]
they're okay but we don't worship the queen it was really miles ahead of the opposition but it's

[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:45.080]
interesting looking down the list where there's a good mixture of old and new unlike many polls

[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.460]
which seem to have an imbalance of hits from the last two years our readers voted across all six

[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:55.020]
decades of the single chart making it the most definitive top 100 ever more than 31,000 people

[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:58.920]
voted the poll of readers of the reference book half of the top then is by Lenin and the Beatles

[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.840]
whose high entries are why what do they say high entries why can't they just tell us what number

[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:09.280]
you basted you CNN sucks whose high entries are hey Jude penny lane strashtra slashtra refield forever

[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.040]
which was on one single both sides yesterday and let it be in all the Beatles managed seven of

[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.160]
the top 100 well that's not such a big deal not putting the Beatles down of course but seven out

[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.300]
of a hundred isn't that big of a deal would you think no not for that in England the most recent

[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:28.780]
single in the top 10 is Robbie Williams unfortunately angels while the Spice Girls first hit

[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:35.360]
wannabe is in the upper reaches of the chart with the groups to become one at seven number 78

[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.680]
and their final release howard 82 American acts also a fair feature including three entries by Elvis

[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:47.440]
suspicious minds is number 14 heartbreak hotel 40 48 and jailhouse rock 94 two by Michael Jackson

[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.300]

California 17 the British punksy of the 1970s is represented twice by the sex pistols with God

[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.580]
save the queen see every song over there that's big has got something to do with some queen

[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:07.480]
it's either sung by a queen or it's about a queen and Johnny rotten the queen there you go sex

[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.420]
pistols with God save the queen at 65 how's he doing by the way he's going to be released later

[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.560]
the would look to be helper to one that they were playing yesterday just to make fun of him because

[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.960]
he did all that stuff see I don't find anything I'm using about that story to me it's cut and

[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.620]
dried 18 cases of attempted murder life in jail that's it that's a good way of putting them to

[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.620]
death as a matter of fact now that you mentioned it cut and you imagine how much of the taxpayer money

[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:45.960]
we could save if they would just make me the king of the universe and just sit me up there with

[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.620]

history of the human race on our worst days we can't come close to those sports nerds those

[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:21.140]
illiterate one-dimensional morons and all those baseball people who do every year month after

[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:24.320]

[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:51.500]
the people like like psychopath and Norma Kent who are overgrown children and no matter how many

[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:55.100]
times they stab you in the back you keep going back for more punishment just like me with the

[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.560]

[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:53.960]
look like too much but with all his money and fame you would have thought that he could do a little

[01:54:53.960 --> 01:55:02.020]
bit better than that maybe he would like to she wouldn't tell no lies not uh not Bonnie Bonnie Lee

[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:06.240]

[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.980]
campaign spokeswoman Nicole Harberger when asked for details of Sheen's visit mr Sheen is a graded

[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:14.480]
admirer of Janet's he believes she had tremendous record and was very impressed with their 10

[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.820]
years attorney general Sheen will host fundraisers and old-fashioned political rallies in South Florida

[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:23.620]
or land to impossible one of the locations in the state Harberger said maybe this is a harbinger

[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:28.040]
of things to come she did not offer specific dates Reno is dipped into Hollywood before before

[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:33.840]
ill he raised money in Los Angeles and attended an Oscars party with singer I ready I'm ready

I'm ready come on rocket man Elton John right now what do they have in common Jan or Reno in Elton John

[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.860]
yeah that's right they both were big freaky glasses left for go and you know something I bet you

[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:49.620]
if he was still alive she'd have probably been there with Freddie Mercury two of the Oscars probably

[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:54.160]
hot your host Rosie O'Donnell you see a pattern here now uh huh who who is leading the charge

[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.940]
to be Vogue Florida's ban on gay adoptions which even the Brits are laughing at Florida now like

[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:02.080]
everybody else in the world and certainly the Canadians here also hope that a fundraiser for last

[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:08.540]
year in Miami Rosie O'Donnell Elton John and Martin Sheen now at least we know Martin Sheen is a

[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.660]
heterosexual because he's had like a children you know a couple of kids so at least we think he is

[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.140]
Charlie Sheen who can't get it get out of his own way and of course a medio Estevez or as the

[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.680]
bird used to say Emeño Estevez more as that good movie he was in it wasn't a good movie but

[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:28.540]
and had a lot of those of people in it see Thomas Howell um the outside of the outsiders yes thank you

[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:32.260]
Pat yeah the answer very good Pat the outsiders of course they play baseball outside unless it's a

[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:37.380]
dome stadium so Pat can relate to that the outside is very good and the two on pitch it was a little

[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:42.060]
bit morbid though and depressing Tom Cruise was in that movie too Tom Cruise was in there and also

[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:45.240]
the kid with the eyes that watch sunken in but he looked he looked pretty good in that movie Ralph

[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.400]
I was gonna say that no no he wasn't there but I'm not talking about him he's a that's it is a

[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.440]
punk you know he got married when he was about eight years old Ralph Macho to Pat Morita I think so

[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.780]
I think they were doing now he did I'm serious he has a wife you know he's got got married when he

[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:03.080]
was about like 14 15 something very young I don't know something silly maybe that's maybe he was

[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.920]
doing too many karate chops now who's the other one I'm thinking of that's what the sunken in

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:12.820]
his mad Dylan no he wasn't in that movie yes he was I don't think Pat must have just seen it

[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:18.440]
mad Dylan was in the outsiders I got see I hate to break the news to you but I'm way

[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.840]
heavy and you're right I think you're right but the point of the and you left out seat Thomas

[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.340]
Holler's is very important you already said that I know but I want to say it again outlaw blues

[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:30.560]
out of order you're out of order the whole effing systems I'd rather I love that scene that is one

[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.140]
of my favorite scenes in the history of mankind don't you love that I loved it but I like all but

[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:38.720]
you know I like he he paid I live movies you know it's accept the course that one movie that you

[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.240]
didn't see which I hope if you live long enough you might see you know like a woman yeah what is

[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:48.060]
it yeah could be one of the all-time worst and certainly the worst movie he was ever okay the

[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:54.520]
outsider oh no that's not it the outsiders yes okay that's still not it you know how many movies

[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.920]
about this one and that gun and how's your piece what's your piece doing yeah we need a lot more

[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.680]
guns that's what the Bush people tell you and it's not just because the NRAs got their office

[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:48.060]
right there in a white house like they were bragging and because they got them by the balls they

[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:53.620]
control the whole goddamn government that's just a coincidence isn't it no no most charted

[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:57.940]
singles the this is a very interesting page in fact maybe I'll just fact this page everybody's

[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.820]
listening right now which couldn't be too many because you tell me that nothing's coming in on

[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:08.180]
the facts machine today maybe just a slow day 305 650198 I just remember the time what do you mean by

[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:11.760]
that well it was that every time I looked over there it was said receiving page one or so

[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.940]
another was a machine was a nut up and I'm sitting here this is like the days when we used to

[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:19.460]
take phone calls the phone was dead and I don't know we deserve yeah oh I'll never forget that one

[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:24.600]
day downstairs on the circuit doors long as long as I live I mean I'm screaming and I'm yelling

[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.340]
and I'm practically saying the seven dirty words on a year and nothing is happening on the phone

[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:33.780]
and finally after about a half an hour of this I finally punched down on the lines and I go up

[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.380]
and down the line they're all dead every line on the board the whole phone was dead and of course

[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:41.820]
that's the QAMF and way because in actually that's the Beasley way we can't be bothered I mean we

[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:45.200]
have some stuff that looks fairly impressive some that looks like crap and it all works pretty much

[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.320]

depressing though morbid and dark just like those circles among Craig's eyes anyway

[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:40.080]
reversing decades of gestive to barman policy the Bush administration has told the supreme

[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.440]
court it believes the constitution protects and individuals right to possess firearms at the

[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:48.820]
same time the administration's top supreme court lawyer said the high court need not test that

[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:53.440]
principle now the administration's view represents a reversal of government interpretations

[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.540]
of the second amendment going back some 40 years through four democratic and five

[02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:02.300]
republican administrations the coalition is very disappointed that attorney general john

[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:06.620]
ashcroft personal politics and debt to the nRA have climbed in the official position of the

[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:10.440]
justice department Josh Horowitz executive director of the coalition to stop gun violence

[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:16.500]
told CBS radio news laws like the Brady Bill like the assault weapons band have met constitutional

[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:21.040]
muster New York senator Charles Schumer Democrats said that during his confirmation hearing ashcroft

[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.480]
promised to uphold the laws as they exist and not to promote his own agenda what happened to that

[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.440]
pledges reporters it's hard look at his actions and not question whether he's going back on his

[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:33.900]
word somehow the gun movement in this country's been captured by people who are extreme and believe

[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:38.060]
in no respect at all that seems to be the direction attorney general ashcroft is moving in he

[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.620]
action is pro-positive that the worst fears about attorney general ashcroft have come true

[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:48.460]
his extreme ideology on guns has now become government policy said michael barons president of

[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:53.000]
the Brady senate to prevent gun violence which promotes gun control barons noted that other federal

[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.760]
appeals courts in the supreme court have not found the same protection for individual gun ownership

[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:01.280]
that the fifth circuit asserted in the emerson case in that case the 50 west circuit court of appeals

[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:06.600]
rejected arguments from texas position timothy emerson at a 1994 federal gun law was unconstitutional

[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:11.540]
the law was intended to deny guns to people under judicial restraining orders the current position

[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:15.320]
of the united states is that the second amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals

[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:19.160]
including persons who are not members of any militia were engaged in academic military service

[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:23.960]
or training to possess and bear their own firearms solicitor general ted ulson wrote in

[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.800]
through court filings this week and of course member ted ulson because of the penis gate hearings

[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:32.140]
and because his wife died in that plane crash yes and because leery king was cut a second is asked

[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:36.220]
for a night after night that right however is subject to reasonable restrictions design of

[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:40.640]
event possession by unfit persons or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are

[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.520]
particularly suited to criminal misuse i think everybody should have at least one who's he don't

[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:49.220]
also in the administration's top supreme court lawyer and plenty of ammo was reflecting the

[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:53.020]
view of ash crop that the second amendment confers the right to keep in bear arms to private

[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:58.220]
citizens and not merely to the well-regulated militia mentioned the amendments text ash crop

[02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:02.480]
causes stir when he expressed a similar sentiment a year ago in a letter to the net the anxious

[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:08.040]
national rifle association all glennon mirroir squeezed himself right now he's rubbing it

[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.220]
and his peace to while some have argued that the second amendment guarantees only a collective

[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:16.200]
right of states to maintain militias i believe the amendments plain meeting original intent through

[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:20.180]
otherwise ash crop wrote at the time ash crop wrote the letter was unclear whether he was

[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:25.260]
expressing his personal view or stating a new policy position for the government that question

[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:29.420]
was mostly answered last November when he sent a letter to federal prosecutors praising an

[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:33.200]
appeals court decision that found the second amendment does protect individual rights but noting

[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:37.520]
that those rights could be sent to limited narrowly tailored specific exemptions in other words

[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:41.340]
maybe like crazy people should be running around with guns john is that what are you talking about

[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:46.680]
crazy people which seem to have the most guns just like luke in my view the emerson opinion and the

[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.160]
balance it strikes generally reflect the correct understanding of the second amendment ash crop told

[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.540]
prosecutors emerson appeal of the supreme court putting the justice department in an awkward position

[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:58.100]
of the government one its case in the lower court using the old interpretation of the second

[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:01.560]
amendment ash crop that switched gears by the time the case reached the higher court

[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:05.660]
allsons court filing Monday urged the high court not to get involved and acknowledged the policy

[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:10.380]
change in a lengthy footnote alls and also attached ash crops related to prosecutors also made the

[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:14.440]
same notation in a separate case involving man convicted aboding two machine guns in violation

[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.240]
of federal law in that case the government also won a lower court decision endorsing a federal

[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:22.080]
gun control law the justice department issued a statement Tuesday night saying its latest comments

[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:26.700]
reflect the attorney general's position in the November letter to prosecutors the supreme court

[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:31.640]
last ruled on the scope of the second amendment in 1939 the amendment protects only those

[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.380]
rights that have some reasonable relationship to the preservation of the efficiency of a well-regulated

[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:40.360]
militia the high court said nineteen thirty nine you know what they were absolutely on target then

[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:47.180]
and now see that was then and this is now remember that movie no dammit how do you like that oh

[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:52.940]

[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.380]
Meribel Roddell as a member of the St. Mary parish council Morris 45 said he was relieved and thankful

[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:56.860]
I've been basically unhauled for the last ten days he said George can relate to that

kidding she said when told by a reporter then she called her attorney John Travina of Clearwater

[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:11.520]
she was literally sobbing he said later my reaction was I told you they were going to do this

[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:16.820]
Travina called the dices investigation a sham remember sand the sham and the pharaohs let's

[02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:20.760]
look him up see if he's on the list as a Catholic myself the lawyer said I'm embarrassed by the way

[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:24.980]
that I see this behaved Morris being stamo was ordered Wednesday morning by bishop Robert Lynch

[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:28.880]
that I see said it's send member response team it found absolutely no credible evidence to

[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:34.180]
substantiate any of the allegations collages accused Morris of filing her 14 years ago when she

[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:38.220]
was a when he was a 31 year old seminary student working in St. Catharines in a Catholic church

[02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:44.440]
in Clearwater and she was a 13 year old member of the church youth how do you like that

[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:50.000]
an addition to California college instructor was a part time secretary it's in Catherine in 1989

[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.460]
accused Morris of making it a lengthy obscene telephone call to her that year the complaint was

[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:58.900]
reported to the dices at the time this week the response team concluded the incident was properly

[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:04.360]
investigated and Morris properly cleared oh my god the dices said more than 25 people interviewed

[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:08.480]
in his latest investigation including church members and employees at St. Catharines in 1980s

[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:14.540]
and on and on a coach crap another white wash you see the problem with all these stale stories

[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:17.960]
is first of all that people are intimidated and this business is about well if you tell anybody

[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:21.240]
nobody will believe you there's another area not only our parents not doing a good enough job

[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:25.660]
of teaching their kids right from wrong like you don't kill people or put pipe bombs in your mailbox

[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:29.860]
but also they don't tell them I mean I know we keep hearing that they tell them these things but

[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:34.220]
I'm not so sure it's they're getting across that if somebody touches you in an inappropriate place

[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:38.660]
immediately tell us call a police run for help screen bloody murder something like that I just

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:43.220]
don't think that's getting done enough what's an inappropriate place like church like in the rectum

[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:48.100]
ry would be an inappropriate place you know exactly what I'm talking about in an inappropriate way

[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:52.240]
and an inappropriate place like between the navel and the knees would probably be a good definition

[02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:57.820]
or in the case of a female between the knees and the armpits the whole thing is the pits if you

[02:21:57.820 --> 02:22:02.000]
ask me and it just yeah and you can't get across to the public because so many of you are so brainwashed

[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.500]
and so deeply ingrained in you since you were not even old enough to really think for yourself

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:09.660]
it's hopeless it's just a hopeless case they're the greatest propagandist in the world

[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:13.500]
and I ever protested again from a girl I don't think I don't think sorry look for the QA and van

[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:41.200]

[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:55.520]
is down a little bit and the faxes you know this last couple of days and i couldn't be wrong about

[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:59.300]
that we just could be going through a lull phase that could be but i don't think so huh you're

[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:03.300]
just paranoid no i'm not the least bit paranoid i'm not worried about that but the fact of the

[02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:07.300]
matter is that i think taken a calls that there was a bad mistake instead of what davighan says

[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.040]

[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.600]
he was mentioned to do i'm i'm i'm too embarrassed to admit this i can't i can't say it say it

[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:39.460]
she was married at one time i remember she came out of the closet on the uh

[02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:44.160]
tonight show on johnny karson no and said that she was bisexual which is which in those days

[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:48.340]
that was about as close to like elton john said the same thing i'm bisexual like anybody would

[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:56.320]
leave it anyway i had a wife you know yeah i know german german acrobat ah what was the name of

[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.200]

[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:06.620]
feet it's all the stress at last couple weeks anyway so she was but can i say it just please please

[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:13.380]
stop mumbling i'm going to agree with Greg Greg hey the uh name of the movie was uh with matla

[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:18.280]
tanzi what that was the name of that movie my tutor okay remember that movie yes i remember it

[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:21.520]
very well in fact i saw it just a few weeks ago was on again i always watched it when it's on

[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.580]
because he's running around naked in there and his uh his tutor was pretty good she was okay yeah

[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:30.480]
little old for him i thought but nevertheless why not i think that was the idea yeah matla tanzi

[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:34.760]
so anyway matla tanzi he kind of talked like this now i don't want to say matla tanzi just because he

[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.940]
had a very high squeaky voice and acted very fake i don't want to say that he was like you know like

[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:44.680]
that like melophers but when you see that it was a very you know now guess who else talks just like

[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.140]
that who's a big strapping guy who looks like you know who's probably about the same age at matla

[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:55.840]
tanzi wasn't it like 25 guess who else sounds just like that like Tyson no i'm serious so

[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:03.480]
i like here of tom welling oh no i hadn't noticed that about tom well no he talks he talks in much

[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:08.200]
too high of a register and i find that very disturbing he reminds me i'm talking about vocally

[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:13.040]
he reminds me very much of matla tanzi rhymes with pansy and see there would be people out there saying

[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:17.580]
well you should hope that no i don't hope that i want i want Clark Kent to be virile and you know

[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:22.420]
all all of the things you see what i'm saying i want him to be a real man not a man's man i want him

up with these millions and millions of dollars which we can't just can't figure out how or why

[02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:44.380]
Ontario candidate and i did browered county by the way my little dog is embarrassed to live in browered

[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:48.300]
county in fact my little dog just uh phoned in and said he's going to start a crap and double

[02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:53.780]
outside from now on just to pollute the air and browered is is that incredible i'm shocked and

[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:58.480]
dismayed way too close to home by the way for some of us and that's not a cool product about them

[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:02.120]
there that's a little thing but i'm not on the air i'm not repeating it though i mean i know

[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:05.980]
it would you but i'm just i'm not given any promotion to that or any credibility to do it but

[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:10.160]
the fact that the browered county chamber commerce is endorsing and welcoming and also promoting

[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:14.760]
them and raising their funds which godoring knows where those funds go but it's very interesting

[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.840]
that shan kroni's got that big expensive home and that they seem to keep coming up with these

[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:22.600]
millions and millions and millions of dollars to keep buying up all these hotel properties

[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:27.080]
well you see this is what's wrong with soft food there's nobody with a conscience man you

[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:30.840]
got crooked politicians you got organizations like the browered county chamber commerce i'm

[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.680]
going to tell you if the brower chamber commerce ever endorsed a business i would i would give it

[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.440]
two cents worth of credibility i would say yeah i wonder who's smearing somebody there now

[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.220]
an absolute disgrace soft food all i can say is hang your heads in shame

[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:48.880]
god you know i had to read that like two or three times you factored during the break and i looked

[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:52.720]
at that or during that bit i was playing i looked at that and i kept looking over and over again

[02:39:52.720 --> 02:40:00.180]
like is this a joke is this some kind of a freaking joke no it's scary how does this guy do it how does

[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:05.600]
he keep pulling a wall over people's eyes big cans of grease that that's another great thing first

[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.860]
of all i don't miss driving because i don't have any car up here which i'm very delighted and i

[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:11.800]
certainly won't have one in Amsterdam because you don't need one here and you don't need one there

[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.480]
so i don't miss the drive and try not to get killed by ancills but i also do miss

[02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:19.380]
stopping at streetlights and being solicited by a bunch of jackasses running around the middle of

[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.700]
the goddamn street like a bunch of little kids who don't know better didn't get out of street corners

[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:26.280]
putting a muscle on me for cash i mean here you got the people sitting on the streets

[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.480]
spare some change mister and you just you know keep walking you know and paying attention

[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:33.500]
and don't anybody give me a song and a dance about my being insensitive to homeless people because we

[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:38.180]
raised a crapload hundreds and hundreds of thousands for the committals house years ago on this show

[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:42.340]
for homeless people all i'm sure glad that i stopped doing that you know because i wouldn't want to

[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:46.600]
see that money going to the to bribe people to cover up for pedophiles i don't think we want to see

[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:51.700]
money that we raised being used for that purpose but it's just the idea that this is so obvious it's

[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:55.640]
so transparent at what it's really all about and the brown county chamber commerce obviously

[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:59.840]
really checking into things very carefully before you know endorsing somebody and raising money for

[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.040]
them shame on you coxle hoist that's my message for the brown county chamber commerce okay and now

[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:10.540]
and now where did that come from the fax machine they fax that to us no somebody did somebody found

[02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:14.960]
this in other words they obviously stuck this on somebody's window or in a door there's a little

[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:20.020]

support for you okay i'm all for the homeless all right nobody should have to be homeless but the

[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:34.100]
idea that these cults that come along these other shady shisters that come down to pike shady

[02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:39.880]
shady shisters fact let's open a place called shady shisters sounds good to me i guarantee a south

[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:53.320]
dial a mattress these are great people i know because i do business with them every time the

[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:56.820]
mattress wears out which of course is not like every five minutes because a mattress is not something

[02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:00.540]
like you know underwear that you change every few days a mattress is something that hopefully

[02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:04.100]
last you for years when you get a really good one but even the best of mattresses get lumpy

[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:07.760]
and bumpy and more not you get a sore back you feel like crap if you want to get you a great new

[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:11.160]

at dial a mattress like i do call one eight hundred mattress there's no way in the world to beat

[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:18.300]
their deals you don't have to leave the house you don't have to run around wasting a lot of gas

[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:22.560]
and certainly not money because they have every day unbelievably low prices on the top manufacturers

[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:27.040]
in the universe they got serta and celi simons and king coil and a really deep selection

[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.740]
so they won't have to give you the old bait and swish and they also give you that 30 day in

[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:34.220]
