[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600]
Now!

[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.280]
Now the Neil Roger Show on 516 W2 AM.

[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.940]
We have to be the police.

[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.540]
The irregularities can keep you tied up and not.

[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.160]
Why haven't CEPT in a week feels like a gun and German shimper it in my call?

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.640]
But you don't need to be a regular.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.520]
I see we dynamite it!

[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.760]
All you need is co-layers.

[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.620]
Why is the German Shepherd?

[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.580]
Take Doctor recommended co-layers for gentle regularities.

[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.660]
901 at 560 WQA. I'm happy Thursday to you.

[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.720]
I'll tell you, why don't we even discuss anything besides a star-dreck?

[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.900]
Huh? What's the point?

[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.360]
Star Wars, I'm sorry.

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.540]
Is there any point?

[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.520]
I don't know if you can hear us just fine, but we can't hear ourselves.

[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.720]
But apparently we're on the air.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.220]
I hear you just fine.

[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.100]
You hear me just fine?

[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920]
We're not getting audio from ourselves or from you.

[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.060]
We can barely hear you.

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.560]
Everything is just great.

[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.640]
But apparently on the air.

[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.460]
And now it's all back again on like we did before.

[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.300]
Something must be messed up in a main controller because I'm hearing everything like in feedback.

[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.920]
Well let's do the whole show like this.

[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.940]
You hear that?

[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.340]
Okay, I can barely hear it.

[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.960]
It sounds like I can't even tell you.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.560]
So what would you suggest now that I'm hearing myself back?

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880]
It's in a master control again.

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.640]
Somebody's dicked with a switch again.

[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.680]
Keep talking apparently you sound fine.

[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.580]
I'm just not going to be able to hear what you're saying.

[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.420]
When you say I sound fine, I'm hearing myself back like half a second later.

[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.340]
Real, real loud.

[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.020]
So whatever, what somebody is dicked with something there because every, we were, you know, the thing that amazes me about this is that we sit around, we talk from 730 until just before 9 o'clock every morning.

[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.200]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880]
And then all of a sudden like about the minute before we go on the air.

[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.320]
Hello?

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.020]
Hello? What?

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.700]
This ain't going to work.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100]
I'll tell you that right now because you've got something really desperately screwed up down there.

[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.260]
I don't know what to tell you.

[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.580]
We're running around like crazy people.

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.240]
Well, there's nothing on this end.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.620]
Everything looks as normal like we do it every day.

[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.300]
It's just amazing to me how it's always on that end.

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.200]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.460]
Always on that end.

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.820]
Now is that, as that repeat going on the air, do we have any idea?

[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.320]
Is there anybody in the building at QAM where they're all losing their minds?

[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.300]
Is there anybody there?

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.540]
No.

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.520]
Anybody in Toronto?

[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.080]
Engineers?

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.500]
No.

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.180]
Program director?

[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.460]
Oh.

[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.000]
Anybody that has a clue, General Manager, I'm sorry, I said anybody with a clue.

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.800]
See, I can't keep doing this because I'll hear myself back real out of my monitor.

[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.720]
And then they're going to work.

[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.320]
So what would you suggest?

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.660]
Should we play a little bit of music?

[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.900]

[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.220]
Maybe you should play some music.

[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.460]
Or I say.

[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.700]
I mean, how is this possible?

[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.380]
But we're just talking like I don't know.

[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.540]

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.040]
So we know it's not going on in these studios here because just like you said,

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120]
it was fine before we went on the air.

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.780]
So something's going on in the control room.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.360]
Because I hear you just fine, but I hear myself back.

[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.120]
So somebody is dicked again in the control room one more time,

[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.520]
where they just can't keep their hands off the switches.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.060]
Don't forget there was this again.

[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.060]
Oh.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.560]
I say maybe we just cancel the show.

[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.160]
I think that's a real good idea.

[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.640]
It's kind of murky here anyway, dripping a little bit, pouring like crazy there.

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.320]
I mean, I can do it like four hours like this, but I'm just going to drive me.

[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.240]
They're going to take me away in a straight jacket, because I'm hearing everything back like we're allowed.

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.580]
In fact, I don't even know at this point if I'm on the air or not.

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.360]
Am I on the air?

[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.120]
You're on the air.

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.020]
I see.

[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.280]
And is that all coming back a second time like I'm hearing it?

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.500]
I'm on the phone at the same time.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.580]
I see.

[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.780]
With George.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.860]
Join the overnight guys.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.460]
Joe and Mark.

[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.340]
This is like back the old WABC days with a reverb.

[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340]
I feel like cousin Goosey would off the bed here piece.

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.420]
Join the overnight guys.

[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.880]
Joe and Mark have Gatsby's in Boca tonight, 79pm.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.240]
And ask them how come this place is such a technical disaster.

[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.840]
Stop by for prizes.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.400]
Register in a trip to Lake Tahoe.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.580]
The Bex models will be there with specials on Bex Beer.

[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.240]
Gatsby's in Boca on now.

[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.540]
Feels like we're all 18th street between military and power line.

[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.500]
And what are we learning?

[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.800]
What are we discerning and what are we learning from our crack engineering staff?

[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.380]
Definitely there is something amiss in the master control because we've been through this a million times.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.520]
Sounds like sabotage to me.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.280]
Uh huh.

[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.560]
Uh huh.

[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.680]
Uh huh.

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.640]
Uh huh.

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.420]
Uh huh.

[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.380]
I want to repeat something.

[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.200]
I just hit it once and like see there it is again.

[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.440]
You're getting double duty today for the same price.

[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.780]
So am I just supposed to continue?

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.300]
Uh I mean this is ludicrous is what it really is.

[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.820]
Yeah, you're just supposed to continue.

[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.120]
Continue what?

[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.240]
I can't continue.

[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.820]
I can't possibly do a show here and myself like twice as loud back a half a second later.

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.960]
No chance.

[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.140]
We are working on a solution to that.

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.240]
Well, how can there be a problem?

[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.260]
Where the hell did this come from?

[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.020]
See this is the amazing thing.

[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.940]
The people who listen to WQA and who've told them about it a million times.

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.300]
Usually it's on a Monday.

[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.780]
It's usually after the weekend with a bit of about 20 children who've had a chance to dick with all the controls in there and play games like a bunch of little children.

[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.760]
And then we come in and everything is like a pochki with an un, you know, doesn't work.

[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.800]
But now like out of nowhere the show yesterday was fine.

[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.780]
We've been rolling right along singing a song.

[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.420]
We talked back and forth this morning.

[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.140]
No problems from like 740 until five minutes to line.

[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.820]
And then all of a sudden when you least expected we got some kind of a problem.

[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.000]
And it can't possibly be on this end.

[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.580]
I'll tell you that right now boys and girls it's not on this end.

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.000]
It's there at QIM.

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.100]
Well, they're troubleshooting it as we speak.

[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.440]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.380]
They're troubleshooting it.

[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.780]
What does that mean?

[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.780]

[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.100]
I mean, what does that mean?

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.040]
It's on the phone in the control room with Robert Grieper and they're trying to figure out, you know, one button at a time.

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.620]
What's pressed?

[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.160]
It should be pressed through what time it is.

[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.760]
Is that show on our list one button at a time?

[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.360]
Oh, ought to be.

[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.620]
I see.

[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160]
Oh

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.280]
Oh, I think we got it solved.

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.260]
There you go.

[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.540]
Really?

[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.780]
They did something then.

[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.920]
See, the reason I could tell is because when you hit the, see it only did it once.

[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.700]
So I could tell it wasn't like, uh, so what did they do?

[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.820]
Was it in there in master control?

[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.840]
Of course it's back in there again.

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.520]
I'm sitting in here and Miguel's running around, but yeah, it's in master control.

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.040]
In master control again.

[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.020]
Now, we've got a real major problem there at WQM.

[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.720]
Let me see it again.

[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.380]
Some people in that master control room keep dicking with stuff.

[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.760]
Just like in the middle of the day, I'll come in here and do a little bit of work in my nice little studio.

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.720]
And I'll notice that the audio from QAIM isn't coming in again.

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.780]
I'll have to call the control room down there and say, hey, whichever you assholes is on here,

[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.800]
how come that pot is closed?

[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.680]
Uh, the, like that.

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.820]
And then all of a sudden, here it is like, like magic when they open a pot again.

[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.420]
Too much bad pot of QAIM, that's the problem.

[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.660]
That was special.

[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.060]
That was really something special.

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.180]
So is everything okay now?

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:35.980]
We kosher or what?

[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.140]
You tell us.

[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.200]
Everything sounds fine here.

[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.020]
Sounds fine here.

[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.100]
Sounds like me.

[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.920]
It sounds like you.

[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.220]
I'm not hearing that feedback again.

[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.820]
I personally think I'd like to know who the hell was in there.

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.100]
I don't want to make start a big inquisition because we've already had enough of those recently.

[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.320]
But I'd like to know who was in there dicking with stuff.

[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.700]
And it happened in about five minutes before the hour.

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.880]
Remember you started mumbling to me about you couldn't hear me and all of that?

[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:58.740]
Yeah.

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.660]
That doesn't mean that something happened this morning.

[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.960]
This could have been done overnight afternoon and it just, we didn't figure it out until now.

[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.500]
Until we switched to show mode.

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.580]
I see show mode.

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.220]
Show mode.

[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.000]
Okay. So anyway, let's say we're in hell.

[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.620]
Why start now?

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.460]
I mean, it's only nine minutes after the hour.

[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.960]
Almost ready for the first goddamn break.

[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.720]
This is beautiful.

[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.700]
And let me say it again.

[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.760]
People are going to be a few assholes are going to say you see when you don't do the show from end to end.

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.300]
There's no reason for it.

[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.060]
There's a, this should be like I keep telling you like rolling off a goddamn log.

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.780]
Like falling out of bed in the morning.

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.880]
Like falling off a goddamn out of an igloo.

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.420]
But when you got, when you got a kind of a place where there's nobody where it's on automatic pilot,

[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.320]
when it's like the Titanic had drifted.

[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.580]
It's somewhere and you know, got a gigantic leak all over the place.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.700]
Too many fingers in there. Too many chillin.

[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.920]
That's the problem in Q.A.M.

[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.260]
Too many children pochking around, didlin' with crap. Too many fingers in the broth.

[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.820]
That's the biggest problem.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.320]
Anyway, yesterday we did our second part and we're compiling our top 50.

[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.140]
That'll be the list today.

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.900]
Don't have to worry about faxing in any more suggestions for it.

[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.360]
About calling in because we're certainly not taking call.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.920]
Oh, especially after that start.

[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.480]
Nine minutes of pure hell.

[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.860]
Although it was kind of like I'm using it at its moment.

[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.380]
Yeah.

[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.820]
Hey, listen, if you can hear what it sounded like here.

[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.960]
The goodness sounded worse than what it sounded like here.

[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.780]
No, I'm sure that's what it's on.

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.100]
These studios, although everybody kept saying, oh no, it's fine.

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.720]
In the control room, it's fine on the air.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.380]
No, it was not fine on the air.

[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.440]
It couldn't possibly have been fine on the air because it was feeding back to me a second time.

[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.780]
Well, I'm not going to go through any of the short.

[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.740]
Anyway, it's the QAMF and Way boys and girls.

[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.820]
That's just the way we do things here on this radio station.

[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.220]
Not slow, not fast, just half fast.

[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.020]
The greatest TV show of all time.

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.500]
TV guys started this thing a few days ago and in the Hank and the mobile picked up on it and milked it for a little bit.

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.160]
But we're going to show you that we can milk it better than anybody.

[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.580]
Although we're not really going to do a show about it today.

[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.440]
We're just going to like stick to 50 on there.

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.040]
Our 50 and then we'll pick the top 20 out of those 50.

[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.060]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.560]
Good.

[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.480]
Here's what came out the top 25 yesterday out of that lengthy list of 50 that we had.

[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.740]
And amazingly, many of the shows that were in a TV guide top 50, according to their experts and perverts,

[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.940]
didn't even come close to making it.

[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.760]
Like American family, which we still have no idea what that is, that had two votes.

[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.380]
Donnie who, two votes, playhouse 90.

[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.240]
Who the hell remembers that?

[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.480]
It was a great show, but three votes.

[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.240]
Meet the press.

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.340]
We thought that would get a lot of votes.

[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:27.920]
Three votes.

[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.760]
Nightline, which they put on their four votes for Nightline.

[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.020]
I mean, are these people crazy or what?

[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.920]
Yes, God.

[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.780]
So we'll give you the list in a second and we'll have Eric put it up there and then you go dittle with it and you know,

[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.960]
and we'll have a little fun with it.

[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.560]
And never the twain shall meet.

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.880]
We apologize profusely for our technical and up to you, don't we?

[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.080]
No.

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.580]
No, we don't. You're used to it.

[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.920]
12 minutes after 9 at 5.60 WQ, I'm here's a simple question for you.

[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.200]
If somebody offered to give you just hand over to you several thousand dollars over the next few years,

[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.560]
I am positive you'd take it.

[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.660]
It'll be a little bit stupid not to take it, which makes it really stupid to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at just 3.95%.

[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.240]
Here's the deal.

[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.820]
There's a Fannie Mae program available at 3.95% for both refinancing and purchasing of homes.

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.560]
Think of it just 3.95%.

[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.960]
Now you have to do is call financial group and 1-800-94053-63.

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.560]
That's 1-800-94053-63.

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:30.260]
To give you an example, you can get yourself 100 grand with payments of only $475 a month or get you 200 grand with payments of only $950 a month.

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.140]
You'll save yourself a crap load of money.

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.820]
So it'll be downright stupid to pass up a chance like that.

[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.720]
Do the math and do the smart thing, get the details by calling financial group toll free no less.

[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.300]
Call it at 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.720]
That's 1-800-94053-63.

[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.220]

As we said at the beginning of the show today, they made the Force be with you.

[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.240]
And I think we were 917-560 WDQAM.

[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.020]
George Sostar was a part 85 already and said,

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.320]
it was pretty good.

[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.300]
It was adequate better than the first, but that's not saying much.

[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.760]
Well, I got 700 reviews of it, but I'll pick out the best one that I got here from-

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.480]
What is this from?

[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.480]
CNN.com.

[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.460]
It's okay.

[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.940]
It's well worth going to see.

[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.100]
Okay, let your kids drag you along and go see it.

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.900]
It'll kill some good time.

[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:02.780]
Also, it'll be a long one like an epic real long and that doesn't really get going good until the second half, but then it gets good.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.860]
Yeah, so in other words, bring a book in a flashlight.

[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.140]
Bring a Playboy in a flashlight and the kids.

[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.080]

[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.240]
Okay, here's the 25 survivors from today and I'll give you the 25 from yesterday.

[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.680]
We'll make sure that we got the same 50.

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.000]
We'll put it on the damn website and then you can do it with it.

[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.240]

[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.060]
I just mentioned that.

[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.120]
There's no A in Fugitive.

[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.660]
I just passed that along just for what?

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.200]
It's worth, Eric.

[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.180]
I mean, I realized that you're very picky about your spelling.

[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.000]
So get it right.

[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.520]
And then the 25 we had from yesterday from, are you keeping up with this?

[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.500]
Are we following this or what?

[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.820]

We know how to kill time better than anybody in the world on this show.

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.500]
We're killing.

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.300]

You know that.

[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:43.120]
FBI director Robert Mueller repeatedly has said he wished the FBI had acted more aggressively in addressing the Arizona Minnesota leads, but said nothing.

[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.500]
The FBI possessed the 4911 pointed the multiple airliner hijacking club.

[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.580]
The FBI wouldn't know a goddamn hijacker.

[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.680]
If he walked right in with a guy named Gunn at their forehead and said stick him up asshole and let me a sit at the controls.

[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.300]
They wouldn't get it.

The FBI to make a long story short blows 926 and 560 WQM here.

[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.380]
I'll tell you something else that blows and that's running around all over town in the hot and the heat and of course in the rain.

[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.860]
What's the point?

[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:22.240]
What's the point of getting soaked and running from one expensive department store to some stupid bedding store when you can just sit right there in your nice comfortable room unless you got a leak in the roof and called the allometrist 1 800 mattress like I always do.

[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.840]
Every few years even the best mattress in the world wears out.

[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.260]
It gets lumpy and bumpy and crappy and not gonna last forever and as a result your back starts giving you the message it's time for a great new mattress.

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:37.520]
So just make that one easy call to 1 800 mattress and pick out the cert of the Seagulli the Simmons King Cray mattress that you like and want.

[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:46.540]
They'll have it in stock ready for almost immediate delivery because when you call dial amateurs you pick the day and the to our window for your delivery when it's going to be convenient for you any day the week seven days.

[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:56.700]
Some other companies make you sit on your ass all day and then you'll be lucky if they show up not a dial amateurs you pick the to our window like 11 to 1 2 to 4 3 to 5 at 7 so on 5 to 7 30.

[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:04.020]
You also get a 30 day home comfort guarantee so you can test your mattress the right way by sleeping on it and doing your thing on it to see if it's exactly the one you want.

[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.000]
If not no problem though they'll swap it for you.

[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.860]
Nobody can match the dial amateurs is every day low prices either.

[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.120]
So instead of getting soaked or spits in your brains out just make the one easy call.

[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:21.600]
They'll be knocking on the door no time at all you'll be sleeping like a shy all the soon as tonight call 1 800 mattress 1 800 MATTR ES or check them on the wicked worldwide.

[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.820]

[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:24.020]

[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.040]

[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:43.240]

[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.480]

[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:10.740]
Ricardo Jose Garcia, 37, was accused last year performing oral sex on a child under 12.

[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:39.720]
Under Florida law, he'd face a life sentence of convicted and often offense against the victim that young.

[02:13:46.740 --> 02:14:09.120]
He'd face a life sentence of convicted and often offense against the victim that young.

[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:16.960]
The child's mother testified on Monday she'd be satisfied of Garcia only spent a couple years in prison according to court testimony, police detectives recommended the same.

[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:27.240]
Florida's castration law took effect in 1997. The law makes chemical castration mandatory for repeat sex offenders and gives judges discretion to impose the punishment on first-time molesters.

[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:30.800]
A judge cannot order surgical castration but defendants can volunteer.

[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:39.340]
Garcia's attorney's argue that the law allows a shorter sentence with physical castration. Prosecutor David Shapiro said he'll push for a life sentence.

[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:45.300]
He'll contend that state law says neither chemical nor surgical castration can be reduced to use to reduce prison terms.

[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:52.340]
A judge in Ocalusa County in the Florida Panhandle handed on sentences in 1999 and 2000 along the low end of state guidelines.

[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:55.520]
The three defendants have agreed to be surgically castrated.

[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:11.320]
When a doubt, when a doubt snippet, Ma'am, baby, let's see, Chris, oh, you have to be joking me.

[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:18.900]
If this is true, that Norma can't call the Mr. Vigo show this morning, I will never speak to that child again in my life.

[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:26.720]
Says Chris, who's a 17-year-old listener? Do you think somebody who's a lawyer listened to this show would not make that up?

[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.700]
I don't want to think about it.

[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.840]
Storm in Norman? I don't want to think about it.

[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:35.760]
In fact, you know something I want to talk about, I'm now or to him.

[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:44.380]
Anyway, mob muscles in on market. This keeping in mind that your person wants to let you take and gamble away your social security money when you're a young person.

[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:49.680]
So that by the time you get to be like a retirement age, you'll have nothing left like the in-round people. Just gamble it away.

[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:53.880]
In fact, how about three-plane tickets to Vegas is a better idea. At least you'll have a good time there.

[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.740]
You'll come home broke, but you'll have a great time.

[02:15:58.600 --> 02:15:59.980]
This is from the Daily News.

[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:07.140]
When Robert Gallo applied to be a registered stockbroker, he mentioned his only previous experience was as a labor foreman.

[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:12.800]
He didn't say anything about his repeater dissociation with one of the nation's largest crime families, New York's Gen of AC clan.

[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:16.800]
Mafia runs stock market firms focused on violence and ripping off clients.

[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:25.860]
Once Gallo joined the Monitor Investment Group by 20 exchange plays, he acted in a manner more consistent with the character in the sopranos than someone who keeps track of the Moneyline News Hour.

[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.700]
On June 14th, Gallo was indicted along with 119 others in the biggest securities fraud case in US history.

[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:39.000]
Since then, law enforcement officials and financial regulators come to believe the mob's influence on Wall Street may be even greater than they once suspected.

[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:48.980]
The five New York Mafia families say authorities have figured out that the current bull market has made it right for the picking of official see increasing cooperation among crime families to divide up the Wall Street pie.

[02:16:49.780 --> 02:17:00.020]
They're getting more together said very more on director of FBI's New York office. They're apt to be taking advantage of the good times. They know how we look at them if they can branch out in a new area where not as aware that's their advantage.

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:08.960]
Investigators, prosecutors and regulators with the National Association of Securities dealers and the SEC all agree that the mob has lurked at the margins of Wall Street for years.

[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:16.660]
But now for the first time prosecutors say a mob boss is receiving a per share mob tax in a tax stock scam.

[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:28.580]
Alphonse Alley Boy Pursico, reputed acting boss of the Colombo Crime Family is getting six cents for every share of the mob secretly controls in various pump and dump schemes prosecutors allege. Pump and dump.

[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:33.320]
Assisted US Attorney Patrick, what's your Cecil knows about that pump and dump?

[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:47.420]
Assisted US Attorney Patrick Smith was leading the 120 defendant mob on Wall Street case from Manhattan, US Attorney Mary Jo White said the money is funneled through Pursico's cousin Frank Pursico a registered broker since the end of the last bull market 1988.

[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:59.160]
Frank Pursico and alleged Colombo associate along with Gallowand Vincent Langella, another reputed Colombo associate represents the new breed of rising mafia star, the Wise Guy Broker.

[02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:07.080]
A review of their resumes reveals a trail of fraud as they jump from one scam brokerage house to another all three of them indicted in very security fraud schemes.

[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:24.020]
For instance, from January 1989 through December 92 Pursico worked at AS Golden Company, he jumped to JW Berkeley from March 1993 through February of 1994, then to Myers Pollock Robbins to June 1995, then he moved to William Scott in company through November 97, then to First Liberty Investment Group.

[02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:31.420]
All of these firms have been implicated in massive fraud and investigations by the Manhattan District Attorney, the Manhattan US Attorney in the SEC.

[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.660]
A look at the history of these mob connected brokerage houses shows how they operate within a few blocks of one another in the heart of Wall Street.

[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:43.840]
There the crime families of New York who often can't agree on anything forged temporary and fragile alliances to make money.

[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:53.580]
At 17 state street from 1993 through 96 white rock investments was a co-op agreement between the Banana Colombo and Genovacy families according to Brooklyn Federal prosecutors.

[02:18:53.580 --> 02:19:02.860]
At 30 broad street in 1996 and 97 Myers Pollock Robbins was controlled by the same allegiance of Banana Colombo and Genovacy families according to court papers.

[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:10.880]
At 80 broad street, 84 William Street in 1996, First Liberty became a joint venture between the Banana and Colombo crime families prosecutor Smith said.

[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:21.300]
And most recently, in 1998 through last June, DMN Capital Investments at 5 Handover Square was run by the Banana and Gambino families and indictment brought by Manhattan Federal Grand Jury alleges.

[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:29.080]
Investigators say Wall Street is a perfect spot for La Cosa Nostra strong arm tactics. The mob is threatening white collar yuppies not long-shoremen or teamsters.

[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:36.900]
Typically, mobsters muscle in on a small brokerage house, then set up boiler rooms to hard sell stock and classic pump and dump schemes.

[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:48.460]
Gangsters secretly own stock and worthless companies. They pay off corrupt brokers and stock promoters to pump up the stock's value by telling unwitting investors a company is about to go public or win a huge contractor be brought up by major firm.

[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:56.940]
When the value rises significantly, they dump the stocks on mass, forcing the stock value to plummet and leaving in the lurch unwitting investors who often are senior citizens.

[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:10.680]
When the scheme is exposed, they move on to another questionable firm. I call it the maggot runs that one regulator who spoke on condition of anonymity, brokers go from one sleazy firm to the next, they rip people off and then they move on before they get caught or sued.

[02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:18.960]
At DMN Capital and Head over Square, former employees spoke to the Daily News on Condition of An Inimity, described the atmosphere as one big party.

[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:26.680]
Run by be reputed Gambino associate James LaBaudin, Banana Associate Salvatore Piazza and Jeffrey Pokross, how the hell they get in there.

[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:35.580]
DMN frequently threw parties with hookers at Midtown Hotels, spending wildly as it scammed unsuspecting investors through hard sell tactics and the former DMN employee.

[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:41.340]
Prosecutors alleged that to keep the party going, the gangsters kept stock promoters in line by threats of violence.

[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:52.780]
When one promoter was suspected by DMN's gangster principles of being an informal LaBaudin who's not a broker, allegedly knocked them out with one punch, then stripped off his shirt to see if he was wearing a recording device according to prosecutor Smith.

[02:20:53.400 --> 02:21:03.020]
Like many of the mob run firms, there inevitably came a day when there was a falling out among thieves, at DMN Colombo Associate Persequio shot up a DMN computer when he decided he'd been ripped off Smith says.

[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:07.240]
Admires Pollock, a six-four-gen of AC associate slapped a broker in the face.

[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:19.340]
The broker saw it help from a banana associate and both families arranged a February 12, 1997 sit down at the Abraccio Mento with had a restaurant near Canarcy, Pier and Brooklyn, best to be in the city.

[02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:21.780]
Yeah, Abraccio Mento.

[02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:27.440]
As a result prosecutor, maybe they should have had the aid in a Louison of Bronx instead.

[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.620]
You know, I hear the veils better there.

[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:35.520]
As a result prosecutor's alleged Devinano family agreed to let the Genebacy Family Control, Myers Pollock Pollock.

[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:39.140]
At Monitor Investment Group, the pump and dumps can begin to fall apart.

[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:42.220]
When one of the stock brokers was beaten, decided to fight back with a lawsuit.

[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:49.620]
Registered broker Robert Grant, who now lives in an undisclosed location in fear of mob revenge, said in court papers he'd been working at a monitor for several months.

[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:52.860]
When broker Robert Gallaud told him there was a staff meeting in the conference room.

[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:58.940]
On January 1996, Grant and a coworker walked in without warning for no stated reason or attacked.

[02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:02.660]
Gallaud won five other brokers beat the two men with fist and kicked them to the floor.

[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:05.720]
One man was plugged with an office chair. The other was a bit in on the back.

[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:11.920]
Grant later taped Gallaud, who apologized for the beating, but said he believed Grant was about to skip to another firm and take customers with him.

[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:15.780]
He then recited a dialogue that could have come from just about any mob movie imaginable.

[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:19.640]
The way he used carried yourselves, that he was looking to do the wrong thing to us.

[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:24.500]
He said, sometimes you know cooler heads don't prevail, but unfortunately, you know, it's nothing personal between me and you.

[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:26.800]
In other words, it's not personal. It's only business.

[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:34.020]
Four minutes before noon at 5.60 WQA.

[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:41.820]
Summer times a panya, baby. On these when it's not pouring cats and dogs, it's 110 degrees in the shade and from what everybody says, it's going to be brutal this summer.

[02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:51.340]
Saturday night on CBS, eat it, it's back from the dead.

[02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:54.100]
It's the 20th anniversary of all in the family.

[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:58.200]
All rookie dead. If it ain't John Jell-O-Weez.

[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:01.200]
Daddy, don't be such a courty.

[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:04.580]
Now what ever happened to my little girl? Look at this.

[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:07.320]
Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh?

[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:09.320]
Maybe have a salad once in a while?

[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:13.920]
Daddy, don't you know how many of the world's people have never had a decent meal?

[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:16.540]
Again with the charity Spieladzi.

[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:17.600]
Well, it's true.

[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.300]
So, why don't you send them the bones from the turkey you had for breakfast?

[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:22.360]
Oh, what a move.

[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:26.440]
I could warm it up.

[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:28.140]
Oh, she...

[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:28.920]
I'm dead.

[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:30.500]
She did that.

[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.420]
I thought she was pushing up days, you smile.

[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.420]
Oh, now watching.

[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:37.560]
The last episode was all a band dream.

[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:39.120]
And same show, bad to me.

[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:41.140]
Look, who was it back there, David?

[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:43.740]
Who's today off? You can get me another beer.

[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:45.060]
Oh, okay.

[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:47.720]
That's 20th anniversary of all in the family.

[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:49.140]
Saturday night on CBS.

[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:52.600]
Brought to you by IBS Home Carrespondent School,

[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:56.980]
where you can learn auto mechanics, gut repair, and back to school.

[02:24:56.980 --> 02:24:58.000]
I'll just guide you to the subway.

[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.900]
Probably one of the reasons I played that is all in the family just jumped ahead.

[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.760]
It's still really tight all in the family 55.

[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:06.280]
The best TV show of all time.

[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:08.280]
This is our runoff today on eoranges.com.

[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:10.160]
This is our final tally.

[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.020]
We're looking at for all we can get.

[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.500]
All in the family 55, Simpson's 51,

[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.620]
Max 36 and Seinfeld 33 and after that, it's...

[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:18.900]
Wait on the list.

[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:24.120]
So here's George saying, by the way, something that my broker connection was a storyline in the surprise last season.

[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.300]
It was just like the story I read.

[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:28.620]
If the brokers didn't go along with the program, the goons beat the Schmidt out of them.

[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:29.480]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:30.940]
Way ahead of its time.

[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:34.020]
Although, obviously, that was going on for a long time before we got that story.

[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:36.800]
See, during that break there, I'm just thinking to myself,

[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:41.740]
there's another even better similarity between Vegas and the stock market is the fact that it's rigged.

[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.520]
It's rigged.

[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:43.940]
Right.

[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:45.580]
And the little guy hasn't got a chance.

[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:46.560]
I mean, you might get lucky.

[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.620]
You know, some people got lucky during the internet bubble and they just happen to get into the right time.

[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:52.320]
And maybe they were smart enough to get out of that.

[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.160]
That's just blind luck.

[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:55.240]
Like in Vegas, you can win in Vegas.

[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:56.460]
You know, you get lucky, for sure.

[02:25:56.580 --> 02:26:00.000]
If you win too much, of course, speaking of breaking your legs, they don't get too happy about it.

[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:02.260]
They don't like guys that come in there.

[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.180]
Wise guys, and you know, and win too much money so that they bring out their own wise guys.

[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:08.620]
That's just the way it is.

[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:09.540]
It's a big scam.

[02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:16.800]
And anybody who doesn't believe that, I mean, when you sit and you watch this stuff that goes on and you see the mad,

[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:22.180]
the way that these things are manipulated and the wild, massive swings that take place, little people aren't doing that.

[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:23.260]
No.

[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.820]
No, some 78-year-old woman who's hoping to make a few bucks so she can pay for prescription drugs in the Vuec Iowa somewhere,

[02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:31.320]
she's not manipulating the market.

[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:32.620]
I'm not manipulating it.

[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:37.180]
George ain't manipulating it with his little 25-cent stocks there on the NASDAQ.

[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.760]
And we sit and we watch the ticker every day and it's a part of our lives.

[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.500]
It's right now where there's that fault-headed asshole, Ari Fleischer.

[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:46.200]
You're hoarding on threat.

[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:47.100]
Yeah, threat this.

[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:54.140]
And the little tickers are in the corner, NASDAQ's down 2.44 and the Dow's up a few points, but not too much and it'll go down.

[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:59.420]
And no matter where you turn to, pretty soon it's going to be on the goddamn comedy channel.

[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:03.220]
Every channel, it's going to be like mandatory that you have that honor.

[02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:06.240]
It's like a it's like a it's a blimable thing like a president would say.

[02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:09.100]
To keep it in your head so like, oh, let's better run.

[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:10.860]
Look at that. Look at the bargains that are waiting for us now.

[02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:11.400]
Right.

[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:15.540]
Look at the Cisco at 16 bucks.

[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:17.020]
Look at Oracle at 8 bucks.

[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:22.280]
Look at some microsystems like $7.3 or something like that and palm it to 1.5 bucks.

[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:26.820]
Look at all these great companies that are supposed to be the best goddamn thing that money can buy.

[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:28.580]
This is a way to retire man.

[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:30.800]
This is a way to invest so you really make the big bucks.

[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:31.220]
Isn't that?

[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:31.500]
No.

[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:33.640]
The scam. It's a fraud.

[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.300]
And in the meantime, they intellectualize it and therefore it makes it and they have all these pundits on there.

[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:40.860]
And David Faber says this and Joe Kernan says that.

[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:42.660]
Emoria Bartir, oh, a bad aroma.

[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:47.000]
She says this and blinks her eyes and winking and blicking and nodding and like,

[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:49.360]
ah, you know, with the inflection of the voice,

[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.040]
wind her pressure, wind her pressure.

[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:56.680]
I say it ought to be against the law for them to put those down.

[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:59.140]
If you want to watch the gambling channels, be my guest.

[02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:01.460]
The CNNFN and CNBC, that's it.

[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.900]
And if MSNBC wants to put it on there because they're rating suck anyway and they're desperate,

[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.120]
maybe they can put it on there.

[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:10.240]
Any other network that puts it on there, take it off ought to be against the law.

[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:12.340]
It's depressing. It's demoralizing.

[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.620]
Well, what is it accomplished for us?

[02:28:15.700 --> 02:28:16.520]
Does it tell you anything?

[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.320]
I mean, is it the, you going to do anything about it?

[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:18.800]
No.

[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.040]
Now, nothing you can do about it.

[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:27.880]
Retired clubhouse, Red Sox Clubhouse Manager plays guilty as sex abuse.

[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:32.580]
In Bartow, oh, that's, you ever been to Bartow? You've been through there, I bet.

[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:33.060]
I'm sure.

[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:34.420]
Over by Tampa?

[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:35.280]
Yeah.

[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.040]
Man, what a place that is.

[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:41.700]
I'll tell you one thing though, you know, they got us beaten many things on West Coast of Florida.

[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:48.220]
Not only they got crystal and not only they have like hearties and they had the steak and shake long before we ever got them,

[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:49.400]
but they got air.

[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.720]
I mean, there are strips of roads, man, over there where there's air.

[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:52.800]
Air.

[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.660]
I mean, the fast food joint that was ever invented.

[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:58.560]
Now, what the hell is that root 60 that goes across the Tampa?

[02:28:58.780 --> 02:28:59.380]
I believe it is.

[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:00.560]
I forget.

[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:02.480]
Come on, get with it.

[02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:05.400]
Well, yeah, you got to get out of the house a little bit more instead of just going to North Carolina.

[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:07.900]
You got to go over to Loots and know.

[02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:07.980]
No.

[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:09.920]
Huh? What's that other one?

[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:10.700]
They ain't going to write by Loots.

[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:11.780]
Don't Eden?

[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:14.280]
Roll the Yahoo's are right next to it.

[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:15.140]
Well, anyway, it'll come to me.

[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:15.920]
Possum Springs?

[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.640]
No, not that.

[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:18.680]
It's right by Loots there.

[02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:21.440]
We're all the goddamn, where they tend to wear those funny pointed hats.

[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.540]
Anyway, a retired Boston Red Sox spring training clubhouse manager pleaded guilty yesterday today

[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.160]
to molesting young boys who worked at the team's complex.

[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:34.160]
And by the way, extra thanks today to all our factures out there in Radio Land,

[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.500]
who are really facts and a lot of heavy duty stuff that our vast staff here on the Elijah show

[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:42.080]
doesn't have the resources or time to be able to find during the show, you know what I'm saying?

[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:44.940]
See, that's another thing about Greg Reed.

[02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:50.440]
He ought to be on his hands and knees, skissing all of our asses, me and George and Miguel and,

[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:54.060]
and Joe and anybody else associated with the show ought to be looking at our cheeks.

[02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:00.040]
When you stop and think of the magic that we weave and make with nothing, with zero.

[02:30:02.140 --> 02:30:03.240]
Do we have a newswire?

[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:03.620]
No.

[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:07.300]
See, I'm not going to go back through that whole thing about how we had to, that we had to, you know,

[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:11.480]
get other people to provide us with the TV set and I had to buy my own computer, all of those things.

[02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:16.640]
You ought to get down on your hands and knees and kiss our kneecaps instead of this baby crap, okay?

[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.500]
A's day, what was it, what's the line again?

[02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:23.160]
The truth, I got news for a man, the truth is in force on this side.

[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:26.580]
I'm still doing the knee-arouders show, okay, from here on in next four and a half years.

[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:27.260]
That's what I do.

[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:28.800]
I do the knee-arouders show.

[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:35.920]
It's a radio show, anybody that cannot bring themselves to understand that I feel real sorry for them.

[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:41.200]
Not tough to do, okay, it's the knee-arouders show and I will continue doing the knee-arouders show, period.

[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:51.340]
I have no, you know, personal problem with anybody who works there except, of course, for, um, that thing, what thing?

[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:55.320]
We already mentioned it, so it wants me forward today.

[02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:00.200]
That, that, that thing, I'll front what passes as a receptionist.

[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:01.540]
But other than that, I got no problem.

[02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:08.380]
And then, of course, Maddie Bell and Shouzae and, I mean, Shouzae and, hey, let's bring Shouzae and back, huh?

[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:31.960]
For what?

[02:31:38.380 --> 02:32:05.480]
For what?

[02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:25.740]
Oh, that's the news from Bartow, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:28.600]
Temple Terrace, that's a place I was trying to think of.

[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:28.800]
Oh.

[02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:31.560]
Loots and good old temple Terrace.

[02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:32.640]
You ever been in Temple Terrace?

[02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:33.400]
I don't think so.

[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:34.380]
Good.

[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:35.980]
Or Loots, we don't like your kind there.

[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:37.260]
They definitely don't like my kind.

[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:38.360]
Believe me.

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:38.360]

[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:40.380]
Which covers a lot of territory.

[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:43.380]
Drive real fast if you ever find yourself in Temple Terrace.

[02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:44.520]
Or Loots.

[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:51.600]
A family friend told a grand jury Kennedy cousin Michael Schakele once admitted he might have killed Martha Moxley and a drunken stupor

[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.980]
was revealed yesterday, says today's New York Daily News.

[02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:56.100]
Mildred Sissy X.

[02:32:56.720 --> 02:32:58.480]
I love that name, I X.

[02:32:58.840 --> 02:32:59.700]
Do you ever hear a name like that?

[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:00.120]
Never.

[02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:05.660]
Now, if she was kind to like Stevie Nicks, would it be X Nicks?

[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:09.380]
Mildred Sissy X.

[02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:15.880]
Told a grand jury that Schakele's father, Rushden Schakele, confided Michael Schakele's admission to her in 1981, six years after the murder.

[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:20.380]
I had a lot to drink then, and I would like to see if I could have had so much to drink that I would have forgotten something,

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:21.780]
and I could have murdered Martha X.

[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:25.600]
Told a grand jury in 1998, recounting how the elder Schakele quoted his son.

[02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:34.000]
X, a longtime Schakele family friend, also told a grand jury that Rushden Schakele said his son wanted to take a sodium pentathol or a trut serum test.

[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.140]
But when asked about the conversation yesterday, X stunned the courtroom by recanting her 1998 grand jury testimony.

[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:45.360]
Instead, she now says, Rushden Schakele only told her his son wanted to take the trut serum.

[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:49.100]
She said the statement about his drinking and possibly killing Moxley or her thoughts.

[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:56.540]
I never knew, I know that Rush never, ever heard from Michael that he killed anyone except I put in Rushden Schakele's mouth what I actually thought.

[02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:58.200]
She put it in his mouth.

[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:05.880]
Schakele's lawyer, Mickey Sherman, tried to keep the jury from hearing about X's grand jury testimony calling in hearsay, prosecutor Susan Gill countered.

[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:09.140]
It's hard to imagine that a father would report such a thing if it weren't true.

[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:13.800]
Judge John Kavanuski left jurors here because they could demonize trustworthy and reliable.

[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:16.400]
They could take it with a grain of salt or not as a case may be.

[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:16.980]
How do you like that?

[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:19.180]
Here's one you'll love.

[02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:21.740]
Woodbridge, no jersey.

[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:28.840]
Three firefighters are under investigation for allegedly throwing a late night firehouse party at which they led members of a punk band.

[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:33.320]
Don their gear and ride around town and their vehicles with lights blazing and sirens wailing.

[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:35.320]
I don't like it. Don't you love that?

[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:37.160]
What a nice fire to go.

[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:42.360]
It's firefighters, man. That's the kind of sense of human development you're sliding up and down in grease poles all the time. Usually naked.

[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:52.900]
Keith Steven Melod is brother David and Kenneth Hilarchick were also suspended indefinitely while the investigation be continuing since Joseph Greco and attorney for the Board of Commissioners for Iceland Fire District 11.

[02:34:53.500 --> 02:35:00.880]
No other firefighters were expected to face this plenary action. Officials learned about the alleged May 3rd party after pictures and narratives were posted on the band's website.

[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:09.340]
According to the site, the four-man band called LIT, LIT, met several firefighters by chance at a local restaurant and later went with them to the firehouse.

[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:15.000]
The site also said that the band performed an all-request show for the firefighters that night and put them on a guest list for their concert.

[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:21.240]
The pictures and narratives were temporarily removed from the site this week at the firefighters request a band spokesman said Tuesday.

[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:24.780]
LIT's publicist Kenneth Phillips said the band had no official comment in the matter.

[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.180]
Steven Melod said the event was being blown out of proportion. There wasn't anything done at the fire department that was illegal.

[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:34.700]
Melod said there wasn't anything done that should be any major ramification about. How do you like that?

[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:49.580]
But I do like that first paragraph which bears reading again three firefighters in Woodbridge, New Jersey, or under investigation for allegedly throwing a late night firehouse party at which they led members of a punk band down their gear and right around town their vehicles with lights blazing and sirens wailing.

[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:56.420]
All right, let them don their gay apparel. They don their gay apparel. Lempersy to slide up and down them greasy poles.

[02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:05.220]
Proven its past noon at 560 WQM how do you like that? A big one? How like maybe at the firehouse? We're talking about a big fat, impressive juicy paycheck.

[02:37:53.920 --> 02:38:04.080]
I was gonna go to class before I got high. Come on. I could have cheated and I could have passed but I got high.

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:26.880]
I'm taking a next semester and I know why. I was gonna go to court. I was gonna pay my child support but then I got high.

[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:50.040]
I was gonna run from the cops but I was high. I was gonna pull right over and stop but I was high.

Now I'm a pair of pleach and I know why. I was gonna make love to you.

I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:41.080]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:41.680]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:40:01.940 --> 02:40:08.800]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:38.780]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:40:38.780 --> 02:41:08.760]
I was gonna drink your pussy too.

[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:38.260]
I was gonna drink your pussy too.

I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:42:38.180 --> 02:43:07.980]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:29.960]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:59.920]
I was gonna eat your pussy too.

[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:06.840]
Trenton New Jersey, but in fact if you want to, oh, you ever smell Trenton New Jersey? No, thank goodness.

[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:16.640]
On the day of your worst diarrhea that you ever had in your life, on the day of the worst intestinal problems you ever had, nothing ever smelled like Trenton New Jersey except maybe Newark.

[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:26.460]
A group of New Jersey political activists fed up with the usual crop of political candidates announced to plan this Tuesday to draft Rockstar Bruce Springsteen to run for the US Senate as a true representative of the state.

[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:42.580]
I think he's perfect for Jersey. He sucks just like that state. With guidance from Doug Friedlein, a former 98 campaign aide to heavyweight wrestler terminist, so a governor, Jesse Ventura, the group called Independence for New Jersey, launched a signature drive to put Springsteen on a general election ballot.

[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:47.780]
They need only 800 signatures, but there's a big problem. Nobody's talked to the boss about the idea, the boss.

[02:44:49.080 --> 02:45:01.500]
Friedlein was not discouraged. It took us seven months to get Jesse Ventura to run. He said, at Bruce Springsteen, a string spleen through his hand in the ring and made a real serious run at this, I think you'd see thousands of volunteers coming out from all over the place. Yeah, he sure inspires me.

[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:12.420]
Political analyst said the announcement was unless a grassroots groundswell of support for Springsteen as native son that was in a tempiventura supporters to set up a third party in New Jersey.

[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:23.580]
The state center race currently features democratic Robert Torres-Sally and three Republican candidates, multi-millionaire businessman Doug Forster and state senators Diane Allen and John Matheson who all face each other in a June 4 primary.

[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:30.080]
Springsteen known as the boss among rock fans and known as somebody who couldn't sing as wet of a paper sack among those who had any taste in music.

[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:35.840]
What offer number of advantages is a political candidate including name recognition and popularity among young voters, right?

[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:47.120]
Springsteen who songs often celebrate the blue collar spirit of his youth in freehold New Jersey, home of one of the most crooked race tracks in the history of mankind, now lives in the upscale community of rumson near the northern end of the Jersey shore.

[02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:51.760]
The committee tried to reach him long ago as December, but so far they've heard nothing.

[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.240]
Ever been to freehold raceway? Of course not.

[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:02.040]
I haven't either as a matter of fact that's one of the few harness tracks in America that I've never been to and I'm really glad.

[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:05.000]
Maybe that's why I still have a few bucks freehold raceway.

[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:08.980]
How's there made Philly on doing? Oh! Call up Jackie Lee, maybe he'll tell us.

[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:17.240]
26 past known is 560 WQA when you shop for quality footwear, selection and professional service are always mighty important, but...

[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:20.160]
By the way, speaking of footwear, do you pass along the information I told yesterday?

[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.300]
No, I couldn't find him. I'll find him today.

[02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:23.720]
Okay, thank you.

[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:32.040]
Like I said, when you shop for quality footwear, selection and professional service are mighty important, but the bottom line is price, dollars and cents.

[02:46:32.700 --> 02:46:38.740]
At Brandy Shoes, you'll always find the biggest select of men's and women's shoes anywhere in town, the best service in South Florida and the best prices period.

[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:44.720]
Top quality names we're talking about. Like rock ports, SAS, Spirys, Timberland, Naturalizer and lots more.

[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:50.260]
And when they're humongous, amazing selection in this megastore, you're probably never going to hear anybody say to you.

[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:54.800]
Sorry, Mr. Orman, we don't have that style in your size, because they've got a humongous selection.

[02:46:55.380 --> 02:47:01.540]
Deep. It's really deep. Find out why most of Brandy's customers don't really keep coming back, but usually, stock up on several pairs on each visit.

[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:07.440]
Brandy's is open every day, 9 to 9, Sundays, 10 to 5, and you'll be finding them in the same great location they've been for a coon stage.

[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:12.140]
You'll find Brandy Shoes at 1290, North Federal Highway and Pompovich, and don't forget all this week.

[02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:14.920]
$10 off on all women's naturalizer shoes.

[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:18.600]
David's then.

[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:23.220]
And Kaplan's key night, sweet night to 10 on Sport 30560.

[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.560]
QAM. Neil Rogers.

[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:37.680]
First, you pull your pants down around your knees.

[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:41.260]
Pull back from your desk and thread, or at your feet.

[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:44.880]
Burnly wrap your hands all around your knee.

[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:48.780]
Then pull up and down, pull up and down, and turn that piece.

[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:52.520]
Keep the keyboard cover so it won't splat.

[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:56.920]
And the club handy-to-wipe it off your lap now.

[02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:00.140]
You could be just like the cheese.

[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:03.640]
And a home land security.

[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:07.940]
Wrap down firmly to secure air boys.

[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:11.700]
All the borders and the shipping courts of boys.

[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:15.060]
Before you get around to it, pull down your shoes.

[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:19.080]
And pull up and down, pull up and down, and turn the board.

[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:22.900]
Get yourself a mindset of blow pens.

[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.180]
As the time doodling it turns desk now.

[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:30.680]
Pull your in charge just like the cheese.

[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.480]
And a home land security.

[02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:34.680]
All right.

[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:37.800]
Pull your pants down and feed your feet.

[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:39.520]
1231.

[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:42.880]
At 560WQAM.

[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:45.900]
63 for all in the family.

[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:48.500]
Simpson's 55. It's still pretty close. It's tight.

[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:50.180]
It's big in a tight.

[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:53.540]
Players, baseball, striking, and evidentable says the AP.

[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:54.780]
What a joke.

[02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:59.060]
Haven't I been trying to tell people this, but they don't want to listen to me because they got nothing else to talk about?

[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:01.220]
Haven't I been trying for weeks to tell people this?

[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:07.820]
With no labor agreement inside, some baseball players think it is inevitable that the union will set a strike date for August.

[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:12.240]
And you know what? Everybody in the free world is going to say to baseball when they do that?

[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:13.080]
Bye, bye, bye!

[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:15.120]
You got it! Bye, bye, bye!

[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:18.660]
Even those who haven't done it already. And some of those who are on the borderline.

[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:24.040]
That's really the only thing we can do. Put your mic stand in the Yankees player representative said today or yesterday.

[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:26.720]
It's not a situation where we have a lot of options. Right!

[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:37.620]
Union officials told players agents that meeting in New York on Tuesday that the staff is considering if and when to set a strike date to agents said yesterday, speaking of course on the condition of anonymity.

[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:40.980]
Union head Donald Fear, who says the only thing we have to fear is him.

[02:49:41.540 --> 02:49:48.520]
Who told players during spring training to prepare for missing their last two or three paychecks is the whole, a similar meeting with West Coast agents in Los Angeles today.

[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:55.160]
For now, the unions trying to play down the possibility of a work stoppage, which would be baseball's ninth since 1972.

[02:49:56.580 --> 02:50:01.160]
The executive board does not yet consider whether to set a strike date for you said we hope not to have to do so.

[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:06.780]
The consideration of a strike date first reported yesterday by the New York Times is of little surprise.

[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:14.440]
Players are unhappy that owners in an effort to slow payroll growth and propose a 50% luxury tax on the portions of payrolls above $98 million.

[02:50:15.180 --> 02:50:23.760]
Management also went through players by asking to increase the percentage of locally generated revenue that teams must share from 20 to 50% after a deduction for ballpark expenses.

[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:29.560]
Owners have promised that through the World Series there will not attempt to declare an impassant talks and implement their proposals.

[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:34.920]
The Union fears management will do so immediately after the postseason in an effort to slow salaries for 2003.

[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:44.780]
For them to rattle their strike date cages frankly disappointing and in my view on counterproductive said Bob DePuy, baseball chief operating officer.

[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:51.620]
We didn't put proposals on the table that were designed to provoke a work stoppage. There is no salary cap. There is no rebate or exercise tax like the other leagues have.

[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:59.560]
We put proposals on the table that were designed to allow bargaining to an agreement. So with disappointing when the other side decides to threaten a work stoppage which is certainly not their only option.

[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:07.040]
In the view of management commissioner Bud Sealey has already made a concession by saying owners wouldn't lock out players who are implemented its proposals during the season.

[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:14.100]
The Union views that pledge is meaning little since 2002 salaries already have been determined when Sealey made that pledge March 26th.

[02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:22.880]
We bargained last time for the ability to affect 2002 and we chose not to exercise our bargaining rights, our leverage to Puy said, we're going to continue to lose enormous sums.

[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:34.060]
Owners claim $232 million in operating losses last year on revenue of $3.5 billion. Players are suspicious but they haven't challenged the figures at bargaining sessions management lawyers say.

[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:49.940]
In 1993 the last season before the 230 today strike that wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 years, baseball revenue was $1.87 billion. The average salary has doubled from $1.17 million at the time of the strike to $2.38 million this season. Now do you like that?

[02:51:51.040 --> 02:52:01.760]
Every year the owners cry poverty and look at the industry and it's almost double financially Clevelandians player Rep Charles Negi said, talks for an agreement to replace the one that the expired November 7th beginning January but the sides have had only sporadic meanings.

[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:18.020]
What's frustrating is we've had this whole year and we can't sit down at the table and come up with remedies said Texas Rangers Alex Rodriguez was only making 25 million a year. Unfortunately a work stopper to some sort of strike is the thing that's going to make us come together in the United and come up with remedies.

[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:30.740]
Oh god, don't you feel sorry for all these people? No, I do I'm weeping. Here's a punk that's making $25 million for playing baseball and putting a jockstrap on and patting his buddies on a butt in the shower after the game.

[02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:39.620]
And he's he's talking about labor negotiations. Most of these guys should kiss the goddamn ground that they're making anything.

[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:48.900]
CBS News Paul has found that confidence in the Catholic Church leaders as a result of their handling of church sex abuse scandals has fallen.

[02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:55.840]
Now the surprise to you I'm shocked and most believe the Cardinal Bernard large Bishop of Boston should step down from office.

[02:52:57.700 --> 02:53:09.960]
Even his deposition began in a civil case against the Boston Arts I see for its handling of charges of sexual abuse of minus by priest the public's opinion of the worry Catholic Church of the way Catholic Church leaders have handed charges of sex abuse by priest has continued to decline.

[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:16.120]
Now only one in about 10 Americans and just 14% of Catholics think church leaders have done a good job.

[02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:20.380]
Two weeks ago positive assessments while low were about twice as high.

[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:42.580]
The number of Americans who think you as leaders of the Catholic Church are doing a poor job is now 83% compared to 61% of thought that about two weeks ago Catholics are becoming increasingly critical of their church leaders as well nearly eight and 10 which sounds like 80% to me think church leaders have done a poor job handling the charges of sexual abuse by priest this numbers up from 62% of felt that way just two weeks ago.

[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:46.300]
Are you following the changes in these numbers? I sure am charting them. Yeah.

[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:51.020]
Two weeks ago poor job I mean why even go through them again okay.

[02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:58.640]
It's it's it's like a gigantic snowball and it's going down a huge snowbank man and it's growing like topsy.

[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:07.720]
Seven let's see some of that drop into valuation of church leaders maybe due to the almost universal negative assessment of Cardinal Bernard law and his deposition in the Massachusetts civil case.

[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:14.460]
Cardinal large Bishop of Boston began his deposition last week in a civil case against the Arts I see about the response to charges of sex abuse by priest.

[02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:30.080]
79% of Americans do not believe Cardinal law is telling everything he knows about the situations involving a priest in his diocese sexually using children and teenagers only 5% say he's telling all he knows most Catholics also think the Cardinal is not telling what he knows 75% of Catholics.

[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:44.440]
And they asked her Cardinal law resign of all respond and 64% said yes 19% said no and of Catholics again 64% said yes but 24% said no but 64% of everybody said yes.

[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:49.080]
When did that kick him out and it should be a lot higher than that by the way yes.

[02:54:51.900 --> 02:54:58.560]
But you know you got a lot of brainwash people out there because somebody puts on a smoker or a frok or anything you know just like a firetuck look at him.

[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:05.680]
Newcomer points to become Dutch Prime Minister this is poor Hans I hope Hans isn't listening today.

[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:15.240]
A political newcomer was poised to become Prime Minister after a dramatic shift to the right elections yesterday that swamped the governing socialist after 8 years of the helm and Needle Ones Holland.

[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:27.240]
The outcome was a severe defeat for Prime Minister Wimcox Liberal Coalition that brought the Dutch study growth since 1994 but was punished for ignoring public concerns about drugs, immigration, welfare abuse and lacks law enforcement.

[02:55:28.060 --> 02:55:37.420]
In the swing to the right the upstart party of slain anti-immigration populist Pym Fortune Pym Fortune's list swept into the legislature with 26 seats a few months ago the group didn't even exist.

[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:45.520]
With 88.6% of the vote counted Jan Peter Balkan and this Christian Democrats won 43 seats again a 15 in the 150 member parliament.

[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:55.200]
Balkan and the 46 year old Christian philosophy professor who took over the party just eight months ago declared he was ready to take on the responsibility of forming a government citizens want a different kind of politics he be saying.

[02:55:55.780 --> 02:56:02.680]
Koch's governing socialist was seen plunging from 45 to 23 seats and his liberal allies from 38 also to 23 court of the results.

[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:11.020]
Fortune was killed May 6 by a single gun and brought these issues to the forefront tapping into a grounds law of this content with Holland's ruling politicians and their tolerant policies.

[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:22.120]
Fortune was killed after a doing a campaign radio interview he was 54 his murder shocked this country of 16 million that is a stranger to political violence as long prided itself on no ripple consensus politics.

[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:43.600]
There's had no nipple the results proved Fortune's party the Christian pro rather should say approved whatever and their allies could marshal a comfortable parliamentary majority for right wing government at the outset of the voting Koch told voters that is eight years at the helm brought them formidable growth and prosperity he said the elections are about my legacy while evidently they didn't like his legacy and he's small potatoes now.

[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.080]
How do you like that huh?

[02:56:48.140 --> 02:56:54.220]
So what goes they don't like them for owners I think that's what it boils down to George don't take it personally but oh I don't they don't like for an as like you.

[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:15.060]

[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:38.140]
I'm.

[03:02:38.300 --> 03:02:38.560]
I'm.

[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:38.980]
I'm.

[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:50.900]
Is there any 않아er attack on Larry, someone!

[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:53.480]
The fucking guard blocks a five def noodle.

[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:55.060]
The person hunts off to them, if you don't who knows that!

[03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:55.060]

[03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:55.060]

[03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:55.320]
So Larry.

[03:02:57.580 --> 03:02:58.600]
And somebody asked mange1 on the block.

[03:02:58.600 --> 03:02:58.600]

[03:02:58.600 --> 03:02:58.600]

[03:02:58.600 --> 03:02:59.480]
Those weapons in your house would make it sink imagination.

[03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:00.060]
I drank filthy food at two truck confession, Satan, you don't.

[03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:02.420]
to various charges, including bribery and extortion.

[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:06.860]
Connelly 61 is accused of taking bribes and tipping vulgar and flimmy about the indictments.

[03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:10.860]
He's also accused of giving the parent information about other FBI informants who were later killed.

[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.520]
Hmm, Connelly lies any wrong doing.

[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:16.020]
He said he was just doing his job to know the extent of the gangsters' crimes.

[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:19.960]
Weeks said he was testifying under a plea deal in which prosecutors have agreed to recommend

[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:22.140]
a sentence of between five and fifteen years in prison.

[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:24.500]
On Tuesday, we already had this.

[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:27.420]
On Tuesday, we testified about his role in the slang of Brian Halleran.

[03:03:27.420 --> 03:03:31.100]
Prosecutors say Halleran was killed after Connelly told Bergeran Flimmy that Halleran had

[03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:33.740]
implicated them in the murder of businessman Roger Wheeler.

[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:38.700]
Bergeran Flimmy were the leaders of Winter Hill gang and Irish crime syndicate that ran gambling,

[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:41.180]
loan-sharking, and other rackets in the Boston area.

[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:41.460]
Oh!

[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.900]
Why tell you that Boston area sure got some problems, you know what?

[03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:48.960]
As much as a beautiful city it is with a lot of living and breathing people and institutions

[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.620]
of higher learning and lower learning, all of these things, pretty crappy radio though,

[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:57.400]
but nevertheless, in spite of all of those things, they got a lot of problems.

[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:04.240]
Child abusing priests, cook at archbishop's, Mafiosi running wild, a lot of good Italian restaurants

[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:05.140]
on the north end.

[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:07.060]
I can't believe you never been in Boston.

[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:08.680]
Sorry, one day.

[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:11.600]
Yeah, let's take up a fund.

[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:14.100]
Okay, we're going to send Joe to Chicago.

[03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:15.320]
I think that's what it was going to be.

[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:16.500]
And George to Boston.

[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:17.240]
All right.

[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:23.820]
And we're going to send Miguel to Cardinist to visit Aion.

[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:29.720]
Don't you think that would be just a beautiful thing?

[03:04:29.860 --> 03:04:31.360]
Can you imagine the buy you would go on?

[03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:34.420]
Well, the product of a big, big suitcase full of food.

[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:37.560]
Yeah, to make sure that Aion gets his happy meal every day.

[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:39.380]
He can pack up a whole bunch of that.

[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:44.460]
Anyway, that's what I'm trying to, the message I try to sell all you people out there

[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:47.020]
is get on a plane or on a bus or on a train and go somewhere.

[03:04:47.220 --> 03:04:48.580]
Okay, get out of that God for a second place.

[03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:49.540]
Go somewhere.

[03:04:50.020 --> 03:04:53.620]
Find out what real life is all about because trust me when I tell you, paradise or

[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:54.480]
not, that ain't it.

[03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:58.880]
I wonder how much longer he's going to be saying that, you know, my good close personal

[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:00.280]
friend, the mom, I'm a monster.

[03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:03.640]
I know he's, you know, he's trying to like blue sky and all of that.

[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:09.080]
But boy, wait till it gets to be like about the second week in August when it's been 120

[03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:11.300]
degrees in the shade every day for like two and a half, three months.

[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:15.100]
Hey, speaking of that, speaking of Schwarz in your brains out, how about cooling off

[03:05:15.100 --> 03:05:16.260]
with some great champion lights?

[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:16.920]
Sounds good to me.

[03:05:16.940 --> 03:05:17.440]
That's right.

[03:05:19.100 --> 03:05:22.340]
Because man, the other sports drinks out there don't even come close.

[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:24.960]
They don't hold a candle to champion light because they're full of crap.

[03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:28.080]
Champion lights got nothing in there but good stuff like all the electrolytes you need

[03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:28.720]
after workout.

[03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:32.620]
All the other sports drinks, whether it's Gatorade, all the others, forget about them.

[03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:36.200]
They're passe because they're loaded with sugar and therefore with calories and carbohydrates

[03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:37.420]
and all kinds of crap.

[03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:41.320]
Some of them even have stuff that'll make you sit on it and be a squatter all day.

[03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:42.540]
Not champion light.

[03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:47.220]
It's got no carbs, no caffeine, no calories, no sugar, no nothing but great taste.

[03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:51.320]
In fact, now it's available in six different delicious flavors and believe me, if you tried

[03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:54.240]
it like a few months ago, you're going to like it even better now because the flavors

[03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:57.340]
are all like juiced up, like the mad dog, they're juiced up right now.

[03:05:57.680 --> 03:06:01.860]
You got orange lemon lime, grape, fruit punch and the new flavors lemonade and blue raspberry

[03:06:01.860 --> 03:06:02.980]
and man, they are delicious.

[03:06:03.480 --> 03:06:06.980]
In fact, when I get back from vacation, I expect it to be cases and cases I expect it

[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:09.140]
to be a Schmidt load of champion light weight in for me.

[03:06:09.380 --> 03:06:10.420]
Don't you think I sure hope so?

[03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:14.100]
Anyway, don't forget you can sample the all new champion light flavors this Saturday for

[03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:17.800]
free and you can join Dolphins quarterback J. Feet.

[03:06:18.020 --> 03:06:20.500]
In fact, walk up from behind with Jay and just like, you know, do the thing with his

[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:22.480]
ears, you know, you know, I'm talking about flick them.

[03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:25.280]
Yeah, just, no, not flick them like regular, zeroes a little bit.

[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:26.240]
See if you get a reaction.

[03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:27.620]
Anyway, join Jay Feet.

[03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:30.360]
There would often quarterback and spokesman for champion light at the new Walmart this

[03:06:30.360 --> 03:06:34.360]
Saturday, 38-01 Turtle Creek Grab and Cruel Springs, 10-30 in a morning till 2 in the

[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:36.820]
afternoon and he'll let you have a try of it and champion light as well.

[03:06:36.880 --> 03:06:39.660]
Or if you want to find the story nearest you that carries it, if you actually want to spend

[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:43.220]
some money and buy it, which is a damn smart idea, check out champion light.

[03:07:13.220 --> 03:07:19.840]
This is your buddy, which one you like best, now that you can call the shots here in

[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:24.820]
the US, do you have the change to break a hundred?

[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:28.600]
How far does Georgia's turn go up your mark?

[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:33.320]
Never mind the timbers that you've funded.

[03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:55.120]
All right.

[03:07:55.480 --> 03:08:00.200]
1257 at 560 WQAM Governor Jeb Bush, this is in the category of better late than never.

[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:05.000]
Governor Jeb Bush signed a bill yesterday making a felony for state workers to falsify

[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:09.340]
records, even punishable by more severe punishments than throwing a spitball in class.

[03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:14.000]
The measure passed last week in a special legislative session comes in a wake of accusation

[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:17.820]
that a child welfare case worker falsely claimed to be keeping up with that little girl

[03:08:17.820 --> 03:08:18.660]
who vanished in Miami.

[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:20.280]
This is from the herald by the way.

[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:24.120]
It says the girl, five year old, Rylia Wilson, who was missing for 15 months and nobody

[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:24.460]
noticed.

[03:08:24.820 --> 03:08:25.760]
Is she not missing anymore?

[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:26.840]
No, she's still missing.

[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:27.880]
I know that.

[03:08:28.160 --> 03:08:29.080]
But why does it say that?

[03:08:29.080 --> 03:08:32.500]
Anyway, now they noticed, I guess that's what it was.

[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:35.720]
The department at children and families believed the caretaker had custody of the girl but

[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:38.880]
the caretaker, Gerald and Graham, with their 85 different identities, claimed someone

[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:42.480]
who identified herself as a DCF worker picked her up 60 months ago for an evaluation.

[03:08:43.020 --> 03:08:44.960]
DCF reported Rylia missing April 25.

[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:49.160]
We must ensure that what happened to Rylia never happens again to any child, Bush said.

[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:51.020]
And look at his kids, man.

[03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:53.260]
If they can all grow up like them, then we'll be okay.

[03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:58.000]
The department says case worker Deborah Muskely fired false reports of monthly visits with

[03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:01.240]
the child while her supervisor, Willie Harris failed to review the case.

[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:02.800]
Both resided.
