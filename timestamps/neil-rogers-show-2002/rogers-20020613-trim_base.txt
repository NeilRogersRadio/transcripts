[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.820]
My thoughts

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.840]
You are a mental case

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.760]

In fact, I didn't station play in most of these

[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.280]
Songs that we're talking about

[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.520]

21 assholes think that's the best one hit wonder in this list

[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.060]
The assembled multitude which started out very slowly

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.660]
And then I played it again to give it a little hype here on the show yesterday

[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.180]
And did very well had 20

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.260]
Also more today than yesterday spirals through a case at 20

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.880]

Status quo pictures of matchstick man which is what I voted for

[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.580]
Had only 11

[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.980]
Isn't that depressing?

[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.880]
What are you gonna do?

[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.160]
Yeah, what are you gonna do you know

[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.480]
But the good news is and I book a brine

[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.440]
I don't want to get him depressed because he's already so depressing

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.120]
But allow the stuff that he sent me because I research to see

[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.060]
I could take everybody's word for it say oh yeah

[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.300]
So it's only had one hit

[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.300]
But you know what?

[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.700]
A lot of times they're full of crap

[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.060]

Maybe Mr. Mark

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.820]
Maybe he was kind of Marky Mark

[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.500]
So anyway status quo pictures of matchstick

[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.860]
Crash test dummies

[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.400]

godly and cream cry head only in yine

[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.800]
And then after that it was strictly downhill

[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.680]
Can you believe Joe Jeffrey group in my pledge love had only three

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.860]

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.580]
What happened to my scd from uh

A big fat freaking mess

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.240]
But that's where it goes

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.380]
I'm looking for Timothy by the boys

[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.400]
Maybe I put it back in my thing here

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.760]
And I did not missing disc

[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680]
Missing disc George

[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.200]
Crawl around on the floor and see if you can find it

[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.460]
All right, I'll be right back

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.080]
Missing god damn disc

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.100]
Oh boy and you know something one of the odds I'm never gonna find that now

[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.000]
Any chance

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.200]
And the audience is saying with a sigh of relief

[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.220]
Oh thank god we don't have to hear Timothy by the boys

[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.080]
Well I was just gonna play like in about five words

[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.240]
That would have been enough

[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.720]
So there's yesterday's result and then we'll put together a pool today

[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.360]
I got I just got tons of crap today

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.260]
Tons and tons of good important stuff

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.080]
Although I'm very dismayed over the fact that Timothy by the boys that cd has vanished

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.120]
You'll find there you'll supply the players

[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.820]
What's that?

[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.180]
I give up

[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.680]
Oh

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.700]
What the music

[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.040]
Hailbreak

[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.920]
Oh

[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.340]
Okay that's enough

[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.800]
You had your shot at it and now of course he's dead anyway

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.280]
For a long time

[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.360]
So we got some faxes here to get us started

[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.580]
I just can't handle this semis

[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.180]
I just got a whole pile of crap

[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.320]
Frank says and also a rich factor

[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.640]
Which I'm embarrassed for

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.280]
Oh you know what I did I put the wrong see

[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.380]
I put the wrong disc into your thing

[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.380]
Okay so we're saved

[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.860]
Those of you who've been waiting overnight

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.980]
Breathlessly to hear the boys in Timothy

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.860]
Guess what you're in luck

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.420]
Good

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.040]
I mean how many songs about cannibalism are there

[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.980]
That's enough

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.520]
Okay

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.380]
That was much more than enough

[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.780]
Yeah we know what it's all about

[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.700]
Okay we've been through that a zid in times already

[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.260]
And you just want to rub it in

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.140]
Hey wait you need to be more

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.580]
Rich factor and Frank both point out

[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.740]
In fact Frank says I can't believe you left out Debbie Boone

[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.000]
And you let up my life

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.780]
Well it was only number one for 10 weeks Frank

[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.960]
And you're right

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.340]
We're just trying to like a bluff that out of our minds

[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.100]
For obvious reasons

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.320]
Can everybody understand that?

[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.420]
Debbie Boone

[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.260]
Rhymes with spoon and moon and June and

[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.080]
Coon

[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.880]
And we hate Debbie Boone

[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.860]
But it was very popular for some bizarre reason

[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.840]
It was number one for 10 weeks

[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.900]
I guess all the goyam liked it

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.600]
Is that what it was?

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.680]
She had big boobs

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.060]
So mark that down

[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.780]
Mark it down

[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.340]
There's the first one for our new list today

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.960]
You don't light up my life by Debbie Boone

[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.640]
And by the way I don't care how many votes it gets

[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.840]
You will not hear that on this show

[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.200]
Okay

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.340]
12 minutes after night at 560 WQM

[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.140]
You know, Mactia shopping is a gigantic

[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.760]
A cataclysmic waste of time

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.340]
That's correct

[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.660]
Because a lot of assholes get in their car

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.340]
You know raining like held on there

[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.740]
And then on the days when the sun is shining

[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.060]
It's 145 degrees

[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.880]
So why the hell run all over time

[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.840]
A waste that time and gas get all sweated up

[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.100]
And then get ripped off anyway

[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.600]
When you can just sit there on your ass

[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.220]

The manager

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.260]
We gazing one on sports radio 5-16 Q-A-M

[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.160]
Can't beat that Gator meat

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.700]
Two fans at the register pay the big price

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.960]
Pay the big price pay the big price

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.300]
Two fans at the register pay the big price

[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.460]
Pay the big price pay the big price

[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.240]
Guess who's back man

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.740]
Back looking

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.460]
Yeah

[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.720]
Shady back man

[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.100]
No afraid

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.120]
Free

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.280]
Guess who's back

[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.420]
Guess who's back

[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.480]
Guess who's back

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.540]
Guess who's back

[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.620]
Guess who's back

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.760]
Guess who's back

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.060]
I'm created a monster

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.600]
That everyone wants to get the hot new record from Shady and they drop liver

[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.680]
Well take it from Shady's way I figure this dude will be a richer man

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.580]
And they are rap singer

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.560]
A little bit of me

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.860]
And some more six figure sounds like the kind of life that makes my life bigger

[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.640]
Fortunately

[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.760]
This white MC figured out how to get rich successfully

[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.260]
It's amazing for Shady to debate and up to creating every person in the world

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.100]
That's me they're hating

[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.940]
What about this dude?

[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.540]
The worst

[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.240]
This CD

[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.460]
I don't complicate things basically

[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.100]
So basically the place to be in the case like me is shamelessly doing things lazily

[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.880]
And crazily you buy my music facefully

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.200]
Sure Showns are empty because of me

[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.220]
Now if one's no real job for me

[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220]
To write a tune for my CD

[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.400]
See to get the song right actually

[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.680]
Hey joke the minute

[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.440]
Literally

[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.040]
See I keep things easy

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.740]
Lyrically

[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.600]
With the rhythm based on simplicity

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.000]
Then I sit and count my royalties

[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.400]
Sure Showns are empty because of me

[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.760]
I would have been a bad taste if I said that I would pay

[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.160]
To watch Eminem rape Debbie Boone

[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.940]
That would be bad wouldn't

[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.560]
No

[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.820]
Wouldn't be bad

[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.080]
Anyway Bonnie Tyler somebody says total eclipse of the heart

[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.720]
And she had three hits

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.120]
Sorry

[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.800]
Nice try but she had three hits

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.480]
Looked it up in my book and my billboard book

[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.340]
And my billboard looked all make mistakes except about

[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.420]
What was his name

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.160]
You know I wrote that down somewhere too

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.180]
Just to make sure I'd have it

[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.940]
Rick

[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.080]
Rick something or other

[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.160]
He was born in 1945 in Sagittanyl, Michigan, lead singer

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.760]
Of a question mark in the theory

[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.360]
In 96 tiers

[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.140]
I have that here as a matter of fact 96 tiers

[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.540]
But

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.540]
We'll have to wait on that

[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.160]
Just I'm just overwhelmed you know

[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160]
Overwhelmed with crap

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.600]
I'm knee deep in crap

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.860]
For example here's a suggestion from a listener one hit wonder

[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.980]
It says how about

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.580]
Bobby McFarron and don't worry be happy

[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.420]
How about it

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.740]
Now do you remember it was the old the old channel four

[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.920]
Which is now on channel six

[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.640]
Remember they did a TV campaign based on that song

[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:47.980]
Yes

[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.200]
And that's when we really began to hate

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.160]
Both the every freaking everywhere

[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.540]
We just started hitting the whole world once they started playing that too much

[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.680]
Because it's annoying

[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.020]
Overdone overplayed

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.240]
Run into the ground

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.980]
I'll tell you one thing whoever does the whistling on that song

[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.320]
They sure couldn't whistle like Pat Boone speaking of the Boons

[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.360]
Remember love letters in the sand

[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.860]
Yep

[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.680]
Did you know he did the whistling on that

[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.700]
I didn't

[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.380]
I wish I enroute in the middle of the song

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.500]
Well that was Pat Boone

[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.200]
He not only sang it he whistled it too

[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.160]
He knew how to put his lips together and blow

[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.840]
Anyway, here's the facts that has a few suggestions for us

[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.740]
Well, let's see is there anything else on that scene

[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.840]
That's worth the given a shot

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.360]
I just got all this Catholic pre-stuff that things going on in Dallas

[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.700]
The Dallas news has got a 75,000 page report in expose

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.060]
We'll get to it

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.160]
Just calm down

[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.340]
Oh I'll tell you what else is on here that we need to hear immediately

[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.200]
If not sooner that did very well on our survey yesterday by the way

[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.860]
You know what it is?

[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:42.440]
You know it?

[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.340]
Oh, they produce

[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.080]
Yeah

[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.660]
I got your picture

[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.000]
On the end of you

[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.240]
Yeah, that did pretty well

[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.860]
And you know something it was a novelty song but we liked it

[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.160]
Yes

[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.700]
Right?

[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.280]
It was cute

[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.540]
It was cute

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.040]
Not as cute as Clark Kent but it was cute

[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.300]
Speaking of Clark Kent and turning Japanese

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.700]
Somebody better tell them don't you think that thing too hard to pull right off of his body

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.160]
You know what

[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.620]
Just think about that for a second

[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.500]
Anyway, here's a poll that says it's raining men by the weather girls

[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.520]
I'm gonna have to look that up

[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.140]
They don't have to hit any other hits

[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.380]
Wow

[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:36.980]
Oh

[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.280]
See just like there only here even though this is a beautiful studio they built for me

[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.220]
It's a limited space you know what I mean

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.260]
I don't even

[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.740]
So I don't have the uh in fact yesterday Robert said were you a banging on that dump button

[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.660]
I said not intentionally

[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.640]
But if you saw the location of it it's very possible like I accidentally dumped it

[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.200]
Bumped it

[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.140]
Bumped and dumped it

[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.200]
What am I looking for?

[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.920]
The weather girl that I don't even see the goddamn weather girls how's that possible

[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.580]
Why is somebody faxing us the lyrics to you light up my life

[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.200]
Some asshole probably probably a Debbie Boone stalker

[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.380]
Now let me see it's it's raining men's gotta be in here right

[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:22.540]
And guess what what it's not it wasn't a top 40 hit it wasn't a top 40 hit it was just a novelty tune that they played at gay bars

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.640]
Right

[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.420]
I can't believe that and then what's your name?

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.600]
We did it from the spice girls what else in jury Hallowell read it recently

[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.760]
Of course that was not in this country was it released in this country? No

[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.060]
As we were discussing off the year before to show there's so much good music which never gets released in USA. So

[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.260]
Tough luck

[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.040]
Anyway, it's raining men doesn't qualify play that funky music white boy by wild cherry or possibly black cherry

[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.960]
And you are absolutely correct on that one and it is wild cherry even though

[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.840]
Bokeh Bryant made a mistake on it what a bokeh Bryant say was a blind yeah not the average white band

[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.180]
Bokeh I'm telling you sent me some great stuff but boy you're all over the place

[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.080]
I had to do about 45 hours research just since yesterday

[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.340]
Getting the ones that actually qualify some were not even hits

[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.000]
Much less top 40 much less so one hit wonders strawberry letter 23

[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.920]
Now who did that don't we have that in here somewhere brothers Johnson and what did we decide?

[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.520]
Uh, I think they had more hits

[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.660]
That one

[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.760]
But I don't know you looked it up or remember you looked it up and I can't remember

[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.420]
I already researched it because it's how one of the bokeh Bryant's it just calmed down for one second

[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.700]
See this is too overwhelming if my vast staff

[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.320]
If I had a stand let's see strawberry uh fields forever what am I looking for strawberry letter 23

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]
I don't know

[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.840]
We just don't have time to dick with us right now. Oh Mickey. You're so fine by Tony Basel. Didn't we play that the other day?

[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.080]
Yeah, we wouldn't you did thank you very much, but we wouldn't dig to five by putting that on it come on

[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.080]
I lean by Dexie's midnight runners

[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.960]
Yeah, what about it? It was a hit

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.380]
Okay, good

[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.680]
Okay, we got more important fish to fry. Let me before we get more with this music stuff. Okay

[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.840]
So I'm watching the news yesterday and they said the Dallas Morning News yesterday

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.740]
And of course this bishops meeting is going on as we speak in Dallas or maybe they're not out of the sack yet

[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.060]
Maybe they haven't put their altar boys back in a uh dr. D. B. B. Pettit on head

[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.680]
Anyway, Catholic bishops and sex abuse. There's a lengthy article

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.240]
I didn't realize quite how lengthy and expose a in the Dallas Morning News yesterday

[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.520]
You can go to their website and take a look at it

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.500]
The reason I'm saying look at it because it's uh much much too long for me to go into here on the air

[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.840]
The essence of it is this because I started downloading this yesterday and in my facts machine says page one of

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.840]
136 and I said oh, I don't think so

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.660]
I don't think so

[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.160]
Roughly two thirds of top U. S. Catholic leaders have protected priest accused of sexual abuse and a systematic practice

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.460]
That spans decades and continues today a three month Dallas Morning News review shows

[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.780]
The study the first of its kind looked at the records of the top leaders of the nation's

[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.700]
178 mainstream Roman Catholic diocese

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.560]
Including acting administrators in cases where the top job is vacant

[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.180]
Excluded from the study were auxiliary bishops who in larger diocese servants haveordinate rules

[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.440]
But can still vote on many matters before the U. S. Conference of Catholic bishops

[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.940]
The 17 bishops who lead eparches whatever that is what's an eparchy

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.720]
Kottley

[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.280]
Which are diocese like entities that worship according to the eastern right see I have a part in they answered it

[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.220]
In checking whether a bishop had protected priest rather church representatives accused of sexual abuse

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:29.400]
Reporters Brooks Egritan and Reese Dunclin relied on published reports court records interviews and church records obtained in civil

[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.500]
Elitigation most protected priest were accused of sexually abusing minors primarily adolescent boys

[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:42.020]
But also younger ones and a sizable number of girls of various ages the newspaper study also covered behavior that indicated a sexual attraction to minors

[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.480]
Such as viewing child pornography or in one case

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.400]
Trading sexually charged emails with someone a priest believed was a minor and that goes on in the next to 75,000 pages

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.960]
Uh, and I wish I did have time because then I would have printed it all on

[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.560]
It's got the diocese location for example the first one archbishop Roger Schweitz

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.120]
Whose head of the archbishop of head of the diocese of Anchorage, Alaska

[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.100]
One of his top bids is the Reverend Timothy Crowley who left the pastor job in 1993 in the diocese of Lansing, Michigan

[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.820]
After being accused of sexual misconduct with the boy church officials in

[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.780]
Anchorage recently acknowledged that they knew about the priest passed

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.860]
See, that's just one. That's the first of about eight zillion

[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.040]
So two thirds of the this is like the a fox guarding the chicken coop is what this whole dog and pony show that to put on right now

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.100]
Because two thirds of these guys are already should be in jail

[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.060]
They've been looking the other way and knew what was going on and then do a guy damn thing about it in fact moved him around

[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.580]
So they could most somebody else's kids

[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.420]
I just mentioned that in passing

[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.200]
I'll frank a Doug Monteiro in the New York Post one of our favorite comments on the shows got a great column

[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.040]
They church has blood of suicide victims on its hands. We'll get to that in a second and we'll get back to our one-hit wonders

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.320]
I have he played today, man. I can barely carry it

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.860]
26 after nine at five sixty wqm here's an easy question with an easy answer if somebody offered to give you

[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.760]
Hand over to you several thousand dollars over the next few years would you accept it?

[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:09.320]
Damn straight you would be stupid not to do it which makes it really stupid to pass up the opportunity to refinance or buy a home at

[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.140]
3.95 percent here's the deal

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.820]
There's a fanny made program available 3.95 percent for both refinance again purchasing of homes think about it

[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.780]
Just 3.9 for a 5 percent and all you have to do to get the information about how this works

[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:26.160]
And just pick up that instrument or as make one easy call or the phone if you like call 1 800 940

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:33.640]
053 63 that's 1 800 940 53 63 to be more specific you can borrow a hundred grand with payments of only

[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.220]
475 bucks a month or borrow 200 grand with payments of only

[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.860]
950 dollars a month you'll save yourself a Schmidt load of cash so it'd be downright stupid to pass up a chance to do something smart like that

[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:50.300]
So do the math and do the next logical thing do the smart thing get the details with no obligation by calling the financial group at 1 800

[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.280]
940 land that's 1 800 940 53 63

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.980]
There were an equal housing lender credit restrictions do apply and rate

[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.500]
God where there are no loose

[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.040]
Go straight to hell

[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.420]
On sports 205 62 AM

[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.240]
Hey

[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.660]
You know I find a funny magazine to look upon

[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.200]
Because I'm obsessed

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.720]
Would make it as an cans

[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.020]
I find the secret little place to lock myself away

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.840]
I'll just take some time to feed a legend

[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.660]
Be with my manhood pride everything everything will feel all right

[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.500]
Everything everything will be all right

[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:57.900]
Hey

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.220]
I should feel ashamed

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.080]
When I'm churning butter all alone you can't come in

[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.640]
You can try right now

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.740]
Just beat yourself

[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.820]
Soon you'll know that you have finished up with no one else

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.700]
You just take some time to feed a legend too!

You just take your time to feed a legend with your manhood rides everything everything will feel all right

[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.960]
Everything will be all right

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.640]
Alright!

[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.280]
Remember this golden gasser!

[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.080]
Wonderful WQAM!

[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.040]
Rudy Martinez!

[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.480]
You know why I couldn't find it?

[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.100]
Why?

[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.100]
Because I wrote it down on the sheet, where it on the Ode with the disc.

[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.040]
Okay.

[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.400]
Rudy Martinez boarded in 1945 and Sagitton, Michigan! Nice going!

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.180]
There we go!

[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.280]
Finding out one right anyway.

[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.480]
96 years, great song only got what did it get?

[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.780]
A few votes, so I'm not going to go back and get that thing out again.

[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.120]
Yeah!

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.540]
Yeah, no I had more than that, I think like 10.

[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.960]
Church has a lot of suicide victims on its hands, rights, Douglas Montero in the New York Post today.

[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.940]
He says the Catholic Church in the United States is up against the wall.

[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.360]
That was evident yesterday when two heartbroken women basically accused the Church had his bishops of manslaughter.

[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.560]
Five years ago these women would have been called blasphemers, blasphemers.

[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:59.980]
But yesterday in Dallas where about 300 bishops are meeting to address the Church's growing, priest sex abuse crisis, these women were sought after.

[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.960]
People are listening thanks to the 700 journalists here.

[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.440]
People are finally getting the message that when it comes to sex abuse of kids, the Church isn't as holy as it pretends to be.

[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.960]
Janet Patterson, 58 of Kansas, does want to take down the Church.

[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:20.640]
She just wants people to know her 29-year-old son, Eric Bluas, brains out on October 29, 1999, because a predator priest abused him 17 years earlier.

[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.340]
Priest sex abuse is deadly, said Patterson, who spoke calmly holding a photograph of herself and her husband kneeling by their son's grave.

[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.200]
All his life he tried so hard to please God and he always came up short.

[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.220]
We came here to speak out so others don't feel desperate or alone.

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.560]
She's angry because Church leaders allowed her son's attacker to function as a priest, although he'd abused others before.

[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.860]
Patterson has a website where relatives of priests included suicide victims can post information.

[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.640]
What is it priest-induced suicide victims can post information about their cases and document church negligence.

[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.380]
The faces of the spiritual leaders of Catholics in New York were plastered on a newsprint page like so many mug shots.

[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:12.200]
Below their names were listed details of how they allowed predator priest to infest communities, advocate Terry Light 50 as today was in tears, recalling how her friend and fellow victim Mary Ann Loveleys 55 committed suicide two years ago in Las Vegas, a priest raped her when she was 17.

[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:20.520]
Light cried an hour before she and other victims were to meet with members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Adhaq Committee, set up to develop a new priest sex abuse policy.

[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:27.760]
She cried because when she and Loveleys met with a similar ad hoc committee in 1994 in Washington, the bishops were falling asleep listening to what she said.

[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.820]
The committee this time will stay awake. There's blood on their hands and native out Catholics in this country know it.

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.340]
Right, Stug Monteiro, today's New York Post.

[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.680]
I have so much priest stuff today, man. I got priest coming out my ass, you know what?

[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.040]
So do all the other boys.

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.540]
Oh, brother.

[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.640]
Although before we get back to that, just so we can spread it around a little bit.

[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.120]
Yeah, to talk about good religious hate since that basically is like a repetitive redundant religious hate.

[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:05.960]
St. Louis, Missouri, the new head of the Southern Baptist Convention has rejected calls to repudiate what a Muslim group is calling bigoted and hate-filled statements made by one of its pastors.

[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:13.160]
The Reverend Jack Green elected the convention's president just on Tuesday said the Reverend Jerry Vines comments about Islam were accurate.

[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:22.260]
Vines, a former convention president told conventioners at a pastor's conference Monday that many of this country's problems, problems can be blamed on religious pluralism.

[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:30.580]
Pluralists would have us believe that Islam is just as good as Christianity, but I'm here to tell you ladies and gentlemen that Islam is not just as good as Christianity.

[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:36.580]
Vines passed the first bath this church of Jacksonville, Florida, told several thousand delegates of the gathering at St. Louis.

[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.500]
Islam was founded by Muhammad, a demon possessed pedophile who had 12 wives and his last one was an 9-year-old girl.

[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.800]
And I will tell you Allah is not Jehovah either. Jehovah is not going to turn you into a terrorist that will try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people.

[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.880]
I guess he forgot about the crusades and the inquisition and things like that.

[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.240]
They forgot.

[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.740]
Abraham Cooper, a spokesman for Washington-based council on our islam-American-Islamic relation, said the comments were outrageous.

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:12.440]
It's really unfortunate that a top leader in a mainstream Christian church would use such hate-filled and bigoted language in describing the faith of one fifth of the world's population who were set on Tuesday.

[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.840]
This is the level of bigotry that requires a clear statement from the top leadership of the Southern Baptist convention.

[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.620]
Graham of Plano-Texas' Advine Statement is an accurate statement that he would not condemn his colleague. How do you like that?

[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:32.240]
I will not respond to Dr. Vine statement other than to say that anyone who follows any path who wants to go to heaven should look carefully at who they're following and what they believe he told reporters.

[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:39.180]
William Merrill, a spokesman for the SBC Executive Committee, said the comments were made outside the actual meeting and that it was not the SBC's place to comment.

[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:46.860]
Ingrid Madison, vice president of the Islamic Society of North America, and a professor of Islamic studies at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut called the comments,

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:56.880]
mean evil. She said statements like this from such a high-placed religious leader can lead to violence against Muslims. It makes me wonder what's the hateful religion right now that we should be worried about, she said.

[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.020]
How do you like that, huh?

[00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.760]
I like it.

[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:08.140]
As they just continue attacking each other, attacking, attacking, attacking my religions better than yours, and the real Christians and the real good people that I believe is please stand up.

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.720]
Kind of sounds like something that John Ascroft said a few weeks ago, remember that?

[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.320]
I do.

[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.000]
Yeah.

[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.780]
Fashes pig, right wing crazy son of a bitch, but anyway.

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.320]
So getting back to our good music here. See, I got to like segue.

[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.040]
No, I like it.

[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.400]
I like it too. Bricks it up a little bit.

[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.120]
Now, what else was on it?

[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.220]
I guess nothing else, huh?

[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.200]
I wrote these down by the way, just, uh,

[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.900]
well, we already got 96 tears. We did that. Is it okay? So let's not repeat.

[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.700]
And we already did this one too, but since it's on air.

[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.740]
Yeah. But we didn't, did we do this?

[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.940]
Let's write that's right. I'm sad and blue.

[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.240]
I can't do the blue, because though I'm lost, I'm lost, can't do it.

[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.660]
Are you sure?

[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.100]
I'm pretty sure.

[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.600]
Are you sure?

[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.660]
Not probably.

[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.800]
I remember writing this down.

[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.860]
Well, I'm looking at four kids.

[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.820]
I'm singing one more time, oh, my mother.

[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:01.540]
I don't see.

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.240]
What are you doing?

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.100]
I'm making right that down.

[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.040]
This is silly song, but people like it.

[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:14.720]
Who did that?

[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.360]
The Pippkins.

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:16.960]
Pippkins?

[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.960]
Pippkins with a P-P-I-P-K-I-N-S.

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.660]
Pippkins.

[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.880]
You don't know your Pippkins, mister. I'll tell you that right now, Goddammit.

[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:25.760]
Pumpkins?

[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.940]
How about the smashing pumpkins?

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.760]
You hear what the smashing pumpkin said yesterday, all of it?

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.580]
That's what they said.

[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.440]
People?

[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.880]
People, and I love you. This is a great song.

[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.360]
Yes.

[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.280]
All of it takes forever to get going, you know.

[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.820]
We listened to it before the show today.

[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.400]
For about an hour.

[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.680]
At the last minute.

[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.140]
45 minutes and finally gets going.

[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.420]
We could do the weather report and a lost dog.

[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.620]
Yeah, how'd you like to do the talk up on this, baby, huh?

[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.260]
Not to make Ricky Tiki flip his cap.

[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.980]
I don't wish you all your good guy in our book.

[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.480]
You're okay.

[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.460]
100% free three hours today in Dayton, Routin.

[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.080]
The next to me, wash off that again.

[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.680]
Yeah, logonacuum.com and start playing the Toyota baseball trivia challenge.

[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.940]
Weekly prizes include golf or forward chulas.

[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.400]
The grand prize is a privilege of the New York or the Labidi weekend.

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.560]
To see the Marlins play the meds, so logon and start playing with it today.

[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.180]
You can logon right now if you like at WQM.com.

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.600]
And believe me, we're not even close.

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.540]
No, that was good though.

[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.680]
Hit a post.

[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:22.940]
Hit a post.

[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.100]
You're close.

[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.180]
But you hit a post.

[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.200]
Yeah.

[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.480]
She'd manage at one o'clock.

[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.960]
I love you.

[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.060]
I love you.

[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.180]
I love you.

[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:36.900]
I love you.

[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.420]
Great song.

[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.440]
Boy, it sure took a long time getting around with that, didn't it?

[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:39.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.860]
But this room was the war.

[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.620]
What the hell is this?

[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.100]
Pacific gas and electric.

[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:44.800]
Are you ready?

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.860]
Fit down and flip it.

[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.820]
You know all this songs?

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.000]
Is this one we're writing this down?

[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.920]
You bet you're sweet ass we're.

[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.160]
You can also subtitle it like, do you be ready?

[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.180]
But I guess that's back in those days they didn't speak like that.

[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.160]
What year was that from, you know?

[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.480]
Yeah, like I do.

[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.420]
Are you ready?

[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.600]
Are you ready?

[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.940]
Pacific gas and electric, baby.

[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.000]
We got the old gas.

[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.840]
941 at 560.

[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.180]
That's what John Ascroft is probably going to give a lot of folks too.

[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.640]
But gas if they don't watch out.

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.760]
Hey, father's day is coming just a matter of days away now.

[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.640]
Make that feel special like getting him this year.

[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:49.620]
We're going to give him a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

[00:30:49.620 --> 00:31:18.660]
Anyway, when I do put on those new balance shoes and I'm out walking around on the streets and all over shmoring around as my mother would say, especially in Amsterdam it was cobblestone streets. In fact, everybody's going to be going on vacation this summer almost everybody. And when you're going to be doing all that walking you're going to have some great walking shoes. That's why new balances the place to get it. And you always know you're going to get a perfect fit because every time you go in there the train, foot fetishes and specialists and new balance measure it the old fashioned way the length and the width they want to take a good hard look at it and your foot too. New balance scores with three great great locations in Miami's Pine Quest, the second floor of the Evans Hurrah Mall and the

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:29.840]
town center in Bokka or you can check them out on their website at newbalancemyme.com and don't forget until Father's Day buy any new balance shoes and get a free cushion support in so I'm telling that Neil sent you by but hurry because the

[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.160]
see you there.

[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.820]
And Kathleen's game nights week back to Ted on sports radio 560.

[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.020]
QA.A.

[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.860]
I don't believe it.

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.820]
The holding commercial was childishly edited from its original form into our own perverted version.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.740]
Any reassembly of an actual commercial by this program is purely adolescent in no way affiliated with the advertiser but it does make us laugh.

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.840]
Is there a better way to experience intimate cleansing? Now there is.

[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.760]
Introducing Vagicill Cleansing Foam.

[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.320]
It's so smooth and creamy.

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.580]
It kind of tastes like miracle web.

[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.540]
It's unlike any douche, towelette, wash or soap.

[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.640]
It takes the rust off the trailer hitch.

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.420]
It gently cleans away wetness even odor without rinsing.

[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.920]
It takes red wine stains off the white carpet.

[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.760]
After all, a woman can never feel too clean and fresh.

[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.220]
I feel too fresh.

[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.460]
Heck, Krispy Kreme donuts aren't this fresh.

[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.720]
New Vagicill Cleansing Foam from Vagicill.

[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.300]
But you know what that sure sounds real good right now don't Krispy Kreme donuts?

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.800]
Mmm.

[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.020]
946 and 560 WQM.

[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.040]
We got a regular lineup today.

[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.080]
Well, almost we got the mad dog at one hand cut three in the studio.

[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.020]
The big at seven because there's no Marlin game I guess.

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.860]
What is your pounded Kansas City last night?

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.300]
Didn't they? What was it Robert 13 to five?

[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.380]
He has no idea. He didn't pay attention that crap.

[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.220]
He don't get any K at 10 and Joe and Mark overnight 2 to 6.

[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.780]
In fact, before the show this morning Robert now talking about hockey.

[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.600]
He's about 15 minutes.

[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.940]
Hockey, hockey, hockey.

[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.160]
How do you like that?

[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.360]
I probably shouldn't say that then he'll get knocked off that morning show.

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.400]
Now some of these factors man.

[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.400]
Oh Robert Parker and Barefooten did I mention that?

[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.440]
I don't know.

[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.300]
I'll pick it up.

[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.600]
It qualifies right that down immediately if not sooner.

[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.340]
Robert Parker and Barefooten.

[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.220]
Barefoot, we be Barefooten.

[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.200]
In fact, you know something I think of that song he says we be Barefooten.

[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.720]
Then he say that?

[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.080]
He does say that.

[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.400]
We be Barefooten.

[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.920]
I think he was one of the first people to be speaking bubonics on a all-time job.

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.340]
Also, what was the other illiterate thing?

[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.640]
Romeo and what was it?

[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.900]
Caesar and the Romeo's?

[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.180]
What was that song I'm trying to think of?

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.720]
I don't know.

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.360]
Oh these oldies but goodies reminds me of you.

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.240]
Who the hell did that?

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.820]
Don't you remember that?

[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:36.980]
Yeah.

[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.060]

[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.640]
He talked about that.

[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.760]
These oldies but goodies reminds me of you.

[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:41.940]
Oh my god.

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.960]
He's gonna remind me.

[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.280]
I have the time to get to the tunnelist.

[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.460]
Yeah.

[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:45.760]
Are we going?

[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.120]
Can we put it on today?

[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:47.580]
Fine.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.720]
What?

[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.060]
Monday and all-in?

[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.700]
I don't think they had any other heads today.

[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.540]
Easy peasy.

[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.260]
Yeah.

[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.560]
And by this season night.

[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.400]
That's one of my favorite songs by the way.

[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:01.940]
I like it a lot.

[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.800]
I already wrote it down.

[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.660]
In fact, that was Ben Alexander's favorite song.

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.800]
Joe Friday on my mind.

[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.220]
I love the way some of these people faxed me.

[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.380]
Some of these imperious kind.

[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.920]
I mean, I appreciate your faxes very much.

[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.900]
We love them and etc.

[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.280]
But it's always like, I can't believe it.

[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.180]
And that's exactly what it says.

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:17.680]
Geez.

[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.620]
I can't believe you missed Gogi Grant wayward wind about 1960 or so.

[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.700]
First of all, it was like 50, much earlier than 60.

[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.300]
Right in our time frame.

[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.780]
It never hurt from her against his Rick.

[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.320]
Well, Rick.

[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.740]
Suddenly, there's a valley by Gogi Grant was number 9 on the charts.

[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:33.440]
He had two hits.

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.320]
So there you go, Mr. Smarty.

[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.280]
Pants, thank you very much.

[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:36.820]
But you're wrong.

[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.640]
Also, here's when it says two songs from the 80s.

[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.820]
Sorry, I don't know the name of the band.

[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.720]
Abracadabra, Steve Miller band.

[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.760]
Not a number one wonder.

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.860]
And also, Angel is a center full.

[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.780]
J. Guiles band.

[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.520]
I wrote those on them.

[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:48.580]
Oh.

[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.440]
I wrote the commentary.

[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.460]
Both of those groups had multiple orgasms.

[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.300]
And multiple hits.

[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.520]
So I have no idea what they're talking about.

[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.260]
This one goes on a little right now.

[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.120]
I thought we already had it on there.

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:01.920]
Not yet.

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:02.960]
What?

[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.060]
Not yet.

[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:04.940]
Look at what we did.

[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.580]
I double-checked.

[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.540]
Great song.

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.380]
A middly other smash.

[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:18.900]
Oh.

[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.580]
It's a cool part by the small faces.

[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.560]
And there's a bunch of other good stuff on this particular one.

[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.700]
There are good stuff on all of these.

[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.300]
But this is not a one-hit wonder.

[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.820]
The literature is British-invasion.

[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.340]
By 1963, I would say.

[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.220]
Needles and pins.

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.340]
And somebody else who certainly wasn't small potatoes and had lots of hits that we never

[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.380]
hear his music for some reason.

[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.640]
Gene Pitney.

[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:55.480]
Yeah.

[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.740]
In fact, you know something.

[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.280]
Gene Pitney looked a little bit like Tom Walling now that I think of it.

[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.880]
At least in the shower.

[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.800]
I had to write to see that out.

[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.760]
But if we're honest from Tulsa.

[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.280]
And maybe this could be the best song of all time.

[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:09.580]
You know what?

[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.060]
Oh, great.

[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.320]
And it isn't just a bad week recording on this.

[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.120]
It was recorded this story.

[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:17.640]
You know that?

[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.560]
Now that I think about it.

[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.100]
Yes it was.

[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:19.660]
Yeah.

[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.060]
Just to stay on track.

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.280]
It should be part of the last we wrote on the first day.

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:23.900]
Right.

[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.420]
It was kind of.

[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.400]
I don't want to be active.

[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.260]
I think the only thing that I'm going to song back from being the best song of all time

[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.100]
was the twilight.

[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.620]
You're recording, probably.

[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.120]
Now that's on the outside.

[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:38.600]
Huh?

[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.800]
That's on Beyoncé.

[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.440]
Moody Blues and Go Now.

[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.560]
Boy outside it makes me want to go right now.

[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.580]
Oh, another really good group.

[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:46.800]
Tremolo.

[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.680]
In an even better group.

[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.380]
The Hollies.

[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.260]
Yeah.

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.020]
I like the Hollies a lot.

[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.740]
Anybody don't like the Hollies that come in is.

[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.220]
I had the greatest pitch.

[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.060]
The old one over it.

[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.000]
You're being deported.

[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.160]
George too.

[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.140]
See the girl in Sima's other fingers answering through the door.

[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.120]
And then we got the animals.

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.060]
We got out of this place.

[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.640]
And a bunch of there are some groups on here I never even heard of before.

[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.900]
And of course the very very amusing.

[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.380]
Herman's vermin.

[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.340]
He was screwing everything that was what I heard Peter knew.

[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.840]
Why they call it Peter?

[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.100]
Peter knew.

[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.320]
Who comes to start and feel it blind.

[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.860]
See there was so much great music.

[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.520]
The problem is that if you live in South Florida you'll never hear any of it.

[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.020]
That's the only problem is you got like your own great collection like we here.

[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.500]
Like the foundations.

[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.720]
Listen, they also have the doofy a buttercup.

[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:37.960]
Remember?

[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.760]
So they have a one-year wonder.

[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.200]
Now did we put tell Starron or what?

[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.840]
That was on the first list.

[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.280]
Okay.

[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.080]
Because it is on here but I want to play it again.

[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.260]
What about Alan Price?

[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.080]
Simon Smith and his amazing dancing beer.

[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:55.540]
Who?

[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.340]
Ha ha ha.

[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.340]
How about Celia Black?

[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.900]
Answering the music question.

[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.920]
It's Celia.

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.240]
Celia.

[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.000]
I say Celia.

[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.620]
It's Celia Black.

[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.240]
And know that I love you.

[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.560]
Anyone who had a heart.

[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.940]
Yeah, you better put that on there.

[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.160]
Okay.

[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.020]
Celia, how you spell that?

[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.420]
C-I-L-L-A.

[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:18.960]
Celia.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.360]
Okay.

[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.820]
What's the name of the song?

[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.660]
Anyone who had a heart.

[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.620]
I just got to your scene.

[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.020]
I know.

[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:24.640]
Ready.

[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.540]
Anyone who had a heart.

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.520]
Now also I've got these some of these pages from our one-hit wonder website.

[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.540]
And I took what I did was I took 1960 to 62 and I took 1990.

[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.500]
See what I'm saying?

[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.020]
So we have like a...

[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.720]
Because if we do it all from one decade then it like blocks out a bunch of old people out there.

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.160]
Especially the punks.

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.560]
I mean if you're like 25, wouldn't you say like when you're about 10 years old is when you start getting interested in music about?

[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.720]
Yeah, about 10.

[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.020]
So if you're 25 that means 15 years ago is when you started listening to music, popular music, and whatever.

[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.700]
And that makes you like 87.

[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.780]
Oh, you're laughing.

[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.740]
But of course they sure how old we're getting.

[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.040]
Old.

[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.260]
Really old.

[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.640]
Ancient.

[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.280]
Even Roberts getting up there.

[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.820]
Get a little long in the tooth.

[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.700]
But the fact is that if you start listening 87, I mean what do you know about the...

[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.580]
Yeah, I mean let's see listen to magic or stuff like that.

[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.660]
And nobody listens to magic.

[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.880]
That's what I'm hearing.

[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.480]
That's what Rich Shaw told me since we got that new PD man.

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:20.980]
We're...

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.220]
We're up Schmitt's Creek without a paddle.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.940]
Without a cap.

[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.180]
So let's see 1990 on this page, D-Light, and then again I don't know any of these songs.

[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.640]
D-Light, Groove is in the heart.

[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.400]
Yeah.

[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.480]
Good.

[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.400]
That was the one hit wonder.

[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.120]
I don't know about good.

[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240]
It was a good dance song.

[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.440]
Good or not?

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.080]
It was cute though.

[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.420]
That way you mumble but you waffle.

[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.780]
Here's a man who mumbles any waffles folks.

[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.200]
I don't want to say it's good.

[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.400]
I'll see you for breakfast in Maratha Waffle House.

[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.660]
It was fine.

[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.540]
D-Light.

[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.160]
That's with three E's by the way.

[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.100]
D-E-E, a dash, light, L-I-T-E.

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.120]
Put it on there.

[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240]
Do you like Groove is in the heart.

[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.300]
If you played it right now I wouldn't know it.

[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.460]
You'd know it if I played it.

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.200]
It was all over the place.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.920]
Candy man, knocking boots.

[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:04.780]
Huh?

[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.280]
Olythe Adams, get here.

[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.880]
That was like a credit card commercial.

[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.560]
Not a good song, huh?

[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.460]
I'd never heard of it.

[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.560]
Perfect gentleman.

[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.360]
Ula-la, I can't get over you.

[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.320]
Don't know it.

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.220]
Faith No More by Epic.

[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.020]
Okay, Faith No More is the artist Epic is the song.

[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.880]
See, it could be the other way around.

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.060]
It could be on Epic Records, which I'm sure wasn't.

[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.760]
Got it?

[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.400]
Got it.

[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.000]
Kuiper and Tic Tac Toe.

[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.740]
Never heard of it.

[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.300]
Kalloway, I want to be rich.

[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.720]
I remember Cab Kalloway shows you how well I am.

[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.120]
I'm ancient.

[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.780]
Not as old as Moe, but I'm ancient.

[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.400]
Kalloway, I want to be rich.

[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.760]
Never heard of it.

[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.920]
I remember him.

[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.260]

[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:46.880]
And was it good?

[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.340]
No, but it was catchy though.

[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.520]
Well, okay, catchy, if catchy qualifies,

[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.600]
because don't worry, be happy by Bobbie McFarron.

[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.540]
We did put that on there, right?

[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.400]
Yes, we did.

[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.480]
Okay, well, that certainly wasn't good, but it was catchy.

[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:00.640]
Same genre.

[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.000]
Yeah, okay, so what did I just say?

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:03.660]
What was it, infant?

[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.560]
I forgot already.

[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.860]
Kalloway and I want to be rich.

[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.540]
How do you spell Kalloway?

[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.720]
Oh, with a K?

[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.800]
With a C, with a C as in C you next time, mister.

[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.480]
Biz Markey, just a friend.

[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.300]
I remember that one.

[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.240]
I remember it.

[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:20.760]
And?

[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:21.960]
Yeah, sure.

[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.620]
Okay, V-I-Z, Markey, M-A-R-K-I-E,

[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.600]
no relation to Markey, Mark.

[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.320]
What was Kalloway song?

[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.320]
I want to be rich.

[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.340]
Or maybe I want to be fat rich.

[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.180]
You got Biz Markey and just a friend?

[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:36.540]
Yep.

[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.380]
Okay.

[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.040]
Let me put a little line on my thing right there.

[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.020]
Well, this is, you know, when I first talked about doing this,

[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.000]
I thought to myself, this is a massive mammoth undertaking.

[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.900]
I mean, what hit wonders?

[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.460]
There have been like thousands of them.

[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.180]
And then I thought to myself, well, it's a summertime,

[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.880]
it's the doldrums, it's the dog days.

[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.320]
We can kill some good time with this.

[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.260]
Plus the audience likes it.

[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:54.460]
Oh!

[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.280]
At least most of them do.

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.020]
And once they don't, to them, okay?

[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.120]
I got 50,000 stories I got to get to here today.

[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.420]
But, you know, let's interspersion with some good cramp.

[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.160]
Right?

[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.300]
Absolutely.

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.400]
You know, I know I looked at it up because I have my yellow mark on my CD here.

[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.760]
But, boy, it seems to me, so a blackhead, some other hit, you know.

[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.080]
I could be wrong, but capital records, I'll look it up again.

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.700]
Just to be sure, we want to be scientific on this one, baby.

[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.780]
We want to get it right.

[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.400]
It may not be good, but at least it'll be right.

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.660]
Speaking of getting it right.

[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.200]
Yes.

[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.040]
Did we put this on there yet?

[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:31.920]
Couldn't get it right.

[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.300]
They didn't have any other hits in this good day.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.300]
What the hell was that?

[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.220]
My max blue band.

[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:37.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.200]
Yeah, I like that.

[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.800]
I qualified, doesn't it?

[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.920]
Well, for now, I'm going to have to look it up.

[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.340]
Well, I can't think of any other hits.

[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.000]
No, yeah, they did.

[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:48.720]
I love you.

[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.580]
It was number 12.

[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:50.340]
Really?

[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.020]
So, guess what?

[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.140]
Guess what, Mr. Smarty pants?

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.640]
Here's a place though that we know is great, and that's unmatched.

[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.860]
That's the Army to look half-way.

[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.760]
Well, I remember when they first started out back when I was on Zeta.

[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.160]
And they used to send over the crème brûlée.

[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.400]
Oh, God, I thought to myself, this is just like dying and going to heaven.

[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.320]
And all of the food they sent over was spectacular.

[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.160]
Well, the good news is, back in those days, they used to be in some little

[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.980]
bum-fork place over on TV Road Extension.

[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.920]
And from the outside, it looked like, you know, so a lot of people probably missed out

[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.320]
although they did extremely well and they became extraordinarily popular,

[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.040]
which is why for 14 years in a row, Armadillo Cafe has been listed as one of the top

[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.860]
of the most popular restaurants in all of Broward County.

[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.460]
And now they're in a great, even better new location that's on university driving

[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.400]
a pizza-loved plaza right beyond Pier 1 Imports where Sadie's befays used to be

[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.320]
between 595 and Griffin Road.

[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.260]
Right there on University in Davien.

[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.820]
Boy, the food is out of this world.

[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.220]
Try the appetizers likely to kill a grilled shrimp with corncakes or the

[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.940]
Temporar Island Princess Conk, only the best ingredients in all their goodies.

[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.320]
Then order one of their terrific spinach salads, if you like, would glazed pecans

[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.240]
with a pistachio-crested mozzarella salad with lemon-vazel dressing.

[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.540]
I'm not going to go back to the entrees that I can't pronounce.

[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.240]
But I will tell you about the pan-seered yellowtail snapper with roasted peppers

[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.520]
of the sea bass with sweet corn and a few glazed dozens and dozens of

[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.100]
mothwatering entrees. All kinds of neat, unique things on a menu.

[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.880]
And for dessert, the desserts will be a perfect ending to a phenomenal feast.

[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.160]
Try the Armadillo Crème Broulet, like I said, it's the best in the world

[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.520]
or the warm chocolate fritters covered in hot fudge.

[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.900]
Hopefully by this October, I'll have lost enough weight I can try that right on the

[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.040]
ear, okay? They'll bring it in.

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:15.720]
Yeah, they will.

[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.100]
Warm chocolate fritters covered in hot fudge.

[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.780]
Doesn't that turn my, makes my insides warm in the fuzzy?

[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.120]
Call the Armadillo Cafe for Reservations 954-4239954.

[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.300]
That's 954-4239954.

[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.680]
It's smoke-free, by the way, with plenty of free parking and a couple of men of

[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.580]
reevalet parking too.

[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.860]
Tell me, Neil sent you by for the feast of a lifetime at the Armadillo Cafe.

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.160]
Mr.

[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.860]
Mitchell and Marsha, overnight time sports radio 560-2-2-3am.

[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.860]
If you blow too much, you're in trouble.

[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:55.240]
Niva, Diana Ross checks herself into the promises, Rehabilitation Center in Malibu, California.

[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.380]
After admitting she was addicted to liquor and pain killers.

[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.540]
All right, group settled down.

[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.720]
Suggest how please.

[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.580]
Now, who would like to begin today?

[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.220]
How about you, Diana?

[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.820]
I am not Diana.

[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.460]
I am Miss Ross, and I ain't nobody's opening that.

[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.420]
Let that little white, choppy girl go.

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.640]
Smells like wild turkey.

[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.380]
Now, Diana, let's just get control of our emotions.

[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.840]
I am Miss Ross, and who the hell are you?

[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:20.660]
A director?

[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.480]
You trying to direct Miss Ross?

[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.140]
I didn't listen to Alan Pacula.

[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.780]
I sure as hell ain't gonna listen to you.

[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.480]
I ain't no mountain high enough.

[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.760]
Diana, take a deep breath.

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.220]
In and out.

[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.960]
We just need to get to the root of your problem.

[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.700]
You're my problem, funny little man.

[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.400]
And stop looking directly at me.

[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.320]
This is awful.

[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.720]
This is more painful than recording an endless love with Lionel Richie.

[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.520]
How long is this gonna take anyway?

[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.260]
I got my curl and I unplugged in back my room.

[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.220]
Yes, James, you have something to add?

[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.100]
I'm feeling a little intimidated by Diana.

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.400]
Well, get a lie, little Mexican man.

[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.600]
You can slide him right behind Mary Wilson.

[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.400]
Go on now! He's on down!

[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.680]
He's on down the road!

[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.180]
10-03-560-WQ, I'm happy Thursday to you.

[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.080]
So here's all kinds of stuff coming in on the faxes.

[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.600]
Rico, Swave, by Gerardo.

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.740]
Did I just play that the other day?

[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.240]
You played it the other day, but I don't think I ever made it on a list.

[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:11.800]
Good.

[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.600]
Well, I thought you liked Gerardo.

[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.260]
I do like Gerardo, but that don't mean you can sing.

[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.360]
I thought you thought he was Rico and Swave.

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.920]
I liked Tab Hunter too, but that doesn't mean I'd put young love by Tab Hunter on there.

[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.780]
Well, he had some other hits and he couldn't sing for Cram.

[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.200]
A Brownsville station smoking in the boys' room, didn't we check that out or what?

[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.060]
I don't remember.

[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.080]
Ah! Ah!

[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:30.380]

[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.540]
God, I just put the book down too, because I got...

[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.540]
And it's interesting how many of these that come in,

[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.300]
and I look them up and a group had like 700 hits, you know what I mean?

[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:38.680]
Right.

[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.860]
Brownsville station also had Kings of the Party, so...

[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.300]
Sorry! Thanks for the try.

[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.360]
Here's a list that's like a mixed bag.

[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.900]
Some of them are right and some of them are wrong.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.380]
Listen on the list, I believe.

[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.180]
This is gonna be on Arlen's.

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.600]
Got it?

[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:56.600]
Okay.

[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.080]
Double shot, swing in the day, and double shot of my baby's love.

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.400]
Mark it down.

[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.580]
Welcome to Spawn and I head with the band.

[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.420]
Good song, by the way.

[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.000]
Another one, which is... We already had this.

[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.760]
But it's worth playing a little bit out there.

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.320]
Ted Nugin and the Anboy Duke's.

[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.800]
How come this didn't get a lot of votes?

[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:16.700]
I don't know.

[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.240]
What's wrong with you, people out there?

[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.080]
I say it again.

[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.420]
A lot of you folks have got...

[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.380]
It's tasting your...

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.240]
And it's worth it to be right over.

[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.360]
In fact, you know, for my money, this is right up here with the best of the moon.

[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:36.800]
And...

[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.280]
You don't like this?

[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.140]
I heard it too much.

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.840]
I don't like that guitar.

[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:41.580]
It's sour.

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.420]
Commonly step-commonly step-manly.

[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.140]
You are...

[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:44.600]
I like Ted.

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.820]
You're a new to the center of your mind.

[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.640]
Now, this wasn't a one-hit wonder.

[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:52.980]
But I liked it.

[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.600]
You didn't select Terry Staths, I did.

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.560]
And suspicion?

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:56.300]
Yep.

[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.560]
And what about the babies every time I think of you?

[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.200]
I like it a lot.

[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.000]
I used to have to play that.

[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:01.940]
How about the chance?

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.780]
The key doesn't matter.

[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:04.920]
Not a one-hit wonder though.

[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.660]
Oh, here's a one-hit wonder.

[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:07.620]
Mark it down.

[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.020]
One of my favorite songs of all times.

[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.600]
The few I am theme song.

[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:15.820]
The few I am theme song.

[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.020]
The few I am theme song.

[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.480]
Yeah, we send that up.

[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.840]
We dedicate that to Greg Reed today.

[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.800]
Got it lies by the Nicarbockers?

[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.240]
Okay.

[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.460]
How about...

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.820]
This is the only one.

[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.700]
Moments live on a two-way street.

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.460]
Not a one-hit wonder.

[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.160]
Here's one that is.

[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.200]
Get ready to mark it down.

[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.980]
Got it down.

[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.800]
Working too hard.

[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:45.660]
The scenes.

[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:46.960]
Push in too hard.

[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:47.200]

[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.460]
The pushing too hard.

[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.920]
The pushing on me.

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.680]
The pushing too hard.

[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.160]
What you want is a theme.

[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.560]
See, it's good that we got all these discs.

[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.260]
Because now, and then vocal Brian's into stuff.

[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.440]
Because now you can write down stuff.

[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.440]
They're actually going to a chance to hear to refresh their memories.

[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.360]
Like...

[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.780]
Oh, hey listen.

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.520]
I like it.

[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.200]
I'm embarrassed.

[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:06.860]
Back of the end.

[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.380]
Not enough.

[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.440]
Thomas Dolby.

[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.900]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.780]
As a daily sign.

[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.220]
Oh, surprise me.

[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.320]
It's a girl blinding me.

[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:18.200]
Hey.

[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.660]
I don't know.

[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.240]
I don't know.

[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.260]
I'm just wondering what science...

[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:30.960]
How about my future?

[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.140]
So, Brian, I got to wear shades.

[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.080]
Timbuk 3.

[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:33.960]
Timbuk 3.

[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:34.780]
Put that on her too.

[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:36.580]
Huh?

[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.740]
Okay, I give it about a one on scale of 6,000.

[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.100]
And certainly for all our disco fag, a friend.

[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.480]
Huh?

[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.840]
So you beat the...

[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.940]
Vicky Su Robinson, baby.

[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.720]
Turn your meat around.

[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600]
Who's Su Robinson?

[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.160]
Vicky?

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:58.660]
Vicky?

[00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:59.300]
What?

[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.940]
Vicky Su Robinson.

[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.040]
Vicky Su Robinson.

[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.900]
Eric's best Thomas Dolby was not a one hit wonder.

[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.860]
So he better look it up.

[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.000]
I already looked it up.

[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.480]
I'm gonna beat around.

[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.480]
I hit when Eric starts playing Butch Boss up there in Orlando.

[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.840]
He's been isolated from civilization for so long.

[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:19.800]
Let's see.

[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.180]
Thomas Dolby, she blinded me with science.

[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:23.600]
That's it.

[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.180]
That was their only hit Mr. Hot Shot.

[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.280]
That's it.

[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.860]
Right in my Billboard book, Schmeckle.

[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.520]
Now here's the fact.

[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.620]
And here's one that's got one right and one wrong.

[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.000]
The right one, Mars, which you know there's like a thing.

[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:37.620]
Right.

[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.220]
Between each letter in it, M-A-R-R-S.

[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.860]
It's got like a slash in between each one.

[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.280]
Pump up the volume.

[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.340]
Got it.

[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:47.880]
Got it.

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.580]
And then they got Snap.

[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.420]
I got the power.

[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.520]
And of course they had Oops up and the rhythm is a day.

[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:53.740]

[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.060]
So one out of two isn't bad.

[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:56.360]
Okay.

[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.860]
Even Thai Cobb didn't bat 500.

[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.340]
Here's another one that's got three out of six,

[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.400]
which is also 500.

[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.000]
Time all that being by the outsiders,

[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.060]
which I had that here somewhere.

[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.960]
Eventually we'll get to it if we feel like it or not.

[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.960]
No, but they had other hits.

[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.220]
Also the raspberries, and please go all the way,

[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.840]
which I love that song, and I like the raspberries,

[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.940]
but no, they had other hits.

[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.400]
I don't like Mondays by the Boomtown Rats.

[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.760]
They might have had another hit.

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.900]
But they never made that and never made the top 40.

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.500]
They didn't have any songs that made the top 40.

[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.100]
How do you like that?

[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.940]
Now here are the three for the list.

[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.740]
Chick-a-boom by Daddy Doodrop.

[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.000]
Got it?

[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.740]
That's with one of the two hyphons in it.

[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.380]
Chick-a-boom.

[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.280]
Daddy Doodrop.

[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.120]
One took over the line by Bruin Shipley.

[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.520]
I thought we already talked about that.

[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.600]
We talked about it.

[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.680]
I don't know if it ever made a list.

[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.340]
No, it did not.

[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.100]
One took over the line, Bruin Shipley.

[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.880]
And how could we have forgotten the cool jerk by the capitals?

[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:47.600]
Huh?

[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:47.980]
Could we?

[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.400]
That's OLS capitals.

[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:50.680]
So there you go.

[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.080]
Sturder and Shipley.

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:53.980]
Yeah.

[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.740]
Like Carl Boor, you could play the best release.

[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.140]
Bruin Bond, Horton Stanley.

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.460]
You know how that works.

[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.820]
And then see George got very upset when I played this this morning because he says it's not the original cut.

[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:08.920]
It's not.

[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.180]
This is not the original version.

[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.500]
Robert will verify it.

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.860]
It was the first video ever played on MTV.

[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:16.820]
The bugles?

[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:17.860]
Yeah.

[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:18.600]
But the same.

[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:19.440]
The same.

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:19.940]
The same.

[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.420]
You know what?

[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.180]
I don't know.

[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:33.800]
I don't know.

[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.780]
I already shimmed Candat.

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.920]
You're so damn slow.

[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.220]
Trying to write these legibly.

[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.300]
Where did I get Bruin Shipley?

[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:39.940]
Oh, that was a fact.

[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:41.960]
That's a fact.

[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.580]
It's a fact that's sort of...

[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.100]
Cool jerk.

[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:44.660]
The capitals.

[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:45.400]
Yeah.

[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.700]
Get with it.

[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.920]
Oh, here's Ben Meshaping by the Five of Americans, which I do.

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:49.920]

[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.160]
have that here but they had other hits you run my mind by the Wii 5 we already

[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.020]
had it we already had it on the thing yes yeah but we never played it though

[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:05.660]
how do you like that hello mona hello phoena by Alan Sherman get serious

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.160]
that was already under and lost whoo this is some project man I'll tell you

[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.980]
right now can I at least get to like a little a bit of this little bit of

[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:24.740]
that in between all this music stuff for example from the CBS news website

[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:30.120]
John Ascroft minister of fear writes CBS news dot com's dick Meyer he says

[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.760]
who needs terrorists when we have John Ascroft to scare us out of our pants the

[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.820]
way the attorney general detonated the dirty bomber case this we completes

[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:42.220]
his metamorphosis from a common press hog to a genuine fear monger that

[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.980]
Ascroft insisted they had to scoop all the other terror warriors

[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.360]
mysterious Mueller wolfowitz and Thompson and make the announcement about Jose

[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:52.980]
Padilla aka Abdullah Al-Moha jeer in a panicky performance from Moscow shows

[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.140]
what a camera moth Ashcroft is that ascroft overstated the threat of the

[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.560]
Padilla plot and of dirty bombs as weapons of mass destruction shows with

[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.240]
egregious clarity how willing Ashcroft is to use scare tactics to grab headlines

[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.540]
control the news agenda and make himself look good in his Monday statement

[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:12.560]
ascroft said in apprehending Al-Moha jeer as he saw entry into the US we've

[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.880]
disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by

[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.940]
exploding a radioactive dirty bomb by Monday night my colleague Jim Stewart

[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.800]
was reporting that FBI sources were backing off ascroft assertion that there

[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.400]
was a specific developed real plan to use a dirty bomb in the US by Tuesday

[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.660]
morning the deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz the administration's hardest

[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.000]
hardliner was telling CBS news that I don't think there was actually a plot

[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.540]
behind some fairly loose talk and Al-Moha jeers coming in here obviously to

[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.280]
plan for their deeds by Wednesday morning white house sources were telling USA

[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.300]
today that ascroft had been chastised for overplaying the Padilla plot on

[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.740]
Monday ascroft also said that a radioactive dirty bomb involves exploding a

[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.220]
conventional bomb that not only kills victims in the immediate vicinity but also

[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.100]
spreads radioactive material that's highly toxic to humans that can cause mass

[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.000]
death and injury in truth while dirty bombs are extremely dangerous it's an

[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.880]
exaggeration to say they'll cause mass death and injury the conventional

[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.640]
explosion that initiates a dirty bomb can cause death and destruction in the

[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.620]
immediate vicinity of the blast but the effects of the radiation that is spread

[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.600]
then are long-term and very uncertain perhaps the worst effect of a dirty bomb

[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:17.400]
are fear and panic ascroft at his part the crazy thing is that Al-Moha jeer

[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.600]
does seem to be an actual bad guy and al-Qaeda is actually interested in using

[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.760]
dirty bombs it unquestionably is a success that he was apprehended ascroft

[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.980]
didn't need to exaggerate the threatens cares more than necessary to get some

[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:31.400]
credit for that success this is a pattern with the attorney general in

[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.760]
october o ascroft presented over two general organs about impending acts of

[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.160]
terror in his october 29th warning he said the administration's concluded

[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.760]
based on information developed that there may be additional terrorist attacks

[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.040]
within the u.s. and against u.s. interest over the next week ascroft was gently

[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.740]
criticized then for scaring not calming in a way that didn't make a safer or

[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.960]
more prepared the same was true in April when he put another hastily arranged

[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.780]
road announcements this time in Pittsburgh to warn that banks in northeast

[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.920]
could be terror targets it's important to note that there is no specific

[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.000]
threat to any specific situation ascroft said we're not asking the banks to

[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.140]
close the urging people to stay away from banks so why bother to make the

[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.140]
announcement well it was a slow Friday made a good chance of leading all

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:11.560]
three network news broadcast the administration's taking heat lately for

[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.540]
time in its news making the further its political agenda president push

[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.860]
proposed the new home on security cabinet agency just as congress was starting

[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.000]
its own connect the dots hearings and is the FBI whistleblower was preparing

[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.980]
to testify the hearings continue as the padea plot was unveiled minister

[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.700]
propaganda area fly sure hates to hear stuff like that look he said these very

[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.940]
few people want to make such an outlandish political accusation represent the

[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.260]
most cynical among the most partisan and they're not to be taken seriously go

[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.660]
ahead are a call some patriotic personally i think fly sure should be proud of

[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.100]
his teams agenda control prowess that kept the home and security agency announcement

[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.300]
a secret they timed into eclipse of negative stories and to give proposal more

[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.700]
momentum in congress that's called politics or governing or state craft

[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.900]
democrats and reporter shouldn't be shocked and a white house spinner shouldn't

[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.180]
write around on their high horse but scaring people's another matter and it's

[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.220]
turning the department of justice into the ministry of fear

[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.560]

Sounds like the name of a porno movie. They're thinking of a dark base. Ace of base. Ace of base did don't turn around

[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.500]
No, oh don't turn around was the name of their song, but yeah, I

[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.960]
Thought they were thinking of something else. I thought they were thinking of a jerk commissar. I

A fifth debate told me okay that takes care of that disc. Oh, this is this is just too much too much for any one man to have to undertake this

[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.960]
It's a gigantic undertaking

[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.460]

No, I was just amazed that she only had one hit

[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:33.760]

He's speaking to be in safe if you're fat and you're looking to go into a supermarket

[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.680]
You want to buy some stuff that you actually can eat

[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.720]
It's very difficult in your conventional supermarket because most of the stuff

[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.800]
There is loaded with calories and carbs and hidden sugars. Not kinds of crap

[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.040]

[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:45.000]
We take a good hard stiff look and to start them

[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.720]
She made us laugh as only a decrepit incontinent old person saying something suggested can

[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:55.540]
She was Claire a peller the old lady who said where's the beef

[01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:01.220]
What I liked was it where's the beef could be about a hamburger patty

[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.020]
But it could also be about

[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.600]
A man's private parts

[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.060]
In tonight's archived interview Clara talks openly about the double untondra contained in the slogan

[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.760]
You know where's the beef could be something you'd say about a man's penis clearly

[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.260]
Clara was not unaware of how the phrase entered pot culture you could be talking about

[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.440]
His trouser snake yes

[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.320]
Clara peller was as feisty as her on-screen persona could be a reference to his rod

[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.020]
Is swinging weenie his lizard?

[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.360]
And I don't know how many of them were released here in this country. I guess if I looked in the book, huh? Yeah

[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.580]
I just I don't want to take the time to do all this other stuff because it's not very simple

[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.820]
But she looks to it's what they didn't have a hit with that

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:50.800]
Let's see Curtis Lee I'd love to put that on there, but I'm not really positive that he didn't have any other hit pretty little angel on that to me

[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.380]
That's the greatest record I was ever made

[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:57.680]

Kokomo is the group

[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:27.920]
Asia Minor is the song and we're not putting the beach boys in Kokomo on her. They may have had wanted to other slightly better hits

[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.580]

[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.100]
J-A-R-M-E-L-S rhymes with smells so they could probably use a little bit of soap

[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.560]
The contours do you love me? Everybody remembers that the one I had that great stop there in the middle

[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.120]
You know what I used to do when I was a district or key and back then we were playing records of course

But you'd reach over and you'd like grab a hold of the record you know why you were playing it

[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:31.400]
That long pause and so it was like about a one and a half second pause you'd make it in like a ten second pause

[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.140]
Oh, I love doing that

[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.800]

Uh-huh, so even if we wanted to take phone calls we could not that's I want to but I just mentioned it in passing

[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:46.680]
surgically removed the testicles of a Michigan man who was later rushed to the local hospital with severe bleeding. What a surprise

[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.060]
It would be doctor was really shortly afterwards however because his patient it has to be castrated

[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:58.420]
It was a consulting adult Smith says we're waiting for a determination from the prosecutor's office as to what if any charges

[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:04.000]
I'll be made Smith said authority said they had no clues into the motivation behind the operations however many of those seeking

[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.140]
Castration do so to satisfy a sexual fetish a

[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.840]
credited doctors are unlikely to perform such an operation preferring instead to words the patient to seek counseling rather than

[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.600]
mutilation

[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:21.760]
Smith said the Taiwanese man entered the US on a student visa and claimed to have performed about 50 castrations in the US and his previous home in Australia

After the operation the two men shared a pie

[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:36.880]
But when the Birmingham man started laughing in order to see was bleeding and emergency medics were called they were having pie said Smith

[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:43.400]
Referring to a post operative dessert the two men have been cheering before the medics arrived at the scene. They were having like a little hair pie

[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:50.480]

Smith said he had a the Birmingham man apparently contacted the

[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.420]
Unlicensed surgeons who want to release two sites on the internet promoting voluntary castration

[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.200]
There's a group of people out there that are interested in this and having it done and have it done and talk about it

[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.160]
Smith said of the websites. It's an unusual case. Let me say that said Smith

[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.460]
It's the first I ever heard of anything like that or anybody around here. It's ever heard of it

[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.860]

Now the interesting thing about this goddy business. Yes, unlike the barzini business

[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:14.480]
Uh, well, I'll get to that in a second

[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.840]
Newsday reports my boss goddy denied funeral mass notorious mob boss John goddy will be interned in a Roman Catholic cemetery

[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.640]
Alongside his son but his family was denied permission to hold a funeral mass for the convicted killer

[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:30.440]
goddy responsible for least five murders during his bloody reign atop the Gambino crime family

[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:35.700]
Well, not receive a massive Christian burial the Reverend Andrew of a curry chancellor that ISIS have broken said yesterday

[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.560]
Instead of a curry said in a one-sentent statement there can be a mass for the dead sometime after the burial of John goddy

[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.860]
goddy died of cancer Monday to prison hospital in Missouri had been sentenced to life in 1992

[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:50.200]
The decision on the mass echo the ruling made by church officials after the goddy ordered murderer of his

[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.540]
Gambino predecessor big Paul Castellano in 1985

[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:59.900]
Castellano's family received permission for a private mass after his burial but was denied a funeral mass within the body of the church

[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.060]
With the body in the trial. You like that. In other words, they don't want his body inside the church

[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.300]
Maybe out on the step on the stoop

[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:12.180]
But unlike goddy Castellano was also denied burial in Catholic cemetery because of his life of crime

[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:16.980]
Goddy's remains removed from the Missouri prison on Tuesday for their eventual return to New York and his family

[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:18.880]
Which has been splitted by federal prosecution

[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:24.420]
two of his brothers his son and ex-Son-in-law were jailed at the time of his death another brother and an nephew were under indictment

[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:28.820]
Goddy will end up in the family mausoleum that holds his son Frank who died in 1980 at age 12

[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:34.740]
When he was accidentally struck by neighbor's car members neighbor that we talked about that got murdered. Yes, mysteriously John Favara

[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:40.420]
The mausoleums inside St John Cemetery in Queens were an assortment of mafia figures found their final resting spots

[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:46.340]
Those buried at St John's include Carlo Gambino, Carmine Galante, Vito Genevese and Charles Lucky Luciano and of course

[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.480]
Don Vito Cualione

[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:54.820]
When's this announcement did not say why goddy was deemed qualified to be buried in the Catholic cemetery and in addition to Castellano and goddy the church is denied a funeral master

[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:57.660]
Other mobsters Galanian goddy under boss Frank the Tico

[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:05.180]
An issue as a church precept called scandal the idea that by granting a funeral master someone who lived outside church teachings

[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.920]
The wrong message would be sent to the church faithful. Oh my god

[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:10.860]
Thank you

[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.900]
That's the a conference in Dallas by the way that's going on right now, but I guess I guess you must be listening to the show in one of your piece

[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.740]
It is well. It's just bad timing from the die right now. Okay, because the world is watching real close

[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.900]
The denial is not a judgment on the deceased lifestyle since the church believes that only God can make that determination

[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.800]
So that's the excuse for taking his money

[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.400]
But when I started to say before I read that was

[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.460]
In reading all of the New York papers except the times of course, which is too stodd I didn't read anything about goddy in the times

[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:48.300]
But the post and news day and daily news

[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:52.900]
Every columnist and most of the stories were like they they liked him

[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:57.080]
Right does that surprise you because he was a snappy dresser

[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.580]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.800]
I bet you build blast that's probably why Bill just finally gave up you know

[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:03.180]
gave up the battle

[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.640]
Maybe his best customer just died

[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:10.780]
In Howard this is by Steve Dunlavy and yesterday's the New York Post on it's just amazing to me

[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.480]
He says in Howard Beech the colors of red white and blue of the best flag in the world is revered as much as motherhood

[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:22.460]
Under that flag stood 14-year-olds Brian Sacco and Mike Fauci clutching a $15 spray of flowers

[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:27.620]
The boys students at ms-202 left a simple note in the flowers sorry for your loss

[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.260]
Sorry, mister

[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.580]
Of course, this was on a corner of

[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:36.640]
85th Street and Howard Beach where the boys were going to drop off the respects to the goddy family

[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.380]
Brian no, I never saw him my grandmother once pointed out his son John to me

[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:44.260]
All I hear is that mr. Goddy kept crime down out of the mouths of babes

[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.000]
They brought their offerings to the berget hunt and fish club these supreme court of goddy's rulings

[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.960]
Richie goddy john's brother came to the door at 150 pm and was extremely polite and was proud that this neighborhood was so patriotic

[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:58.800]
His older brother pita former sanitation worker wouldn't I couldn't talk to me because he's in the slam

[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.680]
Outside the club again those wonderful flags of the west sent by well-wishers

[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.940]
But Carmine Romeo said something that struck me with stunning irony

[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.200]
There's no better flag than that, but who works behind the cover of that flag he said

[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.500]
The same people who believed known felons like salvatore grovano

[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.320]
These people behind this great flag promoted grovano and did this to john goddy

[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:23.480]
Now before you think I start thinking on my website call johngoddy sympathy.car.com forget about it

[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.540]
Goddy had a new time because the bureaucrats who hide behind that flag said so if I were a judge and thankfully

[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.740]
I'm not I would have given john some jail time

[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.860]
But locked in a tomb for life and to let him die like a dog where he's giving more scotel with his fingers

[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.600]
To the arms of his loved ones to say to uh he knows who's talking to him

[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.820]
This is a disgrace

[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.040]
Guards taking written notes from goddy to say to his wife. He loves her. This is a disgrace

[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.140]
Those people who hide behind that flag is that justice for which we love that flag as Carmine Romeo

[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.240]
Romeo had pasted a dollar bill to the door of the hunt and fish club

[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.760]
And he said the dollar represents how generous he was

[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.180]
I left change underneath that that represented the poor people he helped out

[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.200]
When a woman was burned out of her apartment he got a renew and paid for redecoration and rent

[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.260]
John goddy stern generous was bigger than new york bigger than Hollywood bigger than any one of us he said

[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.280]
Now while I think car mines going overboard

[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.100]
What the hell would we all be doing if it wasn't for the john goddies of the world

[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.240]
We'd have newspapers that focused on the stepward a stepford wives

[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.840]
What would then the nero and patina and capola and scorsese you go to do

[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.020]
We're fascinated by these good fellows although they may be bad fellows

[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.360]
I asked richy. What's the best memory of john goddy?

[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:31.740]
I was lucky enough to be his brother. He said richy old son your brother was a wise guy, but I'll miss him too

[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.760]
Right Steve don't leave you in the near post. They're just amazing to me. Yep

[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:39.100]
We like we like them officers man

[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.360]
We like them we're obsessed with them. I don't care what anybody says. Yeah

[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:47.320]
That's right. We weren't happy when sonny got it on the causeway

[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.120]
Kill what most says with his bad hair piece, you know

[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:56.080]
We didn't like that. Oh, yeah, that's right. We like it quality only family because they were family

[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.000]
Right

[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:57.820]
Right

[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.360]
Mama quality only made a hell of a pasta

[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:10.700]
And flamens are made a hell of a sauce first you got to throw in your sausages and the sausage your meatballs with a wine your sugar cut the crap

[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.660]
Yeah, I like that when centinos is cut the crap

[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:21.440]
He's throwing the sauce. Hey listen flamens. I couldn't keep all that weight on without being a good Italian cook you know that right

[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.260]
And of course you got to you got us bulk up a little bit because you'd have no long

[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.420]
idea how long you're gonna have to go to the mattresses

[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:32.240]
Huh, I guess you can always get take-out from Louis and Abrams

[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:40.060]
More on that story we've been talking about in taunt and mass, you know, they used to have a dog track in taunt and mass

[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.740]
I wonder if they still do I bet you the beast would know

[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:50.500]
A stone-coiled adult burrow cult leader admitted yesterday that he intentionally started to sunda death over an excruciating 51 days in 1999

[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.700]
Till fulfill a twisted religious vision that he now says was wrong

[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:58.160]
This is the latest on the story about the assholes that starved the kid to death

[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:05.280]
It was a product of a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings between my wife and I Jacques Robodo said of his reason for sticking to the

[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.000]
Vizar prophecy that led him to sit idly by as his unsamual side slowly of malnutrition

[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.360]
Where in past court appearances Robodo has been defined an arrogant sprouting anti-government propaganda and declaring sovereignty

[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:24.780]
Yesterday he was contrite and humble he choked back tears during three hours of testimony and taunt and superior court during which he accepted full responsibility

[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.180]
For his 11 month old son's heinous death

[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:31.460]
Remember those cookies heinous heinous

[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.020]
Hmm the buck stops with me

[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:38.440]
He answered flatly when asked by prosecutor Walter Schaeff anybody else in the cult forced him to stop feeding his son

[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:44.080]
Robodo a 29-year-old graduate of north adlabor a high school explained that his wife Karen was distraught by their sons weight loss

[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.380]
And wanted to feed the boy but it convinced her to adhere to the deadly plan because the group thought they were following God's orders

[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.960]
Kind of sounds like our friend there in Texas. What else are named a killer five kids?

[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.740]
Um, yeah, that's what they forget. Yeah, that's right

[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.500]
What's her name?

[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.480]
Yeah, I'm Robert and Ray-A-T. Thank you Robert and her husband was the nutcase

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:08.580]
With that religious crap and talking to living living in the trailer and all this other crap

[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.200]
God are involved in that friend of yours there. What that was his name? Mike Warnicki

[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.600]
Mike Warnicki Warnicki whatever the hell his name was

[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:18.500]
My reaction to it was that in order for me to be a good father and a good husband

[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:23.220]
It was my time to be strong in a situation and to follow through on whatever it is that God was giving us at that time

[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:25.680]
He testified in chili in chili

[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.400]
The trailer we call how the boy went from being a healthy and chubby baby learning to walk to any mobile waif

[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.480]
Whose boni appearance sick in his own mother

[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:38.300]
He began losing weight Robodo said his face became thinner his cry wasn't a normal baby's cry was more like

[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.440]
like that

[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:39.820]
Yeah

[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.500]
Didn't have the energy to cry

[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.620]
Before Samuel's aunt

[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:49.340]
Michelle Mingo handed down the bizarre vision from God the toddler had been eating crackers Cheerios

[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:54.280]
Yogurt and apple sauce in addition to being breastfed quoting scripture Mingo 37 told the sect in March

[01:52:54.280 --> 01:53:00.020]
199 that God was upset with Karen Robodo's vanity and wanted to put her on a high protein high fat diet

[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:06.300]
What have I always told you the religious people are the crazy people absolutely

[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:07.620]
Oh

[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.040]
God was upset

[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:14.140]
With her vanity and wanted to put her on a high protein high fat diet

[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.520]
Maybe God's been in touch with Bob Akkins, you know

[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:23.440]
The vision also called for her to drink a gallon of almond milk every day and to feed Samuel

[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.280]
Only breast milk, but because she was pregnant

[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.460]
She couldn't produce enough milk to nourish the boy

[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:30.760]
He ground his teeth Robodo recalled of his son's final days toward the end

[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.560]
He would often bite down on Karen's nipple at times his eyes would roll back into his head

[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.060]
His skin on his chest changed to a dark color of again getting a white chalky substance in his diaper. Oh

[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:45.020]
Sick sick like I said the more religious they are the sicker they are

[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.200]

[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:38.160]
Me, baby a little Jedi love you need

[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.840]
And 25 women trying to prove they're the one

[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.120]
Yoda, you're so cute and furry

[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:49.240]
Thank you. When one man is involved with more than one woman there's found to be trouble

[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:52.420]
You've been chocked at least on the same speed scene

[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:56.540]
Fight before eyes. Who will we choose? All of my 12 breaths are real

[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:59.460]
Find out on all of them, I want to bachelor

[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.500]
Okay, let the pretty two at 5.60 QM. Here's a fact. Could you please tell us if Geohad Rock is on Bokobryon CD

[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.020]
No, because it's not a Bokobryon bit. It's a Bruce Yehrock

[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.560]
And now that I'm thinking about it now we didn't do anything with that last year did we? No

[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.160]
Don't you think that when we do the best of this fall or we should put some of that stuff on her especially that one?

[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.240]
Sounds like a great idea

[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.600]
Bruce would be delighted to have us put it on her I think maybe and maybe now we'll find out

[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:27.840]
Can't cost anything to ask now. I'm looking at Eric's basically got the thing up there

[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.880]
It says which of these one-hit wonders was the best and I'm looking at it and he's got like one where it's got

[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.920]
Question marks you see that one right that's because I forgot to indent and he loses things

[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:43.100]
At ice to is by Mossadade's moce d-a-d-e-s

[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.180]
Moce d-e-d

[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:47.620]
What is it? Mossadade d-a-d-e-s

[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.520]
One more time

[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:51.780]
That's enough Mossadade's at a stew

[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:55.680]
I'll play it again if you want. No, okay

[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.880]
Well, you know quite an undertaking speaking of undertaking that was a bad lead into this story

[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.000]
So the pull will be up there momentarily. I think we got a pretty good list today

[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.260]
You know I like it and it covers a lot of territory from the early 60s is Danny Gallagher would say a lot of territory

[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.420]
Yeah last night I was watching a little bit of the aliefs and the red wings from what time you was at 70

[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:16.560]
Leaves one at game nine to three by the way

[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:17.880]
Oh, nine to four something like that

[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.600]
I would build you with and Danny Gallagher and the Canadians and leaves from a million years ago

[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:30.500]
Anybody care about that? No, no because no, and guess what so Robert tells me this morning the Robert's failure retired officially now. Is that correct?

[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:31.660]
Yeah

[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.820]
So does that really make a difference now?

[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:42.780]
They did is do you have no hockey team anymore down there? You got Steve Weiss and Roberto L'Oongo and you got Roberto L'Oongo and Steve Weiss

[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.520]
That's about it

[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.660]
More goings-

[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:48.740]
by the monkeys

[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.340]
Close enough

[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:55.640]
Founder we couldn't stick it into the Atlantic Ocean okay in the puck either

[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:59.240]
More bones found as Levy investigation continues

[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:01.960]
A grand jury invested this is from USA today

[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.860]
A grand jury investigating Sean Relivi's homicide and whether representative Gary

[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:11.740]
Condit obstructed justice in the case has heard from the congressman's top aid police also have found more of Levy's bones

[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:18.440]
Mike Lynch condits California based chief of staff answered questions fried in front of a district of Columbia Superior Court

[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.360]
Grand jury Beth Wilkerson lends his lawyer said yesterday

[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:27.860]
He cooperated fully with the investigators and prosecutors and answered all questions in a candid and forthright manner Wilkins himself

[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:32.720]
Lynch last year publicly denied Condit and Levy were having an affair a month later

[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.800]
Condit told investigators that he and Levy were romantically involved according to police sources

[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.420]
So does he have any credibility this guy? No

[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:39.760]
No

[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.060]
The grand jury earlier this year subpoenaed Condit to testify however

[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:49.840]
It's unclear whether the California Democrat ever did last fall the grand jury subpoenaed documents from Condit's office including

[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:55.920]
Telephone message slips and calendars federal law enforcement officials have said they're examining whether Condit and his aids asked other women

[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.980]
Who alleged they had affairs with the congressman not to cooperate with police

[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:04.000]
Condit and his aids have denied attempting to silence anyone right and Marie Smith a flight attendant

[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.220]
alleged that she and Condit had a 10-month affair that Condit sought to dissuade her from talking to

[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:13.220]
Investigators in the Levy case Smith also was said Condit is an intermediary. He's tried to get a design of false

[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.060]
Have it David denying that they ever had an affair

[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.560]
Condit is not denied an affair with Smith

[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:20.720]
But as said he never asked her to sign anything that was fraudulent

[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:21.600]
meantime

[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.580]
Well, of course he's gonna admit to that because that's like a major crime right? That's a felony right

[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:31.740]
Mean time police searching the area of Washington's Rock Creek Park where Levy's remains were discovered last month if found more bones

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.220]
Oi

[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:39.580]
The medical examiner told us that two small bones no more than two inches long are consistent with other bones in Levy's foot

[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:45.020]
Said Sergeant Joe Gentile police spokeswoman the spokesman the abodies and the bones were found on Monday

[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:50.920]
A foot long bone found Tuesdays being analyzed by the medical examiner dr. Jonathan Arden Gentile said

[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.640]
Police searching the area now are being helped by trained volunteer searches from the FOP

[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:58.420]
Aren't those the people at Coggerhouse asked for money the FOP

[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:04.840]
That's them. Yeah, the FBI crime labs also continuing to examine twisted wire and Levy's

[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:08.960]
Shinnbone that were found last week by investigators hired by her parents and of course

[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.140]
I'm so sick. Yeah, I've got a bad mind because I'm thinking you know of the shin bone connected to the

[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:19.220]
Okay, because shin bone is just not a word that you use a lot. You know as soon as I came across the word shin bone

[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:25.300]
I'm thinking that that's a terrible thing connected to the knee bone. Yeah to the hip bone hip bone connected

[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.860]
To the I guess not right now. I mean she's dead now

[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:31.360]
It's not like you're not gonna hurt her feelings or anything and the Levy's don't live anywhere near

[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:36.300]
South Fotica. They're not gonna hear this show. They're not listening on the internet right now to the tasteless neo-rodger show

[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:38.400]
They're probably waiting for Bill or Riley to come on not

[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.280]
Police were criticized for not finding the edams during a week-long search of the park after Levy's remains were found

[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:49.240]
May 22th by a man walking his dog police also searched the park shortly after leaving this appear last year

[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:53.320]
But police chief Charles Ramsey's acknowledged searchers didn't go over the general area where the rains are found

[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:58.620]
Arden examined the original rains which included Levy's clothing and termitude was homicide

[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:02.640]
But they still haven't got any idea how she was killed who'd done it. They don't know crack

[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.400]
And how come I couldn't find any more about that robber Blake thing about the LAPD maybe botching that thing

[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:13.380]
I'm real curious about you know what I think they suffer from I think they got a bad case of botulism

[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:19.620]
Because the LAPD botches every guy damn case that they touch they just can't get it right and of course you'll be ecstatic

[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:24.520]
You'll be squeezing yourself you'll be so excited if he gets off like on something kind of technicality will be ecstatic

[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.760]
Yes, you will I might throw a party. Oh, it's time to vote

[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.340]

[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:37.060]

[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.840]
It was lost in a margins and another song by people as I love you not just I love

[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.220]
Or maybe I love that's all I wrote because I was writing so fast

[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:07.860]
And he actually spelled most of that is right nice going there at his two

Uh, I better vote on here get this thing going you know, but I just I can't make up my mind

[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:18.260]
How about seasons in the sun and Terry jacks I guess not I guess not

[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:24.520]
Uh, the seeds pushing through art. That's a possibility. I'm not going to tell you what I voted for by just I just the

Okay, let me see what comes up. Oh, we got some votes on there already nicker bockers and lies has got to appear

[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.500]
The light and grooving a heart is got one

[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:47.820]
Fay about there's only a couple of votes under just one up this second this moment

[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:51.660]
Conference debating bishops accountability

[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:58.500]
faced with the biggest scandal I can front the Catholic Church in the US about 300 bishops from throughout the country converge in Dallas yesterday

[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:03.220]
And began an unexpected debate about whether to punish bishops who protect sexually abusive priests

[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:08.020]
And you'll notice that the victims now after those meetings yesterday they're pushing them a lot farther than they wanted to go

[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.620]
Which is good. They're holding their feet to the fire so to speak

[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.040]
Bishop Wilton Gregory president of the US Conference of Catholic bishops will not predict how bishops might sanction themselves

[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.780]
And did not set any specific proposals, but he said he expects the issue to be debated as the bishops discuss a new

[02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:27.560]
Mandatory national policy ended preventing and responding to instances of sexual abuse of minors by priests

[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:32.100]
Conference leader strongly suggested that the draft policy released last week will be tough and by weeks end

[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.480]
The question of accountability of bishops is a burning issue

[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:42.260]
And I have every reason to believe that particular topic will receive significant debate Gregory said I clearly agree that topic will be a matter that needs discussion

[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:48.260]
The nation's bishops have gathered at a hotel in Dallas for an extraordinary meeting to discuss an extraordinary crisis

[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:55.480]
Over the last six months since details are reported of how the art slices of Boston transferred to Reverend John gig in despite knowing he'd been accused of molesting boys

[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:58.400]
The scandal has engulfed the nation's largest religious denomination

[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.800]
The Church's moral authority and financial strength have been threatened and advocates have reformed from the left and the right of inclamoring for change

[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.780]
As in now

[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:12.300]
The Church has declined to release overall statistics, but lawyers newspapers and interest groups have estimated that as many as

[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:18.040]
1500 priests have molested children in the last five decades and many bishops have failed to remove those priests from the ministry

[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.000]
And they all should be in jail the ones that are still alive put them in jail right now do not pass go do not collect $200

[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.080]
Do not get one free molestation all of them in goddamn jail

[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.280]
And you know something they can probably have a pretty good time in there well big huh

[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:36.440]
Depends on who's in there with them. Maybe they can put them in like in one of those adolescent jails, huh

[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:42.660]
And they're probably they're probably be volunteers. They probably be lined up to be in there on the inside

[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.020]
so to speak

[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.440]

My religion's better than yours

My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.300]
We will be decent until they never ever pay me ill.

[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.540]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:38.260]
Please.

[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:41.100]
My religions is better than yours.

[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:44.400]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:49.380]
We now condorce the bother you like polar brush to spew our views.

[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:51.140]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:55.060]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:58.280]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:03.420]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and get some very lots of wives.

[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:05.460]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:09.460]
My religion better than your religion

[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:13.220]
My religion better than yours

[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:15.720]
We don't want to use our brains

[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.480]
We're mindless when things are parade

[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:19.460]
My religion better than yours

[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:26.320]
Get on, I don't want to say we look like a little idiot

[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.220]
That's cool

[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:29.740]
God!

[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:34.240]
Who's spelled it like that with ease?

[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:34.640]
It's the same

[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.880]
Right by the way, Eric is trying to figure it out

[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:39.500]
There's people voting continuously and it's very tough

[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:40.900]
Very tough one

[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:42.520]
To change it while people are voting

[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:44.200]
But he did change it but it's still wrong

[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:47.960]
Oh, it's ITCH, itch

[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:50.060]
Y-C-O-O

[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:52.500]
Itch-E-Coup-Park

[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.280]
Still my fault

[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.780]
We had two ease on here in the first place because George is a little bit

[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:57.700]
And now we got Iki

[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.540]
How you spell itch-E-Coup?

[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:02.800]
I just got through a telly

[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.900]
I know but who knows that?

[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.040]
Y-C-O-O

[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:07.360]
If you don't know, you act

[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:10.480]
My eyes and you

[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.560]
More publics

[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:12.940]
No, it's not

[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.780]
It's really a little bit

[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:17.260]
Itch-E-Coup-Park

[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:21.500]
That's great song, right away

[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:22.040]
That's a great song, right away

[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.320]
I didn't vote for it but it's a great song

[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.200]
Somebody just faxed this into what's from the Washington Post

[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:30.660]
We never realized that representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican was so despised

[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:33.940]
Bill Clinton that he demanded his impeachment before the Monica Lewinsky scandal

[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:35.740]
Was such a delicate hot house flower

[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:40.720]
Well it turns out that Barr was deeply hurt by all those slings and arrows during his 1998 ordeal

[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:42.660]
As a Republican impeachment manager

[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.020]
Barr was so wounded in fact that he's filed suit in Washington federal court

[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.260]
Against the former president, Clinton loyalist James Carville and

[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:53.100]
Politically active pornographer Larry Flint seeking compensatory damages

[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:56.760]
Incessive $30 million for loss of reputation and emotional distress

[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:59.940]
An injury in his personal property allegedly caused by these three

[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:04.000]
Who Barr claims conspired to hinder the plaintiff in the lawful discharge of his duties

[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.640]
Oh my god

[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:12.440]
When Barr's normally media friendly lawyer judicial watch president Larry Clayman initially declined to comment on the lawsuit

[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.060]
We sense that something highly unusual was a foot

[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:20.540]
The suit was filed very quietly back in March but didn't come to light until yesterday when Flint issued a press release

[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:26.540]
Maybe Barr who was mummious today thought the publicity wouldn't help his tough primary race against Republican John Linder

[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:29.540]
Another Republican incumbent in their firstly redrawn congressional district

[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:34.440]
Defended Flint, Flint meanwhile declared this time Barr has kicked the wrong dog

[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:39.140]
Defended Carville told us the call to suit frivolous would be to elevate the status of frivolous

[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:43.800]
Clinton's attorney David Kendall said the claims have no legal merit and will be defended vigorously

[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:48.200]
In due course the strangely medicine claimant said I know wish to comment on the substance of the case

[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.380]
However it is serious and the congressman is confident of prevailing said the right wing asshole

[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.540]
How do you like that?

[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:54.420]
Put a pussy

[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.340]
Yeah, oh he's gonna sue me now

[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.200]
Focus on the family

[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.140]
Judicial watch all these right wing wacko groups got all these very goody tushu sounding names you know

[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.240]
All bunch of fascist maniacs

[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:12.020]
Now look what's our polls got to vote on how they see now still got a spelled wrong in Chiku Park

[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.780]
We'll get it right at least we got a couple letters right anyway

[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:17.060]
Contours do you love me?

[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:17.620]
He's got four

[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:24.360]
Thomas Dolby she blighted me with science which you laughed and scoffed at that that's got four tied for number one so far

[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.700]
You laughed your ass off at that

[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:28.940]
Speaking of music

[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:36.440]
Harold reports two musicians have filed a lawsuit against Britney Spears claiming that two songs on her multi platinum second album

[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.640]
Oops I did again were based on a tune they wrote

[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.720]
Philadelphia songwriter's Michael Cotrell and Lawrence Woonowski

[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:46.780]
WNUKOWSKA how the hell do you say that?

[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.240]
Dota Lawrence Nokowski claiming the lawsuit that they wrote recorded and copyrighted a song called

[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:57.420]
What you see is what you get in late 1999 and submitted it to one of Spears representatives for consideration on the future album

[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:03.940]
The song was rejected a lawsuit says but the musicians claim that the 20-year-old pop singer later released two songs

[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:09.160]
What you see is what you get and can't make you love me that were virtually identical to the song they submitted

[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.720]
The lawsuit filed Friday in US District Court in Philadelphia named Spears

[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:19.220]
Zamba recording corporation jive records right entertainment group and BMG music publishing of called a

[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:23.640]
Spears public was not returned immediately return how'd you guess?

[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:24.820]
Oh I just lucky

[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:30.040]
The liner notes for Oops I did again credit both songs to several writers and producers that share on studios

[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:36.360]
The Swedish recording studio that also wrote hits for the backstreet boys and stink and the anxious Canadian Celine Dion

[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:46.540]
Oh brother speaking of music guess who's making a comeback vanilla ice the king is making a comeback

[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.240]
There's no hyphen in itchy cool by the way

[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.660]
Poor Eric he keeps changing it it's all George's fault by the way don't play America

[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:57.640]
I didn't tell him nothing about the hyphen

[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:01.540]
Yeah there's no hyphen there's no griphen and there's no hyphen it's all one word

[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.360]
You got it spelled right now just take the hyphen out and you'll have it nice going Eric

[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:05.840]
Oh I got it

[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:08.260]
Yeah that probably was the problem

[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:16.200]
A dance remix of a little less conversation which Presley performed in 1988 film a little a lot

[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.240]
Has been drawing brisk sales and heavy radio where playing Britain since it was released there's a single on Monday

[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:26.560]
And the king is back he been dead for a hundred years and the king is back they can't keep him down

[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:32.820]
The recordings expected to top the British singles charts next week breaking the long running tie between Presley and the Beatles

[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:41.020]
For the most number one hits in the UK which currently stands at 17 a piece and RCA spokesman said guess who's gonna break that by the way very soon I give up West like

[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:48.860]
Hmm well I'm just telling him not asking for a commentary I don't care whether you like him or don't like him I'm just telling you they're gonna break the record

[02:13:48.860 --> 02:13:56.700]
Okay soon the original version of the song reached number 69 on the West singles charts in 1968 and failed to chart it all in Britain

[02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:58.280]
Isn't that amazing?

[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:05.740]
In other words it was a stiff I don't even remember do you know not at all a little less conversation

[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:12.080]
But the record books will contain an asterisk as the new recording takes some liberties with the songs that was originally performed by the king

[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.880]
The updated version of a little less conversation adds a minute long electronic introduction

[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:21.680]
Surround's Presley's vocals with new rhythms and beats and extends the song with dance loops and techno tracks

[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:25.940]
Yeah talk about phony baloney they can do that with any song

[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:26.640]
Sure

[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.520]
If you hear the first man fact it wouldn't be surprised if Disney is gonna start playing Elvis now

[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.920]
At least it'd be good variety from that same 20 songs he's playing

[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:41.200]
If you hear the first minute of the song you'd have no idea that it's Elvis it sounds like a techno song says RCA general manager Richard Sanders

[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.560]
And when you hear his voice kick in it's like oh my that's Elvis oh my god oh my god

[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:46.820]
Yeah like that

[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.600]
Sanders says it marks the first contemporary remix of a Presley's music allowed by RCA

[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.280]
A unit of Bertelsman AG's a BMG

[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:58.360]
RCA owns rights to the original master recordings of Presley's entire catalog

[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.680]
These spokesmen said the six-minute plus recording six minutes plus

[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:05.080]
Yeah oh boy we can kill some good time with that on this show

[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.280]
And guess we're all be able to get it no doubt

[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.200]
Amsterdam

[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:15.760]
You must be psychic it says the six-minute plus recording is the work of popular Amsterdam based DJ and producer JXL

[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.520]
He was licensed by RC and Elvis Presley in a prizes to remix the song for the soundtrack

[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:24.660]
The Nike's 90-million-dollar worldwide ad campaign tied to the World Cup soccer tournament

[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:30.360]
The full-length remix of three-minute version edited for radio and the original version of the song are all contained on a single

[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.520]
Which is due for release in the US on June 25th

[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.920]
Boy I'm sure going to go out and buy that right away aren't you?

[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:35.640]
Right now?

[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:38.320]
June 25th that's only like less than two weeks away

[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:42.500]
The original song also appeared last year on the soundtrack to the movie Ocean's Eleven

[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.640]
Which starred George Clooney and Brad Pitt

[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:47.760]
Who still looks pretty good but still can't act

[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:52.840]
What that was at movie I saw a little bit of with him the other day the river runs deep

[02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:57.900]
Well yeah that's right Craig Schaeffer was in at movie with Brad Pittway played his brother

[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.380]
And Craig Schaeffer by that time had gotten a terminal case of the uglies in his eyes

[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:06.780]
We're not only like bloodshot in like raccoon eyes but like his whole face was coming apart

[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:07.560]
Craig Schaeffer

[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:11.260]
Yes the river run run and the river runs through it

[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:12.800]
I beg your pardon

[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:15.440]
The river runs through it I think it's a proper river move

[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:19.620]
Robert Redford was in that movie?

[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:21.020]
No he directed it

[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:25.940]
Oh well anyway to make a long story short Brad Pitt dies in the end he falls and he's a swimmer

[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.920]
I mean he's fission and he dies

[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:30.920]
I thought he got killed by the bear

[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:32.100]
No did he?

[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:34.080]
That might have been a different movie

[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:41.280]
Pressley's likely to return to the charts again this fall on RCA releases a one CD collection of 30 of his number one hits to commemorate

[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.800]
The 25th anniversary of his death

[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.240]
Oh gee I didn't realize that this falls the 25th anniversary of Elvis's death

[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:51.200]
The album title Elvis 30 number one hits is due out September 24th in the US

[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.420]
I hope you're marking these dates down on the calendar right now

[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:59.440]
He died August 16th 1977 in Memphis Tennessee at age 44 and I'm going to say it again

[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:01.860]
Anybody who goes to Graceland is an asshole

[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:06.740]
Needs a life needs mental health

[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.840]
Then includes all those guys who called in about when we do it about four years ago

[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:13.800]
Right never forget that show down there on the second floor

[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:16.820]
When the phones weren't working just like today's a matter of fact

[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:19.600]
Here we are four and a half years later and the phones are still screwed up at QAM

[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:21.460]
Now they're working because I see one is lit up

[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:21.980]
Right

[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.180]

The pizza loft the Broward original Broward location is on university drive right in your armadillo cafe

[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.040]
Semat or fact kitty corner behind pier what imports between five ninety five and Griffin road

And the pizza loft plaza with acres of re-parking and the brand new location will be corner

[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:46.720]
And I've heard some rise in plantation opening the end of the summer

[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:48.580]
Do you ever tell us when? No

[02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:50.900]
Well go over to pizza loft and say hey

[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.900]
Is the Marlins chicken the Tampa Bay devil

[02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:56.680]
Tomorrow

[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:00.900]
On sports when you five sixty you am

[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:04.540]
Well now I do believe it be the one that's well-bought

[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:18.900]
The songs about my education

[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:27.220]
Grides a sleep of day and my home invites one time I woke up and started taking tests and then I think I took an SAT

[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.900]
And that's about the time I said enough for me

[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:33.900]
My TPA was somewhere near point three

[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:36.900]
Or no I want to watch a TV shows

[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.100]
What the hell are SATs?

[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.760]
My friends say I should fear my grades

[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.200]
What's my grades again?

[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:44.040]
What's my grades again?

[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:50.000]
Been later on on the bus home

[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.020]
My teacher called from our cell phone

[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:54.400]
She told my parents all

[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:58.000]
She said I thought I'd feel I knew that this was gibberish for me

[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.800]
And that's the point when mom and dad just loved it me

[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:04.840]
I said what teachers said just good not be

[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:07.760]
Then suddenly a thought had come to me

[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:11.240]
I'm gonna get those A's and B's by hacking their computer C

[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:13.000]
What's my grades again?

[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:20.840]
F you probably just after what is it two minutes after 12?

[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.280]
Well put them together and get whatever you want

[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:26.860]
So here's a fact I'm a little bit off the beam here because of this one facts

[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:27.900]
And I had to look it up

[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.580]
Again somebody very emphatic

[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:32.120]
Very emphatic

[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:34.720]
I wonder what story they're talking about

[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:36.140]
Is hearing a story like that makes me sick

[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:39.240]
I almost had a turn of radio off the baby story

[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:41.160]
Baby's baby made me sick also

[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:42.480]
But then he writes on here

[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:45.380]
Faith no more question mark they had hits mid-life crisis

[02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:46.560]
Which still gets radio play

[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:50.020]
How can they be a one-hit wonder what about easy they need to be removed

[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:50.800]
Well guess what?

[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.800]
No no they're gonna be wrong because you're wrong

[02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:55.380]
Faith no more had one hit

[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.520]
Epic was number nine in 1990

[02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:00.160]
They had no other chart hits none zero

[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:01.000]
Zipini do da

[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:02.980]
Ready for that?

[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:03.920]
I got it

[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:05.080]
We talked about it

[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.620]
Rock group from San Francisco

[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:07.580]
Faith no more

[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:09.500]
I mean the other songs may have been played on a radio

[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.080]
You may have liked them but were they on a chart?

[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:12.520]
No!

[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:14.500]
So sorry

[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:16.780]
And how come I never mentioned this?

[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:18.260]
Shocking

[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:21.080]
Because I saw it on TV must have slipped my mind

[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:23.040]
McDonald's had spam to the menu

[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:23.660]
Did you see that?

[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:24.200]
Yeah

[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.280]
But only in Hawaii

[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:26.540]
Sure it's big there

[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:30.860]
The 78 McDonald's restaurants in Hawaii are adding a new menu item

[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:33.040]
That's as much an American icon as the burger chain itself

[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:34.240]
Spam!

[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:34.540]
Oh!

[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.040]
I'm getting shocked up just thinking about it

[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:37.900]
I couldn't say it

[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:38.500]
God!

[02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:41.860]
The idea that they're serving something that comes in a can?

[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.980]
More than 3,000 portions of low sodium spam scrambled egg and rice were served in a single day

[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:51.300]
During a test run of the meal according to

[02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:52.640]
Melani Okazaki

[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:54.260]
That's right Okazaki

[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:56.120]
McDonald's local marketing manager

[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:59.340]
I'm not sure why it's taken so long off Kazaki said of this spam breakfast

[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:01.780]
Which he said is offered at no other McDonald's in the world

[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:02.860]
Only in Hawaii

[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:08.480]
So I guess they want to keep the population as big and porked up as so many of those sumo-looking guys are

[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:09.680]
And women

[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:11.280]
Porky

[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:17.640]
Do you ever see those, what do they call when they have those, those luau kind of those shows they put on?

[02:22:17.740 --> 02:22:17.900]
Right

[02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:19.940]
Almost all of them are like porky

[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:23.120]
I'm not saying there aren't a lot of beautiful people in Hawaii because there are

[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.840]
But they don't get involved in those shows I guess

[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.020]
But they like their porky over there

[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:26.700]
They're busy getting laid

[02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:28.280]
They like their pork though

[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:31.920]
M&M has received death threats from supporters of Osama Yamama Bin Laden

[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:34.840]
According to reports who say M&M may begin little two porky himself I guess

[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:42.840]
The video for his new hit single without me shows the rap singer making fun of the terror war lord by wearing a beard and robes and dancing around as bin shady

[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:50.320]
His joke is believed who offended Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network and US intelligence agents have informed M&M that a bounty has been placed on his head

[02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:54.660]
The source told the daily star M&M has had no choice but to take the thread very seriously

[02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:59.080]
He has hired more professional bodyguards to protect him and updated his home security system

[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:03.040]
He's even consoled as specialist and counter terrorism on what precautions to take

[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:07.740]
The neat croix stars often courted controversy with references to sex, rocks and violence in his songs

[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:14.400]
In the past he's been convicted of curing concealed weapon and claims to take ecstasy while on stage and believe me it doesn't help he still can't sing a lick

[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.780]
He maybe can lick it but he can't sing

[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:19.220]
And annoys the crap out of me

[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.420]
I don't know about you but he annoys the crap out of me

[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:22.560]
He's buggy

[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:26.560]
He was in the beginning he was amusing, you know what I mean? He was amusing

[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.640]
Like weirdo, kind of amusing

[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:34.580]
But as time wore on he became more and more obnoxious and more and more like hey we don't need to see him know more

[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:36.680]
I rather see Afro man, any day

[02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:39.120]
How about M&M with an Afro?

[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:42.560]
That sounds good, in fact he may soon get one from the sound of it

[02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:47.460]
Thomas Dolby, he blinded me with science, his number one with the...

[02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:49.060]
Well see this is so straight out

[02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:51.320]
I'm sure just to spite me

[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:58.420]
103 votes on a pool and it's so spread out that we got no and nobody are more than ya'ing so far

[02:23:58.420 --> 02:23:59.920]
Debbie Boone got five

[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.320]
Well does that surprise look if it was number one for ten weeks somebody must have liked it?

[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:07.200]
Yeah but I didn't think we had those people in the audience

[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:11.580]
Maybe we have five women listening, I'm sure that no man would vote for Debbie Boone and you let up my life

[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.420]
No real man, or even me

[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:15.500]
Contours do you love me, got seven?

[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.240]
The small faces itchy couparks spelled right

[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:20.060]
Oh, has got the six

[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.340]
Rick Daringer, rock and roll, Huchi Koo has got five, has does Debbie Boone and you let up my...

[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:28.380]
And the bugles and video kill the radio star, even though we don't have the one in George Wonsman

[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:30.800]
And I got news for it, that what you heard is what you get

[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:32.440]
I'll find it

[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:34.640]
I'm not gonna go out and buy no more bugles, okay?

[02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:38.700]
If you wanna download it and steal it, I mean borrow it, that's up to you

[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.780]
USA Today, Judy Keen and Lawrence McQuillin write today

[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:48.220]
The announcement Monday that US officials had named and led Phil Katero's to a plan to explode a year ago

[02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:51.880]
The radio act of Judy Bob in the USA, messed neatly with President Bush's agenda

[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:56.260]
It came four days after Bush proposed a Homeland Security Department in his cabinet

[02:24:56.260 --> 02:25:01.800]
And ten days after he began describing a doctrine of preemptive military strikes against countries that threaten the US

[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:07.840]
It seemed to add impetus to his argument that Saddam Hussein must be ousted before Iraq sells weapons of mass destruction to terrorists

[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:15.120]
But some people, especially some Democrats, wondered Tuesday whether the arrest announcement dovetailed a little too tidally with Bush's agenda

[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:21.140]
Those questions were fueled by the fact that the announcement came a month after Abdullah Al-Muhadjir's arrest May 8th

[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:25.760]
And by reports Tuesday that he had no radio act of material, no concrete plan, and no target

[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:27.680]
Other than that, he was pretty dangerous

[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:32.700]
It would just be interesting to know why any particular day is chosen more than a month after the fact to make an announcement

[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:36.920]
Especially announcement of this magnitude said Mark Millman, a Democratic pollster

[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:39.400]
Other Democrats in Washington said the same thing privately

[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:44.680]
Bush's stage managing a public pronouncements to serve his goals is a technique every President's used

[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:51.060]
Trying to dominate news coverage to remind voters that he and fellow Republicans are leading the war on terror is a perquisite of a day presidency

[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:55.880]
White House spokesman Eric Fleischer said Tuesday that the duty bomb threat was not overstated

[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:01.100]
It was described accurately he said at times like this the initial reports immediately lurched to the worst case scenario

[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:06.340]
Fleischer said the timing had nothing to do with Bush's announcement last week of the proposed Homeland Security Department

[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:11.640]
Attorney General John Ascroft announced he arrest Monday from Moscow where he was meeting with Russian officials on unrelated matters

[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:20.560]
We have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plotty said there wasn't long before Bush and his top aides were making the link between the arrest and the administration's priorities on the war on terrorism

[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:28.060]
Grave threats are accumulating against us and in action will only bring them closer vice-president Cheney said in between heartbeats

[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:34.700]
In the speech Tuesday in Kansas City Bush said these shadowy terrorists could hook up with a nation that's got weapons of mass destruction

[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.420]
The nations that I labeled the axis of evil the evil doers

[02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:46.700]
Late Tuesday administration officials said Ascroft went too far in his description of the duty bomb threat providing a reminder that message management can be tricky

[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:51.840]
If Bush is seen as trying to gain political edge from the threat of terrorism Americans could lose confidence in him

[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:59.640]
There's enough of a pattern that this administration despite protest to the contrary makes political calculations every day mailman says was this one I can't say

[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:05.780]
He says Bush risk creating the impression that he's playing the kind of Washington games he pledged to avoid it may come back to Hanami says

[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.680]
Americans however are not disenchanted with Bush pull show that three and four approved the job that he's doing

[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:18.660]
In the USA today see it in Gallup poll last weekend one in three said they thought the timing of Bush's announcement of a new home on security department was based on politics

[02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:26.460]
Similar numbers said the same thing when President Clinton ordered missile strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan during the monocle of Blue Winsky scandal

[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:34.460]
Jim Steinberg was a deputy national security adviser to Clinton approves the Bush's plan to create a home on security department doesn't care whether politics play department decision or not he says

[02:27:34.460 --> 02:27:37.640]
Whatever gets somebody to the right place to do the right thing that's a good thing

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:45.460]
Okay, you make up your own mind if you have one remember that ad be killing yeah, oh

[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:50.900]
You ought to see this guy here's here's a wow yeah see that's not fair picture of his driver's license

[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:57.240]
Everybody's picture on the driver's license. I never seen anybody look at on the driver's license of you yeah me

[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:59.260]
Yeah, me

[02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:04.960]
Too bad you don't look good in person. I know I wish the man who killed two monks and wounded two others at Roman Catholic

[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:11.800]
Abby before killing himself have been upset with the church over his divorce the AP learned yesterday see we're looking for a reason right there you go

[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:18.540]
Investigators have been struggling to wonder cover information about 71 year old Lloyd Roberts Jeffress as they search for a motive in his attack on conception

[02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:21.580]
Abby a role monastery in Northwest Missouri in conception

[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:26.380]
Jeffress first victim brother Damien Larson pleaded for his life before Jeffress shot him

[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:33.060]
Abbott Gregory Poland said yesterday he said no no and Jeffress just plugged him with a rifle Poland said just like just like that

[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:38.140]
Jeffress daughter and brother said he'd been upset at the way he was treated by the church after his divorce a source

[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:41.780]
Close to the investigation told the AP on the condition of course of anonymity

[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:47.380]
The source didn't know when Jeffress and his wife were married or divorced and could not elaborate on how the church allegedly mistreated Jeffress

[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:49.340]
Officials were trying to locate his former wife

[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:56.660]
The Abby about 90 miles north of Kansas City we opened yesterday bells that the Abby's Basilica toiled at 8.40 am Tuesday

[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:11.860]
Larson 64 had been there for 32 years well a lot of strange stuff going on including that con Fab and Dallas

[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:18.320]
So this is a tough question. What is the best way to handle this for the good of everybody?

[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:28.200]
Also more fundamental than that is we still don't know how many priests may actually be in that situation anyway is any from what you know

[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:35.300]
Now are you believe in this you blinded me with science crap with 14 votes? No no I think I might even just take that one off of there when we get through with this poll

And we got well after that

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:41.850]
You know, I think maybe you're making another premature evaluation just like you did with the soft sell and tainted love

[02:32:42.690 --> 02:32:48.210]
All right, because if you'll take a peak at VH1 in their top 20 one hit wonders

[02:32:48.890 --> 02:32:49.910]
Guess what's in there

[02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:55.450]

Well as you bring in a real one you know what I should have done today

[02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:27.590]
Because at the beginning of the show if you missed the beginning with shame on you I played the entire winner from yesterday

[02:33:28.250 --> 02:33:32.710]
Which I thought was pretty damn nice to me I played in the Lizzy and a voice of back in town the original version

[02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:37.570]
But I didn't play any of this which you thought was pretty damn good so I'm a little bit suspect at this point

[02:33:38.650 --> 02:33:45.870]
Yeah, the tribute to thin Lizzy with artist from Ozzy Osborne and Alice Cooper and forner and bad company and

[02:33:45.870 --> 02:33:47.530]
Any like the original but it was adequate

[02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:50.590]
Huh, I give it about a six and a half

[02:33:52.170 --> 02:33:55.610]
On a skill of 93 it's okay, but the original is always the best

[02:33:56.150 --> 02:34:00.630]
Usually I tried telling that to podcast her over the original all of always the best he went like that

[02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:03.510]
That was when I saw with the song rest mall that night

[02:34:04.770 --> 02:34:11.450]
Look at that she blighted me with science 16 votes Vicky Sue Robinson turned the beat around turn your meat around eight small faces

[02:34:27.010 --> 02:34:29.010]
But it's a fag song yeah, well

[02:34:29.650 --> 02:34:31.370]
The fact is all your music

[02:34:33.490 --> 02:34:40.590]

I sure wouldn't get my I mean I like it, but it wouldn't get my vote

[02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:13.530]
You know and this list there's a lot of really good stuff on this list and

And neither would the Thomas Dolby get I mean not even close we wouldn't even cross my mind about for that, you know

[02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:24.530]
But then again, there's a lot of people out there would bad taste. We already know that we can't help that

[02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:27.190]

[02:38:27.470 --> 02:38:33.550]

[02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:54.750]
nationalities. The official said at least a half dozen American cities were

[02:42:54.750 --> 02:42:59.190]
believed among the three-hundred al-Qaeda suspects. What is it? At least a half

[02:42:59.190 --> 02:43:02.610]
dozen American citizens were believed to be among the three-hundred al-Qaeda suspects

[02:43:02.610 --> 02:43:06.430]
handed over to the West by Pakistan in the past six months. The hunt for the

[02:43:06.430 --> 02:43:10.430]
Brooklyn-born Padilla 31 also known as Abdullah Al-Mohajir began after the

[02:43:10.430 --> 02:43:13.750]
arrest in March of Osama Yomama bin Laden Lieutenant Abu Zabeda the

[02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:17.770]
official said the bid is currently in the West custody and spilling the beans. Padilla

[02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:20.490]
apparently had been assigned by Zabeda to explore the possibility of causing

[02:43:20.490 --> 02:43:24.150]
maximum damage to Americans intelligence officials said also on condition of

[02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:28.670]
anonymity. We had received information from the FBI in April that some al-Qaeda

[02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:31.810]
men were planning attacks in the U.S. The same information was shared with us by

[02:43:31.810 --> 02:43:35.450]
the CIA and intense weeks-long efforts led to a arrest set a senior government

[02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:41.710]
official who spoke under the condition of anonymity. Good guess. Authorities began

[02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:44.870]
to track Padilla in early April after the FBI provided photos of the former

[02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:47.930]
Chicago gang member to Pakistan's bi agency. Inner services'

[02:43:48.330 --> 02:43:52.930]
intelligence official said the ISI. Using false documents and aliases Padilla

[02:43:52.930 --> 02:43:56.930]
traveled around a central Asian country in April the official said they wouldn't

[02:43:56.930 --> 02:44:00.390]
say how long he remained in Central Asia nor whom he contacted. The official

[02:44:00.390 --> 02:44:03.270]
said Padilla returned to Pakistan left Karachi and laid in April early May for

[02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:06.350]
Zurich, Switzerland. U.S. authorities have said Padilla may trips from Switzerland

[02:44:06.350 --> 02:44:09.870]
to and from Egypt before flying to Chicago where he was arrested May 8th.

[02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:13.230]
Pakistan officials are expanding their search for more Padilla

[02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:16.990]
associates in the deeply conservative tribal areas along the Afghan border where

[02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:20.570]
many al-Qaeda fugitives are believed to have taken refuge. The FBI is particularly

[02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:24.630]
interested in fighting five Arab women, seven children and several al-Qaeda men

[02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:28.730]
believed that close contacts would Zubayda and Padilla. Pakistan is sources

[02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:34.070]
speaking on condition of anonymity. Said U.S. and Pakistan agents raided an

[02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:37.350]
Islamic clerics home in the Northwest Frontier province this week looking for

[02:44:37.350 --> 02:44:43.390]
the woman and children but didn't find anybody yet. They're looking. And yes. The

[02:44:43.390 --> 02:44:46.910]
leader of a Pemberpine's mosque said yesterday that the alleged duty bomb plot

[02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:50.570]
wasn't hatched in Broward County. Thank God. An assertion backed up by federal

[02:44:50.570 --> 02:44:55.410]
agents who said he teni Jose Padilla contacted al-Qaeda operatives after leaving

[02:44:55.410 --> 02:44:59.290]
the West in 1998. Wait till you're the last sentence in this story. You'll pee in

[02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:03.150]
your pants. I want to make sure that there's nothing like that going on here

[02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:09.090]
said Molana Shafayet Mohamed prayer leader at Darul Ulum Islamic Institute. I

[02:45:09.090 --> 02:45:11.930]
just like a clean operation. I don't even want to smell things like that around.

[02:45:12.130 --> 02:45:15.870]
You don't want to smell it. Padilla is the third terrorism suspect linked to

[02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:19.450]
Darul Ulum. He studied the Quran there to other Broward men accused this year

[02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:23.410]
with plotting a bombing campaign in South Florida worshiped at Darul Ulum one

[02:45:23.410 --> 02:45:27.050]
of about 20 Muslim mosque in Broward and Dave counties but that Mohammed said

[02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:31.250]
is pure coincidence. We are the largest Muslim congregation in South Florida

[02:45:31.250 --> 02:45:34.550]
Mohammed said I think people may want to use this as a scapegoat we don't

[02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:38.650]
tolerate radicals we're a peaceful group. The only common factor among the

[02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:41.870]
three is that they just passed through our mosque Mohammed said. Federal sources

[02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:44.970]
told a herald on Wednesday that while Padilla was clearly involved with the

[02:45:44.970 --> 02:45:47.950]
South Florida Muslim community it remains unclear when he turned from moderate

[02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:51.250]
Islamic beliefs to an extreme doctrine that led him to allegedly plot a bombing.

[02:45:51.690 --> 02:45:54.590]
The difficult part for us now is true and of course you do realize he became a

[02:45:54.590 --> 02:46:02.130]
Muslim Ali was in jail? No it did not. Oh yeah. Jose Padilla became whatever the

[02:46:02.130 --> 02:46:06.490]
hell he was now what's his name? Mahmoud, the Shmekel, whatever he is. The

[02:46:06.490 --> 02:46:09.150]
difficult part for us now is to determine which of the many people he came in

[02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:12.210]
contact with hold those views let alone whether or not there are links to El-Kaeda

[02:46:12.210 --> 02:46:15.230]
one source said the FBI's found no connection between Padilla in the

[02:46:15.390 --> 02:46:19.350]
time of 11 hijackers several of whom lived in Broward County. All the evidence

[02:46:19.350 --> 02:46:22.730]
that the release of El-Kaeda is from his trips abroad one source said Padilla's

[02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:27.350]
interest in Islam was apparent when he worked at a Davi Taco Bell in 1992

[02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:30.510]
following his release from Broward County jail where he served ten months after a

[02:46:30.510 --> 02:46:34.610]
road-range incident his former boss was Mohammed Javed co-founder of the

[02:46:34.610 --> 02:46:38.210]
School of Islamic Studies at Broward in Sunrise. Javed said when Padilla told

[02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:40.470]
him he was thinking about converting his advice Padilla to look in the yellow

[02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:43.870]
pages for an Islamic center. He didn't tell me when he and his girlfriend

[02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:47.530]
Sherri Maria Stoltz converted but I learned they had accepted Islam into their

[02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:52.350]
life job it's and he seemed to be a joiner and he was poor. He worked at the Davi

[02:46:52.350 --> 02:46:59.110]
Taco Bell. Do we know where that is? No. In June 94 Jose Padilla

[02:46:59.110 --> 02:47:02.390]
firstly became known as Ibrahim following a hearing before Broward's circuit

[02:47:02.390 --> 02:47:05.690]
judge John Fruciani at the Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale Padilla prayed and

[02:47:05.690 --> 02:47:10.870]
studied at the Rul'ulum from 1995 to 97. Mohammed remembers Padilla as Ibrahim no

[02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:13.710]
longer the troublemaker of his earlier days but a quiet young man who always

[02:47:13.710 --> 02:47:17.510]
wore the traditional Muslim scarf favored by Palestinian leader Yasser Amafard.

[02:47:18.190 --> 02:47:21.610]
A photograph released by the school shows Padilla posing with friends a red

[02:47:21.610 --> 02:47:26.070]
scarf draped over his head a Shmata as the Chinese call it. The headdress is the

[02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:29.410]
type you see in Palestine you don't see it in the US Mohammed said Padilla

[02:47:29.410 --> 02:47:32.290]
attended Saturday morning sessions for the recently converted after while just

[02:47:32.290 --> 02:47:35.430]
disappearing from the scene nine men and three women made up the group women are

[02:47:35.430 --> 02:47:38.490]
not uncommon for the Pembert Prime Institute because of its liberal bent

[02:47:38.490 --> 02:47:42.310]
Mohammed said and here comes here comes the best part of this story who ever

[02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:46.370]
did whoever did what they never did it here Mohammed said people know they

[02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:50.430]
can't do any foolishness here and I'm thinking to myself right like the 19

[02:47:50.430 --> 02:47:56.030]
hijackers they can't do any foolishness there in South Florida right I think

[02:47:56.030 --> 02:48:00.590]
he was referring to his mosque I see I didn't know he wore one maybe he knows the

[02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:04.730]
lone ranger oh I got a great story about masked by the whale savor for

[02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:08.250]
tomorrow you see that story that you facts me about those British kids that

[02:48:08.250 --> 02:48:12.070]
did the whole month yeah and they forgot to make holes in their masks only the

[02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:16.310]
bridge man only the silly silly silly as Brits would come up with something like

[02:48:16.310 --> 02:48:20.590]
that got on mighty all you people listen in England by the way we love you but

[02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:24.930]
you are silly make no mistake about it and and by the way they're the head of

[02:48:24.930 --> 02:48:30.870]
these amazing things called dentists 21 and and and even more amazing thing

[02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:35.450]
called a toothbrush and toothpaste even in Amsterdam we got toothpaste in the

[02:48:35.450 --> 02:48:39.850]
supermarket at Albert Hine Albert Hine we got toothpaste I eventually they

[02:48:39.850 --> 02:48:44.570]
don't even sell it in England why bother 21 till one and Jim Maddog managed time at

[02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:48.270]
QA and here's a simple question for you for simple people if somebody offered to

[02:48:48.270 --> 02:48:51.130]
give you to hand over to your several thousand dollars in cash in the next few

[02:48:51.130 --> 02:48:54.990]
years would you take it everybody in this audience will say sure why not which

[02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:58.410]
makes it really for us to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at just

[02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:02.930]
3.95% there's a fan he made program waiting for you with 3.95% for both

[02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:07.990]
refinancing and purchasing of homes think about it just 3.95% and all you have

[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:12.730]
to do is call financial group with this toll free number 1 800 940 53 63

[02:49:12.730 --> 02:49:18.030]
that's 1 800 940 53 63 to be more specific you can get yourself a hundred

[02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:21.830]
grand with payments of only 475 bucks a month or you can get 200 grand with

[02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:25.090]
payments of only 950 bucks a month you'll save yourself thousands of dollars

[02:49:25.090 --> 02:49:28.410]
it'd be downright foolish to pass up a chance like that so do the math and do

[02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:31.610]
the next logical thing get the details by calling financial group toll free

[02:49:31.610 --> 02:49:38.390]
it's 1 800 940 land that's 1 800 940 53 63 there an equal housing lender

yes I did. Now I'm watching out of the choir and they finally took a break from it

[02:51:57.370 --> 02:52:01.030]
but it just goes on and on this church sex club crisis thing

[02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:06.870]
yeah and it reminds me it will be like if you would have taken the Nazi prisoners in Nuremberg

[02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:10.750]
and turned it around and and let them conduct the hearings you see what I'm saying?

[02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:14.570]
for themselves right then they wouldn't have needed those headphones

[02:52:14.570 --> 02:52:18.310]
right that's right they could just sit there and conduct it that's that this is like the fox

[02:52:18.310 --> 02:52:23.190]
guarding the chicken coop and the way she talks about how this calls so much depression

[02:52:24.410 --> 02:52:29.930]
oh get out of here you're simple and faggot you I mean who are these people kidding evidently a lot of people

[02:52:30.690 --> 02:52:34.950]
because there are millions of obedient Catholics out there very duly obedient and brainwashed

[02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:40.230]
who are just the dying to be of conned they're they're just hoping for the best

[02:52:40.650 --> 02:52:44.290]
yeah put one over on us okay talk the good talk and put on a good to the face

[02:52:45.390 --> 02:52:49.690]
and like I said the other day after the life of me I cannot I just can't figure it out

[02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:55.510]
I mean I could understand if this was a religion that preaches things that most people believe

[02:52:55.510 --> 02:53:02.510]
and do see what I'm saying I know but in most western societies almost everything that they

[02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:06.630]
preach flies in the face of people's values in there and the way they live their lives

[02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:11.390]
then make a bit of difference in fact I don't think it has anything to do with beliefs at all

[02:53:11.390 --> 02:53:16.190]
it's just like a way of life it's like I'm a member of the club and I'm not getting out

[02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:22.810]
this is this is who I am and what I am this is my club like like the FOP like the elks like the

[02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:04.290]
than five million dollars from Suffolk County to run homeless shelters for nearly a decade

[02:54:04.290 --> 02:54:08.350]
