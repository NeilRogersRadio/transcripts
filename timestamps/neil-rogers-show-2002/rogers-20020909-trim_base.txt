[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040]
how quick he was

[00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.840]
uh... it shocked me i i know i just remember

[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.060]
you know knowing him being a good football player

[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.620]
i was surprised that his quickness inside

[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.580]
they combine him with Ferguson who we lost all last year and then wepster

[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.120]
who we signed from baltimore

[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.860]
those are three good tackles and we have four very good and so we can line up

[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.840]
our two pass rush defense events

[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880]
with uh... promise and and john everham

[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.140]
that they run they run under four six there four five

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.800]
well everybody want

[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.620]
those speed rushers on the outside

[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.440]
that's what we were trying to get so that's why you drafted by entomus

[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560]
that's exactly right that's why we took them

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.880]
and uh... he sure looks good and can't but i'm using them on pun return

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.760]
i've got them on one little thing and

[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.740]
let them rush the punter a little bit so he's helping me there

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.960]
and uh... he looks good there looks really good to matter fact yeah

[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.040]
we were returned to regular programming momentarily on wqm dot com

[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.720]

people are emotional cripples and can't handle the truth you know i'm talking

[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.040]
about i know you're not

[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.620]

[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.620]
anyway

[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.820]
nine hundred and fifty two votes on the pool and we asked on friday what do you think

[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.220]
is going to happen this year on nine eleven

[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.300]
which is

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.080]
Wednesday

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.300]
only two days away

[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.560]
anybody out there can a little bit nervous

[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980]
oh we asked nothing nothing unusual five hundred and thirty eight people said

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.320]
that

[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.240]
that's fifty six and a half percent

[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.680]
i have no idea which of course was a correct answer when that's the right answer

[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.460]
that was the right answer

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.140]
that's what we voted three hundred and forty i mean how do we know

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.540]
but you know we did ask for your opinion three hundred and forty two said that

[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.300]
thirty six percent

[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.720]
another terrorist attack

[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.380]
seventy two people only seven and a half percent

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.340]
well i shouldn't say only

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800]
that's actually more than you would have thought isn't it

[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.320]
yes

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.360]
seven and a half percent are in fear of another terrorist attack coming on Wednesday

[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.140]
i don't know just it just seems to me too predictable you know

[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.140]
i don't think that these scumbags these uh...

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.240]
dark age assholes want to be predictable but at any rate we'll see i guess when we

[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.000]
and i will take it as right now up front

[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.200]
if you want to seek a refuge this Wednesday from the eighty five thousand

[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.120]
consecutive hours you're going to be hearing and seeing

[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.620]
about the you know while we're in the misery of last year's grotesque events

[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.900]
and could happen on this show

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.380]
i told your before the show today i'm going to do my damnedest on Wednesday to avoid

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.200]
unless of course it's something happens if something happens well you know

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.540]
the on top of it but other than that uh... forget about it excellent

[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.820]
and we're not going to fit that that's the wrong term to use not going to forget

[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.660]
about it but we're just give you a place where you can come and hide for four

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.720]
hours and get away from the endless coverage

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.100]
it's ridiculous last night now they had a good uh... they had a good show on

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.840]
date line which had nothing to do with nine eleven

[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.080]
which had to do with a trial the Pensacola trial which will get to in a minute

[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.280]
because that's just it's just that my head is still spinning from all of that

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.220]
and you know who's the real asshole

[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.300]
i i know i know that's a really a loaded question

[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.580]
a real asshole is Dan Abrams on msnbc

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.860]
okay you know they're going on about well the fact that they tried the chavis

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.180]
and they tried the two kids and the same prosecutor they try had two

[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.120]
different trials in the same case and he's saying oh well you know this happens

[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.180]
all the time and of course every other legal expert they've had on in last

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.640]
four or five days it said this is unprecedented nobody ever heard of such

[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.560]
a thing but dan Abrams who's always talking over the judge and talking over you

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.600]
know he's he's more important everybody else he's got an ego almost as

[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.400]
big as much as work but it ain't right dan Abrams msnbc you make me sick

[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.900]
somebody who bought a floater a lot of ticket at a Pembroke Park gas station

[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.960]
is a millionaire i told George before the show and this is the truth

[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.840]
two numbers away from not being here today

[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.660]
i get a call eight fifteen Saturday morning the phone rings i'm sound asleep on

[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.040]
a Saturday morning who the hell would you call just a schmooz at eight fifteen

[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.060]
in the morning i would still be asleep at eight fifteen on a Saturday morning i

[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.740]
would have so was i since i have to get up six o'clock in the morning the rest of the week on a

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.280]
weekdays for i enjoy sleep in on a weekend especially i don't have a dog crawler

[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.620]
over me till whenever how i feel like getting up

[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.060]
phone rings and of course i finally get up and i go out in the front room and

[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.700]
there's nobody on the phone so i was already awake and i thought well i'll sit here

[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.000]
and the next time the phone rings whoever the person is that calls that was the

[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.840]
first new call at eight fifteen and will rain up right very good

[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.000]
so i've ten after nine i'm sitting there watching tv ten after nine phone rings

[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.120]
it's rumored

[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.600]
come on

[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.820]
yeah not David rumored a prosecutor from the two Pensacola trials which i'll get

[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.020]
to that man just it just uh... frost my ass

[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.340]
in the first trial he says oh here are the two kids they're going to testify against

[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.660]
Ricky Chavis and you've had to believe what they say because they're little kids

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.620]
they're not going to make up stories blah blah blah and then after he finds out

[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.480]
what they and he and the judge and a couple of other people already knew the

[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.720]
verdict from the first trial right then he goes and he puts the two kids on

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560]
trial and he says to the jury a different jury says oh well you can't believe what

[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.480]
these kids it because they already gave a confession they got no credibility i

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.380]
mean what are we talking about here i think for justice we got to go to don

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.100]
crawler owner somebody beside the american justice system

[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.920]
the joke

[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.440]
but then abrum says all happens all the time

[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.240]
so anyway when we finally get to the end of a meaningless conversation i go to

[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.040]
taking place anytime the remain finally says well uh... i bought twenty one

[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.800]
lottery tickets that i buy you twenty one will go in partners i should sure

[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.740]
whatever you know whatever

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.300]
noon yesterday the phone rings and i notice you like put it off until more

[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.520]
respectable time noon yesterday my phone rings and there's the rim man again

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.500]
on one of the ticket on one of my twenty one tickets we had the first four

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.320]
numbers in a row

[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.220]
the thing he had the tickets not me i think i would have a part of that in the

[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.800]
elevator again

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.060]
that's seriously i mean if you ever had the first four numbers

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.480]
in a row

[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.400]
i mean at that point when you get to the fourth one you start like uh... your

[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.760]
cheek start vibrating in your ass too

[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.400]
but unfortunately that was the end of it so we got seventy bucks

[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.240]
seventy bucks for us so that's thirty five a piece for twenty one so i made fourteen

[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.600]
bucks

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.040]
so the fact that he won fourteen i'll tell you they can afford to buy that lunch

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.160]
by the way how would you know if it was one of your tickets or when it is

[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.720]
he separated them i see

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.120]
and i told him i said what he said see i didn't do you know

[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.940]
in other words he's bragging about the fact that he uh... didn't lie about

[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.160]
it i said for seventy five

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.740]
it had one of course and that's what i said of course of course if it would have

[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.640]
had the other two numbers i would have called you up and it would have said

[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.960]
i'm sorry the number your downing has been disconnected no further information

[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.220]
you know he did yeah right he'd been long gone

[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.940]
anyway seven tickets one bought a fee subco at thirty one fifty one was how

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.300]
the old beach book of our night Saturdays winning numbers to share in the eighty five

[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.320]
million dollar jackpot ten sixteen twenty two twenty nine we had ten sixteen

[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.020]
twenty two twenty nine did not have thirty six or forty one god damn it you think i

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.220]

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.340]
all right you have to you what the big one last show that big one last show i

[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:47.920]

it's just i'm not going to do the one last show i'll still say hey Greg

[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.280]
just for the hell of it and that goes for you to know which will get to him

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.440]
we'll get to that ridiculous story in the Palm Beach post from Saturday in a minute

[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.080]
anyway story employee off top wooden was so excited to find out that his

know it's up there i've heard about it and what cala what do you mean you heard

[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.740]
about it i heard the name total of four hundred and thirty three tickets match five

[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.820]
that's a the problem with a lot of he is the five doesn't get enough to four

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.620]
is okay enough and they you know i mean seventy bucks for four numbers that's

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.600]
a ripoff and and forty nine hundred and fifty seven for five it's it's weak

[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.740]
but like i said you know when they're going to be of that many winners that's not

[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.020]
the week you want to win anyway right right you want to know who wants ten million

[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.360]
bucks you want to be greedy and get the whole god damn pot so nice going remember

[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.320]
don't call me eight fifteen in the morning again you lunatic here on can i

[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.680]
clarify something from uh... friday please never always talk about that nutrition

[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.700]
book yes which i realize nobody cares about that nevertheless there was a thing

[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.460]
and there about sugar substitutes that end in o sc and about how they're all bad

[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.220]
me idea and so anyway after the show i realize there's a message on my thing i go

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.900]
down there's a shibuna champion light which i was very excited about so i go down

[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.840]
there and i get that i thought you know it seems to me that

[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.600]
champion light has sucralos and sure enough i look in there and it does i look back

[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.740]
into book and i realize that only and i'm not saying this to like a shield for

[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.280]
anybody because what have i always said about those uh... sugar the ones that end in

[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.260]
old like in all those candies sort of uh... right you know what i'm talking about

[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.840]
p d lennie who's made me crap my brains out all those ones that end in oil like

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.900]
sorbitol and multi-tall and like a sh** crap at all by the way gerry into good no so

[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.540]
so anyway sucralos has no calories and no carbohydrates so that's not a problem

[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.780]
so it's a okay but fructose and maltose glucose those that have a chloric

[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.260]
value at the same as sugar see what i'm saying i say good anyway here's our

[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.880]
poll question for today and i put this off for a couple weeks since i want to

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.120]

[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:40.800]
and

[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:40.800]

[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.500]
believable because the people that they talk to all of them

[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.560]
believe that ricky chavises the one who killed the father of the bat

[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.600]
now the first group they said they believe that but they didn't the prosecution

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.320]
didn't present enough evidence and then the one guy this old creep he says

[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.720]
well uh... you know i voted to equip because

[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.060]
uh... he's got these other two charges you can have to be tried for and i

[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.620]
know he's going to be convicted and go up the river for at least fifty years

[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.240]
so i'm not worried about that

[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.700]
you following that

[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.180]
he's convinced that he did it

[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.200]
as was uh... the whole jury basically but uh... they didn't have enough

[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.100]
evidence to convict them

[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.940]
and then the jury in the uh... kids that are out they also believe that

[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.400]
chavis actually did the thing which is why they only convicted the kids of

[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.800]
second-degree murder not first-degree murder

[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.680]
because they don't believe that they actually swung a bat and delivered the

[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.980]
blows to us and they killed them

[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.220]
they think they're ricky chavises and they were shot

[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.240]
shot when they heard the version that she was trying not guilty they they were

[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.500]
in disbelief

[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.600]
anyway

[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.020]
jurors who tried to baby face boys and charges are killing their father

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.920]
with a baseball bat brought gas to learn

[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.920]
that another panel that acquitted and adult accused in the case but they're

[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.280]
conclusion that the boys only helped

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.620]
and then swing the bat stunned the prosecutor who presented both cases

[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.180]
yet that david rimmer asshole

[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.040]
and like i said he's telling he's telling the first jury all these kids are

[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.040]
credible and they're gonna testify against ricky chavis and you got to believe

[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.260]
them and blah blah blah and then he tells the second jury that they're little

[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.340]
allires and that they already confessed and here's their confession for you

[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.920]
listen to and uh... they did it

[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.340]
man

[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.120]
this is justice

[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.580]
you will watch this whole thing this thing's gonna blow up in their face on

[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.460]
appeal you know that

[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.940]
yeah which is a big so i don't know

[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.360]
all i can do it king ages thirteen and fourteen were spared a life term on a

[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.700]
jury found the guilty friday of second-degree murder without a weapon

[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.000]
the boys face twenty two years to life without parole but the judges be to go

[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.240]
below the minimum when their sentence dot tober seventeen

[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.420]
if they've been convicted at first of your measures charged early option was

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.940]
life sentences without parole

[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.520]
their convictions have rekindled talk about changing a florida law that

[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.100]
allow them to be tried as adults in a separate trial

[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.500]
convicted child molester ricky chavis for the was accused of committing the

[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.760]
crime by himself he was acquitted and the verdict was sealed until after the

[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.440]
boys trial

[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.280]
assistance state attorney david rimmer who prosecuted both trowel city

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.380]
thought the panel in the boys case had ignored the allegation they wielded the

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.840]
bad and simply gave the boys a jury pardoned by convicted them of the lesser

[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.280]
offense

[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.120]
the jurors no good and well he was killed with a weapon remember said

[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.540]
that's a jury pardon that's okay i don't have a problem with that he said

[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.840]
the jury for woman said that that wasn't the case that the panel believe neither

[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.620]
boys swung the bat

[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.200]
but rather than chavis carried out the slang the jurors didn't know of course

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.460]
that chavis already been acquitted in a separate trial

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.460]
their decision to convict the boys a second-degree murder was based on their

[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.380]
belief in alison d'arick open the door let the killer of the house for woman

[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.420]
linjforte sold a Pensacola news journal

[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.180]
that reasoning stunned rimmer i didn't think that at all rimmer said

[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.040]
rimmer i had a hoi and asking the uh... chavis jury for conviction saying the

[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.360]
only reason the case came close came to trial with that the boys had lied

[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.220]
either when they told police they killed their father or the jurors when they

[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.120]
said chavis did it

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.180]
he said it was up to the chavis jury decide which was the line added i don't

[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.540]
have a dog in this fight

[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.540]
oh give me a break one of the jurors reasoning in the boys trials he said was

[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.340]
i thought perhaps he encouraged them to do it but i never felt chavis was

[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:50.660]
there

[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.100]
alison d'arick had testified they opened the door and that they went out to

[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.320]
chavis's car but no physical evidence was introduced at the trial showing

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.520]
the chavis had been in the house

[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.480]
short said the jurors thought the boys recorded confessions were forced

[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.180]
rehearse and unbelievable

[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.180]
short said the king jurors were a gas when they heard chavis have been

[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.540]
acquitted i was so shocked i couldn't believe it's a short fifty two she said

[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.960]
the other jury saw a different presentation different interpretation it's too

[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.300]
bad they couldn't have all been tried to get that might have been a fair trial

[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:16.880]
she said

[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.900]
the rubber and Thomas masters a lady upon a prosecuting children's adult and

[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.980]
death sentences for juvenile said he thought the jury was sending a message to

[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.680]
change the law

[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.140]
there's no way in the world you can receive a fair trial and adult arena

[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.680]
where you're looked upon as an adult when you have the might of a child said

[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.000]
masters

[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.680]
a pastor at new master only a factor to church in prestigious review of each

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.760]
masters became involved in the issue with one of his teenage congregation members

[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.400]
which charged with murder as an adult

[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.600]
Nathaniel brazil was thirteen and may two thousand when you know i don't want

[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.280]
all of that

[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.900]
Florida log is prosecutors only two choices when children are charged with major

[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.100]
crimes such as murder they can be prosecuted with juvenile's or adults with

[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.020]
nothing in between governor jab bushmeister

[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.960]
acknowledges being uncomfortable with some prosecution and children as an

[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.100]
adult

[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.260]
i do think prosecutors are not have the flexibility to turn in term in the

[00:33:59.260 --> 00:33:59.720]
jurisdiction

[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.480]
whether it's juvenile or a deli say

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.900]
i'll tell you one thing right now this guy this chavis this pedophile piece of

[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.400]
third

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.060]
yes

[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.020]
tether or not

[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.260]
whether or not he wielded the bet you know he was up to up to his ears in it

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.740]
okay he either planted the idea and uh... gave them the idea of doing it

[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.920]
or he did it himself

[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.760]
guilty as hell

[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.780]
implicated right up to his guy named earlobes

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.600]
don't you think of course

[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.300]
see one thing about pedophiles and contrary to what the church would tell you

[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.500]
uh... they don't there's no cure

[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.400]
right

[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.240]
and then of course he denies are writing the love letters denies having a

[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.580]

or maybe we can get like two maybe we can fry two people for the same crime

[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.280]
i bet you they'd like that in texas yeah

[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.280]

so

[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.780]
think

[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:48.060]
This is this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this

this this here this here this here this

[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.420]
Oh, and it's up to people to like.

[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.560]
And those you may even find.

[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.720]
Do they why didn't it reside?

[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.480]
This is the time.

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.100]
The way.

[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:30.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.100]
This is.

[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.600]
Oh.

[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.680]
This is.

[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.840]
And everybody who broke a cake.

[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.320]
Oh, my god.

[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.560]
Yeah.

[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.380]
This is.

[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.120]
This is.

[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:40.440]
Yeah.

[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.200]
This is tonight.

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.580]
That's been so while we've forward.

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.280]
I'm 48 at 5.5.

[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.680]
You do a you're aware why I play that now?

[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.380]
No, you're not.

[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.280]
You didn't read this entire thing that you faxed to me that one of our listeners from South

[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.520]
Miami.

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.540]
Oh, the little thing that found us on my doorstep in South Miami this weekend thought you'd

[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.120]
be interested.

[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.200]
It's a piece of propaganda from the repeal the gay rights ordinance people.

[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.080]
And by the way, before I get into what it says here, Friday night on Donahue, which I

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.360]
was one of the 10 people watching, and right here about his ratings.

[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.580]
Oh my God, they're even lower than Moa Cheswell.

[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.300]
Oh, damn it.

[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.860]
Anyway, guess who was on there?

[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.920]
Mayor Pingo Picania with the vestiment tensions.

[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.460]
Of course, even the way I had no idea what he was talking about was totally unqualified

[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.380]
to be there against that armesto broad.

[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.360]
I wish I'd seen that.

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.420]
Have you ever seen her?

[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:38.700]
No.

[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.900]
So, man, talk about forming a thumb out.

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.740]
She didn't want to shut up for a second.

[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.420]
And of course, she also was just viewing propaganda.

[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.340]
And unfortunately, he was totally unqualified to be on here because she kept saying things

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.620]
like, there was no discrimination.

[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.240]
There's never been one case but, and of course, in the article I have here from Washington

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.940]
Post, which I'll get to in a second, 71 discrimination claims have been filed with the county

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.620]
since the United Discrimination Emergency was restored four years ago.

[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.660]
More than 50 have been settled or are still open.

[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.740]
And of course, that's only people who actually had the cajones to come forward and file

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.500]
discrimination suits.

[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.520]
But according to Amizar Mesto, there are no discrimination cases.

[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.820]
It's just a smoke screen.

[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.040]
And it's a piece of crap that is, do not be fooled.

[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.220]
It's a smoke screen, see?

[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.320]
Which will take away your parental rights.

[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.060]
Kids get graphic instruction, homosexual sex.

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.740]
Many of us are familiar with the travesty that occurred in the Massachusetts Public School

[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.800]
system where glistened red workshops were children are exposed to workshops that taught,

[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.240]
what is that?

[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.740]
Oh, fisting.

[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.500]
See, there you go.

[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.260]
Fisting, I just get through a plan and I can't read this thing.

[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.060]
Fisting and other techniques for gay sex, this is what they will do in date if given the

[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.280]
chance, vote yes, it says 242 September 10th, meaning tomorrow.

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.920]
And of course, obviously anybody with a brain will vote, which is what Mayor Pingo Picani

[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.260]
was leading.

[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.280]
In fact, you know, he's the coach here, one of the vote no campaign.

[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.520]
No, I didn't know that.

[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.440]
How are you like that?

[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.800]
Well, he can sniff the political wins, you know?

[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.360]
He stuck his nose out the window.

[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.360]
He stuck one finger up our good friend Juan Mendi, and put his nose out the window.

[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.280]
He said, oh my God.

[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.080]
Not politically correct to be voting yes on this thing on repeal.

[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.420]
At any rate, here's the other thing.

[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.940]
Now, she was, she didn't want to stop talking, Donnie, who was hard pressed to get her to

[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.740]
shop for a second.

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.720]
Anita Bryant, in all her frilly 1970s, Bufat Glory, smiles down from a record cover,

[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.060]
propped on a corner-found cabinet of the election headquarters of the gay rights group,

[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:22.660]
Saved Aid.

[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.960]
Well, I remember that like it was yesterday.

[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.120]
Bryant is a mythic and reviled figure in this room.

[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.920]
The orange juice spokeswoman and beauty queen, who led a successful campaign 25 years

[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.340]
ago, to repeal a grab breaking ordinance that prohibit a discrimination against gays

[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.600]
and lesbians in date county.

[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.160]
The ordinance was narrowly restored in 1998 by county commissioners, but it is once

[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.860]
again the subject of a fiercely contested repeal effort that will be decided by voters

[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.280]
tomorrow.

[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.200]
The election bears enormous, practical, and symbolic importance to national gay rights groups,

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.380]
which have sent dozens of volunteers to Miami in hopes of defeating the measure and discouraging

[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.100]
repeals in more than 200 cities and counties that have laws prohibiting discrimination against

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.060]
gays and lesbians.

[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.040]
It is sort of our version of the freedom riders at Lower Gene Executive Director of the

[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.860]
National Gay and Lesbian Tax Force, which has contributed volunteers in 100 grand to

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.840]
Saved Aid, Anita Bryant wreaked havoc all over the country.

[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.260]
We wanted to show the country that not only has Miami changed, but the world has changed

[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:13.680]
too.

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.080]
Bryant, who lives in Tennessee, has not been involved in the summer's date kind of repeal

[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.960]
fight, but reminders of her 1977 campaign are everywhere.

[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.460]
She's tried to fight two nickels to rub together, so she can pay all of her help in O'Pore

[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:25.660]
Anita.

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.160]
At times, it seems gay rights activists here are battling the ghost of Bryant's long

[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.060]
ago Saved Our Children campaign, as much as the conservative Christian groups who have

[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.960]
sponsored the current repeal, a flyer in Saved Aid's office, Urges Volunteers, do

[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.760]
undo Anita.

[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.920]
Homophobia is so retro.

[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.480]
The flyer of Oaks of Central Tension and Election campaign, Saved Aid Want voters to view

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.600]
the repeal as an anti-gay initiative, the pro-repeal take back Miami-Dade group wants

[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.560]
to frame it as an assault on what they believe is an unnecessary law.

[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.760]
Take back Miami-Dade's approach departs somewhat from the strategy employed by Bryant, who

[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.020]
took a moral tone in her public remarks and warned that the anti-discrimination law would

[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.480]
encourage gays to recruit children.

[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.660]
Take back data is echoed some of those themes in literature at distributes.

[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.420]
One of its flyers said, Homosexualists want to get orphaned children through adoptions,

[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.480]
and they're demanding the repeal of all laws that protect children against sexual abuse

[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.200]
and exploitation.

[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.660]
An Anthony Verdugo, a member of Take Back Miami-Dade, says, the central theme of the campaign

[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.420]
focuses on not extending privileges to gays and lesbians that might not be afforded

[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:21.760]
to others.

[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.440]
The real issue with special rights and special powers that some people in our community

[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.760]
want is used as a battering ramegan's people who disagree with a particular ideology said

[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.600]
Verdugo, who was head of the Miami-Dade Christian Coalition.

[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:34.760]
What a surprise.

[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.640]
He said, reductions in date count, he grants to the boy scouts, which bans gays true

[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.000]
pleaders.

[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.640]
Take back data also contends that gays and lesbians are not the victims of discrimination.

[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.700]
They have gay clubs, they have gay nights, they have clubs that are not gay, they have

[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.360]
gay restaurants, said Rosa Armesto de Gonzales.

[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.320]
A Take Back date above volunteer who serves as Verdugo's attorney, it's said at discrimination,

[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.520]
you see special treatment.

[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.180]
Such reasoning baffles draw its kettle-honed, co-chairman has saved it, considering that

[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.720]
71 discrimination claims have been filed with a county equal opportunity board since the

[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.980]
non-discrimination ordinance was restored four years ago.

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.420]
More than 50 cases have been settled or are still open according to board's records.

[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.620]
Yet for all the claims filed with the board, kettle-honed said one of his group's main

[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.420]
challenges is drawing gays and their supporters to the polls tomorrow.

[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.840]
The people who are with us tend to be complacent because they think their human rights are

[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.920]
safe, he be saying.

[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.460]
That sense of complacency was stoked, kettle-honed, said by a Harold Pull release last week, that

[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:30.560]
showed 54% opposed to the repeal, 34% forward and 12% undecided, and the past decade repeals

[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.920]
and main and Colorado succeeded after pre-election polls predicting the office-in-resolved meaning,

[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.560]
and the privacy of the voting booth, all of a sudden, bigotry rears that's ugly head

[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.460]
and political correctness goes out the window.

[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.680]
In Dade County and Array of Politicians and Celebrities, and publicly opposed the repeal

[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.600]
including 18 of the 21 mayors in the county, and pop star Gloria Estefan.

[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.620]
The repeal effort is also suffered from a series of scandals.

[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.360]
Take back Dade came under fire for using the image of Martin Luther Coon Jr. on a flyer.

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.960]
Also four repeal supporters, including Ferdugo, were arrested last month for falsifying

[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.020]
petitions needed to get the measure on a ballot they have pleaded not guilty and have

[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.460]
said the arrest were politically motivated.

[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.920]
In the final days leading up to the elections, both sides have turned to churches.

[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.600]
Candlestick's vigils were planned and Sunday sermons were polished.

[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.940]
It seemed fitting in Arthur Curtis' 61st-Ave Day Valentine,

[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.480]
remember togethering at St. John's on Lake Church in Miami Beach to plant strategy for

[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.560]
the fight against the repeal.

[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.560]
Someone mentioned that Bryant used to sing there in years before she moved from her

[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.520]
mansion in Miami Beach.

[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.900]
We all thought it was a brilliant moment, Curtis said they were all sitting down where

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.720]
Anita Bryant had staged her last hurrah in Dade County.

[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.480]
And by the way, hey Anita!

[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.860]
Bye bye bye!

[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.980]
That's for you, sweetheart.

[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.740]
Yeah, the old orange juice queen.

[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.560]
Seen her lately?

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:38.900]
No.

[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.160]
I have a...

[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.060]
The only thing we heard about her is the fact that she can't find, like I said, four

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.100]
nickels to rub together and she can't pay her all health.

[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.820]
Not doing so well.

[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.340]
Not doing too good for Anita.

[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.500]
That'll teach you to take us on fags.

[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.800]
And of course that was before we had Rosie.

[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.380]
I'll tell you one thing about the Rosie O'Donnell boy, he's really doing it.

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.060]
Let's see, 100 George's...

[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.900]
119 votes on a pool.

[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.820]
How did George do filling in for Neil this summer?

[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.880]
I don't listen well when George is on 53, 44 and a half percent.

[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.040]
Sounds a little high to me.

[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.820]
I think those game players are manure again trying to bust your balls.

[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:10.620]
You think?

[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:11.820]
Excellent job.

[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.100]
Better than number 25.

[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.060]
Good, 22.

[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:14.940]
OK, 12.

[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.480]
So you add those up and you got a few.

[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.840]
Week six and fair for a friendly got one.

[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.920]
Well, somebody had a vote for fair just to legitimize it being the choice.

[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.240]
You know?

[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.320]
9.56 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.180]
I got the mad dog, the angry hound at one o'clock.

[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.060]
We got Hank at three.

[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.460]
Wouldn't that more from 5 to 6?

[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.700]
As Hank continues learning more ways of having real short shows.

[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.400]
Nice going, Upper.

[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.600]
6.30 to 8.30 at Turuku and Hotline from David and Busters.

[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.200]
8.30 to 10 or land on the big.

[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.940]
Oh, you're a good guy, bad show.

[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.120]
And then from 10 to 10.30 we must have dead air because the schedule says

[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.180]
at K 10.30 to 2 in Joe and Mark overnight.

[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:48.740]
You notice that?

[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.280]
Yeah, that happens sometimes.

[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.280]
I see.

[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.600]
Could it be a misprint clearance?

[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.200]
And I hear death lots to come back.

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.420]
You know, mattress shopping like I've been telling you is only for idiots.

[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.720]
If you do it the old fashioned way, if you do it the smart way, it's for smart people.

[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.400]
And that is picking up the phone and calling the experts at Dilemma.

[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.880]
Chris, 1-800 mattress, telemold, Neil, Torchard, did call.

[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.800]
I've been using these people for a coon's age.

[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.740]
I wouldn't think of fine mattress any other way.

[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.240]
You've got to be stupid to do that.

[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.160]
And then Charles Zomber, write a column about you.

[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.940]
And when you call 1-800 mattress, you'll be instantly connected with a vetting expert

that was an unbeatable price and unbeatable delivery deal too.

[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.840]
And also that unbeatable 30 day in home comfort guarantee to make a long story short.

[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.640]
It is unbelievable.

[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.360]
Unbeatable.

[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.480]
Call 1-800 mattress, choose from the top Cedar.

[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.220]
A Cedar.

[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.060]
That's a new one.

[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.120]
Cedar, Cedar, Celi, Simons, and King Corps.

[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.220]
We've got now five of them on there.

[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.200]
And when you call dial a mattress, you pick today in the two-hour window for delivery that's convenient for you.

[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.700]
Any day of the week, seven days a week, like noon to two, one to three, two to four, etc.

[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.080]
And like I said, you get 30 days to check it out to make sure that you and your back are doing good

[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.460]
and you get a great night's sleep every night.

[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.680]
So replace that lumpy, worn out bumpy old mattress that's killing your back

[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.760]
and not giving you good night's sleep.

[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.760]
You'll be sleeping like a baby as soon as tonight.

[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.820]
If you pick up that instrument right now and call 1-800 mattress, 1-800 MATTRES,

[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.100]
or check them out on that wicked web if you like at mattress.com.

Line and local.

[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.200]
We're sports radio 560, C-A-U-A-M.

[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.220]
Else people are ice-holes.

[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.400]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.040]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:18.980]
All right.

[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.640]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.520]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:25.860]
Here.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.740]
Shady says, lay off the bed, lay down.

[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.080]
He brought his expectations to women.

[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.820]
They were getting too close to the towel,

[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.260]
headed by the seven-takers fall above him, too, again.

[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.280]
We're charging, hop.

[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.000]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.120]
Oh.

[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.600]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.580]
Are you sure?

[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.300]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.820]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.520]
Yeah.

[00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:01.000]
If they don't insist on this weapon, we got 3000 light will never be avenged.

[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.580]
Because you brainwashed, looking.

[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.840]
As you cut this, so big, you'll put a back in office again.

[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.880]
What the fuck?

[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.560]
Pushes the shot, he's up.

[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.120]
Look, fuck up.

[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.540]
Oh, we're fighting.

[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.080]
Pushes the shot, he's up.

[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.680]
Pushes the shot, he's running, he's up.

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.540]
Pushes the shot, he doesn't fall off.

[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:31.420]
Pushes a shot, he's running, I'm gonna pour в его sehr�.

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.980]
Pushes a shot, he's up, freak out.

[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.100]
Pushes a shot, heaya.

[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.220]
No, sorry.

[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.360]
and the foundation of the

[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.580]
ten or two and five sixty w q and that's his on cnn at the canada says that

[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.120]
it must work through the m u n first

[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.080]
because he met in the trotaries meeting in the trot with john crutch and

[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.960]
will frog you know what crutch and told him this morning

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.000]
that's exactly what he said so here's the fact that says Georgia show is the

[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.280]
second best on q a m behind yours of course Georgia show has steadily

[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.240]
improved and you are absolutely correct and i'd like to bear that out by

[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.680]
pointing out here that the last two summers and i'm sure this summer will be

[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.080]
no different the ratings are george your show are far higher than anybody else

[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.240]
on q a m you think that's a coincidence of course for and things that happens

[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.940]
by osmosis it's the tape that helped me i see now let me ask you out why did you

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.880]
uh... facts me this note is opposed to like discussing it on the years there's

[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.960]
something wrong with that enough you wanted to discuss it on why not i don't

[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.120]
know because i don't want to those things

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.780]
because uh... george said in this note which seems kind of silly you i don't i

[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.500]
don't know it seems kind of strange my reading of facts when you're you're sitting

[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.880]
right there not that there's anything wrong with pruning of

[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.560]
parents is for the people from other shows especially people we like like

[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.340]
joe and mark and beast

[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.700]
but i'm the you're the only one meaning me on the stage that does that well

[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.080]
when we i used to do a parenthesis mad dog with promoted all the time on the

[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.840]
weekend and joe rosie mentioned joe right but i you left out mad dog he's very

[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.440]
good at that

[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.920]
i've worked that that's probably because he's our partner in crime like in the

[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.780]
ten to three spot he's doing one of three but even before he was my partner

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.940]
in crime was only doing weekends he still always was real good about that

[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.820]
like like a lot of times he'd be on the year on the weekend on the saturday

[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.960]
right and we'd be doing a thing like a pizza law for me and you'd be driving

[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.580]
there he'd be promoting the hell out of it the weekend guys like when joe does

[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:12.580]
the weekend show if there's something going on or about to come on right he

[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.980]
will promote it when man the little dog and the man dog the regular and i'm

[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.640]
more than a week i'm sure that if uh... you give the information to moe he'd be

[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.500]
delighted to promote

[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.020]
your parents

[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.640]
i'm gonna start like doing appearances like a brand new pizza lot

[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.980]
i'm sure that moe got it up

[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.600]
ecstatic to do that

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.140]
she brought up the example there are some shows that don't promote appearances

[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.200]
for their own people

[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.800]
really really

[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.260]
whether some shows that don't promote not only don't promote other shows on

[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.480]
the station but encourage their listeners not to listen to certain other shows

[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.060]
on the station

[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:45.520]
i guess i was a moment that point in his big column and saturday in the pond

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.020]
beach post unprecedented maybe in history of broadcasting that we have certain

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.860]
people on qa m promoting for uh... people not to listen to the show that follows

[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.240]
that which is also on her

[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.120]
of course he can't be influenced by this because he don't listen anymore

[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.300]
uh...

[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.800]
so we have a high marks for joe and uh... what's his name i mean mad

[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.420]
all right let's get down to business okay

[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.940]
i got so much stuff here and i feel like uh... i've wasted the whole first

[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.020]
hour you think it was a way to know i don't think

[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.180]
this is from newsweek and this is gonna make you puke

[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.580]
get the bag out okay and don't forget this wednesday this will be the one show

[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.620]
not that we want to make light of nine eleven i would be the last thing in the

[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.580]
world we would do but

[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.480]
i'd like to give people an alternative who've already seen enough of the pictures

[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.100]
heard enough of the horror stories heard enough of the uh... grieving from

[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.580]
the relative and enough of the grieving already you know it

[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.520]
how long do we have to be in perpetual grief right

[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.920]
you can be angry you can be pissed off you can be outraged but you can't lose

[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.720]
your sense of humor and you can't lose your will to go on with life that's

[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.160]
what we need to do is go on with life

[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:49.580]
instead of this constant resurgence of uh... outrage being orchestrated you know

[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.400]
by the uh... powers in washington manipulating us like puppets on the end of

[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.820]
the string playing with our emotions so that we get already to get behind us a

[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.460]
new war now

[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.860]
which is coincidentally all the uh... saber rattling coming right before the

[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.460]
guy demolition

[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.400]
just a coincidence and i think he says you know off your election every other

[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:05.680]
year

[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.120]
right just a coincidence

[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.420]
even though they plan for this month and months and months ago only now

[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.240]
are they starting to really

[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.200]
rattled their sabers publicly notice that i notice

[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:16.900]
anyway

[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.320]
exclusive in newsweek the informant who live with a hijacker newsweek is learned

[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.220]
that one of the beer of the beer of the main the fby one of their informants had

[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:27.900]
a close relationship with two of the hijackers by a michael is a coffin is

[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.480]
which newsweek

[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:33.300]
at first fby director bob muller and sister there was nothing the bureau could

[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.160]
have done to penetrate the nine eleven plot that account has been modified

[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.000]
over time and now may change again

[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.480]
newsweek is learned that one of the bureau's informants had a close relationship

[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.960]
with two of the hijackers he was there roomy

[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:49.000]
the connection just discovered by congressional investigators has stunned some

[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.220]
top-counter terrorism officials

[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.980]
and raised new concerns about the information shearing among u.s. law enforcement

[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.480]
and intelligence agencies

[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.080]
the two hijackers collied al-Mindar and now off al-Hazmi

[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.300]
were hardly unknown to the intelligence community

[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.980]
the cia was first alerted to them in january of two thousand when the two

[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.060]
Saudi national showed up at a kind of summit in kuala lumpur Malaysia

[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.040]
fby officials have argued internally for months that if the cia had more quickly

[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:12.640]
passed along

[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.760]
everything in new about the two men the bureau could have hunted them down more

[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.200]
aggressively

[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.600]
but both agencies can cheer on the blame upon leaving Malaysia

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.020]
al-Mindar and al-Hazmi went to sandiego where they took flight school lessons

[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.980]
in september two thousand the two moved into the home of a muslim man who would be

[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.620]
friend of them at a local islamic center

[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.460]
the landlord regularly prayed with them and even helped one open a bank account

[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.040]
he was also sources tell newsweek a tested undercover asset who'd been working

[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.960]
closely with the fby office in sandiego

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.720]
on terrorism cases related to hamas

[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.820]
a senior law enforcement official

[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.660]
told newsweek the informant never provided the bureau the names of his two

[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.020]
house guests from soudi arabia

[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.180]
nor does the fby have any reason to believe the informant was concealing their

[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.440]
identities he could not be reached of course for comment

[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.080]
he's hiding under his uh...

[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.400]
blanket

[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.620]
what's that thing that they are what would you call that

[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.520]
unmagic carpet

[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.640]
but the fby can see that the sandiego case agent appears to have been at least

[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.320]
aware that soudi visitors were writing rooms in the informants house

[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.060]
on what occasion sources the case agent called up the informant was told he

[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.300]
couldn't talk because colleague a reference to almond are was in the room

[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.360]
icy smith

[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.700]
a former top-up fby account of intelligence officials as the case agent should

[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.860]
have been keeping closer to have

[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.280]
and who was informed was fraternizing with if only to seek out the house

[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.660]
guest as possible informants they should have been asking who are these guys what

[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.460]
are they doing here

[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.460]
this drug smear the lack of investigative curiosity about six weeks after moving

[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.860]
into the house on the dollar left town explained that the land already was

[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.840]
heading back to soudi arabia to see his daughter

[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.620]
all house me moved out of the end of two thousand in the meantime

[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.340]
the cia was gathering more information about just how potentially dangerous

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.660]
both men were a few months after the october two thousand bombing of the

[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.200]
west's cool and yemen cia endless discovered in their Malaysia file that one

[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.300]
of the chief suspects in the coal attack tough uh... toffee

[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.520]
of being a touch was present at the summit and have been photographed with

[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:03.020]
almond are and ha ha has me but it wasn't till august 23rd 2001 that the cia

[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.020]
sent out an urgent cable to us border and law enforcement agencies

[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.140]
identifying the two men as possible terrorists by then it was too late

[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.740]
the bureau didn't realize the sandy eagle connection until a few days after

[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.640]
nine eleven when the informant heard the names of the pentagon hi jackas and

[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.900]
called his case agent i know those guys the informant purportly said referring

[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.120]
to almond are in all has me they were my roommates

[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.560]
but the belated discovery has unsettled some members of the joint housing

[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.900]
television committees investigating the nine eleven attacks the panel is tentatively

[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.420]
do to begin public hearings is early september eighteen racing within the

[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.360]
or deadline but some members are now worried that they won't get to the bottom

[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.420]
what really happened by then support for legislation creating a special

[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.640]
love investigative panel similar to probes conducted after poor harbor in the

[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.280]
committee assassinations increasing only then some members able to public

[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.000]
learn whether more nine eleven secrets are buried in the government files

[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.140]
what do you think you think there are more here again

[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:56.320]
but the first lady says and maybe she might have a point here you know it

[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.520]
although c i have other choices i may watch screen tv

[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.820]
okay well what's wrong with that nothing i wish i had a green tv

[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.000]
that's all screaming there gonna be a lot of other people screaming on nine eleven

[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.560]
let's hope uh... only for a memory sake i don't think anything's gonna happen

[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:10.740]
the

[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:15.080]
first lady laurel bush is asking parents to turn the tv off Wednesday september

[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.420]
other than instead read to their children and perhaps light a memorial candle

[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.520]
you know what the christopher's used to say if everybody would just light one

[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.660]
little candle we probably have a lot of house fires

[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.400]
don't let your children see the images especially on nine eleven when you know

[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.380]
it'll probably be on television again and again the plane hitting the building

[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.040]
of the building spalling missus borsan interview friday with universe

[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.840]

attacks on the united state last september but those in the know were

[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.660]
where that the risk however nebulous was real if nothing else the bombing of

[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.340]
the very same world trade center in nineteen ninety three told them that

[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.280]
in americans were profoundly unprepared for another and more lethal strike on

their own home turf nobody had warned them nobody explained who was likely to

[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.200]
launch it much less why where was the press

[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.240]
like the rest of america we were fat happy and arrogant is how mike walles the

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.860]
celebrated coast of sixty minutes glumly put up this spring when i saw the media

[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.860]

satiation point another with step forward like gary kandita was waiting to

[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.600]
take its place cnn may have started the drift to tabloid news but by the end of

[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.940]
the nineteen nineties the major networks and mainstream press were equally albeit

[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.080]
reluctantly caught up in it for the first time news division to become highly

[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.580]
competitive profit centers that were expected to make money sounds like something

[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:39.520]
out of network doesn't it yes many journalists deplore the trend of the

[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.360]
insular but were sure that the public didn't want complicated dispatches from

[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.680]
complicated places they'd have trouble finding on a map there were studies to

[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.900]

and after nine eleven what lesson if any could be learned in the lead up to the

[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.000]
first anniversary a lot of american journalists are considering the same

[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.820]
issue whether the press will revert to the way it was before is the question

[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.740]
says anthony collings of former cnn and newsweek foreign correspondent now

[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.800]
teaching communications at the university of michigan

[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.720]
our general sense is that the media slightly more serious than before but

[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.400]
serious won't be a continuous state it'll go up and down the attacks were

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.720]
undoubtedly a wake up call for the press as roi peter claques in your scholar

[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.400]
at the point of institute for media studies in st. Petersburg but some of them

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.580]
have gone back to sleep at the first of forms last october who's who of

[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.980]
american journalism from broadcasters Ted coppill and peter on net development

[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.700]
newsman Daniel shore had lit into the profession condemning networks and

[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.680]
newspapers for curtailing international coverage

[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.140]
closing bureaus at the end of the cold war because of the cost and the alleged

[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.260]
so much debated lack of interest from readers and viewers

[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.720]
information though not always palatable is essential in democracy they

[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.740]
argued the media should give people what they need not just what they want

[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.680]
if there had been more of a sense of duty said shorter main

[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.580]

[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:16.260]

[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.500]
Pakistan not today but five years ago had we followed these changes they were

[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.380]
happening gradually i don't think we'd be in the fix we are today trying to

[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:27.180]
understand it all but it's not likely to change as Stephen has the ex-presential

[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.940]
advisor and Brookings senior fellow who co-hosted the forums

[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.260]
air-veh organization running its own bureau is a red herring he contends

[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.880]
because all have access to foreign material on the wires they choose not to run

[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.840]
it he says flatly aside from the major organizations and the New

[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.040]

news you can use it's very sad no one disputes that the u.s media sobered up

[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.940]
fact in the shock of 9-11 tv and newspapers scrambled to cover the event

[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.980]

On this lady's, here's what I'll give you.

[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.840]
She's got a book to read about Flambéry.

[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.820]
Nobody knows for about Flambéry.

[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.700]
Out with a big scoop of mouth, anyone

Political pundits on suffocating,

[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.940]
Trump on the floor and masturbating.

A Republican's ganky home.

[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.120]
She's a federalist, emote.

Making liberal the dirty word, you know?

[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.720]
In a mini-starch-rowing camel-do.

And Sultano's what they can be in a mini-starch that smells fishy.

If you got the money, she'll spread those legs with the cigarette and the shark's name.

[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.600]
And Sultar and Sultar, political pundits, the angel of the rock, have a cheesy late.

[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.640]
That's f**king bitch.

[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.860]
When I wait you see at the end of this fact that I'm going to interject the middle of this article here,

[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.920]
it says, did you hear that Angcolder got fired?

[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.560]
No, we did not.

[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.240]
I looked for the article.

[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:01.600]
Huh?

[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.200]
Fired from what?

[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.840]
Because you had that other article that she was fired.

[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.160]
Her column was discontinued in that one.

[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.840]
No, but that can't be what they're talking about.

[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.400]
That was just one paper that dropped her column.

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.320]
Anyway, we'll see.

[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.880]
But the rise to this fact, I'm going to interrupt that article because this is so well, you're worthwhile and timely.

[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.400]
Anybody paying attention?

[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:18.640]
No.

[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:18.920]
No.

[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.760]
They're busy worrying about this very kind of coming back.

[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.800]
And how about those American idol, too?

[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:28.700]
Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair talked to reporters before opening about three hours of talks at Camp David.

[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.380]
Bush's presidential retreat in Maryland.

[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:38.300]
Blair said that they newly released satellite photo of Iraq identifying new construction and several sites linked in the past to Baghdad's development of nuclear weapons.

[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.160]
And both leaders mentioned a 1998 report by the UN affiliated International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, that said,

[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.600]
Sodom could be six months away from developing nuclear weapons.

[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.080]
I don't know what more evidence we need, Bush said, is he greeted Blair for a brainstorming session on Iraq.

[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.880]
We owe it to future generations to deal with this problem.

[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:56.880]
Brain storming.

[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.680]
I wonder who they are alone to George.

[01:14:59.400 --> 01:14:59.840]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:00.960]
Yeah.

[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:11.680]
In a joint appearance before the summit, the two leaders repeated their shared view that Sodom's oyster was the only way to stop Iraq's pursuit and potential use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:24.560]
The policy of inaction is not a policy we can responsibly subscribe to Blair said as he joined Bush and tried to rally reluctant allies to deal with Sodom, perhaps by military force, as Bush was hiding the 45-nick-a-pictures of Tony Blair with a queen.

[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:34.900]
Contrary to Bush's claim, however, that the 1998 IAEA reported not say that Iraq was six months away from developing nuclear capability, NBC News is Robert Windrub reported Saturday.

[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:47.160]
Instead, Windrub reported the Vienna Austria-based agency said in 1998 that Iraq had been six to 24 months away from such capability before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and he went and monitored weapons inspections that followed.

[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:56.500]
The war and the inspections destroyed much of Iraq's nuclear infrastructure and required Iraq to turn over its highly enriched uranium and plutonium windrub reported in a summary of its 1998 report.

[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:11.900]
The IAEA said that based on all credible information available today, they have found no indication of Iraq having achieved its goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon usable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.

[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.360]
A senior White House official acknowledged Saturday night that the 1998 report did not say what Bush claimed.

[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:24.240]
What happened was we formed our own conclusions based on the report the official told NBC News is neurodonal.

[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.160]
Meanwhile, Mark Gwodowski, Gwodauk, was a deki.

[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.460]
How do you spell it?

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.200]
Gwodauk.

[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:36.080]
A spokesman for the UN Agency disputed Bush's and Blair's assessment of the satellite photograph, which was first publicized Friday,

[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.480]
contrary to news service reports there was no specific photo or building that aroused suspicions he told windrub.

[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.900]
The photograph in question was not UN intelligence imaging, but simply a picture from a commercial satellite imaging company, Gwodauk,

[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:52.680]
he said that IAEA reviewed commercial satellite imagery regularly and that from time to time,

[01:16:52.700 --> 01:17:00.500]
a notice construction at sites that had previously examined was deki said the new construction indicated the photograph was no surprise and that no conclusions were drawn from it.

[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.340]
There was not a single building we see, he said.

[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.140]
How do you like that?

[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:10.860]
So like I told you, they've decided months and months ago that they're going to pursue this and of course now they're rattling all the sabres just before election time,

[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.220]
who just acquinsence the course.

[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.120]
So it's not a question of if it's a question of when.

[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.840]
Anyway, getting back to the article in Toronto Star by Linda Hurst.

[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:25.780]
In the first few days, the media performed a herculean task and did an empirical job since Vince Carlin, the American born former head of CBC News World,

[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.220]
now chair of Ryerson University during Lism School.

[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:40.020]
But they didn't follow through, he says, within weeks any attempts to analyze the multilayered backdrop to the attacks and affect the other side of the story were subsumed by the demands of President George W. Bushes with us or against this war on terrorism.

[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.580]
Evil is evil, says Carlin, when something is demonized, there's no need to analyze it.

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.720]
In that, Bush reflects a fairly broad spectrum of the population.

[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:57.280]
Only recently, he says, have major organizations, the New York Times especially, started to run hard-nosed analyses of US-born policy and only after their columnists had done it first.

[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:02.740]
But in general, Americans were not noted for their interest in the rest of the world before 9-11 and they're not interested after.

[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.160]
There are all sorts of places in the world they should be looking at, but they're not.

[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.780]
How then are the media rated for what they have been covering?

[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:20.060]
Commentators on both sides of the border say serious journalists who saw a less meyetic perspective on the war were handicapped from the start by the emergence of patriotism into the picture that's never entirely been ex-sized.

[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.020]
The constraints started quickly.

[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:34.160]
Last October when National Security Advisor Condoleezer Rice called US networks asking them not to run certain types of teeth evil to a russama bin Laden because they were full of propaganda and possibly coded messages, they readily agreed.

[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.740]
However, the same request by 10 Downing Street in Britain was met with a flat refusal, government interference will be resisted, said the BBC.

[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.700]
In Canada, no calls were made by Ottawa and TV News executives exercised their own judgment on running unadded footage.

[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:54.840]
At the same time when the White House tried to prevent voice of American radio from airing an interview with Taliban leader Mohammed Omar, the staff threatened mass resignation.

[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.180]
They ran an edited version in a government spokesperson ominously responded that the defiance would be looked into.

[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:09.360]
When director Murner Whittworth was replaced, she left a memo warning reporters not to fall under the spell of self-sensorship, continue to interview anyone anywhere she said.

[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:20.500]
In November, CNN initiated a rule that any reporter doing a negative story on the war, the bombing of civilians say or of a Red Cross installation, much balanced it with a reminder that terrorists had killed 3,000 Americans.

[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:29.480]
CNN Chairman Walter Isaacson said it seems perverse to focus too much on the casualties or hardships in Afghanistan inside to say the real reason was pressure from viewers.

[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:38.820]
Either way, North Former employee callings, the Pentagon must surely have been pleased to learn that whenever its plans killed the wrong Afghans, CNN would quickly provide PR damage control.

[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:49.760]
More recently, a senior intelligence officer with a state department accused the media of treason because warning stories had been run on vulnerable future terrorist targets, chemical plants, the trucking industry and the food supply.

[01:19:49.760 --> 01:20:01.800]
This type of reporting must be stopped or censored, he wrote in the Washington Post, as several columnists pointed out warnings work both ways if anyone had written about the possibility of terrorists taking flying lessons that alone might have put a wrench into 9-11.

[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:18.500]
While the public may be unaware of it, there's been less access to information in this war than all others before, say American journalist, as Kaplan noted earlier on, government officials now choose to sit down for the soft lobs of CNN's Larry King rather than face harder interrogation for maybe C's nightline already play selves.

[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:28.980]
Yeah, lobs from Larry King or Tim Russert on eat the press like yesterday again with his neighbor and post personal friend Dick Cheney, another embarrassment, another freaking disgrace.

[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.760]
And don't forget about that meeting between Muhammad Akhton and the neighborless guy from Iraq. I won't forget.

[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:34.660]
Okay, good.

[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.880]
Okay, let me do another break. But this is going to be a three-parter, you know.

[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.920]
But that's okay, it's almost over.

[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:48.340]
221 votes on our survey today. How did George do filling in for Neil this summer? I don't listen when George is on 82 now the 37.1%.

[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.000]

How it David?

[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.280]
What's the craft they played on the whole?

[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:30.380]
That's power.

[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.560]
What garbage. The kids that they don't know what's good.

[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.040]
Like that song, I'm happy I live in a split level head. You remember that?

[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:45.500]
How can you listen? I'm happy I live in the split level head. I'm happy I live in a split level head.

[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.400]
You don't remember that? No.

[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.500]
Why am I surrounded by morons?

[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.220]
Come on, howie.

[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.740]
Don't you go be howie.

[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.560]
Make that enough information from you pal.

[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:57.260]
No.

[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.160]
You shut off, Fetzal.

[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.940]
Okay, that's it. You're all fired.

[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.480]
You've had to be the proven.

[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.640]
Listen to me. You're fired.

[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.840]
I'll be the ghost for you too.

[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.240]
You know who I am? I'm the king of paradise.

[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.680]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.240]
I came down here after losing my child.

[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.080]
But to be a big fish.

[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.120]
In a little pond.

[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.360]
But when they kicked me off the SP and they told me don't come back again.

[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.940]
I had some problems with wise guys who advised I move to paradise.

[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.160]
Oh, really?

[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.760]
Yeah. Fire.

[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.280]
That's best for you late over we die.

[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.720]
I got you, punk. You're out of fire.

[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.460]
I was just kidding. Ghost might die.

[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.980]
I hope he dies.

[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.580]
I hope you all die.

[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.980]
I'm a big fish and a little pond to see.

[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.620]
A big fish and a little pond.

[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.080]
I'm a big fish and a little pond.

[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.140]
A big fish and a little pond.

[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:11.880]
Yeah!

[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.000]
I want to see anybody enjoying it.

[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.360]
1046 at five.

[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.020]
Just like to leave that echo with the end there.

[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.560]
That's nice. Reverbs.

[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.780]
The crazy world of Mocha's work.

[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.280]
1046 at five. 60.

[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.440]
So anyway, Linda Hurst writes in the Toronto Star.

[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.580]
And this is at the end of the article.

[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.880]
Collings whose recent book, Words of Fire, deals with press independence globally,

[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.700]
says the end result has been coverage that is right for a cramped and jingoistic bias.

[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.500]
Canadian journalist and educator Peter Desbaret says the media has had a real opportunity

[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.780]
to do what journalism is supposed to do, provide comprehensive coverage,

[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.220]
and hasn't been taken advantage of.

[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.360]
Reporters continue to stay off hot button topics, such as the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay,

[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.660]
or the rights violations of hundreds of detained Muslims, many of them US citizens.

[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.380]
They've been very quiet about that.

[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.580]
He says they find it difficult because it wouldn't be welcomed by the public.

[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.260]
Just like my show's here last Wednesday through Friday, which I'm sure pissed off a lot of people

[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.040]
who don't want to hear the truth.

[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:11.420]
Haset, by the way, if I can interrupt again, 930 last night there was a report on CNN

[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.560]
by one of the reporters I wish I'd written down the name of the guy.

[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:18.340]
And it echoed the whole litany of things that Cheryl Seal had in that first piece that I read.

[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.080]
Haset Wednesday?

[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.440]
The whole timeline of those events.

[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.460]
Nevertheless, Haset Brookings has surprised anyone who would even ask about the public's influence on reporting.

[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.880]
There's no question there's been public pressure on the press.

[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:33.020]
He says Americans were feeling threatened and protective and they made their voices heard loud and clear.

[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.240]
They expect the news to reflect their own point of view.

[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.360]
Indeed, American conservatives who've long viewed the media as relatively liberal buyers

[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.580]
have pounced on any reports that stray from official White House line.

[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.480]
After flag banners were dropped from the screen during newscast and local anchors removed the stars and stripes

[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.500]
and the lapel pins they had sprouted on 9-11.

[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.420]
Viewers were quick to ask about their allegiance.

[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.580]
Carlin says ABC News anchor Peter Jennings, Canadian and born and therefore suspect in many American minds

[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:03.260]
tried to bring a more sophisticated approach to the broadcast but his producers were warned off and went back to cheerleading.

[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.440]
Not all Americans settled for information can find a US point of view.

[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.540]
Many were watching CBC News as Carlin to get a broader spectrum of opinion.

[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.640]
Canadians are more outward looking.

[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.220]
They want information and the CBC made a valid effort to give the other side of the story.

[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:23.000]
In the first three months after 9-11, 36 US public television stations added BBC World News to their lineups.

[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:30.700]
The Jingoism finally got to long time CBC News anchor Dan Rather who had sported a flag pin in the media aftermath and an interview in London in June

[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:34.220]
he said patriotism run amuck was now trampling press freedom in the US.

[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:40.540]
The fear of being accused of lacking patriotism keeps journalists from asking the toughest of tough questions he didn't exempt himself.

[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:45.700]
One finds oneself saying I know the right question but this is not exactly the right time to ask it.

[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.000]
But if not now as Americans were on terrorism hovers on the brink of extending into Iraq then when?

[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.240]
Ash Linda Hurst article in the Toronto Starriest today.

[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.120]
Nice going, Ireland. What on target A?

[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:01.660]
X and I'm not so sure about this guy. What do you think of Scott Ritter? Do you think he's off the wall?

[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.960]
No, I don't. I think if anybody ought to know it's somebody who's actually been there.

[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:13.080]
And I like to point out that we don't see him anymore Richard or was his name the you went in Richard Butler right well poor lot well poor lot.

[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:25.780]
We saw him on nauseam day after day right after none eleven on CNN but I guess his price went up for something but he also agrees he was a chief inspector right and he's been he said it right then he said that they have no more they inspected they got no more any of this.

[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:34.540]
Iraq is incapable of producing weapons of mass destruction and should prove it by allowing in you and weapons inspectors and American who was once on the inspections team said yesterday.

[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:50.800]
With his comments during a visit to Baghdad Scott Ritter who's been a sharp critic of US policy on Iraq joined a long list of officials from European and Arab nations who've urged Iraq to accept inspectors to the fuser crisis with the US Iraqi cooperation on inspections would leave the US standing alone in regard to war threats on Iraq.

[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.220]
And this is the best way to prevent the war written said he was on with Paula this morning on CNN.

[01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:14.800]
Bush administration officials yesterday who essentially came out and has has said that Sodom Hussein has been trying to obtain materials to build nuclear weapons particularly trying to buy thousands of aluminum pipes that could be used in the manufacture of a centrifuge and also really used to manufacture weapons.

[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.480]
What do you make of that.

[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:35.520]
When the search statement thousands of aluminum pipes and we're going to go to war over thousands of aluminum pipes even the I have reported you site said that if Iraq was to have trying to do uranium enrichment of take them many years before they could do it.

[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:47.080]
This is patently ridiculous these are aluminum pipes coming in for civilian use they are not being transferred to a covert nuclear processing plant or any covert nuclear activity whatsoever.

[01:28:47.380 --> 01:29:02.240]
But the best way to figure this out is to send the weapons inspectors in if they if the United States has this evidence that Iraq has these types why not have give me the data I'll come to Iraq hunt it down will bring you to a close that would serve us going to war.

[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.660]
We cannot go to war because vice president Chinese worried about some aluminum pipes this is ridiculous.

[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:19.740]
The former US Marine intelligence office spoke to members of parliament and the journalist on his third trip to raxon TV sign from the went inspection team in 1998 as in the past.

[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:25.700]
His trip was organized by the Iraqi government the rest of his kids was not yet public you don't find that a little bit suspect sure.

[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:41.640]
Oh but still maybe he's going with the Peter Arnet maybe they're going on together Iraq while the nine its band weapons is offered only to continue dialogue with the win about the return of inspectors.

[01:29:41.640 --> 01:30:06.680]
Additionally is the first step to further talks don't you love the way the you went makes demands yeah you either do this or we'll draft a resolution how do you like that we'll put it on our website so that everybody can tell the rest of the world that you're ignoring it like everybody else ignores all of our resolutions like Israel and everybody else paper tiger baby in a course we foot the bill for most of it like usual because we're suckers and we got to write there in New York as if New York doesn't have enough problems and targets already there is the UN sitting right there and God damn Manhattan.

[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.860]
Right right most expensive jerk off in the world.

[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:29.780]
Yeah you went you went said this and you went today and what the hell are they doing in fact how come we don't have you and peacekeeping I'm not talking about a handful gigantic numbers of troops in Afghanistan now you follow what I'm saying because if we do go into Iraq and we eliminate this comeback which is dubious advice we couldn't get them last time when we do go in there and flush him out.

[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.060]
And we take over you know over bag that in five days or whatever what do we do then.

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:45.800]
So this is the problem that most people in the country just all wrapped up in a jingle was the bullcrap that I was just reading about nobody wants to come to grips with those articles about the Taliban and how we embraced them and we love them and we financed them.

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:54.120]
First they were the Mujah Hadin and then they were the Taliban and then they were all the same scumbags we later we filed after 9-11 but on 9-10 we loved them.

[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:04.040]
And in May of the same year we handed over 43 million dollars and you can believe it was because they stopped the poppy growing or because of the Afghan oil pipeline but whatever you want to believe but it's a fact we do.

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:10.680]
We gave it to them and then all of a sudden all the repressing women and they men all have to wear a beard a certain length in their barbarians.

[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:20.540]
Yeah and the same with the Saddam and on articles our bread last week that we helped them develop all of that chemical and biological capability.

[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:34.020]
Help them with his war against those worst evil doors in Iran see we do this all the time we put in one corrupt leader and then when they he turns on us like when he invaded Kuwait then all of a sudden we got a wrist thousands and thousands of American lives.

[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:38.920]
And then we got a wrist that we had to try to undo the evil doers most of the evil doers around the world are there because we put them there.

[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.680]
Oh you can't say that sorry good thing we're not.

[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.680]
By the way now Gaddafi closing in on new capability says you're wrong.

[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:51.240]
Well I tell you one thing we're sure going to have a good time for the years to come because there is no end to those evil doers.

[01:31:52.560 --> 01:32:01.560]
It's a good thing that what's his name runs for all didn't get his way on 9-10 last year that we you know had some time to think about it for star wars that 900 million that he wanted.

[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:11.260]
For billion whatever it was you know small potatoes what's a few billion among friends Libya's Colonel more Mark Gaddafi has been secretly developing nuclear weapons capability and may acquired before Iraq.

[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:21.520]
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon one of Georgia's favorite people disclosed and mine too this less than heartwarming news and interviews before last week's Russia show the holiday weekend.

[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:26.480]
But again Israel may be the best prepared country in the world against the danger of a chemical or biological offensive.

[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:38.820]
This was his message to Israeli citizens who already are discussing on a daily basis the possibility that sawdum may launch warheads containing small posture and track that them as the last resort once the Bush administration moved to dethrone him.

[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:51.600]
But the threat of Libya is not well known and because Gaddafi is tried hard to clean up his act after being forced by US blood sanctions to indirectly admit complicitly in the lock or be airliner sabotage the dictator and triple denounce terrorism.

[01:32:51.600 --> 01:33:07.000]
He tried to hire a Washington lord to get a little bit removed from the west list of tear sponsoring nations in nearly succeeded since the State Department during the Clinton administration conveyed the screen messages to them as really prime minister a who would barrage government that Gaddafi had endorsed the asher aerofarts peace process.

[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:22.700]
Gaddafi tried so hard to convince the world that he had stepped away from the access of evil 10 years ago a Libyan chemical weapons plant operating with the illegal help of German firms and scientists was shown blazing in flames intelligence reports indicated over the Gaddafi removed the weapons and equipment before staging the fire.

[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:33.620]
Operating with the illegal help of German firms and scientists but in the last month western intelligence agencies gained the tales of Gaddafi's latest adventure his bid to join the nuclear club.

[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:44.400]
At first intelligence aimless suspected that Egypt was helping him in this project but now it is certain that Iraqi scientists and engineers who developed their expertise in the last 25 years under Gaddafi are leading the underground Libyan effort.

[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:53.780]
Shiroon said a secret weapons effort is taking place in Iraq in a similar process going on in Libya which probably will turn out to be the first Arab state with weapons of mass destruction.

[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:05.780]
Other countries are helping Gaddafi but the extent of the assistance is not clear Shiroon said it may be that there is assistance from Pakistan as Iran had and nuclear weapons development that Prime Minister warned but for sure there is assistance from North Korea.

[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.360]
All the evil the worst baby they're doing it.

[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.300]
So who do we attack first?

[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.940]
Let's just start on the edge of the Mediterranean.

[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.420]
I say Gaddafi I don't like his head gear at all.

[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:20.280]
No. And that neighborhood jacket he wears that somebody should tell him it's out of style.

[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:29.580]
Nine, a 1056 at 560 WQA is a good chance your carpets are schmootsy after a summertime of your kids running all around and your personal kind of craft.

[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:35.140]
Time to get back to normal again okay the summer is over and your carpets like I said need a real good cleaning how do you do it.

[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:43.140]
You call up the best in the universe and drive concepts the people that do my home my mother's home anybody with a brains home because there's nobody in the world has a better job at a fair price.

[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:51.700]
And don't forget the thing that separates these people from the rest aside from the fact that your carpets look just like brand new when they get done is the fact that they don't play games with their customers.

[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:58.140]
No scams no tack ons at the end no per room song at a dance they give you a written guaranteed price before they start the job.

[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:05.460]
Your carpets dry in a couple hours after they finish no soap carpets that are like a must for days and you're ready to rock and roll the same afternoon or evening.

yore

[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.260]
that has

[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.500]
role the peaceful work

[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.760]
finding a visit

[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.780]

[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.480]
Эtter

[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.640]
your whole holes.

[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:10.960]
Till you explode.

[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.820]
Just like your fat fat churn and lady

[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.500]
after you bite your teeth on a plane.

[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.880]
Spending your fingers that have yellow stained

[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.200]
from sea tools.

[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.180]
Pinsy or tools.

[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.780]
After piggy poodles.

[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.580]
Now to be fat disgusting and hasty, always.

[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.660]
You make the shutter, women smile.

[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.760]
They like a cow who's spandid, sad things.

[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.120]
Think smelly, fat, so repulsive and mild.

[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:53.080]
Your body cheese smells like a grapple.

[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.080]
After it was occupied by head,

[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:59.340]
I've learned it a few more to get into your car.

[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:02.300]
Cuts your two by dem white.

[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.780]
Onkins squeal, onkins squeal, onkins squeal.

[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.240]
Fat lady, it's living with your lover, let me.

[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:17.820]
Clobberin' and thortin' the tree between her knees.

[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.700]
Matchment table, heat.

[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.380]
Smells fishy to me.

[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.600]
That's the button that's moist and hasty.

[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:36.820]
It's a level 02 at 560 QM.

[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.440]
260 votes on our pool.

[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.060]
How did George do filling in for Neil this summer?

[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.700]
I don't listen what George is on, 95, 36 and a half percent.

[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.120]
See, it's kind of like leveling off now.

[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.280]
Just wait.

[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.720]
Excellent job, better than ever, 73.

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.140]
Good, 42.

[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.520]
Okay, 26.

[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.620]
Week 17, and fair is up to seven.

[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:55.740]
That's here for fair.

[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.500]
I mean, not that that's the right vote,

[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.680]
but at least it's got a few votes.

[01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:58.960]

[01:37:59.100 --> 01:37:59.520]
I'll pull it out.

[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.980]
I'm pinging out of my balcony.

[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.940]
I mean, if it's good enough for 10 Williams, why can't I do it?

[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.860]
Let's see, here's the fact that everybody seems to be missing the real reason the shrub needs to invade a racket

[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.820]
and solve a puppet regime as he did with Afghanistan.

[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.160]
The trade sanctions against Iraq from the Gulf War will expire at the end of November.

[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.360]
This means Iraq, with the third largest oil reserve in the world,

[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.860]
will be able to dump the oil on the world market again in much lower prices than Saudi oil,

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.300]
which will cut into poppy oil cake back from the Saudi.

[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.360]
Oh, jeez.

[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:30.360]
Rosie sex change.

[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.560]
Okay, let's get back to fat Rosie, shall we?

[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.540]
This is in this week's globe.

[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.100]
You better go out and get the globe because they got a picture of here in a man.

[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.280]
Well, it's not a real picture.

[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:45.220]
Created with little photo magic, it says they got her head on a big fat body with a like a man's pinstripe suit on.

[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:48.240]
And a tie, a polka dot tie, it's lovely.

[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.980]
Rosie sex change.

[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.280]
Shocker is the headline.

[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.880]
Emotionally, she now sees herself as a man and wow does she look the part says the globe.

[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.620]
Hey, man, just look at Rosie.

[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:05.180]
Friends believe that her shocking new book looks amounts to her decision to change her sex say sources.

[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:09.280]
And everything but the physical sense, the ex talk show host acts like she switched gender,

[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.340]
and she's happier now than she's ever been in her life.

[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.380]
I thought we just got through reading last week about her, her, her, her boyfriend,

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.800]
girl, whatever that thing or her lady of Galpel was getting tired of her and the dumpitor.

[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:21.800]
Right?

[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:22.700]
Didn't we?

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.100]
Well, it all depends on which tabloid crap you want to believe.

[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:29.660]
The former queen of nicest suddenly changed in a way tough looking in your face leader,

[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.800]
primed to take on anyone who stands in her way.

[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.960]
I'd like to see her go three rounds with Janet.

[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.020]
Oh, by the way, tomorrow's the election.

[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:37.900]
Bill McBride.

[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.800]
Wouldn't you say Bill McBride and if hope no on 242 and Bill McBride for governor.

[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:44.280]
Yes.

[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:47.720]
It's a shadow range change from how Rosie presented herself at the Emmy Awards a few years ago,

[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:48.280]
since a pal.

[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.820]
Back then, she looked like a high school prom queen.

[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.140]
Now she's looking like a young Jackie Gleason.

[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:53.740]
It's amazing.

[01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:00.140]
Rosie 40 has a man-a-share cut where is a mask where is masculine clothing and strides around like a guy.

[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:04.300]
And pal say her figure is somehow come to look manly and remarkably less feminine.

[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:10.720]
It's like Rosie had a change of sex as Matilda Rosenberg CEO and chief designer for the trendy clothing line,

[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.100]
Kukla International Link, whose outfit sell in top LA women's stores like Fred Siegel.

[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:16.020]
Kukla?

[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:17.500]
Okay.

[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.880]
What happened to Fran and Ali?

[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.020]
Physically, she's still a woman she tells the globe, but in her mind, Rosie's clearly 100% a man.

[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:32.100]
And Dr. Lewis Mollerace, psychologist based in Tampa, who counsels many gay women but has never treated Rosie, tells the globe,

[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.800]
she's on her way to becoming as masculine as she can.

[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.880]
Emotionally for Rosie, this amounts to a change of sex.

[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.440]
All right.

[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:44.200]
Another leading researcher on gay and lesbian issues notes that Rosie might go all the way and actually have a sex change.

[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.980]
I always told you, I thought she had a penis.

[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.760]
No, no, she's going to go get one.

[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:54.360]
She may be a lesbian who's always felt that she's really a man and may want to pursue her makeover even further by surgically becoming a man,

[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.560]
says the expert doctor Esther Rothbloom, a psychology professor at the University of Vermont, who's also not treated the star.

[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:10.760]
Whatever her final decision may be, Fran's point out that there's a stirring story behind Rosie's changing appearance, a saga of hills she's had to climb and obstacle she's overcome.

[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:16.280]
She sent shockwaves when she officially came out during an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's Pride and Time in March.

[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.400]
Rosie says she only started getting real much.

[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.600]
She dumped her passive girly act from TV, can find another pal.

[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:26.220]
The world has gotten hostile since she came out of the closet and she's got many paddles ahead.

[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:30.300]
If becoming more like a guy than a gal gives her a winning edge, more power to her.

[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.200]
Rosie's had come a long way toward finding out who she really is.

[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.020]
This person is a woman who's more comfortable looking and behaving like a man.

[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.680]
If anyone's got a problem with Rosie's butch way, she could care less.

[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:41.920]
How do you like that?

[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:45.820]
Fafangula, baby, that's the message from butch Rosie. Fafangula.

[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:51.300]
Rosie took that feisty attitude and her battle with the state of Florida was law banning gay people from an opting kids.

[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:56.660]
It stunned me to know that Florida the state where I live is the only one that doesn't love gay adoption, she says of the 77 law.

[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.920]
She has three children she adopted as a resident of New York, Parker 7, Chelsea 4 and Blake 2.

[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:06.100]
In her long time, Galpel, Kelly Carpenter is expecting a baby girl later this year.

[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.200]
And now that she's looking at Manley, you know something maybe Rosie impregnated, or you think?

[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:11.340]
I think it was spores.

[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:19.920]
Rosie's spokesperson says the changes in her appearance are no big deal and she's s'mores and she craps her hair for the summer.

[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:21.920]
You've got to see this picture.

[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.060]
Get the globe, look a little leaf through it in the echeca.

[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:24.920]
I...

[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:31.020]
But pals say that it's much more than that and reveal that Rosie couldn't be happier with her new self, cheerfully calling Kelly the little woman.

[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.340]
Ha ha ha ha!

[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.820]
Anybody stand next to her who would be the little something I guarantee you that.

[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:44.840]
And more than being provider and protector of what pals say she calls the wife and kids, Rosie is shown employees at her magazine Rosie, that she can be just as tough as the next boss man.

[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:53.380]
When colleagues express concern that she might turn her magazine into a forum for other lesbians and gay adoption proponents, staffers got a taste of her techno prisoners attitude.

[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.420]
She marked into the big apple offices and read them the riot act.

[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.100]
If there's one more leak from here to the press than Rosie is true, she reportedly thundered.

[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.960]
All this affects you a lot more than affects me.

[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.560]
I'm already an effing millionaire.

[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:10.020]
Adds her friend the swaggering way she walks, the rough way she takes charge and even browbeats people.

[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:14.740]
Her short hair and unfeminant clothing all make Rosie seem a little bit more manly every day.

[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:16.180]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:17.000]
Whatever.

[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.900]
Yeah, butch off. I mean, butch down.

[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.240]
Butch down, bitch.

[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.760]
Now let's see, I don't have time for this after the break, I'll do this one.

[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.680]
Bush's father feared expanded role in Iraq.

[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:33.760]
Contrary to what a lot of those right wingers out there like to tell us when we used to take those stupid calls, which were just loaded with misinformation.

[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:43.080]
I mean, if I have the choice between believing something that's well documented and written by a respectable journalist and a respectable rag,

[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.560]
then I'll tend to believe that more than some asshole calling in anonymously on a stupid radio talk show.

[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:48.520]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.000]
I don't hear something about that.

[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.860]
Reporter Al Qaeda, I had nuclear plants this from the AP.

[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:58.940]
Al Qaeda considered striking US nuclear facilities in the 9-11 attacks and hasn't ruled out nuclear attacks in the future.

[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.560]
An Arab TV reporter who interviewed two plotters of the third attack said yesterday.

[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:15.640]
Yashri Fuda, correspondent for the satellite station Al Jazeera, told the AP that it was taken blindfolded to a secret location in Pakistan to meet Khalid, Sheikh Mohammed, and Ramzi bin Al-Sheev in June interview and range by Al Qaeda operatives.

[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.580]
Fadah said he waited until not aware of the audio taped interview.

[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.500]
It scheduled to run this Thursday on Al Jazeera because he wanted to include it in a documentary marking the first anniversary of the attacks.

[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:29.800]
A videotape of Al Qaeda leader, Osama Yamama bin Laden released by US official in December for many established,

[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.260]
why? For many established Al Qaeda's responsibility for 9-11.

[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:38.460]
According to Fadah's account, Mohammed and bin Al-Sheev spell out the link even more clearly.

[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:45.200]
US officials regard Mohammed as one of the highest ranking Al Qaeda leaders at large and believe he's still planning attacks against US interests.

[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:52.500]
US officials say bin Al-Sheev was a member of the Hamburg base, so led by Mohammed Ata, the Egyptian-born suspected lead hijacker, by 9-11.

[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:57.220]
I am the head of the Al Qaeda Military Committee and Ramzi is the coordinator of the Holy Tuesday operation.

[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:01.280]
Fadah quoted Mohammed as saying September 11th last year fell on a Tuesday of course.

[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.900]
Mohammed said planning began two and a half years before 9-11 and that the first targets considered were nuclear facilities.

[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:13.160]
We decided against it for fear of a guetta control. Fadah quoted Mohammed as saying, you don't need to know more than that at this stage.

[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.540]
In any way, it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now.

[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:24.280]
Fadah speaking by telephone from London said Al Qaeda operatives told him not to bring any electronic equipment, including a camera or recorder of the interview.

[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:29.620]
The Al Qaeda members videotape the interview but instead of sending a copy of the video as they promised, sent him only the audio tape.

[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:36.800]
Fadah said at one point while he was being led blindfolded to the meeting, said he thought he was going to meet with Al Qaeda leader or Samu Yimama bin Laden.

[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:45.400]
Fadah said during the two days he spent talking to the two, Mohammed once referred to bin Laden in the past tense and that a sense of disarray led him to believe that bin Laden could be dead.

[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:53.260]
Fadah and Egyptian reporter, host of Al Jazeera's investigative program, Top Secret, said he flew to Islamabad and then to Qorakshia and Al Qaeda instructions.

[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:59.940]
In Qorakshia, he was taken blindfolded and via a complicated route to an apartment where he met the two many recognized as, will have it and bin al-Shib.

[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.580]
Al Jazeera had announced last week it'll broadcast the interview as part of its coverage marking the anniversary of the attacks against the World Trade Center in Pentagon.

[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.360]
Fadah wrote about the interview for London Sunday Times in a story that appeared yesterday.

[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:13.360]
He told the AP he accrued the Times to publicize the documentary.

[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.780]
He wrote in the newspaper that during the interviews he learned that the US Congress had been the fourth target.

[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.260]
hijack plane slammed in the well we know that.

[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:29.000]
Fadah also learned that it had been a sleeper operative in Germany since 1992 and started detailed planning with a 1999 meeting in Afghanistan with other sleepers.

[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:41.200]
Once in the US, Ata communicated with higher ranking Al Qaeda officials via email Fadah wrote, but when he had determined everything was ready he telephoned bin al-Shib in Germany to tell him the date using a riddle that referred to the shapes of the numbers 9 and 11.

[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:48.780]
The gutter based satellite station Al Jazeera has drawn world attention with its broadcasts and news with end statements by Osama Yomamah bin Laden and its top loop.

[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.440]
So there you go covering yourselves accordingly.

[01:46:53.980 --> 01:47:00.880]
From minutes after 11 at 5.50 WQM we got the mad dog, the ponderous puppy, the hysterical hound he's coming up at 1 o'clock.

[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.960]
You got Hank Goldberg at 3. Do you realize Hank's got a ball game tomorrow at 4.30? Lucky man.

[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:05.980]
Lucky man.

[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.900]
He's going to forget that show down to about 15 minutes.

[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.660]
He's learning to do what we do best. Me and a mad dog and a hound per man work as little as possible and get paid the most.

[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:15.920]
That's the way to do it.

[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:19.260]
Do you think we're going to get any new copy from a Skippy or anybody?

[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:20.520]
No.

[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:24.420]
What is that pigeon again? Speaking of craft. Just lifted his leg.

[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.740]
As soon as I said Skippy, he lifted his leg. How do you like that? You'll fit in real well Skippy. You're just one of the group.

[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.880]
He probably getting lessons from Tundraq.

[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:38.100]
Let me tell you that all your med is a product that will make you feel your best and keep you in good health and sound fluid.

[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:44.000]
No matter how hot, how humid out his answers it gets. All your med is a soft gel capsule that's got all kinds of good stuff in it.

[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.280]
There's pharmaceutical grade all along with vitamins and minerals and minerals.

[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.320]
Unlike Eventonia for a very, very, very long time with limited copy.

[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:57.920]
They make a product for each different part of your health. There's one for your prostate, one for your heart, your blood pressure, your cholesterol.

[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.280]
They also make supplements to promote health and your circulatory system.

[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:07.420]
You're digestive, your endocrine system, your skin, your bones and your mind. All using the benefits of the best out of oil you'll find anywhere.

[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:12.840]
And don't forget, olio med like I keep telling you makes products for men and ladies as well, even maybe one for Rosie.

[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.080]
Maybe it'll put you up a little bit more, but I doubt it.

[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.140]
Olio med is available at Walgreens Whole Food Markets, the Royal Pharmacy in Sedanos.

[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.300]
If you want to get more information about olio med, and when you call them by the way, ask them how come Skippy won't give us any new copy.

[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:33.560]
Call 1-866 olio med. Copy, what's that? 1-866 olio med. Don't forget you can get that information on their website too, as well as order this exciting new product.

[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.540]
That's olio medamerica.com.

[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.820]
You're not going to look all over. It's just for 20 or twice to do. You way out.

[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.080]
A lot of people have little boys.

[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:47.980]
No!

[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:57.880]
Everyone in office did the same as me. The only difference was they were a little more discreet.

[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:04.400]
You elected me, your president. Not yours, mate. No matter who you put here, it'll always be the same.

[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.780]
For Washington, the push they all had something on the side, but the press loved it was best to keep it quiet at the time.

[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:17.100]
And half of them back then, and it never gone the stop. Every president has done the presidential law.

[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:23.580]
When FDR was given up the brand new deal. Hellenor was given chips the reason to spoil.

[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:43.100]
He was a little more discreet.

[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:43.100]

[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:43.160]
He was a little more discreet.

[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:43.160]

[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:46.080]
He was a little more discreet.

[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:52.220]
Compared to what went on with McKinsey, the girls I had all of that to make you win.

[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.340]
Unless the cause of zone have Peter law for for mob help.

[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:02.080]
It wasn't a coincidence or just bad luck. That hoover is the name of the vacuum that sucks.

[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:05.280]
Half of that's them. And it's never gone the stop.

[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.360]
The ever president has done the presidential buff.

[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.900]
When you're the president, you have to ask yourself why not?

[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.780]
The ever president has done the presidential buff.

[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.120]
Kim Starman thinks it's criminal, but I hope it's not.

[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.320]
The ever president has done the presidential buff.

[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:28.600]
Well, they say it's going to be a week of history of maybe in fact CNN's on a right now.

[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.580]
Search isn't sorrow, remember 9-11. There's more images again.

[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.260]
See television does two things magnificently.

[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.740]
Number one, they exploit human misery and suffering.

[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:40.720]
And number two, they desensitize the viewer so that after they show it over and over,

[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.100]
it doesn't have any meaning anymore, right?

[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.460]
It's like it's like the puppy snuff tapes, you know?

[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:48.320]
After the 50 million time they showed it, even the greatest of us dog lovers,

[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:51.780]
it had no meaning anymore. And of course I wouldn't watch it more than once anyway.

[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.660]
But if you did, it just had no meaning.

[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.680]
And the same thing would have plans crashing into the twin towers and into the Pentagon.

[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.600]
All you know what? We don't see the Pentagon because I guess we don't have that footage.

[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.880]
Right. And that's small potatoes.

[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:07.520]
And that's small potatoes anyway. It's only like, you know, on the outside of the wage.

[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.320]
What was it, 2,300 people died there?

[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:14.840]
Which I noticed that nobody talks about that about anybody who died of the Pentagon.

[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.880]
But nevertheless, moving right ahead, like I said,

[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:21.100]
desensitizing the viewers and if they show you something over and over again,

[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.380]
it's like the thing with the dead little kids, all these, you know,

[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.780]
not that they were into that big time.

[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:25.500]
Right.

[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.840]
I mean, these acts are so grotesque and so unacceptable,

[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.400]
and yet because it's on television, oh, do you know what I'm saying?

[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.700]
You know? Let's see if we can find out more about it.

[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.240]
Let's see if we can go into a feeding frenzy about it.

[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.220]
But the public accepts it.

[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.880]
Don't get excited. Just stay calm. Don't get all carried away.

[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.800]
See, I have a tendency when I start talking about that to get aggravated.

[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:51.360]
Because they said you, they peddle you this idea that somehow,

[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.480]
this is the way the world is supposed to be.

[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:57.900]
And yet what they should be doing, and that is exposing the insanity of religious fanaticism,

[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.080]
which is what 9-11 was all about, and continues to be,

[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.460]
they don't want to deal with that because it's not going to prevent this.

[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:10.340]
Bush's father feared expanded role in Iraq by Walter Pink as Washington Post staff writer

[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.680]
and yesterday's Washington Post.

[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.080]
Four years ago, former President George Herbert Walker

[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.320]
Bush wrote that there was unanimity within his administration that the 1991 Persian Gulf War

[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:26.880]
should end once the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's had been driven from Kuwait.

[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:30.140]
Remember all the calls we had from those right ones?

[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.700]
Yes. All in all, with the Democrats in Congress, wouldn't let them continue.

[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:33.980]
They would not authorize the right.

[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:35.400]
Those wits, those voices.

[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:36.880]
That's right. Those appeasers.

[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.900]
If he had sent US military forces on the back of that,

[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.760]
Bush asserted in the 1998 book he wrote with Brent Scowcroft,

[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.200]
his national security adviser.

[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:48.880]
The US could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.

[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.420]
That's the same Brent Scowcroft, by the way, who for the last two weeks,

[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.320]
has been raiding against this Bush administration and saying that we absolutely have no reason to invade Iraq

[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.140]
and would be a grotesque mistake.

[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.220]
Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq,

[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:05.120]
would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in mainstream,

[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:10.280]
engaging in mission creep, and we would have incurred inculubable human and political cost

[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.600]
Bush wrote in the book titled, A World Transform.

[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.000]
As the administration of President Bush intensifies its efforts to commence Congress,

[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:20.000]
the American public and US allies need to confront Hussein again.

[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.740]
It's also looking at how a policy on Iraq evolved within the first Bush administration 11 years ago.

[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.420]
In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990,

[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.300]
the UN Security Council let November authorize the use of force to drive the Iraqis out,

[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:35.040]
but did not make a change of government in Baghdad and part of the package.

[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:39.980]
President George Herbert, W. Bush and his aides, informally decided that,

[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.620]
although removing Hussein would be beneficial,

[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.720]
that goal would not be part of US policy unless the Iraqi President used chemical

[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:50.760]
or biological weapons against US or coalition troops or neighboring countries such as Israel, he did not.

[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:55.800]
Months before the war began in January 1991, while Pentagon planners were still at work,

[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:58.160]
the White House had discussed the question of Hussein's future.

[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.880]
At a December 1990 meeting of senior national security officials,

[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.540]
Hussein's removal was set aside according to Scotcroft,

[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:08.200]
making it a formal goal of the coalition of the United States was assembling for the war

[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.100]
well beyond the bounds of the UN resolution guiding us, he wrote.

[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.500]
If the United States announced such a goal unilateral, he added,

[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:17.640]
we would be committing ourselves alone to removing one regime and installing another,

[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.120]
and if the Iraqis themselves didn't take matters in their own hands,

[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.840]
we would be facing an indefinite occupation of a hostile state and some dubious nation building.

[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:29.800]
There also was the problem of maintaining the support of Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia

[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.180]
that were vital to the war.

[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:32.460]
Bush senior wrote,

[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.260]
we also believe the US should not go at alone,

[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.820]
mounting an effect of military counter-duel warx invasion required the backing and basins of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.

[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.800]
On February 26, 1991, two days after the US and coalition troops began,

[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.500]
their successful ground offensive to free Kuwait. Bush wrote in his diary,

[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.120]
we would declare an end once I was sure we had met all of our military objectives

[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.800]
and fulfilled the UN resolutions.

[01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:56.540]
The following day after the Defense Secretary Richard V. Cheney,

[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.040]
oh, could that be the same one?

[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:04.060]
Reported that the southern part of Kuwait was free and that military operations would halt that day of the next.

[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:07.140]
US television screens were filled with pictures of US aircraft,

[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:12.360]
artillery and tanks pounding Iraqi units fleeing North and Kuwait city to the southern Iraqi city of Basra.

[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.300]
The carnage had an effect on the White House,

[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:20.280]
we had all become increasingly concerned over impressions being created in the press about the highway of death from Kuwait city to Basra,

[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.180]
Skokraft Road.

[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.860]
In the Oval Office that afternoon, Bush asked his advisors including Cheney and General Colin Powell,

[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.580]
then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if it was time to stop, they decided it was.

[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.160]
There was no descent, Skokraft Road.

[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.720]
Not even from Dick, how do you like that?

[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:40.440]
Bush later wrote that Robert M. Gates who was deputy national security adviser at the time told him,

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.480]
we crushed their 43 divisions, but we stopped, we didn't just want to kill and history will look on that kindly.

[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:50.380]
There had been a secret plan drawn up by the Army's chief operations officer to seize Baghdad,

[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.000]
according to a book by Michael Gordon and General Bernardi, trainer published in 95,

[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.100]
the plan was circulated after the war ended.

[01:55:56.580 --> 01:56:01.440]
While it raised the possibility of a decisive victory, it also opened the door to a protracted occupation in Iraq,

[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.580]
which was not the kind of war that power or general Norman Schwartzkopf wanted they wrote.

[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.660]
Bush and his book laid out other reasons for not sending US forces into Iraq,

[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:13.340]
many of which are being cited by US informed opponents to a new military offensive.

[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.680]
The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs, the Zerdingen and Nangir and other allies

[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.640]
putting out, pulling out as well, Bush 1 Road.

[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:26.120]
Referring to a doctrine first applied by the Reagan administration, Bush 1 noted there was no viable exit strategy we could see,

[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.680]
violating another of our principles.

[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:32.080]
It was also possible that invading Iraq could lead to a breakup of the country,

[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:34.980]
which was opposed by Iraq's Arab neighbors as well as by Turkey,

[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:39.340]
which feared that an independent Kurdish state might be created in northern Iraq, Bush 1 Road.

[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:43.920]
US intelligence and Arab coalition members had told Bush that defeating Hussein would quickly lead to

[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:49.140]
being forced out of power that did not happen, instead in uprising among Shiites and southern Iraq was quickly put down

[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.940]
by Iraqi forces, a similar attempt by the Kurds in northern Iraq was also squashed.

[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.240]
Can't you just hear the Bushies now saying, ah, Shiite.

[01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.040]
Accused of having encouraged those uprisings, Bush said that although we said removal of Hussein would be welcomed,

[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.780]
his fate was up to the Iraqi people.

[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:06.400]
The end of that for very practical reasons, there was never a promised way to not uprising.

[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:11.780]
Cheney, who's taken a lead role as Vice President, pushing for preparation to take military action against Hussein,

[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:14.120]
played the same role 12 years ago as Defense Secretary.

[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:17.540]
Bush wrote that months before any operations were launched 11 years ago,

[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.940]
while Secretary of State James Baker III was reluctant to contemplate use of force

[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.160]
and pressing for diplomacy and sanction to get the job done,

[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:27.580]
Cheney recognized earlier that sooner or later it would come down to force.

[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.080]
Cheney was probably ahead of his own military on this Bush wrote,

[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.460]
while the military did not appear eager to go to war unless other options have been exhausted.

[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.100]
Cheney led the way for the military, leading not pushing the military to understanding and fulfilling,

[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.060]
the mission said for them by the President.

[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.180]
We don't want to say he's a hawk, do we?

[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:43.940]

[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:44.440]
What he is.

[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:45.860]
Heyman Rumi.

[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.660]
26 after 11 at 560 WQM, how's George doing on a vote, baby?

[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.620]
We've got 290 votes, a lot of votes pouring in there.

[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.680]
How did George do in filling in for Neal this summer?

[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.020]
And look at that, you're making slowly but surely you're making progress back to that 30%.

[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:06.380]
I don't listen when George is on 104, 35.8% under 36 now.

[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:09.300]
Excellent job, better than ever, 79. Good, 49.

[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:09.920]
Okay.

[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:10.460]
Okay.

[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:11.720]
31.

[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.420]
Week 18 and fair is up to, look at that.

[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:15.800]
I told you fair would get some votes.

[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:16.520]
Yeah, I did.

[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:16.980]
Yeah, not fair.

[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.460]
26 past 11, we got the mad dog coming at one.

[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:22.940]
Have you heard the news about the 3.95% mortgage?

[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.540]
Well, if you've been thinking about it, quit thinking and do something smart.

[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:32.460]
Because now is the time to buy or I home or refinance your existing home at the unbelievably low rate of only 3.95%.

[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:33.140]
100 late more.

[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:40.940]
If you have a 7.5% mortgage, the 3.95% would save you over 3.5% or over 3500 bucks the first year on a 100,000 dollar mortgage.

[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:46.560]
So to make things easy for yourself, just pick up the phone, make one quick call to financial group, they'll tell you all about it.

[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.500]

Credit restrictions do apply and rates are subject to change if you wait 2-Damn long.

[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:27.360]
Line in local, we're supporting Radio 560, QA-M.

[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:28.400]
QA-M.

[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.340]
I love a hand.

[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:40.480]
Your is the foreignest person that you'll ever view.

[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:41.320]
Yes.

[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.980]
We can't take you anymore.

[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:50.600]
No one's for more reason, vice president, alcohol.

[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:04.440]
No signs of facial expression is he alive.

[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:11.440]
If you're stuck with him then one hour seems like five.

[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:19.480]
Who's going to be the foreignest person that you'll ever view?

[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:27.280]
Who's going to be the foreignest person that goes for two or two?

[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:57.260]
Who's going to be the foreignest person that you'll ever view?

[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:08.740]
So CNN and dutifully do and just what I've described before in the article from the Toronto Star.

[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:17.040]
They're discussing reports as Iraq poses nuclear threat and they're showing pictures of them setting the world field on fire from the Gulf War.

[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:22.260]
And of course those pictures with the gigantic balls of fire looks like nuclear explosions, is it?

[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:22.460]
No.

[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:28.520]
In fact I'll tell you something, the scene at the World Trade Center for my year.

[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:30.560]
That looks more like a nuclear explosion than this did.

[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:32.240]
Didn't you think so?

[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.180]
Sure, left to crater.

[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:35.740]
Jeff, what is this?

[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:37.940]
Is this the inside poop on what's going on in the station?

[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.100]
Yeah, just got to start reporting.

[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.120]
Spy report, Jeff, hi.

[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.520]
Aka fat boy.

[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:46.180]
Aka, a tub of lard.

[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:48.720]
Can't close the stall door when he poops.

[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.460]
Oh, oh, man.

[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:54.840]
I may not be coming back.

[02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:57.220]
Either that or I'm going to tell you one thing.

[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:01.600]
I'm going to spend the get up an extra hour early in the morning and really evacuate heavy duty.

[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.260]
So to speak, since we brought everything else in here maybe you could get a little stall installed.

[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.580]
Oh, man, I don't want to see that.

[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:12.100]
I don't want to walk in there to take a leak and have that that handicraft the stall door open.

[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:15.020]
And him in there in his full reggae and the chair and a hole.

[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:15.720]
Ah.

[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.160]
Bush ratings down on foreign policy.

[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:20.640]
Uh-oh.

[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:29.540]
President Bush is overall rating is slid steadily downward over the summer largely because of a major withering of support in the ways conducting foreign policy two polls.

[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.600]
I'll be finding a CBS news.

[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:38.600]
New York Times poverly Saturday also found a majority of Americans things Bush lacks a clear plan to carry out his war on terror.

[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:44.980]
Overall, the poll found that 63% of the way Bush is doing his job while strong for president almost two years on the job.

[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:52.640]
The number is down three points from the summer 66% rating and down 24 points from his 87% approval rating soon after the attacks of last 9-11.

[02:02:53.420 --> 02:03:01.300]
It found 54% support is foreign policy only two months ago 68% approved this foreign policy and last fall the level stood almost three forts.

[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:05.860]
Before 9-11 just under half the residents of respondents rather approved this foreign policy performance.

[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:16.220]
A Washington Post poll published in yesterday's edition found that Bush's approval rating is now 69% down 23 points from the 92% registered by post pollsters in October.

[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:23.800]
It also found that 70% now approved the way he's managing the war on terrorism down 13 points from July and 22 points from October's high.

[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:34.180]
The Times CBS poll also found that while almost two out of three field Bush has not explained his position on Iraq sufficiently, Americans generally support his preemptive policy against Sodom Hussein.

[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.480]
Not that they're propagandizing or planning the seeds you understand.

[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.380]
Don't forget go on and pick up the inquire or just take a peek at it.

[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:50.140]
Pick up the picture on the front cover and then inside page what page 34 through 30 something 36 7.

[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:56.680]
Oh, patchy ramsy man looks like hell on wheels worse than fat boy but we'll get to that.

[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.660]
This thing you just fact to me.

[02:03:59.340 --> 02:03:59.540]
Yes.

[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000]
From the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and of course a warmen up for the nights again the patriots and the Steelers.

[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:10.280]
I got to confess I did call yesterday and I got the NFL package and that embarrassing to admit to that.

[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:11.100]
Yeah.

[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:17.680]
I saw a little bit of the dolphins against the little girls teen yesterday and joke and I did see the end of the bills jets game.

[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.000]
I saw quite a bit of that game did not see the end of the Cleveland Kansas City game although it's shown the low light on it about 50 times.

[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:24.820]
But it's you know it's worth having on the Sunday.

[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:34.360]
But tonight of course on ABC, Al Michaels who was on the emptying with Mo Cheswick this morning and John Madden make their network debut in a regular season game.

[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.340]
Good pair man.

[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.680]
They got rid of that silly goose.

[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:37.940]
What did I tell you about Dennis Miller?

[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:39.040]
Did I tell you forget about him?

[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.700]
Did I tell you that?

[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:40.520]
Get rid of him.

[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:41.540]
He's a craft.

[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:44.660]
I could have saved them a lot of embarrassment with that but they don't ask me.

[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:50.620]
Anyway, Mark Madden, a relation to John writes in the Pittsburgh, the Post Gazette this past Saturday.

[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.980]
With Jerome Betis accused of sexual assault, the Steelers raised something they certainly don't need as they begin a season filled with so much promise.

[02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:59.800]
And unnecessary distraction.

[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:07.840]
Forgive me if I take a Greensburg woman's personal tragedy, be it real or perceived and aim lives its relevance to football but this is the sports page.

[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:15.800]
By being involved in an unseemly situation, Betis has opened himself up to countless cat calls from opposing fans and Steeler fans too if he performs poorly.

[02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:18.200]
Can't wait for the first pooled groin joke.

[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:20.740]
The situation will be discussed endlessly on talk shows.

[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:27.740]
I don't presume to judge Betis at government since although this seems like a, he said she said situation with no witnesses and that tends to favor the accused.

[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.320]
But even when you beat the rap in a sex case, Abone remembers that you were involved with something as lazy.

[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:38.240]
I can't fault Betis for picking up women. He's young single guy. He has for doing so during training camp.

[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:41.820]
I hope nobody expects all the Steelers to put sex on hold until after the Super Bowl.

[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:45.120]
That's Draconian he wrote, sending you scurrying predictionary.

[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.900]
There's one thing I do know if I ever feel they need to commit a crime I'm doing it in Greensburg.

[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:54.200]
Betis is accused of sexually assaulting a woman August 21st. The woman filed a report with police that same night.

[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.540]
The Greensburg police didn't get around to questioning Betis until two days ago.

[02:05:58.060 --> 02:06:00.940]
And only then did so because the Post Gazette came nosing around.

[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:06.160]
It's not like Betis is hard to find. He's been at the Steelers outside practice complex the past two weeks.

[02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:09.440]
The Greensburg police, by the way, have you ever been into Mountain View winning Greensburg?

[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:11.040]
Nope. Excellent food.

[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:13.280]
I actually stayed there one time.

[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:19.140]
The Greensburg police clearly tried to give Betis the celebrity exemption, perhaps dragging their feet in the hope the alleged victim would drop or complain.

[02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:26.060]
The Greensburg police should have died disguised themselves as members of the sports media and walked around with microphones, cameras, tape recorders and notebooks.

[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:30.620]
They wouldn't have had the need to look for Betis. He would look for them. He has an addiction to attention.

[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:38.600]
Betis is vial accounts of very nice guy. But we shouldn't use that as self evidence to assume his innocence or to assume that he's totally incapable of doing anything bad.

[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:44.760]
When Al Martin played for the Pirates, he was widely hailed as the most affable human being, the cent-foot in a big league clubhouse.

[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.420]
Turns out he was a bigamist who told ball face lies about a fictional college football career.

[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:52.840]
This doesn't mean Betis is guilty of being a bad human being, much less guilty of any crime.

[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:55.560]
But it does mean we really don't know what pro-athletes are like.

[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:59.780]
You can't judge a man by his quotes in the paper or by a soundbites on radio and TV.

[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.700]
And we, as sports cough journalists, can't judge an athlete by the fleeting few moments he or she is a dainst to spend with us.

[02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:10.500]
I would guess this whole incident likely will blow over. No charges have been filed.

[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:15.540]
And in case without a witness is hard to prosecute. For the discussion and corresponding distraction will outlive the legal matter,

[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:21.280]
Pittsburgh loves how to rumor much more than cold hard facts. It'll be interesting to see Betis reactants to fans give him a hard time.

[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:25.360]
Memo to Jerome, a hundred yards against the Patriots guarantee this will not happen.

[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:30.860]
How do you like that last line there? I'm kind of cute. A hundred yards of my ass Jerome, okay? Up your ass.

[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:36.980]
Patriots tonight, Tommy Brady, anybody going to be watching? George might even be watching that. I doubt it.

[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:37.220]
What?

[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.540]
Big game tonight, baby. Monday night football. Are you ready for some football?

[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:47.440]
Come on, man. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Are you ready for some football? Remember that call?

[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:52.860]
Yes. Down on the second floor. This is one of those memorable calls. Almost as memorable as the guy who said,

[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.760]
I can't relate to the people who voted for Gore. Almost as memorable as that and I quite.

[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:04.840]
Neil, are you ready for some smash mouth? This was some schwarzer. Ready for some smash mouth. M-O-U-F-F-O-O-B-A-L-L.

[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:07.120]
And I said, no.

[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:11.200]
T-5 yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. Push the tech.

[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:18.120]
How about those Houston Texans? I saw the end of that game, too. Beat up on the Cowboys. And I saw that Jerry Jones on the sideline, man, I hate that son of a bitch.

[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:24.580]
Anyway, 20 till noon. Am I starting to get in the two football intensive? Yes. We'll get off of that and we'll get on the job. But, ain't this second.

[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:31.660]
Gotta see the pictures. You won't believe it. And, of course, you would be in the hard-ass son of a bitch that you are. You'll be trolling and truckling at her misery.

[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:39.480]
Anyway, let me tell you about one person we're reveling in and that's the beast. He looks so much better. Man, he looks almost human underlined the almost part.

[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:45.600]
He's lost 53 pounds. I bet you by the end of this week when he weighs in again. He'll be, he's starting to get close to 60, you know.

[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:53.860]
Close to 60, right? No, I'm serious. I bet you by the end of the week, he's edge in toward the 60 pound mark. He's looking pretty dang good for him.

[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:58.900]
And you can do the same thing. You can lose weight, get healthy and have great tasting, delicious meals every day. In fact,

[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:08.140]
Valence for life puts so much damn food in the little black sack. Some days you might have a hard time finishing it, but that's the idea because it's based on the premise of the principles of the zone diet, the premise and principles.

[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:19.860]
So you really need to eat all of that food. Three delicious gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, and they deliver it right to your doorstep by six o'clock every morning in that very important little black sack, even a 60-nose bottle water was in there too.

[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:29.620]
And if you eat all of that food, you'll be amazed at how full it keeps you number one. Number two, how delicious all the food is made with the freshest, the best ingredients you can find anywhere and how fast the weight just pours off.

[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:39.120]
And they let you choose between two alternatives for each meal every single day that you're on the program too. How long can you afford to be overweight out of shape, lethargic, diabetic, dying is basically what it's all about.

[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:48.260]
So get yourself in shape, lose that weight and stop being frustrated because it's the easy way to do it. You don't have to count calories, carbs, anything else. All you have to do is open your little black sack every day.

[02:09:48.260 --> 02:10:02.640]
Let balance for life. Take care. All the details call them at 9.5.4. 5.6.8.32.29. And I guarantee you know time at all you look better than the beast. 9.5.4.56.8.32.29 or visit them on their website at valanceforlife.com.

[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:08.600]
My life and love all this is 4.25.60. You weigh it in weigh.

[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.060]
Oh that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.460]
Oh my dad knocked me out. He made me when he had me up there.

[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:30.460]
When I went on the neighbor. I was killed by my daddy. Oh my dad knocked me out.

[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:41.540]
I was in a dream. It's not a needy of it. I'm a someone who knows.

[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:54.380]
He beat me and beat me to the mouth. And I should have heard it. He's got me an old, old, no, come around.

[02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:03.920]
So they're gonna let him go. My dad knocked me out. He made me to get up there.

[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:11.720]
So he's a one who beat it. You'll never hear an ad made it.

[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:19.780]
My dad knocked me out. I knocked me out.

[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:36.880]
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.

[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.440]
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.

[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:49.760]
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.

[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:54.160]
But for right of branch he'll be shooting again TV that is. Well look at that much later.

[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.300]
We'll have time.

[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.880]
325 votes on a poll. They're pouring in for George or against George or about George.

[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.860]
This is the kind of poll the audience likes. See? Now what's gonna happen Wednesday? They don't give a crap about that.

[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.880]
They don't know anyway. Any more than you know or I know or anybody else.

[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.040]
How do we know what's gonna happen next half hour? For all we know, station could go off the air.

[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:17.380]
The historic could come in on the internet about the station being sold to entercom.

[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:20.220]
We don't know. And sure it's how nobody's gonna tell us anything.

[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:23.660]
Because they lie a lot. That's the nature of the business. They lie through their teeth.

[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:29.100]
And then of course if the sale does go through then you know Greg will you know stand up there and scratch his head making that.

[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:32.780]
Well we couldn't make any money with you assholes so we'll see if they can do it. You know that kind of thing.

[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:37.760]
And of course George has got his fingers and eyes and legs crossed. I don't know why.

[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.780]
You got your good you got a real good ally there in the morning. Feasty.

[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:50.080]
No. Mocha's week. 325 votes. Remember Mr. Cheswick from Kuku's nest.

[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:54.420]
I want my cigarette. That's what we got in the morning. Mocha's week is my new name for Mo.

[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:59.200]
325 votes. How did George do filling in for Neil this summer we asked?

[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:02.920]
I don't listen when George is on. 118.36.3%.

[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:05.940]
I think that's about did I say between 30 and 40?

[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:06.480]
Yes.

[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.960]
When you can't get much more between 30 and 40 than maybe exactly 35.

[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:16.260]
Excellent job better than ever. 9128%. That's a pretty good endorsement. A ringing endorsement for little George.

[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:22.000]
And of course keep in mind. Keep in mind speaking of Mo. Shrek, Drak, whatever his name is. Mocha's week.

[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:25.980]
Then if it was up to him if he would have had his way George wouldn't have been there this summer.

[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:32.240]
He got only knows what kind of crap you would have. Maybe it had the the algorithm of radio. Joe Zagaki on there.

[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.720]
Excellent job 93 better than ever. Good 60. Okay 34. Week 18 and fear 11.

[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:44.880]
So if you end up the percentage that's the week and that's 40 so it's like 60 to 40 you're in the lead.

[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:48.420]
I mean like that. Oh right. Yeah sure what how not.

[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:54.440]
In addition to what's let me say it again George by keeping 60% of what we got here during the rest of the year.

[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:57.220]
Sure as hell's got a lot of bigger numbers that they have in certain other day parts.

[02:13:57.220 --> 02:14:01.080]
I don't want to mention any times or day parts or names Mo.

[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:09.100]
And isn't it convenient he left out the meat of that story to protect his own ass that story with a child Elmore and Palm Beach in a post.

[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:17.660]
Oh he didn't want to go into the details of course he doesn't want to go into details because he doesn't want to tell a reporter or anybody else in a guy damn world which is why he's pissed off.

[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:23.200]
He tried to get your little ass fired like an overgrown child. If you don't fire George I'm walking out and that kind of crap.

[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:29.340]
And then all of a sudden when he lost his gig with Westwood one and Q.A.M. in the doffin thing became his only.

[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.020]
Then all of a sudden he adopted a whole different tune did you notice?

[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:39.300]
Right I noticed and he hasn't listened since the 3rd of June.

[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:48.180]
Oh yeah right but gang right stop funny don't forget about that gang right not funny but he hasn't listened since you're and does anybody believe that he's listening right now.

[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:52.480]
He's got this thing cranked up so loud he can hear the president speaking in the background.

[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:56.260]
Technology technology that the prime minister and I just saw both see there you go.

[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:01.800]
Oh by the way they hate I don't know how froggy keeps staying in power here you know Critchin.

[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:17.740]
Everybody seems to hate him like poison the newspapers the letters to the editor they got billboards all over town here about Critchin just ripping him an ass about what a liar he is and his time has run out and you know and they don't trust the guy who speaks out of one corner of his mouth which means all frog's of course.

[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:33.200]
John but a cops shred Ramsey alibi new evidence found is Patsy's health fails bursting in a tear is a shattered Patsy Ramsey collapsed in front of relatives after learning newly released police evidence destroys her claims that John but a was murdered by a stranger.

[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:55.460]
The discovery by cops has made her already failing health even worse disclosed in the cider the former beauty queens downhill slide is shocking as exclusive inquire of photos reveal chemotherapy treatments for advanced liver cancer caused her color chest that brown hair to fall out and the returning stubble is tinged with gray and and stubble is you know as the word.

[02:15:55.860 --> 02:16:00.540]
Her weight is approaching 180 pounds she's ballooned up like a bull far like Jerry loses head.

[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:07.720]
While trying to get her life back on track John but a mom was recently tipped the cops are beefing up evidence against her and husband John.

[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:16.320]
Patsy exploded lashing out of police would be able to family inside her she yelled those dumb ass obese don't know what they're doing god damn it.

[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:29.440]
She seemed flabbergasted that police were still saying the Ramsey's did it family members were frightened she was going to pass out in the midst of her fiery tie raid Patsy already weakened by her ongoing life or death cancer battle completely fell apart.

[02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:37.360]
She started crying collapse the knees screaming I can't take it anymore this is crazy this is crazy will never be free of this disclose the source.

[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:50.320]
And you know who else want to be free of it who John can a emotional turmoil is extremely hard on Patsy and I witness who spotted her right before the labor day weekend told the inquire she's about 40 she's 45 but looks about 60.

[02:16:51.720 --> 02:17:00.900]
The inquire has learned that Patsy shocking breakdown is just part of a recent pattern of bizarre behavior that clearly indicates she's cracking and possibly even experiencing pangs of guilt.

[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:18.980]
See insiders and leading mental health experts we discovered that Patsy and amateur artists has been creating a series of eerie paintings and experts we consulted say the shocking surreal creations expose for the first time her highly educated state of mind in one of them Patsy painted all the people she feels about together.

[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:32.900]
So they family acquaintance not that she's paranoid or anything to understand I understand there is Steve Thomas the former a bolder detective who wrote a book accusing Patsy murdering John but they not to be confused with Stevie Thomas the hockey player who played twice with a police and then a black box.

[02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:42.140]
Tom Kobe the former Boulder police chief might came the special prosecutor failed to win indictment when he presented the case to a grand jury and other investigators who targeted the Ramsies.

[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:56.940]
In the chilling painting Patsy's villains are arrayed around her Boulder house pointing accusing the edit the inquire has learned in another startling painting Patsy has melded her husband John and herself into one person they're standing in front of a dead tree with a fire blazing behind it.

[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:07.740]
The paintings can definitely be an indication that Patsy is collapsing mentally and unconsciously expressing guilt fame Beverly Hills psychiatrist and relationship expert doctor Carol Lieberman who is not treated Patsy told the inquire.

[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:25.200]
In the first painting she has a recuses arranged in a semicircle pointing fingers at guilt the semicircle represents the news tightening around her the painting with the dead tree and fire and Patsy and John shown as one person is very telling Patsy could be revealing she feels the heated investigation closing in on her and that she and John share the guilt.

[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:36.100]
The tree itself could be her family tree which is destroyed fire also represents passion or sex and a reason the question of whether Patsy is admitting that John but he was sexually abused.

[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:43.300]
Famous psychiatrist Judy and Denson Gerber an expert in criminal matters is not treated Patsy but is convinced she's threat to the breaking point.

[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:57.440]
She's had to fight the return of the cancer she's the mother of her murdered child and her paintings now show she's obsessed with a killing doctor against the Gerber told the inquire all of these things add up to a lot of pressure and if she also knows she did it she's headed for a total mental collapse.

[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:05.540]
There you go. That's enough of that. There's more to it go out and buy the inquire okay they like it if I get you to go out and buy the and just look at the pictures for those of you who can't read.

[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:18.600]
Inquire or the globe. No that was in the inquire. Okay the other one the other one I don't get I'm confused the one on Rosie that was the globe and you got to get that to in fact this would be a good way and there's a good thing for you.

[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:28.600]
This Wednesday the eleventh instead of turning on your TV set and getting bogged out all I go here's a froggy I think Canada the country is run by women.

[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:37.460]
The governor general is a woman. The chief justice is a woman. And my wife is a woman.

[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:45.840]
There he is there's froggy for you wonder why they want to buy him probably rubbing in there and there's a lot of he's chartly he's laughing.

[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:58.780]
Anyway here's an editorial in a Boston Globe yesterday insecure airlines. It says the arrest August 29th and Sweden of a man with US flight school experience that's the one who had a pember finds address.

[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:14.780]
Okay the rest of August 29th and Sweden of a man with US flights will experience trying to carry a handgun onto the plane was just the most recent reminder that airline safety is critical year after 911 and open industrialized country like the US's full of targets for terrorists but the vulnerability of airplanes will always make them especially inviting.

[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:25.020]
Airlines concerns about passenger impatience with the late should not be allowed to interfere with thorough inspection travelers in their bags. One immediate improvement was the strengthening of cockpit doors.

[02:20:25.020 --> 02:20:34.300]
Some pilots find this inadequate or asking permission to permission to carry handguns but the airlines raise a sensible objective this while we're spending literally billions of dollars to keep dangerous weapons off aircraft.

[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:41.140]
The heads of 21 airlines wrote to senators the idea of intentionally introducing thousands of weapons in the system appears to be dangerously counterproductive.

[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:50.360]
Examination of check luggage by explosive detecting machines has improved slightly but airports say they'll have difficulty meeting the December 31 deadline for 100% compliance.

[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:59.980]
Loginary report to its credit is working to get the devices in place the failure of the federal government and the producers of machines not to ramp up production after 911 has been a signal defeat in the war against terrorism.

[02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:19.540]
The airlines now do a positive matching of bags with passengers. What is it with passengers? I know a company luggage gets on board but poorly written in the globe but only on the first legs of flights the airline's fear that bag matching would cause unacceptable delays on connecting flights although a recent trial in Chicago showed this was not the case matching should be required on all flights.

[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:40.760]
Arnold Barnett professor of operations research at MIT who specializes in airline safety sees gains since the 11 but says some improvements might be lost because of pressure from the airlines while the airlines spread over the customers they lose to rail or car travel because of security related hassles they should be more worried about the fate of their industry if we security leads to another airline hijacking or bombing.

[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:48.420]
Excellent point in yesterday's Boston Globe that's right if we have one more the parties over baby they'll all be bust.

[02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:52.260]
Am I right right now be the end.

[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:59.900]

[02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:35.260]
and

[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:36.320]
you

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:38.300]
and

[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.940]
and

[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:40.980]
and

[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:42.140]
and

[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:42.920]
and

[02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:48.680]
and

[02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:48.960]
and

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:48.960]

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:48.960]

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.120]
and

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:50.120]

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:52.120]
and

[02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:07.440]
and

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:07.440]

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:07.440]

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:07.440]

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:07.440]

[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:07.440]

[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:21.680]
the vast majority of the people who craft our border pose Norris to either country to

[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.840]
ensure that such Norris can individual are able to trap.

[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:26.320]
I'm sitting here.

[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:27.660]
I'm just, I can't restrain myself.

[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:29.020]
Were you watching this at all?

[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:29.320]
No.

[02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:32.600]
A couple of minutes ago during the middle of the break, I only wish we would have been

[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:33.220]
on the earth at the time.

[02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:36.380]
He started, what he's doing is he's doing his speech and then every now and then he'll

[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:38.920]
like repeat several sentences in French.

[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.340]
The expression fish out of water was never more appropriate because the bushmeister was

[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.520]
sitting there like off to his right.

[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:51.100]
And when he started doing the first line in French, W like reached up and scratched the

[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:51.720]
side of his head.

[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:53.420]
You know how like Greg is always doing the top of his head.

[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:56.600]
Would that same like, quizzical like, would that whimsical look on his push like,

[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:57.040]
huh?

[02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:57.900]
How you want?

[02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.160]
Fish out of water, baby.

[02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:00.580]
That's our leader.

[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:01.860]
Oi!

[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:08.200]
Erick and Justin, a hot and run and on-hung chads right, Andres Martinez in yesterday's

[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:08.820]
New York Times.

[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:13.640]
On September 11th, Al Gore told, I see I wasn't ready for this.

[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:14.860]
I wouldn't realize this was in here.

[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.540]
On September 11th, Al Gore told Oprah Winfrey under 7 million viewers that Wheaties was his

[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:20.140]
favorite cereal.

[02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:24.700]
Elsewhere in Chicago, Aubrey Harvey, Jr., 51-year-old supervisor with Argonne Bright

[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.240]
Security, who served at Chicago, well here's United Terminal, was being faded.

[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:31.480]
He'd just been named the FAA's National Screener of the Year.

[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:35.300]
No doubt happy to change the subject from the crowded terminals and delays that have made

[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:39.500]
flying such a nightmare, Jane Garvey, the agency's administrator, had offered this praise

[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:44.140]
for him three days earlier, maintaining constant vigilance while processing past years

[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:47.020]
at one of the busiest airports in the world is a tremendous achievement.

[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:51.040]
With the year 2000, the following year's award ceremony fortuitously would be moved

[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:51.560]
up to August.

[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:57.380]
On Wall Street on that last ordinary 9-11, shares of Enron touted by Fortune Magazine as

[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:01.200]
the nation's most innovative company for five straight years, closed at 86 bucks near

[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:02.100]
its all-time high.

[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:06.260]
Poll showed that Florida once thought to be in the pocket of George W. Bush was turning

[02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:07.120]
out to be a toss-up.

[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.060]
Presidential candidates hate playing defense, but when Mr. Bush arrived in Florida on

[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:14.720]
that day, he did a good job of seeming pleased to say, I plan quite a few visits here.

[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:18.920]
Meanwhile, Patrick Buchanan, the reform party candidate, was fighting just to get on the

[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:19.480]
Florida ballot.

[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:23.680]
Mr. Bush could never have imagined that the successive candidacy would wind up pinching

[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.080]
on a combination of Mr. Buchanan's success in that effort and one county's infamous butterfly-shaped

[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:30.940]
ballot so peculiar our history's narrative building blocks.

[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:35.640]
Americans were a rather self-satisfied lot in that seemingly distant fall of 2000.

[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:39.900]
We had dodged the year 2000 bullet and let's face it, the technology conserves mass plenty

[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:43.680]
of more apocalyptic millennial anxieties and appeared ready to coast through the second

[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:44.900]
consecutive American century.

[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.680]
The presidential race reflected that complacency with much of the debate, lock boxes, tax cuts,

[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.080]
new benefits and the rest of it focused on the art of managing the nation's surplus

[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:54.600]
bounty.

[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:57.960]
Foreign policy made only a token appearance on the campaign trail.

[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:02.000]
The stakes seemed so low that more than ever, the voters felt they could focus on candidates'

[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:04.140]
personalities rather than their experience.

[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.120]
Sure the stock market had fallen from its springtime highs, but most investors couldn't

[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:11.280]
imagine that they were standing on the edge of a cliff instead of in one of those buying

[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.260]
opportunity dips.

[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.680]
To that come, friends, he might have died down, but proven high growth blue chips like

[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:17.820]
Enron offered refuge.

[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.460]
The company had recently signed a 20-year deal with Blockbuster to offer movies on demand

[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:26.300]
over its broadband network and analyzed gosh that within five years telecom bandwidth

[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:29.080]
trading could generate more revenue than Enron's energy business.

[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.960]
Enron keeps inventing markets, editors at Fortune Magazine Marvel, not knowing the half

[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:34.300]
of it.

[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:39.160]
Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential Goldman Sachs strategist, was predicting that the overall

[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.780]
market would start rebounding in November.

[02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:44.960]
The mega merger between JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan announced the week of 9-11 seemed

[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:49.620]
to indicate that the party on Wall Street was far from over some 2500-anaged Ag points

[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:50.760]
later now we know better.

[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.340]
Hindsight cast a brooding sense of foreboding under that tranquil fall of 2000.

[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:59.100]
It's not unlike the ominous foreshadowing that runs through in McEwan's Mastily Portrait

[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:02.880]
of Life in a grand English manor house on the eve of World War II in Atonement, his

[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:06.260]
most recent novel, or that historians bring their accounts in the over the Carefree

[02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:09.620]
Summer vacations enjoyed by Europe's Royalty in the summer of 1914.

[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:14.480]
Americans in that fall of 2000 were poised to suffer three cataclysmic shocks over the

[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.880]
next year that would challenge their sense of invulnerability.

[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:20.980]
We were about to discover that we could be incapable of resolving a disputed presidential

[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:24.380]
election without the intervention of a court and that widespread corruption undermined

[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:25.800]
the integrity of our financial markets.

[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:29.340]
Worst of all, we would suffer the most devastating attack ever on the U.S. mainland.

[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:33.880]
Historians looking back will scratch the plastic service and mock our complacency, they'll

[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:37.460]
make much of A. Hood Baroque's downcast mood as you return home from New York on that

[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:41.280]
9-11, less than three weeks before a new Palestinian uprising, having stated that the

[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:44.240]
window of opportunity was closing on the Middle East peace process.

[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:48.500]
They'll highlight a mountain of study showing how rickety our voting equipment had become

[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.280]
and the diligent efforts of U.S. Commissioner National Security led by former senators

[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:55.540]
Gary Hart and Ward Rudman to sound an alarm about the dangers of terrorism.

[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.840]
Much tool be made and rightly so of Arthur Levit's efforts to crack down on the conflicts

[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.040]
of interest-based by auditing firms that also provide clients with consulting services.

[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.140]
Mr. Levit and the SEC chairman held public hearings in New York the week of September

[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:13.040]
11 to promote his proposal to ban such conflicts, but hardly anyone except the industry lobby

[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.180]
has paid any attention to it.

[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:17.860]
Mr. Levit was ultimately forced to accept the watering down of his proposal.

[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:20.940]
To look back is to be consumed by a sense of helplessness.

[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.220]
That September in 2000, Mohammed Ottal, ready in Florida, applied a trade in his tourist

[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:27.700]
visa for a student visa so it could take flying lessons.

[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:31.880]
Another one of the men would hijack four airliners a year later, Hanne Hanger was granted

[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:35.740]
his student visa in Saudi Arabia on September 25th so it could attend a language school

[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.380]
in California.

[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:39.060]
He made it to America but never bothered showing up at the school.

[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:44.240]
Al Qaeda was about to strike against the Kool and American naval destroyer in Yemen.

[02:29:44.700 --> 02:29:48.200]
Intelligence agencies were reported to obtain a copy of the terrorist organization's

[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.180]
chilling training manual.

[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:52.620]
It was shared with prosecutors preparing to try in New York and a court were most implicated

[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:55.220]
in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Africa.

[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:59.520]
The trial of the following spring set out in painstaking detail Al Qaeda's intentions

[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.200]
and capabilities, but few Americans paid much attention and we couldn't be bothered.

[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.140]
We were coasting for its Andre Martinez in the assidates New York Times.

[02:30:07.380 --> 02:30:09.520]
We were coasting.

[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:12.300]
Paracquist for terrorist links, Stuttgart.

[02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:15.680]
The only reason I'm using this story is because I like saying Stuttgart, stay together.

[02:30:16.100 --> 02:30:16.880]
Stuttgart, Germany.

[02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:18.500]
Stuttgart.

[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:23.340]
German investigators have failed to find any links between a pair of rest of unsuspected

[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:26.260]
planning and attack on the US Army base and the Al Qaeda terror group.

[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:30.320]
The Turkish man and his American fiancé were detained through his day near Heidelberg,

[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:33.800]
Southwest Germany, home to a US military base after a tip off from the US authorities.

[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:34.980]
How's the old Heidelberg doing?

[02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:35.460]
Still open?

[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:35.640]
Yes.

[02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:38.200]
Remember I was asking about the German restaurants?

[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:39.140]
Yes you were.

[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.040]
But very invillage and the old Heidelberg.

[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:42.940]
See how my mind is sharpened up here, eh?

[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:48.740]
If fear of the peer who had a picture of Osama Yumama bin Laden, the department were planning

[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:49.860]
a terror attack on the base.

[02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:54.820]
Police also found 287 pounds of chemicals and five pipe bombs as well as a book about

[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:58.460]
bomb making during a search of the couple's third floor apartment in small town of Waldorf.

[02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:02.780]
But German and tear minister Otto Schiele said no evidence existed that they'd been recruited

[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:05.800]
by the terror network, blamed for the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

[02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:09.540]
Based on what we know so far, we're dealing with an individual who's shown no indication

[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:11.180]
to participation in terrorist network.

[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:14.300]
It was quoted by the APS telling antenna, Bayer and Radio.

[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:18.060]
It seems we're dealing with a dangerous individual with an Islamic background.

[02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:18.880]
Oh not again.

[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:23.320]
Federal prosecutors are reviewing the evidence set in a statement.

[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:26.940]
It must be clarified whether the male suspect acted alone, whether they two acted together,

[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:30.660]
whether they planned the terror attack in Heidelberg as members of a terrorist organization.

[02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:35.900]
The pair have been named as Oman Padmetsi, 25, worked at the chemical warehouse in Carl

[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:43.840]
Schru and Astrid Azagiri, EYZAG, Azagiri, 23, who had a job at a base store.

[02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:47.840]
She would have had access to many facilities at Campbell-Verris, which is under the U.S.

[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:48.480]
U.S. U.F. headquarters.

[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.560]
The Army's fifth-correct headquarters in NATO facility.

[02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:53.560]
It's not clear how dangerous the chemicals found might have been as police didn't reveal

[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:54.120]
what kind they were.

[02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:57.980]
Why don't we just store it up like a squirrel store up nuts?

[02:31:58.980 --> 02:31:59.080]
Right.

[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:01.040]
Then everybody with a brain store up their nuts?

[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:05.820]
369 votes on a poll today, so far as the votes are pouring in here.

[02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:08.780]
How did George do filling in for Nielis Summer?

[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.580]
For whatever reason, we always get a lot of votes on this.

[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:11.200]
You know what every year?

[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:11.740]
I don't know.

[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:14.760]
Well, because you're a controversial guy, I guess.

[02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:17.460]
I don't listen when George is on.

[02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:21.200]
129, 34.9% is dropped under 35 for the first time.

[02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:22.660]
How do you like that?

[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:23.460]
I like it.

[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:25.180]
Well, of course, don't count.

[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:25.700]
You're a...

[02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:26.140]
I don't know.

[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:28.140]
Before your squirrel hatches, this is really important though.

[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:29.780]
What do you mean by that?

[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.520]
It doesn't much job hang on this?

[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:33.200]
No, it hangs out with our mole.

[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:34.000]
It has another snit.

[02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:35.660]
Oh, that's more...

[02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:35.960]
Cheswick.

[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:37.060]
I know.

[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:39.280]
Listen, when George is on 129, excellent job.

[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:39.740]
Better than ever.

[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:41.300]
105, 28.4%.

[02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:42.000]
That's pretty good.

[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:43.740]
That's a pretty good ringing endorsement, you know what?

[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:44.780]
I'll take it.

[02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:45.580]
Good.

[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:46.240]
65.

[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:47.520]
OK.

[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:47.960]
40.

[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:49.240]
So yeah, those up you got 44.

[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:51.220]
Right there is 55%.

[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:53.600]
Week 18 and fair is all the way up to 12.

[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:54.740]
So that's...

[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:56.300]
There's the result so far.

[02:32:57.100 --> 02:32:58.620]
Speaking of elections, don't forget tomorrow.

[02:32:59.040 --> 02:32:59.400]
Election day.

[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:01.740]
State County vote no on 242.

[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:02.700]
The last thing...

[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:03.660]
Forget about me being a fact.

[02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:05.520]
The last thing that State County needs is more...

[02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:06.520]
I need a bride embarrassment.

[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:10.020]
I mean, let's face it.

[02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:13.660]
And if even even Mayor Penga Pakenia is out there campaigning...

[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:14.620]
Even though he doesn't know what he's talking about.

[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:17.220]
If even he is opposed to these far-biscina...

[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:19.700]
Like this armistok, Gonzalez Rodriguez Schwartz...

[02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:20.500]
Bitch, whatever her name is.

[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:22.400]
I wish you had seen that without you.

[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:23.740]
I did too, but it made me say that.

[02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:24.320]
Oh, you know something?

[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:25.280]
Oh, no.

[02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:28.420]
I'm going to have to go into my garbage.

[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:29.040]
You want to know why?

[02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:29.240]
Why?

[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:31.860]
I'll do it there in the break because on the back...

[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:34.020]
You know how sometimes there are good stories on the back of both pages.

[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.520]
On the back of the Rosie's story, there was a thing about O'Donohue.

[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:37.860]
O'Donohue.

[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:38.240]
Uh-huh.

[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:38.800]
Rose O'Donohue.

[02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:42.240]
And the fact that there ain't nobody watching the show and he's in great jeopardy.

[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:43.020]
And he's so desperate.

[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:46.000]
He wants to get Michael Jackson on with him.

[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:47.280]
And this one, that please don't.

[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:48.280]
Please...

[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:48.740]
He's desperate.

[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:50.720]
Desperate.

[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:51.680]
It's not about you.

[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:53.020]
It's not about you.

[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:53.400]
You want?

[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:55.660]
It's not a bad show the times I remember watching.

[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:57.520]
Uh...

[02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:58.160]
I don't know.

[02:33:58.380 --> 02:33:58.660]
I like to play.

[02:33:59.000 --> 02:33:59.920]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:01.060]
It's certainly no Bill O'Reilly.

[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.220]
It sure doesn't beat that one out of that.

[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:06.040]
Unfortunately, Bill O'Reilly is beating the crap out of him because there's a lot of right-wing assholes out there.

[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:08.200]
And a lot of very naive people who are buying the showbiz thing.

[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:09.140]
Who think it's a real show?

[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:09.760]
Right.

[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:14.120]
Who thinks that O'Reilly actually is a person of substance and is opposed to just a psychotic ego.

[02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:16.980]
Who makes it up as he goes along and never has any facts to write?

[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:18.540]
Hey, forget about that.

[02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:19.360]
Yeah, we don't care about that.

[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.120]
See, because basically that's what it boils down to.

[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:22.940]
Most people don't care about the substance.

[02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:24.620]
They only care about the style.

[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:26.320]
You know, that line sell the sizzle?

[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:26.800]
Right.

[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.320]
Well, that's what it's all about.

[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:31.480]
And he gets on there and he pontificates any interrupts.

[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.420]
And oh, they'll confuse me with the fact that now you're wrong.

[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:33.800]
You're...

[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:35.080]
You know, because it's all about him.

[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:38.640]
And there are a lot of schmucks out there who like Fox News because they like the...

[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:38.940]
...F...

[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:39.500]
...F...

[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:39.520]

[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.080]
...F...

[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:48.700]
...

[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:48.760]
...

[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:48.840]
...

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.840]

[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:48.880]
...

[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:48.880]

[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.220]
How?

[02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:09.520]
How?

[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:09.600]
Are you?

[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:09.800]
The Wheel lí Sister isатель Could it be?

[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.060]
What do you say?

[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:10.060]

[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:11.400]
in classics, I'll tell you what.

[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.380]
Oh, driving classics and how about we throw a screen in there too?

[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:18.800]
Oh, please, can't have it.

[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:23.640]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 WQM, here's something you can have, a great new mattress.

[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.360]

[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:30.460]
day of your life, you feel like crap, you're tossing, you're turning, you're back, especially,

[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:31.420]
we'll tell you the message.

[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:32.760]
Get me a new mattress.

[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:36.340]
And if you want to get a great new mattress, the unbeatable deal is dial a mattress.

[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:38.480]

And of course, you know, you get a new mattress, it lasts you for a long time, but they don't

[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:43.340]
last forever, even the best mattress in the world.

And that 30 day in-home comfort trial, which is so important because instead of having

[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:24.260]
to sleep on a guy with a plastic, I don't mean sleep.

[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:26.180]

[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:31.740]
chesswork

[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.720]
we're talking the biggest names in show business section politics people like

[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:37.520]
michael jackson

[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.260]
and in a cool smith and bill clinton says an industry source

[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:42.240]
to help with his liberal philosophical talk

[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:45.660]
film those he needs to put a spark into his show he's got a secret plan to do

[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:46.040]

[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:47.860]
and he better do it fast

[02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:51.460]
fewer than a hundred thirty six thousand people nationwide

[02:41:51.460 --> 02:41:55.460]
tuned in to see the former talk show kings new msnbc get best on a new

[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:58.360]
that translates into a pathetic

[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:00.660]
point one the elson rating

[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:03.500]
that's a kind of waiting we had on whammy

[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:05.120]
and we're that actually

[02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:09.580]
so yeah but this is nationwide nearly as low as you can get

[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:13.640]
by comparison donna who's arch rival bill or riley don't confuse me with the

[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:14.280]
facts are highly

[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:17.780]
grab one point one million viewers during the same time period on fox news

[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:20.260]
so one point one million against hundred thirty six thousand

[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.140]
fills not going to sit by what someone like a riley thump of notes the

[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:24.380]

[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:27.800]
but he realizes he needs a little help at this point yeah more than a little

[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:30.840]
he knows he needs to make a big splash to get noticed again

[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.980]
and he's got a lot of surprises in store

[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:37.140]

the film donna he shows him went into syndication floors for nearly three

[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:44.040]
decades

[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.140]
ending its run in nineteen ninety six

[02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:49.600]
but after the six year hiatus he now finding regain a foothold in the

[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:50.740]
form and he practically invented

[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:55.000]
fill his desperate says another tv insider he can't last long with his ratings

[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:55.700]
in the toilet

but the guys the legend who feels he can pull things out when it out pull it

[02:42:59.380 --> 02:42:59.580]
out

[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:02.260]
he's scrambling to call in some favors and will come up with big controversial

[02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:03.660]
names who will walk in viewers

[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.440]
but he better act fast because he be exact so even shorter on patients than

[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:10.240]
fill is on viewers there's no telling how much time he's got left

[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:11.640]
on the air

[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:13.200]

time because they don't care about canada but

[02:43:36.980 --> 02:43:39.520]

[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:43.100]
canadians have this inferiority complex and they just can't they not only can't

[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:45.380]

[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:07.080]
because you might get a taste of home with sexual violence.

[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:10.720]
We don't play your butt's much harder like a dog in a stair drawer.

[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:11.760]
Don't keep your mouth shut.

[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:14.740]
But when you see us with our Ray Bans bomb, we're just fine in the park.

[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:16.280]
And we want to get our hands on.

[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:20.220]
We're the F.A.G.

[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:21.000]
That's her.

[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:23.200]
Ooh, we don't have a traitor.

[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.100]
Don't you forget it.

[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:28.220]
We're the F.A.G.

[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:30.500]
Really all the hardest swallows.

[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:32.580]
We just are taking family.

[02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:34.840]
Let me see you just prance with me.

[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:35.960]
Just prance with me.

[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:36.800]
Now slide.

[02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:38.160]
Ooh, right there.

[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:40.700]
Let me see you do some white bandage.

[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:41.820]
Oh, perfect.

[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:43.020]
I make wrist limbs.

[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:43.840]

[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:45.940]
F.A.G.

[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:47.340]
That's it, baby.

[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:48.040]
Just ugh.

[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:49.860]
Whoa.

[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:51.700]
Now look what you went and did.

[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:53.200]
Ugh, I got a white dissolve.

[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:56.440]
Oh, jeez, this is everywhere.

[02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:57.620]
Let go.

[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:01.200]
Does anybody have a moist towel?

[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:03.860]
F.A.G.

[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:04.780]
Okay, look.

[02:49:04.940 --> 02:49:05.860]
Come to the crowd.

[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:08.920]
You're no duty garland.

[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:14.980]
So anyway, here's a facsimjo in Miami who says rumor has it that Fred Phelps will be in town tomorrow to pick it.

[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:16.100]
Hallelujah and pass the offering.

[02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:17.060]
But you know Fred Phelps?

[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:18.020]
Yeah, I know who that is.

[02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:20.800]
That crazy bastard from Kansas, the Reverend Fred Phelps.

[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:22.020]
Of course, homophobic people.

[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:25.380]
The funerals of AIDS people and all this stuff.

[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:27.740]
Homophobic champion of the universe.

[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:29.080]
Fred Phelps.

[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:30.020]
He'll be in town tomorrow.

[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:35.580]
And by the way, just because the poll in the Herald says it's this or it's that, let me point out again.

[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:36.240]
Right.

[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.420]
Back in 77 because I lived through it.

[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:40.160]
The referendum, the polls were all even Steven.

[02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:41.120]
And it got trounced.

[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:42.800]
So don't get too cocky if I can say that.

[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:43.380]
Can I say that?

[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:43.600]
No.

[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:44.580]
All you fags out there.

[02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:45.660]
Don't get too cocky.

[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:46.220]
Better go out and vote.

[02:49:46.380 --> 02:49:47.600]
Two, three, four times a piece tomorrow.

[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:48.540]
Just to make sure.

[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:55.560]
Anyway, here's one from Julia in Miami who said that you check out QD Pie, Hunk David Carr, quarterback of Houston Texas.

[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:56.540]
I certainly did.

[02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:57.340]
Julia?

[02:49:57.880 --> 02:49:58.480]
Excellent choice.

[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:00.420]
Way cuter, better cuter than Brady.

[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:04.740]
She says, I'm sorry, but you were doing real well until you get to that point.

[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:09.640]
See, David Carr is, he's pretty damn good, but his nose is like, like he ran into a wall or something.

[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.480]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:14.160]
I know you guys have like a flat, mushed down like a puddle.

[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:17.740]
A little bit, not real bad, but a little, uh, he's no Tom Brady.

[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:18.480]
He's okay though.

[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:19.660]
Believe me.

[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:21.880]
Tonight you get to see Tom Brady.

[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:23.220]
Stark naked on ABC.

[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:28.420]
By the way, I'd like to point out that L Michaels, who was on and how he was yucking it up.

[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:30.980]
With Mo Cheswick this morning, yucking and yucking and yucking.

[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:37.400]
Guess who's one of, uh, L Michaels close to buddies and co-workers for many, many years on ABC when they were doing throwback racing?

[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:40.040]
Okay.

[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:42.300]
That we talked to, uh, three times a year.

[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:42.960]
Dave Johnson.

[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:44.120]
Right. There you go.

[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:45.400]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:46.480]
Oh, is he one of yours?

[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:49.380]
Speaking of Donnie, who would says read this, dammit.

[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:51.540]
This was a really good show with mutual information about Jeb.

[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:53.960]
And I don't know what they want me to read because that's all I got.

[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:54.800]
That's all you facts me.

[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:56.020]
Is there more to it?

[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:56.860]
No, that was it.

[02:50:57.460 --> 02:50:58.540]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:50:58.740 --> 02:50:58.980]
I don't know.

[02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:01.300]
Speaking of Donnie, you read this, dammit.

[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:03.460]
This was a really good show with mutual information about...

[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:07.120]
Oh, that transcript thing that I really, I didn't mean to send you the first page of that.

[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:09.100]
Oh, it's another way to do more.

[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:09.220]
It's another way to do more.

[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:11.040]
Well, the fact that you can sift through it.

[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:11.680]
Okay.

[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:12.720]
Oh, and that's a long thing?

[02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:13.600]
Yeah, it's a long thing.

[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:14.340]
How many pages?

[02:51:14.780 --> 02:51:15.020]
Five.

[02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:15.840]
Ah!

[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:17.640]
Save it for a little later.

[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:18.260]
Save it for tomorrow.

[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:21.040]
I don't have time to embark on something like that right now.

[02:51:21.060 --> 02:51:22.080]
And it kind of cut off in places.

[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:24.560]
Well, like I said, look, take a look at it.

[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:27.420]
Because this is much more important, speaking of the election tomorrow,

[02:51:27.860 --> 02:51:31.940]
what bushes aren't, McBride is, writes Dan Muffet in the Palm Beach Post, which, like I said,

[02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:35.380]
got some pretty good news and editorial things, but this fourth section blows always.

[02:51:37.180 --> 02:51:40.920]
He says, eight years of Bill and Hillary gave the nation a bad case of Clinton fatigue.

[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:43.740]
Now, the first symptoms of bush fatigue can be detected.

[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:47.260]
Do you know that even Kathy Willett suffered from bush fatigue after a few years?

[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:48.520]
Is that what she shaved it off?

[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:49.100]
Yes.

[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:52.620]
It says, how else to explain the rise of Bill McBride?

[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:57.900]
In the span of several weeks, Mr. McBride has made the improbable transition from obscure, long-shot candidate

[02:51:57.900 --> 02:52:02.160]
for governor to surging campaigner who draws hyperbole from across the state and across the country.

[02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:06.860]
US representative Robert Weissler, Democratic Del Rey Beach, went so far this week as to call him,

[02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:08.540]
the future of the Democratic Party.

[02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:14.860]
Analysts now say that if he can defeat Janet Reno in tomorrow's primary, it will mark the greatest upset and floored a political history.

[02:52:15.420 --> 02:52:20.140]
Mr. McBride's name, which was a little known outside Hillsborough County a month ago, now appears in front page headlines

[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:21.240]
and leads the evening news.

[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:28.860]
The White House is concerned that a loss in Florida's gubernatorial race could be interpreted as a test of the president's prospects for winning reelection in 2004,

[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:32.760]
the Boston Globe set in a recent article about Republican ads targeting Mr. McBride.

[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:41.160]
In probable ascension such as this are creatures of timing and context, Mr. McBride is a 57-year-old newcomer who has come to the right place at the right time.

[02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:48.120]
With bush fatigue palpable, both in Tallahassee and in Washington, Mr. McBride offers an allure that is largely biographical.

[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:56.400]
Next to nothing about Mr. McBride's background resembles that of Jebs or W's, the stark contrast of his life's threat with other than bushes has captured the effect of Democrats.

[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:58.660]
They relate at an organic level.

[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:05.980]
They see him as a good counter to which bush he and evil inherit virtue for every intrinsic flaw, a McBride yin for every bush yang.

[02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:08.580]
In Bill McBride they believe they found their anti-bush.

[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:10.260]
It begins with origins.

[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:17.280]
Mr. McBride grew up North West of Orlando in Leesburg, son of an Air Force vet, who went through electronics school on the GI Bill and fixed TVs for a living.

[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:26.300]
Governor Bush and President George W are products of Connecticut affluence groomed for public office from an early age and transplanted into popular states to extend a political dynasty.

[02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:34.540]
Mr. McBride attended public schools and through a, the way he found that football, player and exceptional students, worked his way through the University of Florida, waiting on hotel tables.

[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:39.860]
The bush's attended private schools, though Jeb went to the University of Texas and never worried about paying the next tuition bill.

[02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:50.500]
When the Vietnam War came, Mr. McBride left law school and volunteered for the Marines. He became an infantry leader, graduated first in the class from the Army Ranger School and in Vietnam, he earned the bronze star for valor.

[02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:52.860]
The bush has spent the war years protecting Texas.

[02:53:53.780 --> 02:53:57.800]
When Mr. McBride left the service and returned to Florida, no empty desk in the family business was waiting.

[02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:02.760]
There was no family fortune to spend on drilling oil wells, no family connections to a career in real estate.

[02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:06.340]
Mr. McBride worked his way up at Holland at night, rising the managing partner.

[02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:14.700]
When it came time for Mr. McBride to marry, he found an independent professional woman with a career at least equal of his own, Alex Sink, the former president of Bank of America, Florida.

[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:18.120]
They sent their kids to public school and became locally renowned for specific activism.

[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:23.400]
There was a folklore about him that's distinctly Floridian and impossible to invent or import from other places.

[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:28.220]
When he was 10, he cut his hand with a machete, yet played that night in a little league all-star game for Leesburg.

[02:54:28.580 --> 02:54:31.340]
He homeworked and ran the bases, bleeding as he crossed the plate.

[02:54:31.740 --> 02:54:38.860]
As they're running back for Leesburg High School yellow jackets, Mr. McBride earned the nickname Carabou for his 6.3 frame and bruising inside runs.

[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:42.280]
Florida coach Ray Graves caused us during the town of 15,000 residents.

[02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:46.320]
When he showed up at McBride's house to recruit him, Mr. McBride's gear career ended quickly.

[02:54:46.540 --> 02:54:51.460]
However, when he tore up his knee during one of those first practices, he could have kept his football scholarship and elected to give it back.

[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.820]
Coach Graves said the freshman told him that because he couldn't contribute, it wasn't right to keep it.

[02:54:55.820 --> 02:55:04.780]
All the qualities that die-hard Democrats find offensive about the Bushes that privilege the sanctum only, the faux service, the success by endowment, the bravery bright by proxy,

[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:08.080]
are reflected in opposite to Mr. McBride, a self-made Floridian.

[02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:10.560]
Biography matters in this race for governor.

[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:14.320]
Bill McBride is the anti-Bush that Republicans have reason to fear.

[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:15.660]
How do you like that?

[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:18.620]
Says Dan Moffat in Fridays of Palm Beach Post.

[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:20.760]
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:22.020]
How do you like them, apples, huh?

[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:22.900]
I had no idea.

[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:25.640]
Well, you know, a bit more about Bill McBride.

[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:28.280]
Now that you're going to like Go out and vote for him 20 or 30 times tomorrow.

[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.060]
I mean, Janet, like I said, he's a good guy, but, you know, let's not...

[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:34.640]
Seriously, let's not get carried away.

[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:36.900]
She couldn't win a one-horse race.

[02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:37.900]
And just...

[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:39.620]
I am all.

[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:42.160]
This is 420 of bikes to keep.

[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:43.420]
2 way out.

[02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:48.220]

We'll see you Thursday starting at 5 for the best happy hour party in town exclusively at Treasure Rylan.

[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.720]
Push, free to move!

[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.400]
Don't like all the Harper.

[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:08.640]
Don't stop, don't ever.

[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:10.860]
Time I feed.

[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:13.980]
Don't stop, don't stop.

[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.820]
That free tart it's in which.

[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:19.700]
Don't stop, don't stop.

[02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.860]
My TV.

[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:25.280]
Please, President's got s***.

[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:30.660]
Republigate muscle in and in articulate idiot.

[02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:37.080]
I don't know why they wanted me on, but now he's here.

[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:39.840]
Here's proof the neck for you.

[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:42.020]
With President's thumbs s***.

[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:51.840]
Oh, what I get to is tell both of us both.

[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:56.480]
And get to your voted poll.

[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:01.840]
Oh, why did you want this?

[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:08.360]
Don't stop, don't let drummers stupid me.

[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:13.000]
Don't stop, don't find this drunk and rich kid.

[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:18.340]
Don't stop, he's living, numbering me.

[02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:21.380]
Please, President's thumbs s***.

[02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:24.320]
You don't care what it's all.

[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:28.200]
You got a man by a truck truck with a Christian.

[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:30.120]
I know what's better.

[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.060]
You and I have a hell no fear.

[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:35.700]
We've got a great leader here.

[02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:38.160]
With President's thumbs s***.

[02:58:43.100 --> 02:58:47.440]
I'm 301 thinkin' what when he starts fracturing the sky of his head when it's froggy.

[02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:49.060]
His pretzels started talkin' in French.

[02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:50.400]
And you just had to see it.

[02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:53.980]
And you look at that and said, oh man, this is scary.

[02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:57.120]
In fact, I see so many similarities between him and somebody else.

[02:58:57.520 --> 02:58:58.100]
You know who that is?

[02:58:58.220 --> 02:58:58.320]
No.

[02:58:58.880 --> 02:58:59.900]
Let me give you one clue.

[02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:00.500]
Great.

[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:01.120]
Yeah.

[02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:03.580]
I think it could be the same person.

[02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:04.680]
Have you ever seen it two of them together?

[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:05.440]
No, no.

[02:59:06.420 --> 02:59:07.100]
Look at this.

[02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:09.860]
George is like really peeling into that thing now.

[02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:10.700]
You're looking at it?

[02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:11.680]
No, there it is.

[02:59:12.160 --> 02:59:14.440]
How did George do in filling in for Neal this summer?

[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:15.720]
Less than a turd.

[02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:18.040]
You were like hurtin' earlier.

[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:19.640]
440 people.

[02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:21.080]
Now that you mentioned it, they'll come back.

[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:22.280]
No they won't.

[02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:23.540]
446 vote.

[02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:25.680]
Well, I mean, I gotta give the thing.

[02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:26.380]
Go ahead.

[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:27.260]
What do you want me to do?

[02:59:27.460 --> 02:59:28.340]
Just to not talk about it?

[02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:29.280]
Mm-mm.

[02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:32.520]
Four hundred and forty-six votes.

[02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:34.720]
I don't listen when George is on 147.

[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:38.120]
32.9% sliding a hair under a third.

[02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:39.760]
Excellent job.

[02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:40.280]
Better than ever.

[02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:41.720]
146.32.7%.

[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:42.940]
Look at that.

[02:59:43.100 --> 02:59:44.100]
I didn't even realize that.

[02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:46.460]
Almost even Stephen.

[02:59:47.500 --> 02:59:47.680]
Good.

[02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:48.340]
75.

[02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:48.920]
Okay.

[02:59:49.180 --> 02:59:49.580]
44.

[02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:50.880]
Uh-huh.

[02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:53.220]
Week 21 and fair 13.

[02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:57.060]
I'm, you know, I made a list here, speaking of President

[02:59:57.060 --> 02:59:57.520]
Dumpishman.

[02:59:57.640 --> 02:59:59.740]
I made a list of why we went up with presidents like that.

[03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:00.520]
Okay.

[03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:02.200]
Since 1972.

[03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:05.120]
Now, Humphrey of course ran in 68 and he lost because he didn't,

[03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:06.680]
you know, he didn't disavow via NAMATIL.

[03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:08.060]
It was too late, you know, but LBJ.

[03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:12.340]
But the government in 72, Jimmy Carter in 76,

[03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:14.200]
actually won, which was shocking.

[03:00:15.060 --> 03:00:18.760]
Walter Mondale, Michael DuCaca and Al Gore.

[03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:20.800]
So if you take Bubba out of there in the two terms that he won,

[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:21.900]
uh, that's what.

[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:22.840]
There's the answer for you.

[03:00:23.980 --> 03:00:26.400]
What a, what a group of listless,

[03:00:26.780 --> 03:00:28.640]
come, the whole group combined.

[03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:30.840]
I got the personality of Joe Zagaki on a bad day.

[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:32.760]
Pathetic.

[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:36.720]
New terror threat to US question mark as CBS news.

[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.020]
US intelligence and law enforcement agencies have detected increased chatter

[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:42.940]
or communications between known out-cut operatives.

[03:00:43.340 --> 03:00:45.860]
Senior officials have told CBS news correspondent Jim Stewart.

[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:48.760]
The official described video chatter is terrorist,

[03:00:48.820 --> 03:00:50.200]
electronic and internet intercept.

[03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:52.940]
Some of which are in the form of morale booster messages like

[03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:54.900]
state tune, good news is on the way.

[03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:57.060]
Some suggest targets in the United States,

[03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:58.080]
others say overseas.

[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:01.100]
Much of the increased chatter is taking place in Afghanistan.

[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:04.040]
It began to spike in volume earlier this week.

[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.540]
They suggest an impending attack against the West

[03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:07.980]
and it's allies both in American overseas,

[03:01:07.980 --> 03:01:09.900]
but contain no specifics as usual.

[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:13.000]
It may possibly be related to the September 9th anniversary of the

[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.520]
assassination of Afghanistan of a Northern Alliance leader,

[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:16.900]
which is like today.

[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.680]
The threat is non-specific and official say the increased communications is less intense

[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:24.620]
than a spike that occurred around July 4th, but it's still intense.

[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:29.460]
It is similar, but not quite as serious as the chatter picked up around last July 4th said one official.

[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:31.620]
It was enough, however, with the four-day Pentagon,

[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.340]
to immediately resume 24-hour-deck combat air patrol over Washington and New York,

[03:01:35.340 --> 03:01:38.600]
something they hadn't planned on doing until next this week's Wednesday.

[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:43.520]
This, the technicals caused US officials to resume combat air patrol for an indefinite period,

[03:01:43.700 --> 03:01:44.180]
as well.

[03:01:44.540 --> 03:01:47.020]
The US Embassy in Kabul has been buttoned up.

[03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:53.880]
And of course, we know that they keep reminding us that the messages we intercepted last year on 9-10.

[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:54.940]
Yeah.

[03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:57.680]
About tomorrow is like D-Day and tomorrow is Yadi Yadi.

[03:01:57.820 --> 03:02:01.840]
There were like two separate messages, but they weren't decoded until 9-12 that they after.

[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:06.320]
And you want to know one of the reasons they had difficulty decoding them?

[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:07.000]
I give up. Why?

[03:02:07.380 --> 03:02:08.660]
Not enough Arabic speakers.

[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.720]
Now, wouldn't you think if this country forget about which administration, because they're all guilty,

[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:18.820]
wouldn't you think that if we were serious about combating terrorism, every terrorist group on the list,

[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:21.560]
I'm talking it not domestic, you know, the skinheads, I'm not talking about them,

[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.080]
international terrorist group, almost every single one of them is from some Arabic country, okay?

[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:30.580]
And wouldn't you think that if we were serious about fighting terrorism that maybe,

[03:02:31.020 --> 03:02:33.900]
just maybe we would have recruited more people to speak fluent Arabic?

[03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:35.120]
No, you're just being silly.

[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:39.200]
And if we're like working on decoding those messages, doesn't it help if we understand what they mean?

[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:41.540]
Well, I mean, no, I realize I'm getting radical now.

[03:02:42.260 --> 03:02:42.960]
I'm getting carried away.

[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.180]
You're right, it's back up to 33.1%.

[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:48.780]
I won't mention it again until the end of the show.

[03:02:50.060 --> 03:02:55.540]
It's coming up on 10 before 1 at 5.60, WDQ, and we got the hysterical out of me, wow.

[03:02:55.940 --> 03:02:58.940]
I'm sure he'll remind you that they beat up on a little girls' team yesterday.

[03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:00.380]
They'll get too carried away.

[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:03.560]
And of course, the idea of having a game in the middle of a Jew holiday,

[03:03:04.060 --> 03:03:05.660]
and then playing a little girls' team for the opening,

[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:08.660]
that's why they couldn't sell it out, and the channel was a channel seven Fox,

[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:11.040]
had a bite their main tickets to get on on TV,

[03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:14.180]
another embarrassment for South Florida, but that'll teach them, I guess.

[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:16.940]
I'll tell you guys, I can teach you a lot about life,

[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:19.520]
and that's my good friend Tom Lehman, that at Halibh Pani, at GMC.

[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:21.840]
They're doing it again, that's what Bob Eisenberg tells me.

[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:24.960]
0% financing is continuing right as I speak.

[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:28.840]
Get yourself 0% financing up to 60 months with approved credit from GMAC,

[03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:30.320]
or it's your choice.

[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:32.580]
Take up to $4,000 rebate.

[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:35.880]
We're on select 2002 Paniacs, or GMC models in stock.

[03:03:36.060 --> 03:03:37.960]
You can't beat the deals at Halibh with a stick,

[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:41.120]
and why do they be sure to take a look at the line?

[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:45.080]
A complete line of GMC gas guzzling SUVs, including the Onvoi,

[03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:46.840]
voted by Motor Trends SUV, the Earpluss,

[03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:50.120]
see the all-new Paniac vibe SUV, it's got the power of a sports car,

[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:53.180]
and probably guzzled gas like crazy, just like your SUV.

[03:03:54.500 --> 03:03:54.740]
Yeah.

[03:03:55.260 --> 03:03:58.060]
You know, my microvec gets like on a highway 25, 26 miles,

[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:00.160]
around town, around 20, but they don't sell

[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:01.680]
Crovettes at Halibh Paniac.

[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:04.120]
Halibh also has a dependent selection of pre-owned cars,

[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:06.300]
trucks and sport utility vehicles, that you can depend on.

[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:09.180]
No lemons on that lot, and if some other schmuck turned it on for credit

[03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:11.800]
and the car business, have no fear because Halibh is here,

[03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:13.920]
and Tom Lehman and the folks down there will cut you into the

[03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:16.000]
luggage you know a new car, or use car or something.

[03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:19.160]
So for a great deal on Paniacs and GMC, this is the place,

[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:21.120]
Halibh Paniac GMC where they'll treat your right,

[03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:23.960]
and they've been doing good deals for folks for over 35 years,

[03:04:24.260 --> 03:04:25.300]
and that's saying great location.

[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:28.500]
134-01 South Dixie Highway, that's US-1 across from the falls,

[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:31.880]
open every day, seven days a week, Halibh Paniac GMC,

[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:33.940]
we are professional grades.

[03:04:34.260 --> 03:04:39.700]
My line in local, we are sports radio 560s, you ain't, you ain't.

[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:41.460]
You ain't.

[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:42.800]
Young is too young.

[03:04:43.140 --> 03:04:47.120]
The mad dog is out of control, and you'll find out why.

[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:50.660]
When you hear the latest release from Blackpuster Entertainment,

[03:04:51.140 --> 03:04:53.520]
Jim Mandage sings duet.

[03:04:53.860 --> 03:04:55.240]
Well, alright!

[03:04:56.820 --> 03:04:59.260]
Run around in the feet, Ralph.

[03:05:00.060 --> 03:05:00.840]
Alright!

[03:05:01.980 --> 03:05:03.200]
Here's the mad dog.

[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:06.600]
Jim Mandage sings classic rock.

[03:05:08.120 --> 03:05:09.080]
Alright!

[03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:12.280]
Oh!

[03:05:12.520 --> 03:05:12.900]
Alright!

[03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:16.040]
Alright!

[03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:20.020]
This is our right!

[03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:22.900]
Oh!

[03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:23.380]
Oh!

[03:05:23.820 --> 03:05:24.620]
It's right!

[03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:30.320]
The mad G-San.

[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:31.060]
Oh!

[03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:32.020]
I'm going to play for me.

[03:05:32.260 --> 03:05:35.060]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:40.440]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:40.800 --> 03:05:44.880]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:46.280]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:47.420]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:48.480]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:48.480 --> 03:05:48.500]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:48.960]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:49.560]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:50.600]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:53.020]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:53.200 --> 03:05:55.640]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:55.820 --> 03:05:56.660]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:05:59.240 --> 03:06:01.040]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:06.900 --> 03:06:11.660]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:12.580 --> 03:06:12.640]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:12.640 --> 03:06:12.660]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:12.660 --> 03:06:14.780]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:14.900 --> 03:06:21.720]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:21.720 --> 03:06:22.720]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:23.820]
I'm going to play for you.

[03:06:23.820 --> 03:06:23.820]

[03:06:23.820 --> 03:06:23.820]

[03:06:23.820 --> 03:06:30.040]
She went all low.

[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:30.040]

[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:30.300]

[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:30.300]

[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:30.780]
She went all low.

[03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:30.780]

[03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:35.240]
60 he'll be along in just a couple minutes after the sports update we don't have like news at the top of the hour

[03:06:35.240 --> 03:06:41.120]
We don't believe in news on this station. The only news that's worth hearing about is sports news like the U of M beat up on another

[03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:45.760]
Marginal school over weekend by 100 points and the dolphins beat up on little girls team by 200 points yesterday

[03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:50.360]
Let's hear it. Oh, because I'm sure that everybody in South Florida feels better about themselves now

[03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:54.360]
And then of course we want to get the screw this morning. I come in. There's no audio feed

[03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:59.020]
Did you guys see clearance at all? I saw him well, did you pass along the message?

[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:01.960]
I mentioned it to us. We got these guy Dan football games every weekend

[03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:05.480]
Everybody has to dick around with his dick around and I want to get in dick, okay?

[03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:09.640]
Which quite frankly on a Monday morning that early. I'm not too crazy about getting dick

[03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:14.060]
Anyway, speaking of that the whole country is getting dick because it all blood the blood stem cells

[03:07:14.060 --> 03:07:18.020]
We're unable to transform into other types of tissue cells in a Stanford University study

[03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:21.500]
Raising new doubts about the eventual value of the cells in the treatment of disease

[03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:25.760]
The findings supports the view that embryonic stem cells not adults themselves

[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:29.140]
All for the most promise for treating conditions such as heart disease

[03:07:29.140 --> 03:07:33.320]
Spinal injury thigh-abetes and Parkinson's disease some researchers say

[03:07:33.320 --> 03:07:36.460]
But many people including president George W. Bush

[03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:42.000]
Opposed using human embryonic stem cells in medical research because it involves the death of an embryo

[03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:47.580]
The Stanford researchers attended to race the evolution of blood stem cells after placing them singly into mice

[03:07:47.580 --> 03:07:52.880]
Whose bone mirror had been destroyed the hope was that the study would show how a single blood-making cell would grow into millions of cells

[03:07:52.880 --> 03:07:59.280]
Including perhaps cells of another tissue to the body instead said Amy Wagers first author of the study appearing this week in the journal

[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:02.140]
Science the group found that blood stem cells replenished the bone mirror

[03:08:02.140 --> 03:08:04.820]
But made almost no other types of tissue cells

[03:08:04.820 --> 03:08:09.400]
Wage you said the study strongly suggests that blood stem cells make only one thing blood

[03:08:09.400 --> 03:08:16.740]
Making skin neurons muscle or liver cells as some researchers have reported from such stem cells is an extremely rare event

[03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:18.700]
That probably would not be useful in the treatment of disease

[03:08:18.700 --> 03:08:24.880]
So once again embryonic stem cells are what we need and those of you with diabetes like me or Parkinson's or other diseases

[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:30.100]
We have to wait until we have somebody in there who isn't like in the pocket of all those good right wing Christians

[03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:34.540]
Oh, that's right. I forgot we have this bias against Christians in the meeting now. That's what governor

[03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:35.940]
That's right. Thank you

[03:08:35.940 --> 03:08:38.480]
That's right me and all the other people would have brain

[03:08:39.180 --> 03:08:40.440]
Who don't want your anyway?

[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:48.680]
Here's the final total before we leave today because this is a very important poll today the future of the show depends on it doesn't it?

[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:54.520]
How come it is pulled no done and all depends on whether a mole wants in chess with gets all been out of shape again

[03:08:55.180 --> 03:08:59.300]
Maybe he'll call up Charles Zomber and like giving the rest of that story. What do you think no chance?

[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:04.780]
Because even he would be too embarrassed to admit that the whole snip was about him trying to get you fired over a bunch of silly

[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:07.460]
Childish emails even more would be too embarrassed for that

[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:13.340]
But don't forget I'm bad and the mad dogs bads him for his bad westwood one they're bad their classes

[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:18.720]
And it's the whole world against Mocha's way, baby. He want his that whatever it is he wants what is he want?

[03:09:20.020 --> 03:09:25.200]
473 votes on a pool. How does a George how did George do filling in for Neil this summer? How do we be doing?

[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:29.240]
I don't listen when George is not 161 back to 34% I think you're right

[03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:34.100]
Excellence job better than ever 153 just changing again good

[03:09:35.080 --> 03:09:41.020]
76 okay 46 week 23 and fair 14 mad dog by the way give you very high marks. I love him

[03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:45.800]
Huh? No, seriously when I was down there he came in and there went out of his way to say I tell you one thing

[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:49.960]
But George did a sensational job this summer man. Oh man does he give good head?

[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:04.500]
We will return to regular programming momentarily on wqam.com until then here's the best of sports radio

[03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:09.960]
560 qam is Bobby Bethard during the hammer Hank Goldberg on Monday August 5th

[03:10:10.420 --> 03:10:15.780]
Great to get a chance to talk with you and it's great that you're back in football. How are you doing? Hank I'm fine
