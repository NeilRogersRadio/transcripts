[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540]
Yeah

[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.080]
Should we just hit it?

[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.800]
Wait, wait a minute. Where's the promo? Where's the ID? Where's the ID? Where's the promo? Where's the beef man? Where's the something guilty?

[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.380]
The hell is turning like Mojoon?

[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.220]
The Elijah show is next. That's what was supposed to hear there, buddy. You little swerp

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.420]
Ask you what what was that?

[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.140]
What was the new one on me? He just got up and walked out

[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.000]
Maybe they didn't know that they were supposed to fire an ID off after that. I

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.380]
Stick mother fucker. Put one in my socks is nice. They smell like your sister's crotch in the morning

[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.840]
What's what happens when you get the guy then?

[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.080]
I'm moving away Zach push down a goddamn fool already, friends. Oh

[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.180]
Fuck a yellow key so far apart

[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.820]
Oh

[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.120]

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.200]
Now you shine their shoes under Lisa

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.840]
All the way you watch and talk the white is cause

[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.180]
George it's junior say he trust you under Lisa

[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.380]
Who tell our allies of the greedy oil wall

[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.120]
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms

[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.660]
The cup of seats the toilet and then scrub the floor

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.560]
They tell you don't wear sandals

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.820]
God don't leave no

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.720]
Your coach told him make them wall of wretch and you

[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.380]
You're not being like a mitches like it beveled through

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.460]
If you'll be what you can be that don't get through

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.340]
One day while you be flippin' in fact gay you may realize

[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.020]
That they're creating you just like your esterone

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.660]
That's when your head will move from side to side

[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.960]
Drone to Lisa

[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.740]
It's your bush and rummage

[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.440]
They be cracked or as old

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.820]
Yeah I was pretty awake there guilty

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.240]
You know something I don't want to start the bitching about him too

[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.480]
Not just cause he's under concerning with mole moist mornings

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.260]
I'm glad he didn't get jigsmaked out of jugs McDonald's job

[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.820]
You know what?

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.780]
That guilty?

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.360]
It was that's fault

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.620]
What do you mean by that?

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.420]
He's the one supposed to fire off the adi

[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.980]
He's talking about firing off the adi

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.160]
I'm talking about the abrupt like right before that

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.420]
You know?

[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.200]
So if he took another five seconds

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.660]
Hey the fat faggot's coming up next in mad dog

[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.380]
You know we got a whole line of people coming on here you know?

[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.120]
That's just some little twerk talking about ball games

[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.320]
How about those ball games?

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.800]
Now even George is excited about it

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.500]
Not that he watched him but he feels it in the ear

[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.380]
You don't feel it?

[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.640]
What?

[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.640]
Oh come on Saturday and last night

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.800]
That had to be two of the most electric games in the history of the sports

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.080]
Even if you don't like sports

[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.860]
There were games

[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.640]
There were hiracunes and the seminal

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.180]
Oh by the way you know what I forgot to mention?

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.620]
Of all the important things

[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.800]
Florida steaks

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.920]
Yeah nice gone Bobby Bogdan should have gone for two you moron

[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.180]
You got outcoached you idiot

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.200]
But anyway right down to the end

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.740]
And this time at least it wasn't wide right

[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.160]
Which is Florida state air beer against the hiracunes lately

[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.640]
Wide right with a field girl

[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.780]
This time it was wide left cause it had bad snap

[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.120]
Boy it's a good thing for the hiracunes

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.000]
They didn't have a good snap

[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.880]
Cause that kid would have kicked that right through the middle

[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.360]
And then last night

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.620]
Is if that wasn't enough excitement to keep it

[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.800]
Oh and let me say it again

[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.580]
Greatest name in the history of sports even better than extra hip

[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.340]
Ethnic sands

[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.760]
The hurricane star receiver

[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.400]
Ethnic sands he be having good hands

[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.740]
That ethnic sands

[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.740]
And it be filled ETH ENIC

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.700]
Ethnic

[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.860]
Huh?

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.500]
He's kind of like racial shorts

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.000]
Is that racial or racial?

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.780]
How do you be saying that?

[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.920]
And of course also in a game with ethnic sands was Rufus Jones

[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.920]
Now I just I don't want to tell dark folks what you ought to name your kids

[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.320]
Okay?

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.220]
But Rufus is probably not a real good idea

[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.600]
Even Schufro at least is a little bit humorous you know

[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.200]
Tyrone

[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.860]
Tyrone

[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.720]
Yeah Tyrone is uh but Rufus just do not be good

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.660]
Okay that'd be a good dark name

[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.840]
Ethnic sands

[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.000]
Okay have you ever heard a name like that in your life?

[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.700]
That's a new one

[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.220]
And then last night as I started to say and guess who the star now you can guess

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.920]
Who the star for that offense was last night?

[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.840]
Olindo

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.380]
Maurei

[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.900]
Maurei

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.780]
Very good see

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.360]
Jürt don't even follow sports and how about those uh see

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.300]
Oh I got off of that thing and I'm in the wrong place

[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.260]
How about those freaking patriots yesterday?

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.820]
Hey stop

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.140]
Wow talk about an embarrassment

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.640]
I don't want to get two sports intensive but it was a heavy duty week

[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.360]
So for South Florida the Panthers winning overtime and it land a five to four

[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.660]
On our shipments in Matthew Bill is the younger brother of Marty Burrong

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.820]
He's the young defenseman on the Panthers hasn't played a million

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.920]
Hey Denny, uh pot fail we can't figure out what you're talking about

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.540]
Nobody has a clue what you're saying including yourself Matthew Bill Hont

[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.900]
But anyway so the Panthers win over time in Atlanta

[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.340]
The Huracun's win and just nail biting gut wrenching fourth quarter

[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.900]
The record crowd of the Orange Bull and last night in Denver right there in Denver

[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.720]
The dolphins pull it out of their ass

[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.200]
Denver kicks a 55 year Jason Eelam kicks a 55 year field goal with just seconds left in the game

[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.620]
45 seconds to put Denver ahead by a point

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.200]
Miami gets the ball

[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.180]
There's that Jewish kid with a big ears from a Dartmouth J. Feeder

[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.100]
Who nobody wants to give any credit and there's that the play of this whole season

[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.520]
Right through that sparsus I mean the Aligned Backers hands number 51

[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.420]
That's a bad number to be where you know I'm saying

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.180]
You know who used to wear that number?

[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.180]
Brian Cox

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.840]
I could put the thing under but I want to leave it

[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.080]
I can't stop for the Patriots because that was that was embarrassing right there in the winglet okay boys

[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.860]
You can't complain about their running defense because they don't have any

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.060]
Man my grandma could run for 15 yards of carry through that defense

[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.440]
But nevertheless so it was a very traumatic sports weekend

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.280]
And notes you feel it in the air

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.860]
That's why that that I mean talk about pulling the air out of a balloon

[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.220]
I guess Geldy must have sucked all the helium out of the balloon

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.300]
That's why it sounds like that

[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.780]
Because it was done left by at nine o'clock

[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.140]
We get nothing man we don't even get like a hey here's the asshole nothing even a monkey the organ grinder

[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.880]
We got nothing is that in there?

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.540]
Would you put that under organ grinder organ grinder we don't even get that now

[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.720]
Like I said Belly you backstabber

[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.180]
You're not getting jugs down you're gonna make them sure they are

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.620]
Well I wish you missed that old morning cool you know

[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.400]
I'm not talking about the first thing I'm talking about the morning sickness food

[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.740]
Ron Hershey highway

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.500]
Poor Carolyn that got knocked up the hall

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.900]
I said knocked up the hall I just got knocked up

[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.380]
Now who else?

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.060]
And Geldy?

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.020]
Well two out of three ain't bad okay we don't miss Geldy

[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.460]
Not after that pathetic lead in this morning

[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.980]
That was weak man somebody ought to be spanking you on the hall right now Geldy

[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.200]
I'd like to see Duff put him over his knee right now and spank him

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.780]
In fact Duff could put him over his knee and Clara could spank him

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.620]
Now that we got all these hot shots around here when you love to see that?

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.900]
No I'd pay big bucks to see that

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.240]
Give him a little spanking you probably enjoy it

[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.380]
1193 votes on a pool from Friday and you people out there man you just see this is another part of my being back here

[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.980]
Which believe me ain't gonna last too long folks this ain't gonna last too long

[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.920]
This place is the end of the universe and being here being in this building

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.180]
I never up until this time because the two previous times when I came back in April and in June whatever it was

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.320]
I guess it was three

[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.600]
It was for like five days

[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.500]
And I knew it was only gonna be for a few days

[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.740]
So psychologically you can say to yourself how big the undo in three shows I'm getting back out of here

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.000]
But now that I'm supposed to be here for four and a half months or at least alleged

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.860]
It's like being on death row you've got to be kidding me

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.520]
You have to be joking me

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.640]
This place is like it's like the land of the walking dead you can feel it you can smell it

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.480]
So the fact that we got all those big victories over the weekend in sports even if you don't like sports

[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.840]
It's gotta be something okay better than anything else going on here

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.100]
And being in this building just

[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.220]
Wooo

[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.860]
Heavy heavy duty even just having to see your close personal friend the other day

[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.780]
What is 800 suit you know what I'm talking about?

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.100]
Yeah him that's depressing that's mortifying it's debilitating

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.860]
Love it 193 votes and a pool the tone of Neal's show is

[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.120]
Well let me do it after the break okay because I want to go into it with a great length

[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.880]
And we might just take calls for four hours today

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.540]
I don't know that's what they want when I'm here when I'm not here see when I was in Toronto

[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.380]
It seemed to me correct me if I'm wrong it seemed to me like things are going along sensational

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.660]
We were getting phenomenal response on our website

[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.180]
Everything seemed to be really rolling along you know what?

[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.780]
Yeah and then I came back here and it's like holy crap man

[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.160]
It's like uh...

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.240]
In spite of what they say on the pool which we'll get to in spite of their observations

[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.920]
I think things were going a little bit too well and this town doesn't like that

[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.780]
They resent it when things are going well for it

[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.340]
When you sound like you're in a really good mood

[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.800]
And then of course Thursday the first day I come back here

[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.240]

Hijinks

Could have been worse, he could have choked it down

[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.080]
How many of you think he choked down this morning?

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.480]
Zach, about 255

[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.100]
He brought you the remnants

[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.280]
He brought you the scrapers, the drops

[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.600]
Two faxes I get here first about

[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.160]
About NPR radio loosens stations of religious broadcast

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.920]
There's how many years ago I had that story on

[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.780]
Thank you very much

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.980]
And also Ariana Huffington's column wise

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.000]
No one's talking about casualties

[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.860]
Remember that one?

[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.080]
You folks are a little bit behind the time

[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.020]
It's really going to be back to you

[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.040]
You can't stop floating, guess what?

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.840]
It's Christopher Columbus Day, remember him?

[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.040]
No

[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.400]
No

[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.520]
They don't know him either

[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.700]
But Jewish sailor

1202 votes

[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.140]
The tone of Neil's show we asked on Friday

[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.920]
It makes no difference where he's to see

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.960]
It was basically how does the show sound

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.300]
Depending on where I am

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.800]
Is really what it was all about as opposed to these assholes

[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.180]
And you're not fooling me

[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.240]
Maybe you're fooling yourselves or somebody else

[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.260]
You're not fooling me

[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.120]
And the proof of the pudding was those calls I took on Friday

[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.400]
And there was also one on Thursday wasn't there?

[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.260]
Same thing

[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.480]
Yeah

[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.440]
Well, you know, hockey seasons are starting again

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.780]
And it'll be great to be talking about these other things

[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.140]
And you know, we have to put up with all your left-wing leanings and anti-bush

[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.180]
And basically what they would like me to do is talk about anything

[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.480]
And take a whole lot of phone calls from idiots as opposed to sitting here and telling the truth

[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.520]
Because they can't stand it

[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.560]
They can't handle it

[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.980]
So they want to deflect the agenda of the program is what they want to do

[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.700]
And then of course, sure when they're also the idiots, the chronics and the cranks

[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.020]
Who want to take the program over again who feel that they've been disenfranchised

[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.420]
Makes no difference where he's doing a show

[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.600]
542, 45 percent

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.940]
The tone sucks, we want the callers back

[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.480]
458, 38 percent

[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.640]
38 percent want the callers back

[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.040]
You ready for that?

[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.640]
And where are the callers? Do you see any?

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.440]
No

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.700]
I don't

[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.520]
You know, here we had, here this is supposed to be the sports station

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.060]
And these people are supposedly such gung-ho football lunatics

[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.520]
Three times I went out there, first when I came in, so that's four

[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.500]
Because I went out to take a leak twice this morning just

[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.400]
There's nothing like your good pee

[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.940]
That's what my aunt Rita says

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.020]
Lunch dinner, nothing like your good pee

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.540]
They're cheap

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.040]
And anyway, and I looked at the phone out there, there was no tremendous number of phone calls on there

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.020]
Those phones should have been let out, wouldn't you think?

[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.880]
Huracun's, Dolphins last night, one of the great games in history of the franchise, one of the most

[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.640]
SIDLATING games, you've got to be on your ass after watching that game

[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:26.900]
And even after, Elon kicked that 55-yard field rule, I'm saying to myself, hey, there's 45 seconds left in this game, baby

[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.160]
And ain't over yet

[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.820]
And not being any Dolphin fan, which I'm not going to be a phony and jump on the bandwagon

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.020]
I got to give them credit, doing one hell of a job

[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:41.640]
And Olindo Maurei, and I noticed that the TV announcers there last night on what was that on?

[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.800]
Well, it was on channel four here

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.080]
But they didn't call him Olindo Maurei, none of them

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.900]
And you want to know why? Because that's not his name

[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.000]
I just mentioned that in passing again

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.980]
Not that anybody here cares about my nusha like that

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.060]
But are you certain about that?

[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.800]
Oh God, Ethnic Sans

[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.800]
It tickles my glands when I just say it, Ethnic Sans

[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.100]
And it sports again, how many times have I talked about that? In sports, you can have any name no matter how ridiculous it is

[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.660]
And the sportsers, oh yeah, there's Ethnic how you do, how you be doing Ethnic?

[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:14.780]
Huh?

[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.100]
Can you imagine having a kid naming him Ethnic?

[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.640]
No

[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.080]
Well, what is that? It sounds like some kind of an Ethnic reference to me

[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.560]
And then you got that moosey guy up there in the DC, the chief of police

[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.280]
Anywhere that's got a TH and it turns into a V, maybe that's because they're close to Virginia

[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.240]
Huh? Any like a together? We're working together to work on it

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.920]
Well, what is that? Together? And this is the chief of police?

[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.680]
Hey, you dark folks out there, I don't want to pick on you too much

[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.440]
But it's about time that you started like getting the boom box off your shoulder

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.440]
And getting with it, you know, maybe like attending one or two classes a year will be good in between crack deals

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.420]
I mean cut it out, cut the crap

[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.040]
And I don't want my car wash this week

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.580]
So, WQ I am

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.440]
Deal

[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.160]
Yes sir

[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.080]
I don't know if you heard man that's last night when you were alive

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.640]
Sir, I was watching the game on TV, I was not listening on the radio

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.160]
Well, you should get it on a drop because he sounded like he blew a brain gasket when that thing went through the stuff right

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.000]
I could not believe what I was listening to when it went through

[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.580]
I thought I seriously I thought it had exploded really

[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.340]
It was the biggest r-ratt and then the woo

[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.080]
It was real, I mean it was a little bit sad

[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.380]
I mean it was nice but what would a man did in the course and what do you mean it was sad?

[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.040]
Well, I mean he gets very excited but I don't have to say his mo-hour and it was sad

[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.000]
Because mo-hour was trying to scream over him and say

[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.600]
He really kicks the gun and the background you just hear man just trying to get his woo out

[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.100]
It wasn't well done, I think that the two of them don't want to walk together

[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.000]
If I could mo-hour was a big hard-head and like to his mo-hour

[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.500]
Okay, thank you

[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.460]
Have a great day, what do you give him me a look like that? That was a good call

[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.580]
He took a little cheap shot at Moa near too and also even the mad dog

[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.260]
He's a little crazy

[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.440]
You know, you're giving me a look like that

[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.800]
Anyway, can I do the pull here?

[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.940]
The show is best for Miami 118, 9.7%

[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.900]
Best from Toronto 63, which is obviously the correct answer

[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.900]
5.2% and best from Amsterdam 20, 1.6%

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.780]
Like I said, I did so few shows from Amsterdam, how would you know anyway?

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.800]
So, you know, excluding that the correct answer comes up last, the best from Toronto

[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.860]
The show was smoking from there, it was great

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.960]
Yeah

[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.000]
The difference is like the difference between night and day

[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.860]
I crawled out of the sack, I got all my stuff there, I downloaded a bunch of other stories

[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.420]
I'm sitting there, I'm in a great mood

[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.840]
I don't have to put up with all these butt plugs coming into my place

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.060]
Right, full of them and vigor

[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.520]
Yeah

[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.500]
Don't have to get in the car and go through a bunch of assholes on the highway

[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.920]
I'll tell you one thing this morning, I'm coming on 5.95, miss 5.4, which is again a new arach

[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.280]
All of a sudden they start jamming on their brakes, I mean slamming on their brakes

[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.200]
Was there any reason for it?

[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.080]
No, there was nothing there

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.720]
Just for the halibut

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.260]
And the guy in front of me, I mean you could smell the rubber, it was like you'd walked into a rubber factory

[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.680]
The aroma was just incredible

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.440]
It was seeping if you catch my drift

[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.820]
That kind of an aroma

[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.260]
So we have 1209 votes out there and 38.1% want to call us back

[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.780]
When he just had one, he was pretty good

[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.100]
I don't, it doesn't bother me, I got a whole, look at your witness, you got a whole pile of stuff here

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.460]
This could take me to 4 o'clock if I wanted to, okay

[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.940]
Keller in his truck on video, restaurant manager charge in sniper hoax, you know that story

[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.180]
Nope

[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.580]
Well, there you go

[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.720]
Steve Dunleoby, these are terrorists, he's talking about these because there's more than one in the truck in the white box truck

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.200]
There's a loop

[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.460]
And he says they're terrorists, vile crimes, sparks are straight outrage

[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.920]
The greatest tragedy in the history of those islands, hundreds of almost 200 people did

[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.420]
Right

[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.540]
And Al-Kaeda done it and some of their other, some of your other good Arab friends

[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.480]
Some of my friends?

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.720]
Some of your terrorist Arab friends

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.760]
Your friends?

[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.540]
The bombers, the crazy bombers

[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.180]
The people are all in it with La Bomba

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:07.680]
And of course it's interesting that you should be in league with them because what do we have here in Miami in the 60s and 70s?

[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.400]
Bomings

[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.200]
Yeah

[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.840]
If we time somebody got pissed off, La Bomba, of course now it's kind of different, you know

[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.260]
It's for people to philosophy, not mine

[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.420]
Hey, don't, don't tell me about those Jews

[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.200]
By the way, Puerto Ricans expand donations to GOP and Jeb Bush, there's another great story for all you a Julio's out there

[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.320]
Puerto Ricans, huh?

[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.260]
George had a good point on them anyway, so at least he's not perfect

[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:36.300]
Meet producers, we call 27.4 million pounds of deli product, 27.4 million pounds and guess where they're how far back they're dated?

[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.520]
Since May

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.000]
June, July, August, September, it's only five months

[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.360]
Yeah

[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.780]
27.4, anyone in a Y?

[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.220]
Because they got Listeria

[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.960]
I don't want anybody to get hysteria

[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.320]
Over Listeria said maybe ethnic sands

[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.260]
And you know something, nobody will have one comment about that name

[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.580]
Because like I said, the sports thirds, whatever it is, that's what it is

[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.560]
Like what's his name? What the hell's the receiver used to play for the jets?

[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.480]
I can't even say I have a brain fart now

[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.180]
You know who I'm talking about with a ridiculous name?

[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.260]
They're all these other, it's a new thing in America, it's part of the racist...

[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.280]
Underpinnings of this society, whatever the hell that means

[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.880]
It is

[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.580]
Name your kids the most ridiculous outrageous idiot again

[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:30.240]
It's either that or it's the Islamic names now we got Rashid Hasham, Ah-Halam Schwartz, all I crap

[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.440]
Right, at least they got an excuse

[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.500]
You got the other people

[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.620]
Well maybe it's an ethnic thing, I don't know

[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.600]
Ethnic sands? I wonder if he's kind of Tommy sands, you think

[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.720]
Oh it's big of Tommy sands, we got some bad news

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.360]
Ray Conif rhymes with Ghanif, Ray Conif is dead

[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:45.960]
He died

[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.620]
Somewhere, see we don't have the music, we don't have any somewhere in my love, Ray Conif

[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.560]
Ray Conif is a great band leader, huh?

[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.140]
Not even any of his Christmas time

[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.820]
Columbia Records man, he was there for a Koonzade

[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.360]
Shai

[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.840]
85 and he's dead

[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.620]
Okay I'll give you the new poll in a second, they were just relaxed

[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.000]
Okay, cause we're getting way behind I have to take a lot of calls today

[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.760]
I don't think we're gonna get a lot of calls today

[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.160]
And of course the excuse is not only is it Monday, it's Columbus Day

[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.000]
See?

[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.040]
Haven't you thought about that?

[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.540]
Oh, no

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.780]
And there's a lot of Columbus Day festivities going on out there, isn't there?

[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.120]
No

[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.940]
Oh, that's right

[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.080]
How about a coyote? They celebrate in Columbus Day there?

[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.320]
How would I know?

[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.860]
Wasn't he? Well he was with Queen Isabella, she was a spick

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.980]
He was an authorized agent of Spain

[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.880]
Like I just said, it's correct

[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.160]
What did I just say?

[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.160]
He's a spick

[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.120]
I didn't say he was a spick, I said Queen Isabella was a spick, okay

[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.460]
What language would you be spicking now, Mr. You just pissed off as the Puerto Ricans are supporting the Jeb Meister

[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.380]
Would you be?

[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.380]
I'd be embarrassed too, I'd be more embarrassed

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.180]
I'd be more kind, I'd be so upset

[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.960]
I'd be not gonna do with them

[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.260]
You'd like hell you don't

[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.700]
No, I don't

[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.940]
You're a kid man, you're a blood brother, they're a great son of the islanders, has nothing to do with me

[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:58.700]
27 after 9 at 5, 60 WQM, let me tell you right now about our good close personal friends who drive concepts

[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.900]
Hey, here's they got their own website now too, by the way, www.dryconcepts.com

[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.320]
You can log on there, take a look for yourself, and find out about all the great things they do for you

[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.740]
How they do that miracle on your floor that I've been telling you about for over 20 years on this program

[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.840]
Carpet dry cleaning, which nobody else in the world does, which is why nobody is as effective

[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.940]
Because they can make even the worst looking and smelling carpets in the world look and smell just like brand new

[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.860]
And of course also a pulstery cleaning, leather cleaning, or anal rug cleaning and repair, water damage restoration

[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.680]
And of course they'll take care of pet odors, what do I know about those and more?

[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.540]
In Broward, column at 9-5-4-3-70-77-78

[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:41.940]
9-5-4-3-70-77-78, in date or Palm Beach, call tool for E-1800-248-5071

[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.740]
And no matter what kind of work you have to do for you, they have a for you

[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.680]
At dry concepts, you don't have to worry about getting ripped off because you can give you a written guaranteed price

[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.840]
Before they start the job, call them today, you can clean today and entertain tonight

[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.960]
It's not just a slogan, it's their business at dry concepts

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.220]
And look all, this is 420560

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.240]
And I'm in Hunir

[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.940]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.960]
Bread's his cheeks to his, his toosh

[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.860]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.220]
Stepping in fetch and at the whim of his white master

[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.900]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.960]
Kicked us to the knees of the globalist cracker

[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.740]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.860]
And a belt on some survey on Google

[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.620]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.220]
A pristine, black, safe, full lips, full eyes

[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.680]
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro

[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.480]
Yo, call him, call him, call him, call him, call him, be a slave, he, he, he, grow

[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.260]
Yes, golden foul is the, oh that what he be doing

[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.120]
I'm 33, I wonder if he knows ethnic sands, you think so?

[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.880]
Huh? And they wonder why I call him the Heracun, so you people kidding man

[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.620]
The Heracun, ethnic sands, and you know what, nobody will call and tell us the origin of that name, you know that?

[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.680]
Hey, they might

[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.740]
Here's the poll today, well we're looking for all those calls man, 38% of the audience wanted the calls back

[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.780]
And so far we've taken how many? One?

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.580]
One? One? One, and it was pretty damn impressive too

[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.740]
And what is that? Memo? A memo saying

[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.980]
Let's read the memo, let's get the important memo, maybe that's something to do with the end of the world is coming

[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.720]
I'll tell you during the break

[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.840]
What do you mean you'll tell me during the break? I'll tell you during the break

[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.820]
Well what is it about? It's about somebody passing

[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.880]
Somebody died? Yeah, so I'll tell you during the break

[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.740]
Somebody we know? I'll tell you during the break

[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.900]
Here's the poll today, Jesus, see another reason I don't want to be here

[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:28.280]
He can't even keep a straight face about it and you're sitting there like a man, is it bad news?

[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.960]
It's not funny, it's not funny

[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.360]
No, I didn't say it was funny, but I'm in the bus

[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.640]
I'm in the dark again like Condoleezza, I'm in the ethnic sands

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.400]
Here's our poll today, President Bush's approval rating is about 63% what do you like about him most?

[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.860]
Well, no, seriously his approval rating is 63% that means almost two-thirds like the job he's in

[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.840]
What do you like about him most? Here I give you five choices, his tough stand on Iraq

[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:03.580]
His handling of the war on terrorism, his handling of the economy, he's not a flaming liberal or absolutely nothing he's a disaster

[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.900]
I got my vote

[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.260]
President Bush's approval rating is about 63% what do you like about him most?

[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.660]
Let's emphasize that most, let's underline it, put it in italics, put it in heavy duty print, Eric, most

[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:29.060]
His tough stand on Iraq, his handling of the war on terrorism, his handling of the economy, he's not a flaming liberal or absolutely nothing he's a disaster

[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:35.080]
Now getting back to Alindo Maurei, stem cell science offers new hope to diabetics

[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.860]
See here's another thing I like about him is the fact he's helping to keep us in the stone age, I like that a lot

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:48.420]
Type 1, this is from the Reuters, type 1 diabetics patients may be able to avoid the need for daily insulin shots through transplants of insulin producing stem cells

[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:54.000]
But the procedure faces problems finding the cells and dealing with immune system rejection research you said on Friday

[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.080]
We've done 38, how do you say that?

[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.080]
Islet? ISLET, I guess that is

[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.560]
Yes, I know I've seen that, I've just never said it before

[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.520]
Have you ever said that before? Not lately

[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.360]
38 islet cell transplant procedures since 1999, 87% of those patients are free of insulin therapy, your after transplantation

[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.400]
Dr. Jonathan Lakey University of Alberta and Edmonton

[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.940]
See I'm reading this too fast now because I'm just too anxious to take those great calls

[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.320]
Research from Edmonton other islet stem cell transportation centers being presented to the diabetes conference in Anaheim

[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.800]
So in other words, the mega long story short, it comes down to again the research stem cell research

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.440]
Been in the slow down of a crawl because of the good old right wing Christians and they're doing it by the way

[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.080]
The Christian coalition is firing up the faithful and proved that it has still as the clout

[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.240]
The coalition has opened up a three day conference in Washington aimed at raising its profile and getting out the vote in November

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.060]
Republican Senator James Inhoff of Oklahoma exhorted those who gathered to vote the Liberals out of office

[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.920]
He called to doing the Lord's work because the Lord ain't no flame in liberal

[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.800]
I'll tell you that right now. He's a right wing Bible thump and conservative asshole red neck who likes guns

[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.500]
Oh, it's speaking of guns by the way

[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.000]
Supporters also proclaimed their solidarity with Israel which many Christians consider part of the biblical Holy land

[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.240]
They heard from Jerusalem as mayor Ehud Olmaird who said their support helps Israelis endure Palestinian bombings

[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.520]
Right

[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.780]
He never met a right wing boy. He didn't like his what he's trying to say so speaking of guns you notice

[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.080]
If there's some like sniper out there who's like shooting at you killing people from hundreds of yards away

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.260]
Having your own peace, which is what the NRA people are always saying

[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.000]
You gotta have your own weapons to protect yourself

[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.200]
It's pretty hard to protect yourself when you're pumping gas or walking into your school room or whatever

[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.040]
And there's somebody that you can't even see it's not like in a godfather where you walk right up to him and put the you know

[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.720]
Bullet through his brains and right spill his guts all over here and I sigh believe suit. It's not like that but I think right

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.960]
They're killing people with these high powered weapons which of course are readily available just like cracker jacks and cheetos man anywhere

[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:58.260]
Speaking of that did you see 60 minutes last time yes I did I saw crazy people right crazy people would be demanding the wait a minute

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.400]
But haven't I always said that America basically I mean it's complicated. There are a lot of different kind of people

[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.460]
America basically is crazy people with guns right

[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:13.920]
But that guy from the mental health association saying oh there's no indication that these people are going to commit future crimes just because they were you starting up again

[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.920]
Sorry are you starting up picking on what's good NRA right wingers again taking on the crazy people yeah and they're associated

[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.620]
So what's the difference people who are in love with guns they got some kind of a mental problem don't they?

[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.500]
Maybe they're just a scared and this business about and they're starting the same old crap again

[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:35.440]
Is it a serial killer is it a uh what's the other one a terrorist no no no and forget about that

[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.160]
But a serial killer a uh spree killer they're starting to say more crap again like they did with Kunehaan and all the time yeah the labels make a difference

[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.880]
And then this bill uh what's his name bill Hummer on CNN this morning he's really out of control

[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.840]
He's filling in for Paul of this week and not that she's she's about if I think the biggest lightweight in the world he makes her look like a Walter Cronkite

[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.720]
He's such a lightweight and he's grilling this guy they got one of these shrinks on he was trying to analyze these snipers and who they are

[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.820]
What they're all about is if they have any idea which they don't and he's saying well yeah

[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.720]
But wouldn't it be a better idea if we like told them you're a coward and this and yeah

[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:14.100]
And the guy is saying no because that's just gonna bait them and taunt them into like coming out and doing more after they took another weekend off you know

[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.800]
And he's like he's like basically tried to tell the cops how to do their job bill Hummer

[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.780]
They're on CNN just read the news you asshole all of a sudden he's a guy damn expert

[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:32.100]
He's a freaking psycho-loss a criminologist and I got them expert a forensic psychologist and all of these things bill Hummer

[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:38.080]
So freaking newsreader is what he is stick to reading the guy damn telepropter okay bill and stop at living

[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.460]
You're making a jackass out of yourself on these certainly not news network

[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.080]
But like I said it sure as hell will help you lot to go to one of those gun shows that we advertise on this station lot

[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:58.140]
Pick yourself up a whole arsenal weapons to defend yourself against some sniper day you can't see that shooting you from a hundred yards away from out in the bushes somewhere or from his white box pick up truck whatever hell it is

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.240]
That'll get the job done crazy people with guns that's America baby

[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.120]
I can look all this is 420560 way away

[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.080]
Well and rate me

[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.140]
You're riding around with your windows down

[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.620]
I'll us up on the show right now

[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.040]
We've got a vacancy in the hotel

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.740]
We'll talk about men till your penis well

[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.600]
Out half as they run and how good they look

[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.140]
Pass along tips for your bookie to book

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.140]
Hello sportsmen let's talk about Ricky well and we'll bring over again and Elvis good luck

[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.540]
I heard tired so I started sounding like

[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.020]
Don at talking about Henry men and loving it

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:52.120]
And some side issues like where are all the writer trucks remember those housey on days where they were writer truck

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.740]
The smell of musty-movers blanket that blended so well with eating a sandwich

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.380]
A cruisin along in the afternoon

[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.260]
Talking about ignorant sport old girls

[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.960]
A juxtaposed angle their balls like a bell

[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.700]
Think about how good their juxtaposed spells

[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.880]
Ain't much talk about women except to say

[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.700]
He's got a nice patch of real estate

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.880]
Hey man dog how you doing?

[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.560]
Make you king, stitty fool

[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.120]
What you believe?

[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.920]
Like a stink dog daddy from Killis

[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.400]
I have on the line my old friend like raw

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.620]
Let's call

[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.160]
The dog

[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.060]
I'm sorry about that I meant sick free

[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.320]
He's a fuck spot here

[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.400]
What if it isn't the old friend all around whole trick

[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.220]
They're not fooling anybody call it

[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.460]
I don't need that kind of aggravation

[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.160]
I make plenty of money

[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.620]
Don't even need to give

[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.720]
So blow it up your ass my friend

[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.980]
Because I can sit here in the lex and wear my tongue

[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.360]
It takes a real man to do a radio show and wear a tongue

[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.280]
945 at 560 WDQM

[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.580]
I want to thank you all again for the tremendous build up and promotion of the show this morning did a hell of a job as usual

[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.420]
And the U38% out there that want the callers back on a show I don't know where they are

[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.760]
It's basically the same as when we used to take calls every day

[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.040]
And sit here in big form

[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.660]
I don't know there's not a call on the board

[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.180]
Do you see any?

[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.280]
No

[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.120]
What are you pounding on the thing there?

[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.560]
I was just remembering those days

[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.200]
And the numbers and writing and writing and writing and writing

[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.900]
And finding out that they got nothing to say

[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.540]
And like I said, even if it was just a ball game stuff

[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.880]
Now the one guy he was very entertaining about to the mad dog and ripin' mo a little bit

[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.980]
But other than that, these people had nothing to say

[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.120]
560, 560

[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.000]
And I'm doing this to humor those 38% of the people out there and pretend to be

[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.940]
And even the people I talk to Thursday and Friday

[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.480]
They had nothing to say they wanted to tell me how to do the show

[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.600]
I would hope he knocking bush like that

[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.560]
Let's see on a pool we got 21 votes

[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.740]
They like most about Bush, he's not a flaming liberal 7

[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.840]
Absolutely nothing is a disaster 6

[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.020]
His tough stand on Iraq 4

[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.900]
Is handling the war on terrorism 3

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.180]
And is handling the economy 1

[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.500]
That's probably Kenny Lay

[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.300]
Voted that vote and there's just before

[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.680]
Just before they took him away

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.440]
That must have been Kenny Lay

[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.340]
Either that was ethnic sands

[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.160]
WQAM

[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.800]
Hello, how you doing?

[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.340]
Pretty good

[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.920]
Yeah, I've been wanting to get 30 for a while

[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.120]
I got a good book to recommend about oil

[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.960]
Yeah

[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.900]
That's you know playing such a big roll now

[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.920]
The book is called The Prize

[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.560]
The author is Daniel Jurgen

[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.400]
Y-E-R-G-I-N

[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:34.640]
Right

[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.260]
It's a really good book

[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.680]
It was actually a mini series on TBS

[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.940]
Probably like two years ago

[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.340]
It's a really thick, it's really thick in the book too

[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.800]
But it's well worth the time

[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.760]
And any world too

[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.420]
Yes

[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.180]
But I really enjoy reading the articles

[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.360]
I guess that's about it

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.820]
I just, I'm not happy to be off today

[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.040]
If I finally was able to get through

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.280]
Oh, you're one of those 10 people

[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.340]
Get off for Columbus Day, right?

[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:58.960]
Yeah

[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.340]
Excellent, okay, thanks a lot

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.660]
Okay, have a good time

[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.820]
See, there you go, that was pretty good

[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.500]
And he enjoys the articles on here

[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.620]
You don't mind my reading those bedtime stories on here

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.680]
But a lot of people do

[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.840]
I mean, who do I want to hear some

[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.260]
Fatal Faggot reading on here for four hours every day

[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.020]
I don't really care while I'm here

[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.980]
Which won't be very long

[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.900]
When I go back to Toronto and do the show

[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.660]
Then I'll do it my show, I'll do it my way

[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.640]
Like Frankie would say

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.100]
I'll do it my way

[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:21.680]
That's right

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.320]
And be very happy with it

[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.280]
And we'll be doing just great

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.520]
As far as oil is concerned

[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.440]
I'm glad he mentioned that

[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.880]
Because I do have one of my bedtime stories

[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.180]
And you're way down in a pile

[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.180]
We're about, we better, we do this

[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:33.860]
And we better do that

[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.680]
But we are doing it

[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.040]
How about how we better get rid of our dependency on oil

[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.140]
Like Europe is trying to do?

[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.520]
Where the hell is that article?

[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.080]
I can't find a god damn thing

[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:43.840]
Christian Coalition

[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.440]
Did I just do that story?

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.980]
Get out there and vote

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.720]
Oh also the Finland Mall Blast

[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.200]
There was some teenage punk lunatic

[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.180]
Crazy people with guns, crazy people with bombs

[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.160]
And so on

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.960]
Fallwell protest leads to riot

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.900]
You saw that I'm sure

[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.520]
No

[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.620]
In India, you didn't see that?

[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.160]
No

[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.180]
Alabama ban on sex toys is struck down as unconstitutional

[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.920]
When hellmout is my story in here about how we better do like the Europeans

[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.480]
And get rid of our tremendous dependency on oil

[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.820]
But of course we don't want to get rid of our dependency on oil

[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.140]
Because all of these damn people who are in control of the government

[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.940]
That's they're up to their armpits in oil

[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.580]
They're up to their nostrils in OIL

[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.480]
Okay? Like this guy who's just saying

[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.140]
WQAM

[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.700]
Hey, Neil

[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.300]
Yes sir

[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.220]
How you doing buddy?

[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.620]
Great

[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.620]
Don't take any callers

[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.160]
I get very little to say

[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.480]
But love articles you're reading here

[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.280]
Anyway, how come they got so upset with fallwell this time

[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.840]
And they didn't make such a big bruha howe

[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.280]
And he came out against stinky winky

[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.040]
They did

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.420]
He apologized for that he went out and bought one

[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.360]
He's rubbing tinky winky on the head right now

[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.860]
You're right you didn't have too much to say

[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.700]
He was okay though

[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.080]
What he's trying to say is they made a bigger stink about this

[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.540]
They did about that fag thing

[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:55.900]
Okay?

[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.040]
But you gotta understand if it wasn't for us fags

[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.180]
Those right wing Christians wouldn't have any goddamn agenda

[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.580]
They wouldn't have anything to talk about

[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.400]
They'd have to find some other scapegoat like guys named Ethnic

[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.400]
They'd have to address ethnic issues

[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.940]
As opposed to sex issues

[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.620]
Which they're very big on sex issues

[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.640]
Because that plays big with the Christian right

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.560]
Five people were killed Friday when Hindu Muslim writing broke out

[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.040]
And a protest against comments made by the Reverend Jerry Falwell on 60 minutes

[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.800]
Well, at last I had a little bourbon that didn't you see that on 60 minutes at the end

[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.300]
Where what's his name Bob Simon mentioned this?

[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.000]
No I didn't

[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.100]
And talked about the fact that the decent people have called on El Presidente

[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.400]
To disassociate himself and condemn those remarks

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.180]
And has he done it?

[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:35.580]
No

[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.300]
Hasn't done it

[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.840]
What's hooliog given directions about it?

[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.800]
And hey go get that apartment in there so I have some

[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.760]
They're poshking around in there?

[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.480]
There's another guy that just done I mean when I open every time the door opens

[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.520]
There's some big fat person in it there you know it?

[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.140]
Not hooliog is a good guy but Jesus Christ is he fat

[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.940]
Is he fat?

[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.640]
Or what?

[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.220]
He's in the right place we could start a club here

[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.760]
Him and Zach and Fat Boy

[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:56.920]
Right

[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.620]
And me and how the Humper

[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.560]
And Howard

[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.760]
Who?

[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:02.940]
David

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.100]
Howard's fat?

[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.400]
Is it me?

[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:06.820]
I don't think so

[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.140]
David Gut?

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.420]
Does he really?

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:08.880]
Sure

[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.020]
I wouldn't call him fat

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.060]
Alright

[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.420]
See yeah okay I hope he's listening right now even though he would lie about it

[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.720]
I hope he's back from Denver which I'm sure he is nice to gotten the job by the way by Olynda Mare

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.880]
But the fact of the matter is you're the one about to plad pants and a bad hair piece

[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.440]
I think he had a good point

[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.880]
And about his Verico's veins

[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.820]
I didn't say that either

[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.840]
He painted white and green jet colors

[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.580]
And about his wife wearing the jets cap and the crowd

[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.260]
The day they jets were here in town and it's often knocked the stuffing out of him

[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.440]
That was one that saw him yeah

[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.060]
I don't want to get everybody over

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.720]
And I'm not jumping on a bad wagon because I don't like them but

[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.960]
I saw that performance last night and I'm saying to myself this could be it

[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.080]
This could be the year seriously

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.600]
Really

[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.160]
I think they could do it this year

[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.340]
Even with that Juboi J. Fiedler in there which this town don't want to give him any credit

[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.600]
I think this could be their year

[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.080]
I'm serious

[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.660]
Because the league is so mediocre

[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.340]
Even Oakland was shown up for what a craft team they really are yesterday

[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.020]
They're mediocre

[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.980]
Patriots suck the joint out

[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.920]
Commercial switch the thing that switches the commercials off because that thing is still an issue

[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.260]
Apparently I didn't switch it back

[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.500]
And we got a lot of people out there who are pissed off a lot of people who rely on the show to kill four of the best hours of their life every guy at the end day

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.920]
Especially if they live in Florida

[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:27.180]
Which is the greatest public service we do at the prices right at no charge and they can't hear the show right now

[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.480]
Which just frost my fantasy

[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.120]
This is what happens when I come back here

[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.140]
I'm surrounded by it

[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.040]
A sea of technical incompetence

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.640]
Now where does that take place?

[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.100]
Broadcast.com

[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.540]
Well I'm going to tell you right now broadcast.com

[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.980]
Get with it

[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.520]
First we're going to go after Bell South

[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.480]
Then we're going to go after them

[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.800]
Then we're going to go after something lunch

[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]
Right after lunch

[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.440]
Sergio and Hylia says

[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.820]
Welcome back to the nation's poorest big city

[00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.920]
Okay thanks Sergio

[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.480]
Got a terminal

[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.660]
I get your points here, but it wasn't there wasn't airworthy it was great, but it was like I said week

[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.580]
5670560 let's go to this one WQAM

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.120]
I know. Yes sir

[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.340]
I wanted to say that I've been listening to you for almost 15 years since I was in high school

[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:23.420]
And calls back then although they were nothing the right home about in that past 15 years they've definitely had progressively gotten worse

[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:29.480]
Right especially all these a-holes are calling you telling you what to talk about say this don't say that

[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.820]
I mean if I'm listening to something like let's say it's for you and I'm not interested in the topic

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.780]
You're talking about upwards to something else for a couple of minutes

[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.760]
Back and then whatever if you're talking about something that I like then I'll just keep it there

[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.280]
See they don't understand if you're I'm going to take calls

[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:48.020]
I want to hear what they have to say now what they want me to say I want to hear them say something

[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:53.320]
But the problem is as you obviously a garnered in last several years is that they increasingly have almost nothing to say

[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:59.320]
Exactly and then just to sit on hold so that amount of time just to like say nothing is like I was beyond belief

[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.040]
Anyways I wanted to thank you I think initially a year ago turn me on to Smallville

[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.880]
And that is like one of the greatest shows

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.360]
And it runs again on Warner Brothers runs it again Sunday afternoon

[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.040]
George and I were talking about it before the show what time is it like between five and six I think

[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.560]
I think like on Sunday or yeah Sunday afternoon

[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.460]
This new second season like I think they're going to like the fourth episode

[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:26.240]
Every single episode since episode one of this season has been fantastic

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:32.560]
Yeah and even the scenes for the scenes for this one Tuesday maybe dark the dark side of Clark

[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.160]
He's turned evil for another

[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.400]
In fact I understand he changed his name to ethnic

[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.540]
To ethnic?

[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.380]
Ethnic Kent

[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:41.980]
That's funny

[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:48.260]
I wanted to share something I know you're like a big food lover and you have probably the sugar and diabetes and all that

[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:57.580]
I went someplace to eat some brunch on Sunday and I ordered it was cinnamon raisin, holla, french toast

[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:05.620]
Drowed in a Vermont maple syrup, sugar powder, whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.940]
And I was about to blow up after you know

[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.700]
Oh stop with bananas also

[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.260]
Oh great

[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.880]
So I don't know if I can do the part that's probably kill you about if it doesn't kill you

[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.240]
I'll just I'll just think about it

[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.080]
I recommend you have the honey tune

[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.860]
Okay thanks

[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.540]
Okay

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.980]
Say there's a guy who loves the show he's trying to kill me

[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:30.240]
27 after 11 at 560 WDK we got the mad dog who's going to be whipped up into a frenzy day from Monday 3

[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.480]
He's just going to make gurgling sounds for two hours

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.300]
He's so excited for your hard field goal

[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.800]
Everyone yesterday is Dolphin Game last time in Denver

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.980]
A scintillating performance

[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.320]
It's going to be a 53 yard attempt

[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:42.860]
Yeah

[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.160]
Oh you want to move?

[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.060]
No I don't want any more that's enough I don't want to have

[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.740]
We're not going to put him on this show

[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.860]
He won't even mention my name we're going to put that old funny daddy on this show

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.380]

Gordon gives South Florida a major blowjob

[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.540]
Baby launch a couple missiles

[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.440]
Yes

[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.160]
Tour to place we know

[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.900]
And aim a madame

[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.700]
Who's first name begins with

[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.800]
There's one thing we all understand

[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.620]
Alcatta won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan

[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.060]
We could chase around forever

[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.720]
With our tanks and all our troops

[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.900]
But special forces are some tired of jumping through them

[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.660]
Who's Jesus Christ

[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.080]
You know we need another

[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.560]
Play

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.700]
So let's cut out all the nonsense

[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.840]
And go blow up Pakistan

[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.420]
Yes

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.840]
Alcatta needs a nuclear tank

[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:22.500]
Why don't we stop pussyfoot and blow up Pakistan

[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.940]
Probably because they have that nooks might be one reason I would think

[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.420]
But I've something to do with this

[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.480]
1133 at 560 WQM

[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.140]
So as usual we're trying to like do the best weekend on this internet problem

This concert times we got again as usual it's back it's back

[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.260]
The problem was on this end it wasn't broadcast calm we own apology

[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.220]
Okay, don't we know

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:53.720]
But it was on this end because once the commercial break ends it's supposed to automatically kick in based on what's going on here inside this building

[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.260]
And of course you know what's going on inside this building no jir

[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:02.560]
That's right if it has anything to do with radio broadcasting with anything technical it's crap pure on the other

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:03.500]
Deliberated

[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:12.600]
327 votes on a poll today president Bush is approval rated nationally is about 63% what do you like about it most absolutely nothing

[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.620]
He's a disaster 210 64.2%

[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.460]
He's not a flaming liberal 64 people so that 19.5% change it again

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:28.260]
Sanjayd he's is handling of the war on terrorism 31 9.2% his stuff said on Iraq only 17 only 5%

[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:36.560]
How do you like that it's back stuff we're doing it baby we're on top of it get out of here and is handling an economy 5 1.4% the economy

[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.980]
Five clowns out there five people and you want you know what I commend those people because those are probably people lost their ass

[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.040]
They probably had tons of in-run or halibut and stuck crap like that

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:56.600]
And they're saying well my least keep my sense of humor you know don't cost nothing to laugh we take a lot of calls today because yeah we're just I don't know

[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:03.860]
I'm not so sure what had anything to do with a poll I took on Friday although we're trying to prove a point no let's see 64.9% that's been pretty consistent

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:14.100]
35.1 is the right thing and 38% when I think about they wanted to call this back makes me very very suspicious you know this oh why did I put this so far down in my pile

[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:27.080]
You talk about freaking Hutzpah man that old man would have got them dress on boy does he have a lot of cuts by I saw this I just saw the headline and it just frosted my fat all ugly ass in the Boston globe

[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:37.880]
Cardinal expects Vatican will grant us church waiver to enact hardline sex abuse policy they're gonna grant us a waiver and that nice of them yeah wave a back at him okay

[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.580]
like with a limp at wrist way like that look at that jersey that very naturally

[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:51.740]
Rome an American Cardinal said yesterday he expects Pope John Paul the tooth will grant the US church a waiver from church law

[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:57.560]
So we can implement its new clerical abuse policy in other words what they're trying to say is well we believe that our

[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:05.460]
Canon law supersedes your law which therefore a crap about that but we'll grant you a waiver because we're such a nice bunch of guys

[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:12.140]
Boy does he have a lot of clips by their law comes from God oh I forgot about that well our law comes from you

[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:20.360]
Good how do you like that that says that pedophiles all go to jail directly to jail do not collect the $200 do not pass going to not kiss the Pope's ring or anything else

[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.360]
Yeah, but what if there wasn't any passion involved that's okay Cardinal Francis George of Chicago who was in Rome over the weekend

[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.580]
Made the comments and interview with the A and P bolstering suggestions by senior Vatican officials that the Holy See

[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.980]
Yeah, hey hold up one finger and say see this the Holy See was leaning toward accepting the policy on an experimental basis

[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:45.000]
American bishops adopted the policy in June after a wave of sex abuse allegations which we already know about the bishops want Vatican approval

[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.080]
So the policy is the full weight of Rome behind them. Thank you. I were here the best say how to Scott but don't tell not to come in here again

[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.280]
A rejection would be an embarrassing blow US bishops who are struggling to restore credibility in the wake of the scandal

[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:03.380]
It seems to me that we're a lot of other embarrassing blows and they were long before this a lot of embarrassing blows you know I'm saying I'm sure you do

[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:12.400]
The provisions in the thanks are I have a great day have a happy Columbus stadium good Italian boy he could be Italian

[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:19.460]
The Jews in the Italians got a lot in common. They got their one their raviolis we got our crepline and then the chinks they stole all of it with those one times

[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:29.840]
That's right I forgot we all we both from the Chinese Marco Polo my ass okay there was a good Italian boy Marco Polo what team does he kick for huh I wonder if he's related to a Linda Maude

[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:37.060]
The provisions in the new policy include requiring diocese to remove guilty priest from church working in some instances from the priesthood itself

[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:46.740]
It also removes a statute statute limitations for abuse claims saying a guilty priest will be relieved of his ministry for even a single act of sexual abuse of a minor in the past, present or future

[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:52.740]
That reminds me nothing in Wilmington Delaware in other words if we think you're going to commit a crime sometime in the future well guess what

[00:51:53.340 --> 00:52:02.640]
U.S. Church lawyers of question whether they plan conflicts with canon law and the due process rights of accused clergy and whether the diocesan labor view boards mandated in the plan have too much authority

[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.660]
George who said not our George but Bishop George who said he discussed the issue with Cardinals in Rome over the weekend

[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:17.060]
They expected the Pope would accept the policy and would grant the American church a waiver to get around aspects of church law that make conflict with the new rules and the Cardinals are pretty excited about tying up the giants in that series

[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.660]
For example he said church law provides for a full blown trial you notice how often that word blow is in this lot of blowing going on baby

[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.420]
Full blown trial for an accused priest before it could be defraught

[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:37.160]
George said American prelates went to the Vatican April for a landmark summer with the Pope to ask him to consider granting an exception to the law because the enormity of this scandal warranted fast

[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:48.460]
Direction that a trial would allow in other words the heat was on man the heat was on and how the heat is off nobody gives a crap about this stuff anymore the media there too busy with with a sniper the expert sniper

[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:58.120]
And then with and Iraq not a question of if but a question of when and the al-Qaeda in which we've done a wonderful job again then have a look not too good

[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:10.740]
Now there's another al-Qaeda attempted shooting in Kuwait yesterday not to mention the thing in Bali of course that grotesque the worst attack in their history over there in the largest Muslim country in the world by the way I should point that out

[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:21.380]
I just mentioned that in passing we don't want to get too serious here today we're trying to keep it light keep it light we're back on the internet everybody's happy we want to celebrate the dolphins great win last night

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:51.360]
The Huracun's climactic win at a boy ethnic sands you'll be going baby and roof is Jones whatever the names are you know when I knew FSU was going to lose the game I can't think of the name of the quarterback for FSU pretty good looking kid by the win number 16 the quarterback for FSU for the seminals when they scored what they thought was going to be the winning field goal or touched out I forget I forget how the game went he knelt down and he crossed himself but that's right it wasn't touched on because then the Bobby win

[00:53:51.360 --> 00:54:06.260]
for one instead of two that is going Bobby you red neck you Yahoo man Bobby bound see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree that's why you send that Terry bound is a while he sits in the tree most of the time and even he said daddy Ramora should have gone for two but anyway this could

[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:36.000]
went he got that and he showed the replay as they were going to commercial break the replay of the crucifixion crossing his chest crossing his breast he was checking to see if his nipples were still firm how do you like that I know mine work because he's pretty good looking kid but anyway I don't remember what is that somebody you'll let me know somebody will fax it in or call it in quarterback for FSU what do you got what's his name so like I said it was a very exciting weekend but every time you think this time is going to be just

[00:54:36.000 --> 00:55:03.420]
pumped up in nothing absolutely nothing man this is the worst deadhead ass place let's have some hockey talk no don't forget George is going to be doing some hockey shows what's his name Chris Rex Chris Rex and rumor I'm hearing as he's a kind of a range of ranger ricks from flipper wasn't that his name that was a yeah Chris Rex Chris Rex was crossing himself and like that was the kiss of death baby because once you do that that's it you're done

[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:27.240]

[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:03.760]
and

[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.220]
He can see back there, it's an American bomb

[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.360]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.700]
We'll stop him off to the dump

[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:18.880]
Till he cast for his mom, it's an American bomb

[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.520]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.080]
To keep your oil warm

[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.440]
We did it once before

[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.500]
But now you need some more

[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.800]
But these American bombs

[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.420]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.460]
There he is

[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.060]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.820]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.160]
That's why I told I got any elevator that day

[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.060]
It's an American bomb

[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.160]
And gave me a dirty look

[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.620]
He said, boy, you must be in a cloud

[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.100]
In a fog

[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.640]
13th of noon at 560 WTA QA

[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.220]
And this has been the kind of pleasurable today

[00:58:59.220 --> 00:58:59.820]
I feel okay

[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.320]
Especially after I get my elbow all straightened out tomorrow

[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.920]
Which I don't think it'll get straightened out of one day

[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.060]
They'll probably have to operate

[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:05.800]
You think?

[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:06.500]
Phone saw

[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.860]
Your whole hacksaw, when a doubt cut it out

[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.580]
So anyway, Muff got a kind of a chuckle out of that fact

[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.400]
That we just handed to him

[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.560]
It said something about

[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.600]
If you blow too much, you're in trouble

[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.400]
Something like that

[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.020]
361 votes on the poll

[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.120]
The votes are pouring in today

[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.100]
We got the audio back on your Rogers dot com

[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.560]
Don't panic, we appreciate your fanaticism

[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.880]
That's great, but just, you know, don't be blaring on us

[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.220]
Although I guess the fact that they barely

[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.660]
brought Eric's attention to it

[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.140]
And we got the people's attention down here

[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.760]
And the people's got it fixed, right?

[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:35.760]
Right

[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.040]
I wonder, do you think Eric Nixan's is one of the people's

[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.740]
361 votes

[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.760]
So what do you think of it?

[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.260]
What do you like about President Bush the most?

[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.580]
Absolutely nothing, he said his answer 233

[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.860]
64.5%

[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.240]
He's not a flaming liberal, 68

[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.760]
He's his handling of the war in terrorism 35

[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.040]
His stuff stand on Iraq only 19

[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.560]
And his handling of the economy

[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.200]
6

[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.220]
6 people in a good sense of humor said that

[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.900]
Here's the fact that it says, oh, and I see we're trying to get everybody into a little more upbeat mood today

[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.240]
And this is more like beat up than upbeat

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.780]
I'm so depressed, it really looks like there's no way to save the world from religious zealotry and ignorance

[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.720]
And it's overwhelming

[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.740]
What part of the commandment thou shalt not killed of the good Christians failed to comprehend

[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.820]
Also Jesus preached the root of all evils is the love of money

[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.800]
You can just insert oil for money because there is no difference

[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.800]
However, a futile it may be

[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.860]
Voicing we concerns of the few reasonable people that must be done if nothing else

[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.480]
But to prove the posterity

[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.500]
They're not everyone was taken in by the lies promoted by both sides in this modern version of the crusades

[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.840]
We started in the dark ages

[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.020]
The calls are okay and very small doses says this fact sir

[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.700]
It also might enhance the droning of the idiot callers with classical music in the background

[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.960]
Like the old looney tunes and writing snippy

[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.820]
Now don't put no music in the back just because this uh you're like an auto automaton

[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.280]
Auto matron

[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.240]
Just in case

[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.540]
Says keep up the good work in Georgia's still disgusting

[01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:00.120]
But is so much better than anything else qaim has and an absolute genius compared to paul and run and that other

[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.940]
Shmit shmit shmit whatever's made

[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.420]
Shmit

[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.400]
We had a good book by the good trend

[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.040]
I said shmit

[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.420]
Yeah, but you got a mouthful of food and it's not like you said that it's not like you said something else

[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.080]
Said you like you had a mouthful of shmit or something like that

[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.500]

Listen that's that wasn't a good team we played this weekend. What about about that? Yeah

[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:35.620]
Okay

[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.900]
No, you know something

[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.960]
What see when Denver blew the game they were moving the ball like the dolphin defense wasn't even on the field

[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.080]
You notice that and they come away from the first half

[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.640]
They blew the last field goal because of the penalty on it was the time ran out

[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.080]
So and when you only come away from dominating a half with only nine points

[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.720]
Then the door is wide open. You know you're probably gonna lose the game and happens every time

[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.500]
Yeah, you get a little discouraged like that's right. Absolutely

[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.980]
You know, but they hung in there. They thought they had the game there at the end and I said oh my god

[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.160]
He's gonna get the chest to come back

[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.860]
Oh, and then of course when you said when you're out when you saw the ball that passed go through the linebacker's hands

[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.340]
Number 51 I forget his name when you saw the ball he didn't have to catch it

[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:21.680]
They're except that all he had it was knock it down and it just deflected just ever so slightly off his hand

[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.920]
And they get to complete down the 35-yard line. You knew that the fates were on the dolphin side

[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.080]
Yeah, well, you know, it's sometimes it maybe this is this is our year maybe who knows I think it is

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.340]

[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.100]
They took it when in doubt they took it right away from nobody's right and they just doing on their own

[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:01.360]

But instead he sits around stirring and stirring and stirring and whipping up all kinds of rumors and crap because he's a craft

[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.320]
Okay, like I said

[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.800]
You reach the point you say okay, that's it throughout material three hours after seven months

[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.100]
Of basically no calls on it showing a three hours throughout a material

[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:10.460]
And we're back to the same dregs the same quizzling the same simple dance the same people who think they're very amusing

[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:15.860]
You have nothing to say about anything you're the biggest bunch of losers that ever came down to pike in the history of mankind

[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.700]
This is a place man. This is not a place to live. This is a place to to vegetate

[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:22.580]
Vegetate

[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:29.820]
Maybe veggie will call in from boca because he's the epitome what this time is all about maybe we'll talk to what's his name in port st. Lucie

[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.100]
WQ I am

[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.300]

Hey good morning. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. How you doing? Okay, great to talk to you

[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.820]
How you doing? Let me say it again. I'm doing just as great as when I said four seconds ago. I'm doing great

[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.800]
I just want to turn my radio down

[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:15.920]
I just wanted to mention are you still into the sopranos? Are you still watching as much as you used to?

[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.920]
I'm watching it just as much as I used to. Yeah. Do you have any idea who you're speaking to?

[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.160]
Of course I do Neil. I'm kidding

[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:22.900]
Oh

[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.800]
Listen, thanks for the great call. What just happened there. Did you see that?

[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.660]
No, it was just like a little flash in one of the layup. Maybe it was under bulbs. Maybe it was from his call

[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.620]
5670560 pound 560 on the 18 T and T in Verizon Wireless line

[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:41.820]
WQ I am

[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.060]
Yes, sir

[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:53.400]
About who? Arthur Fieler. Yeah, yeah

[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.440]
How long you think he'll be out? Who said he's out

[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.940]
Discuss he's got a busted thumb call up mad dog. Okay, talk to him on one of them dumb sports shows

[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.340]
We're not doing a dumb sport show or even a smart sports show. How long do you think he'll be out? He'll be out

[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.060]
Is he gonna be out? I'm telling you what do you think do you think they're gonna? How long is it gonna? Yeah?

[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.200]
Who now? He gives a crap what I think. I don't care how long he's gonna be out

[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.860]
Maybe I missed the rest of the season. I don't wish him any bad luck. He's a good Jewish boy from Dartmouth

[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:26.420]
Got big ears big nose ugly. Do you think it's gonna rain tomorrow? I don't know

[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.120]
How about that asteroid when do you think it's gonna hit?

[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.120]
I know that this child is pretty good from Atlantic City subs

[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:42.000]
Always you see you see that right there is one of the reasons that the sports shows are so stupid in the first place

[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.100]
That's one of the main reasons beside the fact that you know, look

[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:46.920]
What's his name?

[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.580]
Ethnic sans

[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.960]
But that's one of the things. Well, what do you think what's your take?

[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:59.160]
Mm-hmm man. I know what I take every morning real regular

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:00.920]
WQAM

[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:03.840]
WQAM

[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.360]
Yeah, Neil I want to thank you for reading the great articles you read

[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.380]
You are the voice of reason thank God and people don't know it, but I think we're on the brink of a royal war

[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.820]
And I'm scared shitless about it because if we go into Iraq that's gonna be a hotbed

[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.880]
It's gonna explode in her face and retaliation could be and

[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.440]
um

[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.540]

[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.300]
Hi

[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:23.500]
Hi, we're talking quarterback J. Peter broke his right thumb late last night in the game against the number Broncos

[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.420]
But still might change you to the game's winning drive

[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.120]
A dolphin spokesman said there was no media estimate how long he'd be out well

[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:33.460]
They wanted Ray Lucas now you get your rate Lucas, huh? And you're gonna be real sorry guys

[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.620]
People was injured on the next last travel that often 40 24 22 went over the

[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.780]
Broncos on a past or Ricky Williams in the flat

[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.340]
I

[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.820]
Came down on a helmet felt something loose in your feet

[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:50.900]
We said but I was still able to grip the ball and throw it. He was still able to grip it

[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:55.760]
On the final drive after Denver is Jason Mabba to be but a move that he completed a 17 year past remaining

[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:01.500]
Michael a 22 year old to the seed record sitting up Olimdo Madre is clinching 53 year of fuel with six seconds

[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.920]

[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.180]
So it might be out of wild looks like

[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.040]
You got a fracture near your joint. I think I might you think that's what it is probably well find out tomorrow

[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.360]
Maybe Tane I could get healed up together. What are you saying go get the moves go get some good kishy

[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:26.160]
I just saw the moose he was on he said any we try any day without a shooting is a good day

[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.840]
Lee right and what we say on issue is any day without wolf blitzkrieg is a good day

[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.200]
So get his ass off of there immediately

[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:38.280]
So Jay Feele we don't know see if Jay Feele don't know how to how am I supposed to know this

[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.460]
Rarts is calling up asking me how long Jay Feele are gonna be out. So there's the info for you pali

[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.860]
Are you like his doctor or something? Yes

[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.160]
WQ I am hey, I want to talk to Neil speaking

[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:57.220]
Neil this is Chris how are you okay Chris? Hey, you should ring mo Howard's neck. He's gay

[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.440]
WQ I am

[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.640]
Well, Marv Thomas is a douchebag

[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:17.500]
WQ I am now yes, sir I want to talk about the dolphin broadcast real quick. I'm gonna take all the time you like

[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:21.980]
Uh, probably my ham is I don't know if uh mo is a good

[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:28.160]
Play by play guy or not. I have a play by play by play by play by play guys really make it judgment on that

[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.740]
But the problem I have is you know what I tune into the dolphins

[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.140]
I tune in for the color guy. I mean Jim Manage has always been the star of that show in my opinion

[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.480]
Because you know, I'm watching it on tv. I'm at the game listening to it on the radio on my headset

[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.920]
I know what's happening. I want to know why and I think this year that's been lacking the why

[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.700]
It we're getting all the what none of the why

[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:53.100]
We're getting all the what what we're getting all the what you know, you know, he's too verbose

[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:56.760]
He doesn't look you know gives him enough time because he wants to be the center of attraction

[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.780]
I don't understand that but they came up with that cocking me idea of putting norlato else a giri on a sideline

[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.940]
And to be in a third man in the abroad cast which would have taken even more time away from the mad dog

[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.360]
Mo was all a favor of that is what I'm hearing. That's what I was told on friday

[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.060]
I mean Jim he wants to be the centerpiece man. He wants to be the superstar. He don't want anybody stepping on his parade

[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.060]
Uh, I don't get into I mean whatever he might be good play by

[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:26.540]
Yes, the fact is I just want more I want more colors more mad dog more mad dog and less mo

[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:27.460]
Exactly

[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.620]
Mo mad dog okay, thank you. I'll pass that along. I'm sure you'll have no effect pass that along tell gildi

[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.420]
Okay, if you can get us out of those ass well that was terrible this morning

[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.300]
We just he just left us hang in there between him and the zack

[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.200]
Zach of course was having a big mack attack

[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:50.600]
My he was probably like sitting there in morning reconsidering that he gave you that last chocolate muffin out of the 15 that he ate

[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.580]
I still have it. Maybe do you want to look back huh?

[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:58.360]
Looks really chocolatey. Does he really? Yeah, I'll split it with it. I

[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.540]
Should spit on it right now. How big is it pretty good? What do you mean you should spit on it?

[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:07.020]
To keep you from getting it so that's why I wonder what diet I'm not gonna go to what I see

[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.500]
Meantain cheese that fat filled the sandwich stuff the tongue's gonna swell up. You're gonna swallow your tongue

[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.340]
It's already swelled up not the tongue though. I was watching that show before an MTV and that's your fault

[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.340]
It's swold up a little bit. I know it's not easy to tell but believe me

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:20.860]
WQ I am

[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.460]
Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah

[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:29.240]
Did you hear about the riots in India because of Jerry Falwell's? Yes, I already had that story on thank you very much sir

[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.920]
Way ahead of you guys, okay?

[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:38.080]
Hand it on over an hour ago five people died because Jerry Falwell and then the best part of the deal is they set on 60 minutes last night

[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.820]
When Bob Simon came into that follow up little piece at the end of the show

[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:45.320]
Yeah, Jerry Falwell's comment is he wishes that 60 minutes wouldn't have repeated his quote

[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.440]
Is not it instead of apologizing instead of saying hey, I wish I wouldn't have said that he wishes

[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:57.640]
They wouldn't have broadcast it or even it came out the wrong way what a disgusting obnoxious fat-faced son of a bitch

[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.480]
That's the best I can say for him who was a burger a facial putty

[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:06.960]
And I'm delighted that those fags moved in across the street remember I had that story about there in the Virginia where but hell it is

[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.680]
Sick disgusting bigoted nasty hateful sal that's what you are Jerry

[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.380]
I hope they catch you with a billy goat

[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.680]
WQ I am

[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.400]

We're happy you're taking calls together the whole Dutch community

[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.260]
But the whole Dutch community, yeah, by the way, how come you people are so cheap?

[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.100]
Uh, well, I guess I don't know

[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.820]
Yeah, I guess comes from the war trying to live up to that Dutch treat crap yeah, I know

[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.120]
What

[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:07.100]
I didn't know that yeah, he died. Oh brother. He died. Yeah, it's a big freak of humor tomorrow. Everybody probably get drunk

[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.800]
I can see him all sitting out there right by the grasshopper just getting stoned off their ass

[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.840]
The bulldog probably end the bulldog right

[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:19.140]
And listen, it's good to mix up the show over

[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.440]
Okay, totesines

[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.420]
567 05 60 pound 5 60 got to get back to Amsterdam see this summer that was just bad

[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:32.080]
You know just between the uh flu and then the other thing that came back and then fallen down

[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.180]
There's a couple of stairs which I didn't want to talk about because every time I go over there fall down and people are gonna say

[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.180]
Yeah, he's falling out because he's stoned out his ass

[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.340]
Right

[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.480]
Well, they're gonna get you're gonna come up with something you know

[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.920]
Because you were chasing some hot young guy

[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.720]
No, I keep my balance when I do that

[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:53.980]
Yeah, I keep bra I'm very good at that's why I got my new balance shoes

[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.600]
And your balance for life balance for life that's right unbalanced for life

[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.360]
So what's that thing look like that the brownie hound? I mean that I just want to take a look at it

[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.180]
Okay, don't necessarily want to put it in my mouth. It looks really good. Oh, it's from the wild bean cafe

[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.640]
Oh the wild bean well of Zach and eat that let me ask you my as fat as Zach am I even in his league?

[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:18.940]
No, am I in his league? No, I don't even know if I've ever been his like he's got to weigh like about 350 when you think he's a tub man

[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.020]
Oh, that I don't want that all right, you're right. Well, maybe a little bit

[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.560]
Don't put your tongue on it Jesus Christ now that I know where your tongue has been. Oh, man

[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.020]
Airby nook and cranny every nook and granny

[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.040]
Every ass that's ever come down to Pike

[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.080]
George said hey, I like

[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.380]
No brother like I said have a good time with I might have crap. I'm doing unbalanced for life

[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.860]
So I went off a little bit today because I didn't bring anything for my sack because quite frankly true. I well

[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.480]
WQ I am

[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:52.360]
Yes, sir

[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.600]
What is it?

[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.180]
Do you have any idea what that was?

[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.480]
Craig number saying what

[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:08.160]
Obviously, who hello? Who I see WQ I am. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I'm up to disagree with something you said earlier. Can't do that

[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.700]
And by the way welcome back. It'll probably a short lift for a phone line. Yes

[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:19.020]
But last night on the end during the ballgame you didn't hear thighs and they were saying

[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:23.680]
But everybody is made made made and they have to roll the damn hurls

[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.780]
But that's okay because if you want to be you know to pretend you're like a tag

[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.500]
And you want to be a little greasy especially with Columbus day coming up today

[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.140]
They were trying to like grease it up a little bit. That's okay

[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:37.620]
Nothing that drives me nuts is Joanne to use to do this. She's perfect unbroken. Perfect unbroken English

[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.820]
While doing the marlins games and like leave on her nandas with

[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:46.140]
Yeah, but see that that was his southern California roots. See that was his west coast roots with his

[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.060]
Chicano thing

[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.600]
Hey come up and say now batting

[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:53.780]
My gosh, which his name is Joanne Hill, so he's one of them too, you know

[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:57.140]
Hey, and also be back on call which you played a few times

[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:03.560]
It's matter like a couple of hours on the overnight sports shows. It was being like ridiculed nationwide. It was being ridiculed

[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.720]
Yeah, by the uh by the eye guys on the overnight spot

[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:14.080]
So well, you know what screw them? Yeah, the calm home or so. I'm not gonna look the greatest sports casters

[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:19.520]
Harry Carrie Bob Prince. They're all home. We're so okay. We like our homeers and our home was okay

[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.700]
You gotta have a little entertainment because more times the night the games that boring is hell right? That's right

[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.900]
Yes, this weekend was certainly an exception both in the college and the pro

[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:33.240]
Yeah, and that's why you're the first guy that seems like all uh hyped up about it. This audience man in dead is a doormel

[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.620]
I thought I was amazed I

[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.220]
You know the folks the ringing all day and I was surprised that I'd be able to get in and make up you know even get in on a line

[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.540]
No problem. You're right. Everybody's been bitching in Monin's thing get the call back at its time

[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.620]
And and now that they're gonna probably have to play Ray Lucas and they're gonna be saying oh gee

[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:51.140]
We want to feed her back. He was the best man. You know, that's a bunch of phoneies

[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.660]
Well, it's like having me else in closing

[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.880]
The question

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:55.820]
Yeah

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.020]
Don't get that little bit too much inflection there. He crushed it

[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:04.760]
He crushed it. It's no good. It's off to the left. Uh hurricane's win

[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.900]
He's terrible man. I don't care what anybody says

[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.440]
I know he's got a lot of boyfriends in his building and it's not personal

[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.140]
Would Joe I liked you is a good guy. I said that the other day I'll say it again

[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.600]
I don't know why I have to keep doing that because there's a difference

[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.880]
See I'm trying to point out here. There's a difference not with Mo as opposed to with Joe with Mo as business and it's personal

[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.340]
Because he's a major asshole

[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:30.440]
With no sense of humor with a gigantic big puffed up ego like a big boofo-toe man a big big fat ego

[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.140]
That's mode. That's why you don't want mad dogs saying too much under he must have cracked his panel

[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.700]
They must add a changes guy then the pens at the end of the game there

[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:40.420]
Not because it often pulled it out in the linda moda kick that great 53-yard feelable

[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.060]
Because when a mad dog went nuts

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.680]
And I'll say you know we thought that Rick weaver had a big ego as he did

[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.980]
But at least he kind of like tried to blend in a little bit with a mad dog

[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.760]
See the difference I want to play that again

[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:04.040]
All right, all right all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Of course he's dead now, but you know

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.920]
Now he was okay. Reki he just he was uh prick

[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.560]
I got along with the fun. He was a prick but but he's he also had a gigantic ego

[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.140]
But the fact of the matter is number one

[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:21.520]
He was he was the greatest broadcast ever the dolphin's advocate with anybody says which he did with our pool except for those phony votes

[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.600]
He was he was good

[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:27.820]
He smelled very bad. He had very bad personal hygiene. There was number two and number three

[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:32.820]
He was just self self-absorbing self-centered but even on a personal level. He was a better guy than this guy

[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:37.580]
You could get along with him. He had a sense of humor got along with him fine. Yeah, I did too professional right

[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:45.200]
And even you know, I mean what a shock it was when we took our show over there to that station and he and have any problem with it

[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.000]
Even took his commentary out there in the beginning

[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.380]
I don't know if you remember when the beginning they had that new hour loaded up

[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:54.100]
There was Paul Harvey and then I was I said hey guys this ain't gonna fly in like the second day

[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:58.560]
Even bill wise that Yahoo took all that stuff out there. He didn't care what he give a crap

[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:03.800]
So see there is a difference folks between a guy that wants to be the center of attraction all the time

[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.240]
And don't want anybody else saying five words in a guy who at least in spite of his stain and fortune

[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.200]

content

[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:51.060]
Aren't you

[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:56.620]

[01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:02.500]
schwarze of thought. Is you there because you are

[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:08.260]
Hatton Boop, Lippley Throne? Is you the black-head,

[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:15.500]
Anger, Mammar, who'll be smart? Does they like how you

[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:20.640]
have their shoes come to leave the house away?

[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:27.040]
Washington, talk the whitetess cause. George, it's

[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.440]
Junior, say he trusts you, come to leave you.

[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:37.360]
Who's there to lie lies on the greedy oil wall?

[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:44.000]
But then he'll make you clean all the white house bathrooms.

[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:50.100]
The cup of scenes, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.

[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:57.080]
They tell you no where's the end of the godly floor.

[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.060]
Your cold-skinned hills make them all rich and few.

[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.920]
You'll not be like a look you'll like it be velcro.

[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:15.960]
It's your p.o.a. you to be that don't you still?

[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:23.080]
One day while you be flippant back, you may realize

[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.940]
That they're treating you just like you're as the roll.

[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.480]
That's when your head will move from side to side,

[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.080]
Drowned to leave the house.

[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.360]
Until Bush and Rameer, they be cracked as old.

[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.560]
Well, 34 or 560 W.Q.M. the mad dog will be here at one,

[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.860]
and then you can call him and tell him that you want Moe.

[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.940]
What is it? Moe, a mad and less Moe.

[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:54.880]
You know what they want? So PR Ralph faxes me this.

[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.840]
How come we didn't have any woman call to give me the information?

[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.260]
The only woman we had all day was that one that hung up on again just like

[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.160]
a year ago, it's going to be a song to dance about how Bush was rubbing his hands

[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.600]
together with Glee after 9-11.

[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:07.640]
That bitch, which goes to show you, but like I've always told it is,

[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:09.100]
there's a handful of callers.

[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.280]
Look it out out of two and a half hours today that I've been taking calls

[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.320]
or whatever it's been three and a half.

[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.160]
Look at how many of these people.

[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.680]
I'm not saying they're all bad either,

[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.280]
but look at how many of them we know who they are.

[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.040]
Thought of what I'm saying.

[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:19.400]
Oh yeah.

[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.360]
Know them well.

[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.520]
Oh man, including ones that run for like about a half a second.

[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.260]
Guiding light.

[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.560]
Alan sneaks out of the hospital to access the spawning file.

[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.060]
Saw that.

[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.600]
Alex and I changed my mind.

[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:33.300]
I'm John Collins is doing a good job on it.

[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:33.480]
Sure.

[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.220]
I hate to tell you that.

[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.240]
I know what you hate her like poison that I generally do too.

[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.640]
But she's an obnoxious bitch and that's what she's playing.

[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.040]
She's doing a good job.

[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.620]
She's really hard on the eyes.

[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:42.840]
Yeah.

[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:44.520]
And.

[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.160]
Alexandra finds Alan at home.

[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:47.820]
Philip is done.

[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.820]
Wayne learns Olivia Plants, the mayor, Alan in the hospital.

[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.520]
Cassie dreams about Richard who tells her to thank Riva.

[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.260]
Cassie Patux when she receives another black rose.

[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.660]
Cassie learns that Olivia spent the money she planned

[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.620]
on for using a paying off the mob.

[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.880]
Mara Moves in with Bill Ben and Remy.

[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:03.900]
Remy.

[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.620]
Gus terms Alexandra.

[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:07.900]
Tony yells at Eden for missing work.

[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:08.500]
But doesn't fire.

[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.300]
Harley tells Gus that Eden's part of black,

[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:11.420]
the black mailing ring.

[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:13.060]
Gus is furious when he learns Harley,

[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.180]
pretended to be Eden.

[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.680]
It's learned about her past.

[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.340]
There you go.

[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:16.740]
That's it.

[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.980]
When she was in the flop house there in Chicago.

[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320]
So that's the update.

[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.420]
I guess we don't have any women out there listening or at least not

[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.260]
they're going to call me certainly and give me any information.

[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.060]
Except that one I want to repeat the same thing I hung up on our

[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.000]
a year ago about and I hung up on her again.

[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.620]
Nice going to.

[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:31.520]
Excellent.

[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.320]
Silly bitch.

[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.120]
WQ I am.

[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:37.560]
WQ I am.

[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.560]
WQ I am.

[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.020]
WQ I am.

[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.740]
Hey, look at Neil, please.

[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.160]
Speaking.

[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.520]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:46.860]
Okay.

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:50.980]
I'm glad you're taking calls again although I don't have no complaints about

[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:51.920]
your other format.

[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.240]
Yeah, well, this will last too long.

[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.000]
I got a couple thoughts about foul

[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.400]
wetland, the bombing, the visa and

[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:58.980]
healthwear.

[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.440]
What a, and I'm not a bush reporter, but what a perfect opportunity this is for

[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.480]
Bush to come out and not only distance himself from the

[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.020]
far right wing of his car.

[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.000]
He could have happened, man.

[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:11.740]
Not going to happen.

[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.240]
You're dreaming.

[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.840]
Not only could he distance himself from foul well in all of this rhetoric,

[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:20.420]
but he could also use the opportunity to, on the other hand,

[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.300]
that's great.

[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.520]
You know, why freedom is so great in America?

[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:27.400]
And I'm saying the old police, I can't stand what you're saying, but I'll defend you.

[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.080]
Sure, he's not going to come out and alienate the constituency that put him there in the first place.

[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:31.880]
He's not going to do that.

[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.320]
That's where he's at now.

[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.520]
He's, uh, he's locked in.

[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.960]
Stamined by foul well, it's so, so,

[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:38.620]
whopper.

[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.680]
Uh, uh, I've removed from anything that we've got.

[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.820]
Well, let me ask you something, sir.

[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.260]
It was, it was aired on 60 minutes a week ago last night.

[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:45.540]
So that's eight days ago now.

[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:48.300]
Have you heard the president say anything to repudiate or rejected?

[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:49.060]
Not a peep.

[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.300]
Right. And you won't.

[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.300]
And you won't.

[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.360]
The other thought I had is, it's, it's too bad.

[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.720]
It's the perfect opportunity to distraint what freedom in America is all about.

[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.180]
Yeah, okay.

[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:58.480]
Thank you.

[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.520]
You said that about four times.

[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:01.080]
This guy don't want to get it.

[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.180]
He doesn't want to understand it.

[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.680]
Sure, you don't want to get it.

[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.920]
Freedom used to be about an American.

[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.140]
You're living in the past, sir.

[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:07.920]
It's all I can tell you.

[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.000]
You're living in the past.

[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.660]
They want to Christianize America.

[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.820]
That's what this whole business about, about religious-based, uh,

[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.240]
charities and all.

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.260]
All of a sudden, bullcrap.

[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.480]
More tax breaks for the religious right.

[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.920]
More, uh, opportunity for them to interfere in, uh, in government.

[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.140]
That's, that's what it's all about.

[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.660]
And that's why these people are having all the rallies and trying to get,

[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.820]
that's only three weeks from tomorrow.

[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.140]
It's going to be the election, boys and girls.

[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.180]
And these people are out there, uh, troops all whipped up into a frenzy again.

[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.940]
Because they got the keys to the kingdom now.

[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.380]
They're going to run with it on the road to Armageddon.

[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.980]
See, that's another reason it's so pleasant to be in Canada.

[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.120]
The radioactive cloud will fall on you just to save.

[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:50.420]
No.

[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:51.800]
No.

[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.600]
We got a block that the sea and tower.

[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:55.680]
It's going to fall into Lake Ontario.

[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:56.960]
Watch out in Rochester.

[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.000]
You're going to be in big trouble.

[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.440]
Here's the fact that says I'm scared, Schmittless.

[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.460]
Over these cars, that asteroid can't hit soon enough for me.

[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:08.980]
Todd Nahaliwood says,

[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:10.920]
P.S. the car is eat beagle-ass.

[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.740]
And then he quotes,

[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.520]
I'm getting all the what and under the why,

[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.500]
Mo Mad Lessmo.

[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:17.540]
There you go.

[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:20.280]
That's what we want.

[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:20.860]
Lessmo.

[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.600]
In fact, I don't know why you people are such a bunch of

[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:22.960]
pussies.

[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:24.280]
You're calling me and repinting them and ask,

[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.180]
which is okay with me.

[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.200]
But call them up tomorrow morning and say,

[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.600]
Hey, listen, how come you don't want to let the mad dogs say nothing?

[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:31.740]
You jackass.

[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.060]
Right.

[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.800]
Why don't you go along there like, uh, like Mr. Weaver did, okay?

[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.600]
And be like a team on there.

[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.540]
All right.

[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.120]
All right.

[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:40.580]
All right.

[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:40.720]

[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.560]
That's the way you do it.

[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.740]
Now, now, did you tell that story on the air about why he lost a job at Westwood

[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.240]
One allegedly?

[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.120]
Of course not.

[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.140]
I just found out Friday afternoon.

[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.140]
Well, what's the story in a nutshell?

[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.200]
Is that he was at the Masters at Atlanta golf tournament?

[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:55.780]
Right.

[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.940]
Covering it for a Westwood one.

[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.180]
This is alleged by the way.

[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.580]
This is the story we're hearing in the building.

[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.800]
And one of the Westwood One big waves wanted him to do a little bit of a crossover

[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.780]
with someone else.

[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:04.960]
Right.

[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.840]
And he told them no, it wasn't part of this contract.

[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:08.700]
And the guy asked him again,

[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.100]
really nice.

[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.660]
He said, look, I understand it's not part of your contract,

[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.520]
but it would really be nice and helpful.

[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.820]
Get a little bit of a cross promotion.

[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.460]
Something like that.

[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:15.380]
This is the story I got.

[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.460]
And he said, no, F dad, it's not part of my F in contract.

[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.140]
No, I'm not going to F and do that.

[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.180]
No, because he's a big shot, man.

[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:23.520]
And walked off.

[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.600]
And that was that was the beginning of the end.

[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:26.840]
The ball started rolling right there.

[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:28.600]
Well, how do you like that?

[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.280]
I sure comes as a great surprise to me.

[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:30.640]
Not.

[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:31.700]
But that's just what I heard.

[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.920]
And he goes as side of the inverse.

[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:33.960]
Again, that's just alleged.

[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.980]
We emphasize that emphatically.

[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.800]
But nevertheless, that's what the rumors around town.

[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.000]
Twenty before one at five, 60 WQA,

[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.240]
and we all have different lifestyles,

[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:44.160]
therefore need different products to make us feel better

[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:44.720]
and be healthier.

[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:47.600]

black walnut.

[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:02.800]
Black walnut juice.

[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.300]
Look for audio-meds, three new formulas,

[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.560]

[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.340]
All right, all right.

[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.820]
5.60 W-Q-A-M-Anc,

[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.020]
classic gay spoils are saying down with Ricky Williams.

[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.520]
And up with Elvis.

[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.840]
Yes, your body.

[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:07.720]
Thank you.

[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.880]
Thank you very much.

[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.040]
Thank you.

[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:14.140]
I want you to know how old your body is.

[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:14.140]

[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:15.500]
You're all used to sports homes.

[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:16.720]
Oh, squeeze.

[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:18.660]
My juxtap tie to.

[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.020]
Oh, squeeze.

[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.760]
My sport hold buns.

[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:22.580]
Hey, man.

[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:23.620]
Squeeze, squeeze.

[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:24.720]
My juxtap tie to.

[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.160]
Golden piece of motion.

[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.480]
Golden piece of let go by the gate

[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.980]
and play the centeloccurruel that you can spray my days.

[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:36.780]
He's a sport holding train.

[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.860]
Probably glow that he'd have.

[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:45.560]
On a roof for his team like a sport holiday.

[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.820]
You want a sport jockly?

[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.060]
Wrap around your neck.

[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.100]
You like men and anger?

[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.420]
And smell of sweat?

[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.660]
You want their brown hole?

[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.800]
Close to your nose.

[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.780]
You want a sport jockly?

[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:04.160]
Wrap around your neck.

[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.000]
Spoon holes while the beat.

[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.680]
Fins over chin.

[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.480]
If they could get 20 shots.

[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.260]
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.820]
Those Chicago bands.

[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.320]
What's he saying?

[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:28.120]
You will, you will.

[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.880]
Our dozen are so bad watching sport bag listeners.

[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.040]
What is this?

[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.180]
Gerbach.

[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:34.880]
The noodle fair noodle hole.

[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.160]
560 WQAF.

[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.860]
Proud to be your official Elvis.

[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.440]
Elvis Gerbach's born to all headgoaters.

[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.280]
Yeah, we were.

[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.720]
Dude, that last time I played that.

[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.700]
But I know he's not saying what it sounds like he's saying.

[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:47.860]
You know what it sounds like he's saying?

[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:48.120]
What?

[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.880]
It's 1245 at 560 WQM.

[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.720]
Our friend Rich Pactor, another one out of control.

[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.080]
Boy, these people are something, you know.

[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:54.860]
Look at that.

[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.340]
We've got to put into a frenzy with another facts.

[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.280]
Joe Angel is Colombian.

[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.240]
That's why he rolls his aras says Rich Pactor.

[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.940]
Roll up the rim.

[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.960]
Yeah, they got a spot in Canada.

[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.680]
They're a roll up the rim to win.

[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.660]
But that's Scottish.

[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.900]
Scottish, where they have those keltz.

[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.940]
In fact, I've seen some of those guys with the keltz and the big socks.

[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.560]
It was Prince Watt's name, Charles.

[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.580]
Keltz and heist writings that come up to like their crotch

[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:22.780]
up to their black nuts.

[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.360]
560.560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.260]
452 votes on that pool.

[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.960]
President Bush's approval rating is about 63%.

[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.580]
What do you like about him the most?

[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.740]
Absolutely nothing is a disaster.

[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.860]
200 and it's changing again.

[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:39.840]
Come on.

[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:40.820]
285.

[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.360]
62.9%.

[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.900]
63% which leaves 37%.

[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.420]
You following?

[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:47.020]
You see this?

[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.900]
Put this in connection with that poll we had on Friday.

[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.840]
There was a couple of real suspect calls.

[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.940]
As transparent as a paint of glass.

[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.700]
Oh yeah, well, you know, there's all this other stuff.

[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.800]
You know, it gets really ponderous.

[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.080]
All those articles about Bush and fashion Bush.

[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.040]
Now that hockey season started and we had one call about hockey.

[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.880]
The undefeated quality losing overtime.

[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.680]
But the path is with three points in two games.

[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.160]
No.

[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.260]
First off, because there ain't no interest.

[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:09.920]
There's no knowledge.

[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:10.620]
There's no interest.

[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.420]
There's no nothing.

[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.200]
But please, please talk about anything.

[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.300]
Don't you go on here and tell the truth.

[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.420]
Don't you go on here and like this old, the Bushmeisters.

[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:22.020]
Because that's on American.

[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.760]
And all the gun squeezes too.

[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:26.340]
We never even got to any of those stories today.

[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.540]
The snipers.

[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.980]
Crazy people with guns, man.

[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.460]
And the public, oh yeah, well, you know,

[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:35.680]
not going to take away our guns.

[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.220]
W-Q-I-M.

[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:40.440]
You can't see it.

[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.740]
W-Q-I-M.

[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.100]
W-Q-I-M.

[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.380]
Hello, Neil.

[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:46.840]
Yes.

[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.580]
Always good to hear you, Neil.

[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:49.200]
Here I am.

[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:50.980]
Two things.

[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:51.900]
I wanted to talk to you.

[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.040]
Did you see those commercials voting on smoking,

[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:57.040]
whether to ban smoking in public.

[01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.860]
Restaurants and stuff like that.

[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.540]
I don't know if that's going to happen here in Florida.

[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:01.920]
Ah.

[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.200]
In Western, you can't even smoke in your house.

[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.020]
You can't smoke in a boys room.

[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.280]
Because I keep on seeing commercials saying vote yes on this number

[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.140]
or for something like that, whether to ban smoking in restaurants.

[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.720]
I was just wondering if that pertains to South Florida

[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.740]
or somewhere else, another state or not.

[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.600]
They're going to do all these anti-smoking,

[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.240]
these militants.

[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.100]
They're going to do it everywhere.

[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:25.820]
Pretty soon, smoking a cigarette will be like smoking a joint in public.

[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:27.340]
You want to go to jail for five to ten?

[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.280]
I mean, I have nothing against smokers.

[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:30.360]
I mean, I used to smoke myself,

[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:31.560]
but I mean, when you're in a restaurant

[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.680]
and you're enjoying a good meal,

[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.320]
the last thing you want to do is smoke smoke

[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.980]
when you're enjoying a good state.

[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.000]
Unless it's a good cigar.

[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.860]
I mean, cigars are cool,

[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.460]
but I mean, the people that smoke a smoke a Murray,

[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:43.960]
you know, they're that way.

[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:45.480]
They have that little attitude.

[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.100]
They're that way?

[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.700]
Yeah, there's nothing more of that.

[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.500]
People who smoke cigars are gay.

[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:51.620]
No, no.

[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:54.420]
They're just that, you know, that machismo,

[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:56.760]
you know, you're like me, like me.

[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.380]
I'm pretty much.

[01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:58.600]
No, you're an exception.

[01:47:58.780 --> 01:47:59.220]
We love you.

[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:00.320]
Yeah.

[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:03.520]
And another thing that's pretty good book about,

[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.180]
it's called Cuba Confidential.

[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:07.260]
It's a pretty good,

[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.200]
objective unbiased look at the hardline ex-oz,

[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:11.860]
you know, cast.

[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.440]
Oh, God, I don't want to hear about them.

[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.260]
No, no, but actually,

[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.700]
there's one of the reasons I despise being back here

[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.640]
is those freaking exos.

[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.400]
I saw Rosanna Dana on earlier than I wanted to puke.

[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.600]
Actually, I mean, which I'm a pretty young guy

[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.960]
and I didn't realize that there were actually a lot of hardline ex-oz

[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.060]
that were actually put in jail for bombing places.

[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:31.680]
So I mean,

[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:32.820]
I'm no kidding.

[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.820]
I mean, well, I totally did not know that.

[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.520]
And I, you know, I really don't want to know

[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.760]
that Cubans have something in common

[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.360]
with these crazy Palestinians, you know.

[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:41.620]
And actually, we do.

[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:41.920]

[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:42.940]
No, no, but you see,

[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.560]
now, but these people weren't suicide bombers.

[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.120]
These were people of just, they were, they were, they were, they were artists.

[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.680]
We were smarter, I guess, to the public.

[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.160]
There you go.

[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.500]
You know, like that wacko, what was his name, Bosch?

[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.100]
Well, let's go back.

[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.120]
That's because the Cubans couldn't find seven virgins.

[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.340]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:56.880]
You too.

[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.240]
See ya.

[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.900]
5-6, and now, how come this thing is acted up again?

[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:01.840]
I don't know.

[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:13.640]
I left here in August that thing was working magnificent,

[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.440]
just like clockwork.

[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.380]
So I don't know what you did with it.

[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.920]
Yeah, I went through it to the floor.

[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.140]
I don't, I don't know what Carlos did with it while I was doing that.

[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:21.440]
Got the window.

[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.040]
Must have pockied around with it, man.

[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.160]
Carlos that, uh, said,

[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.260]
I was just, they'll know a little by little more.

[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.920]
She's, uh, truly like big chunks of paper

[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.300]
are coming on instead of one sheet, then it's two and it's five.

[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.900]
And it's like the, then the whole rim of paper comes through

[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.420]
there every time a fax prints out.

[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:37.720]
Headed, rim.

[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:39.940]
When it doubt, rim it out.

[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:41.340]
Now, here's one, pal.

[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.580]
Oh, it's big, dex halfway in.

[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:46.880]
It's side of Louise, tell you why.

[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.040]
Yes, well, you know Louise, all those guys, what are your people?

[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.520]
They're looking for big dex.

[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.040]
Highway in.

[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.520]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:57.500]
Uncle Neil.

[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.400]
The Joseph Gackie, J.P.O.

[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.860]
Piedler, who'd you rather sleep with?

[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:03.620]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:04.840]
Hi, Neil.

[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.500]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:09.180]
I just wanted to talk about some that's really frost in my fat ass.

[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:09.560]
Yes.

[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:11.160]
You mentioned the sniper.

[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.260]
Why do media types have to give these people moniker's?

[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:18.400]
Have you heard on like a fax?

[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.520]
They have to be calling them the, let's see.

[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.960]
No, I'm 6'10 this morning.

[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:28.920]
I heard the tarot card sniper, the dealt way killer.

[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.480]
It's the same thing with the guy, that kid that was bombing mailboxes and stuff.

[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:39.680]
They had to call him the smiley face bomber.

[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:39.960]
Right.

[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:42.120]
Because he was trying to make the pattern on the map.

[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.700]
It drives me crazy.

[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:47.400]
We'll see if it's like a self-fulfilling thing because they want to have more and more of these

[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.580]
copycat can also, so they have more to put on the ear.

[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:50.960]
Good for weather ratings.

[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.380]
Do you like to take the hell out of me?

[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:54.420]
That's all I want.

[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:54.920]
Okay.

[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.200]
You guys can have your back.

[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:56.720]
Thanks.

[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.000]
Watch out for the, what was the guy in California, the stranger, what the hell they call him?

[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:05.040]
Oh, that Julio.

[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:07.100]
Whatever.

[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.420]
Well, I'll come with, whatever the hell's name was.

[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.140]
They called him the, the crazy spick.

[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:17.340]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon, where I was lying.

[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.340]
We got the mad dog coming along at one o'clock who's pretty fired up and pissed off.

[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.500]
Not only because Dave Fido has got a broken thing,

[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.220]
but also because of the fact he got stepped on there at the end of the game.

[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.320]
He's acting a little gay.

[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.000]
He asked me.

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.680]
Him and Mo are having like a little countertops.

[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:30.080]
Aren't they?

[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:30.360]
No.

[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.200]
Thought you think that would be great?

[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.560]
What getting into my brawl right in the middle of a dolphin broadcast?

[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.400]
Like trying to grab the microwave from each other.

[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.240]
There's my turn.

[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.080]
Oh god damn it.

[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:41.740]
I'd listen to that.

[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.180]
Yeah, even George would tune in for that.

[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:45.840]
Hey, don't forget to join the overnight guys.

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.640]

It's the 49ers at Seattle tonight at gasbees in Boca.

[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.420]
Kind of an unappetizing matchup.

[01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:58.740]
You know what?

[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.780]
Maybe they'll show you some good naked pictures of Moses.

[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:04.820]
Hey, you know, there's never been a better time to buy a new home or refinancing

[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:05.360]
home.

[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.540]

[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.240]

I can dirty.

[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.040]
D-d-d-doy.

And that's why I think I'm gentle hot but jimping ship season.

[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:06.640]
The jams?

[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.400]
Where did I tell you?

[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.940]
You don't talk, do I say you can talk?

[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.160]
This is the beast.

[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:12.860]
I said shut up, fatso.

[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:14.140]
But you're like a father to me.

[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.120]
You don't talk to l'm done talking.

[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.160]
When I'm done talking, then you talk.

[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:18.960]
Okay, I'll...

[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.680]
Hey beast, come here.

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:20.420]
Come here.

[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.920]
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.020]
Mr. Golf Club.

[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:24.960]

This court sentences you to 20 years in Oz.

[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.220]
Would you invoke?

[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.400]
I had put a tag off my mattress.

[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:42.420]
Look like we'll be your bookmates.

[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:44.100]
The name's Mohal Adabin.

[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.200]

[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.560]
Nico, Nico, Fer.

[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.680]
You got so pan.

[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:51.160]
Nice.

[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:51.640]
Thank you.

[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.300]
Hey, you know,

[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.580]
what do you sell powder and drill, huh?

[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:57.060]
I'm gonna make you my woman.

[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.540]
Hey, nobody's gonna stop it.

[01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.240]
Scott!

[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.120]
Scott!

[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.580]
Who got you, pinky?

[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:01.840]

[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.700]
My child, Todd, you got 10 minutes.

[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.220]
Well, it was to be safe beneath.

[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.540]
Yo, both of you.

[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.080]
Yo, man.

[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.040]
You know, I knew linda blam over that.

[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.220]
Hey, so pretty.

[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:11.800]
I'm mad.

[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.140]
Okay.

[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.840]
Put on powder, so you'd be like that.

[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:14.980]
You know who I am?

[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:15.560]
No, come here.

[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.840]
Then don't pick it up now.

[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:17.880]
I'll be a blood man.

[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:18.740]
All right.

[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.660]
But I expect a print in the apology I might touch my...

[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.960]
That blue man, a book, Todd.

[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.080]
That yellow, blue man.

[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.040]
I'll pick the fraud.

[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.120]
This is...

[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.960]
This is...

[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:32.180]
Lord, and I'll see you now.

[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:32.600]
Thanks.

[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.660]
Well, Mr. David, hello, Warren.

[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.760]
Jack, Jack Gordon.

[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:38.880]
How can I help you?

[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:39.520]
You see, Warren?

[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.040]
Yeah.

[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.200]
I keep getting raped.

[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.560]
Is that a shame?

[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.560]
I'll look into it right away.

[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.140]
Thanks, Warren.

[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.080]
It's about time.

[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.080]
Some put it out.

[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:48.940]
Drop your pet.

[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.000]
I said, drop your pet.

[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:51.940]
This was odd.

[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:54.000]
Oh, favors no come, Chief.

[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.160]
No, no, no.

[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:57.720]
Let's rape, oh.

[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.400]
Radio big shot.

[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.760]
I guess now we pass the time away

[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:06.660]
in the Gale of Oz.

[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.160]
Drop 57 at 560 WQM, Addox, 10.

[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.240]
By Hank, I'll be doing a shot at Chulose this afternoon.

[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.980]
With that more 5 to 6, I don't see Patrick Sirtan

[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:17.420]
on the agenda for this week.

[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:18.380]
Like I said, he...

[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.560]
Once you change your name like that,

[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:21.320]
like Tony Dorset becomes Tony Dorset.

[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:23.820]
Once you change the way you'll be pronounced in your name,

[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.780]
then you get to be too big to be coming in for these

[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:27.080]
hour here and hour there, you know,

[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.400]
to kind of rate the print in this place.

[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:29.300]
Forget about that.

[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.180]
Then we got Hurricane Highline

[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.320]
tonight with a assimilating...

[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:32.920]
Terrific guy.

[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.720]
...who I'm sure will be like whipped up into a frenzy

[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:36.600]
about that nail-biting Hurricane victory

[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.000]
over the seminal on the Saturday.

[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.220]
Pretty exciting stuff, although this crowd

[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:41.440]
dead as a door nail is usual.

[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:42.660]
WQAM.

[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:44.240]
Hey, George.

[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:44.860]
Yeah.

[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.920]
George, listen, a bunch of those are going to start

[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:49.780]
pronouncing Howard's last name, David,

[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:52.260]
until he can get more raised name right.

[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.080]
Howard Dovid.

[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.020]
Howard...

[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:55.460]
No, Howard Dovid.

[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.080]
No, Dovid.

[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:57.120]
David?

[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:58.720]
Yeah, Dovid, like Mogen Dovid.

[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:00.920]
See, obviously a boy, huh?

[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:02.200]
You don't get it. Mogen Dovid.

[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.240]
You get that, don't you?

[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:03.600]
Sure.

[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:05.760]
WQAM.

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:08.520]
WQAM.

[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:10.540]
Hello.

[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:11.500]
Hello.

[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:13.660]
Hi, can I speak to Neil?

[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.160]
Speaking.

[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:15.780]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:16.200]
Great.

[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.400]
Neil, I heard last week you were having problems

[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:21.480]
with your DSL and Bell South and whatnot.

[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:22.120]
Yeah.

[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:25.560]
And somebody had sent you some information on M-Power.

[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.700]
I tell you what, be careful when you change

[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:31.620]
because these companies, they all go through Bell South.

[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.020]
Right.

[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:34.720]
We use M-Power and any time we have a problem,

[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.280]
they send the Bell South guy out.

[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.560]
And usually the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.

[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:39.760]
Right.

[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:40.600]
It's been a while.

[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:42.400]
We already got that here at QAM,

[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.020]
so we don't need somebody else who don't know what they're doing.

[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.080]
Well, that's great, Neil.

[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:47.080]
I just wanted to warn you.

[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:47.860]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:48.760]
Hey, thanks, buddy.

[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:50.620]
So whatever you do, don't call that M-Power guy.

[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:52.280]
He meant well, I guess we think,

[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.680]
although you never can be too sure.

[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.160]
I called him.

[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.660]
Yeah, George, he called him.

[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.800]
He called him and he didn't have a lot of money.

[01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:58.100]
And it's just a bunch of Bell South,

[01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:58.720]
step children.

[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.600]
And then of course, Spiro Canton,

[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.300]
Eric Bell South.

[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.820]
He called and left the message and George

[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:03.580]
tried to get back to him.

[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:05.580]
He kind of like danced around it and didn't bother.

[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.560]
Okay, once we passed the blame off on him,

[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.000]
who was it?

[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:09.420]
Oh, Netscape.

[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:09.840]
That's right.

[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.020]
There.

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:12.560]
I'll tell you, everybody's having the internet problems.

[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:13.480]
There's something going on.

[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:14.760]
You know, I don't want to get anybody panicky

[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:15.620]
or nervous, something like that.

[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:17.060]
But there's something going on.

[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.420]
And believe me when I tell you,

[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.180]
it ain't good.

[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.080]
You understand what I'm saying?

[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:25.220]
472 votes on a pool on 63% plus a George E.W.

[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:26.220]
Absolutely nothing.

[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:26.860]
He's a disaster.

[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.360]
They can't find nothing they like about him.

[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:29.260]
Even in big years.

[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.120]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:32.600]
Then you'll watch a show on FI-6,

[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.560]
the MQA.

[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:34.960]
My enemy for my hands.

[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.760]
If there's a button, I smell it.

[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:39.380]
Yes.
