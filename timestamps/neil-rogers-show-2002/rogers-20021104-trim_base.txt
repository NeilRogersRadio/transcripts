[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.660]
This is South Florida's only real source agent.

[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.920]
Have a look, you're like,

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.700]
Oh, thank you.

[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.940]
The broadcast crew station.

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.120]
SWQAM.com

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.820]
Or, or, or, or, or, or.

[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.380]
So your second talent error, no mention from Guilty.

[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.140]
I'm going home.

[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.180]
A bad day to quit sniffing the flu.

[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.420]
All right.

[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.820]
I'm the leader, I'm the leader, I'm the leader.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.280]
Get from the movie.

[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.340]
Yes.

[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.340]
With your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.

[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.200]
I'm the leader, I'm the leader.

[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.020]
What you be doing.

[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.400]
It's the old-fashioned, black-ged, token-shorts-and-starts.

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.080]
Is you day because you were at home, whoop-liop-liop-loop-loop?

[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.760]
Is you deflected and dramatic, whoop-y-small?

[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.740]
Does they like how you shot their shoes, gonna lead the...

[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.420]
Oh, the way you was and how the white is gone.

[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.680]
Hello, George.

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.640]
George is junior, say he trust you, can't believe you.

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.260]
Who tell our allies on the greedy oil roll?

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.020]
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms.

[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.260]
The cup of the thing, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.

[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.260]
They tell you don't wear sandals, can't believe no.

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.280]
Your cold chiptool will make them wanna wretch and you.

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.140]
Your nappy-legged, not your slide, it'd be very flow.

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.200]
It's you, be what you, to be that token-stool.

[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.120]
One day while you be sniffing, fast-paced, you may realize

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.140]
That they're treating you just like you're as the roll.

[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.740]
That's when your head will move from side to side, from the lead.

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.520]
It's a push and from it, they be cracked and as old.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.040]
Hello, hello.

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.320]
Hello.

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760]
Yeah, this is turning Richard Friedman, I just wanted to give Neil

[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620]
Would entertain my going on for a few minutes and discuss the metarail sales tax.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.080]
Oh my god, my good close friend Richard Friedman?

[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.760]
Yes.

[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.940]
That's me.

[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.980]
Hi, Neil.

[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.580]
Hi, man.

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.900]
I see you didn't always gonna pick up cold, probably flipped your lid.

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240]
It did, and it's...

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.120]
How many ask you this question?

[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940]
You didn't get your piece of the same place that MoldGod has it, did you?

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.880]
Come on, Richard.

[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.500]
Anyway, moving right along.

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.940]
Go right ahead because you're our champion.

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.020]
You're the only great white hope.

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.840]
Thank you.

[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.500]
Now let me ask you this question before we go on.

[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.560]
Are you offended by the bit I just played that condolese?

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.540]
Is that offensive to you?

[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.700]
No.

[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.260]
Okay.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.900]
No, because I think Sattire is the greatest part of Merck and you, or do you ever hear Mark Twain?

[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.400]
No.

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.260]
I heard Luminabner, though.

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.920]
Anyway, go ahead.

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.120]
I heard him, too.

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.540]
No, I think what you're doing is beautiful.

[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.560]
I love you stuff.

[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.180]
I know you do.

[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.440]
Don't be sucking around just because I'm going to give you a chance for a few times.

[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.920]
No, I...

[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.100]
Take all the time you want because tomorrow's election day, maybe, and believe you may.

[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.840]
And let me just say this before we go ahead.

[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.460]
The new technique, see this is the reason that Fax was slamming me and John Gibson in this Heather Broadness whole other business,

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.040]
the new approach, which it took me all weekend to figure it out with Ellis and Zollabot,

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.940]
because they don't care about me.

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.520]
The message to Black voters is we can't...

[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.360]
We can't force you to stay home anymore.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.460]
We can't prevent you from voting the ways we have in a past because too many people are watching too closely.

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.340]
So what we'll do is convince you the liberals are really a bunch of racists.

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.000]
They're not your friends.

[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.240]
So if we can't continue voting for our Republicans, at least stay to hell home and don't vote.

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.480]
That's the message now.

[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.180]
But anyway, go ahead.

[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.260]
That's a terrible message.

[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.780]
Yes it is.

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.660]
What's in the democracy without a vote?

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.180]
In addition to which, I'll tell you, these people in power now, if it was up to them, they'd bring the poll tax back.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.800]
But anyway, I'm taking up...

[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.300]
They would go ahead, take all the time you want.

[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.860]
No, actually, the thing I'm concerned about is that there's so many things in a ballot.

[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.440]
And I hope that people get to the very end.

[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.060]
In fact, if they don't vote on anything else, I hope they go to 135 and vote no.

[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.740]
Because that's the county question.

[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.920]
That's a pocket, but it pocketbook issue.

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.940]
It directly affects them to the extent of a few hundred dollars a year per household over a period of the 21 years

[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.240]
that they're projecting initially.

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.300]
You're talking about thousands of dollars a year.

[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.180]
They're voting against a half percent sales tax.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.740]
The problem is that it's manyfold.

[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.060]
Number one is the fifth time they're trying to get the public convinced that they should expand Metro Real.

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.180]
Right, they just won't give up.

[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.280]
It ain't out.

[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.220]
I mean, they figure, well, if we put every two or three years of entry, we'll get lucky.

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.680]
The only difference between this fifth one and the ones in 1976, 1990, 1991 and 1999,

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.060]
if we remember the election in July 1999, you were so helpful in defeating...

[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.780]
Yes, I was.

[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.240]
The issue were.

[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.180]
Your voice was very strong, and you definitely had a big influence, I think, in helping to defeat it.

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:23.280]
That half percent is only 5.6 billion in extra sales taxes over 21 years, which is 262 million dollars annually,

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.760]
which is an extra 5.6 billion more or less.

[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.180]
And 94 percent or more of that is going to go simply to expand Metro Real.

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.280]
But what they don't tell the public is that even they're going to build it over next 15 to 30 years

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.120]
and only about the same as you have now.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.060]
Another 20 and a half miles they can build with the money and operate it with the partially operated with the deficit.

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.500]
And that's unless they get federal and additional federal state funds, they can build a little bit more than the 20 and a half miles.

[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.620]
Of course, they put up to 88 miles in the ballot proposal, which is typically misleading.

[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.840]
It's another example of the county attorney putting public relations language in there instead of honest language in the ballot proposal,

[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.120]
which I find very offensive.

[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.620]
For example, they have a thing about the people's commission that's going to oversee the money.

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.760]
But the truth is, the people's commission, first of all, the appointees are going to be political appointees.

[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.660]
Secondly, a two-thirds vote of the Metro commission can overrule them.

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.280]
Thirdly, a majority vote of the Metropolitan Plenty Organization, which is otherwise known as the MPO,

[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.640]
which is the Metro commission, plus a couple of other people, can also overrule them by a majority vote.

[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.080]
So the people's commission is just a public relations scam.

[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.940]
On the issue of what the Metro Rail means, it means higher property taxes for the people in Metropolitan Metropolitan State County.

[00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:01.500]
And here's why, because right now we pay $120 million annually, that is this past year's budget will be higher this coming year,

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.180]
out of our property taxes in order to subsidize Metro Rail and the Metro Bus.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.600]
There is a provision in the ordinance that calls maintenance of effort provision.

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.880]
Maintenance of effort means that, so long as the sales taxes there, they can never reduce the amount of property taxes now used to subsidize mass transit.

[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:27.060]
So if the, that's the minimum, so that you'll never have a reduction of the property taxes that may relate to mass transit subsidies.

[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.760]
On top of that, when you expand the Metro Rail, instead of $120 million deficit, you can have $300 million deficit.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.000]
If they add the 3,000 transportation employees, they're projecting.

[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.980]
So what it means is that we're getting the extra hundreds of millions of dollars.

[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.180]
They can't just do it with the half percent sales tax.

[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.340]
They have to go to their current source, which is property tax.

[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.400]
So you can anticipate that would be an increase in the property taxes in addition to the sales tax.

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:07.260]
So people ought to realize that, and that means there's an increase in the amount of the rent you pay, because everybody who pays a business rent is going to have their, their sale, their rent increase to the extent of the sales tax.

[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.540]
Yeah.

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:19.420]
A lot of those appliances and every other close, everything that a sales tax now applies to will go up an extra half a percent, which over a course of time did a lot of money.

[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.580]
Another thing about this sales tax.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.980]
Yeah, time's almost up Richard.

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.480]

[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.060]
Go ahead.

[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.880]
Now, another aspect to it is that 20% of the money is diverted to 31 cities.

[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.300]
Now, that's over a billion dollars, about a billion two that's going to be diverted to the city.

[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.480]
The last time it was gone to the cultural arts.

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.580]
This time it's gone to 31 cities.

[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.080]
So for political reasons.

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:50.280]
So that means the difference is that to me, a politician's slush fund, because they get spend it on whatever they want.

[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.980]
Why? Because the state statute says that 25% of all the money need not be spent for transit purposes.

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.480]
So they spend, they buy 200 buses over 20 years. It's 10 little, many buses a year.

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.980]
It's cost about 50,000 dollars a bus.

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.760]
And then the operating buses cost maybe another 20 or 30, 40 million dollars over a period of 20 years.

[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.220]
And the rest of the money, they got into pocket.

[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.460]
So that's the beautiful thing that the city governments like for this tax.

[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.460]
So to make a long story short, vote no on what is it 135?

[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.820]
135, they got to vote no. And telepoliticians, once or forever, pick me to metro politicians.

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.660]
We know your game to big scam. We don't want more metro fail, which is a train nowhere.

[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.140]
Amen. And you're doing a great job.

[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.640]
And so are you? This is this is one area boy where we need to dig free mail on this and to sing the national anthem. Those two things.

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.040]
You're a wonderful guy. I am. Thanks dig.

[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.100]
Okay. See you.

[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.100]
Where's your freedman?

[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.100]
By the way, time's up, Dick.

[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.500]
You know, that's how we ignore the ticking clock there. That's okay. Very important. No on 135. You got it?

[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.940]
No, no, no. No. No. No. No. No.

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.780]
To more of this metro rail crap, but you go up and down to Dixie High where you see all those people on the metro rail cars?

[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.280]
No. All those empty cars going back and forth and up and down.

[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.260]
It's kind of cool. Look at that. It is. It's like it's a little curb red caboose.

[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.160]
Whatever happened to our friend, John, it's a little caboose by the way.

[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:25.140]
Well, that's that PD linear again. Anyway, let's see. You got a couple of faxes here. We got to do the break though first because Richard Friedman sure took a lot of time. Thanks, Dick.

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.380]
Oh, maybe you'll call back a little later and tell us how to vote on that to protect the pig amendment too.

[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.860]
There's a pig amendment. Oh, yeah. It's the arosie Donald.

[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.680]
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.000]
Seriously.

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.100]
And then of course, I noticed during the spots promoted, which I'm all for that. I'm all for protecting animals and against unusual and cruel, etc.

[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.960]
But I noticed that they keep showing these dogs on there during the pig thing because dogs are much cuter look at the pigs.

[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.020]
That's what Josh Friedman told me.

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.800]
It's 12 minutes after 9 at 5.60 WQA. I'm happy Monday to you. Big day election day coming up tomorrow. All whipped up about it.

[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.020]
No. No. Pretty depressing.

[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.580]
Anyway, we know that you love your home, but maybe no matter how nice it is, you need some more space to do the things you want to be doing.

[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.480]
What do you do? You do the smart thing like even George did, which in his case is pretty unusual.

[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.480]
Do what hundreds of other people are doing. Call strictly additions, whether you're having a baby.

[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.560]
See what I mean? And need another room or if you're converting a car porter patio in living space. Maybe you wanted to business for yourself.

[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.620]
Want to make yourself a little home office. Call strictly additions. Let them handle everything from A to Z in and between.

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.480]
These people are your one stop. Shop more space for your place. Place with an absolutely positively.

[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.060]
Worry for your approach to expanding your living space. Those no shows by the contractors. Ain't going to happen with these people. No way.

[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:43.700]
No one expected bills. No one complete work. No worries about the job not getting done right. And like I said, they take care of every last single detail.

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.140]
They drop your blueprints. They get the building permits and all the inspections.

[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.720]
Strictly additions has got that easy five step approach to total customer satisfaction.

[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.980]
First, they call the schedule a free project evaluation deployment at your home where a project estimator will determine the scope of your addition.

[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.260]
How big it is and what it looks like. Secondly, and the thing too. Schedule a bit deployment of their convenience room where you'll get a detailed proposal on the exact price for your work.

[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.660]
Thirdly, they select your finishing touches. You pick them and go to contract. Fourth, review the design architectural drawings and fit sit back and relax.

[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.980]
Is your dream edition moves ahead on schedule with unbeatable quality. They take all the guesswork. All agree.

[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:25.680]
So give strictly additions a call. It does number 954-791-8100. You can check out the red and yellow pages. They serve all of Broward and South Palm Beach County.

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:34.420]
The license they're insured and they care about doing a super job for you just like they did for little George. Call 954-791-8100-4 strictly additions.

[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.720]
My life in law. This is Portrait of I city.

[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.580]
Way to A.

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.780]
Today's show is brought to you by the makers of Norman Bates' Cutlery.

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.340]
Jesus let go. I mean, killer. Killer.

[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.620]
And now back to our program.

[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.000]
Coming up.

[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.980]
Let's do it. It's our guest.

[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:01.040]
Let's get right to the things that been the most talked about of recent data. That's crisis. You have had a financial problem.

[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.180]
You know, Larry, I'm not making so much money these days.

[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.720]
We are told that you're part of the financial problem.

[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.000]
Oh, definitely. Yes. And I think that.

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.120]
Explain that. Well, I sort of have an inside track. You know what I mean?

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.400]
Oh, that's right. Why?

[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.060]
The distortion of the truth.

[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.380]
Somewhere in the vicinity of $700 billion. Did you know it was that much?

[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.040]
No, I'd be $700 billion.

[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.420]
Billion. Yes.

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.120]
You're kidding.

[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.600]
Timing is everything. You know what they say?

[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.300]
Yeah, bitch. Shame on you.

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.260]
Montes Stewart fraud. That's true. She's falling apart.

[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.780]
Thank you.

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.860]
Actually on this edition of Larry King live. Don't go away.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.540]
Don't be trusted.

[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.320]
I had 17 and 560 WQM. Happy Monday.

[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.240]
So I'm sure that there are some people like George who thought that that first call air from Richard Friedman,

[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.740]
especially started a brand new week was a little on the combatoes side, but it's important. Don't you understand?

[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.220]
Important. That's the problem.

[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.520]
That's the problem. Important also is boring usually. See?

[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.960]
It is.

[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.500]
That's why most people out there can't be bothered with important stuff.

[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.480]
See what I'm saying? I mean, if you want to get ripped off by the Crook's Air in office in Dade County,

[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.520]
and pay more for transportation than nobody's going to use and give them that slush fund he was talking about,

[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.960]
then go right ahead and vote yes on that. Otherwise you'll say to more of that crap, OK?

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.000]
135 vote no several times on that.

[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.180]
So it was important. It was boring because Dick is a great guy,

[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.740]
but he tends to be a little ponderous, but it was great.

[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.240]
No, like I said, it was boring, but it was very important. See?

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.620]
Like the election tomorrow, it's boring, but it's very important.

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.780]
And let me say it again to you, dark, complex folks. Don't buy into this crap.

[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.600]
This is the new line of the right wingers.

[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.640]
Oh, the liberals are your enemy. They're really racist. Like I've told you before, we're all racists.

[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.520]
To some degree or another, it just depends on whether you're a virulent racist,

[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.920]
like a hood wearing freak, something like that,

[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.140]
whether you just somebody who happens to have certain, you know, hang-ups because you're not one of them.

[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.420]
Whoever them happens to be. Dark folks are racist, white folks are racist.

[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.460]
I'm sure that yellow skin people could be racist too if you catch my drift.

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.340]
Even Puerto Ricans could be racist. George said, I'm not sure he's right,

[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.700]
but that's what he brought me to remember that. Throw them in there too.

[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.140]
But the fact of the matter is this business a while, stay away because the liberal,

[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.360]
that was the whole purpose of that Fox business,

[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.120]
which took me a long time to figure out what that was.

[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.080]
Why would I waste their time with a little small potatoes like me down here

[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.620]
in some little crappy market on a make-believe radio station?

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.300]
And then when you see Hannity on there, which I don't, I don't watch their network,

[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.960]
but that one night he and he was on with guess who was on with them.

[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.300]
I give up.

[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.120]
I see you ate something a minute ago, it'll be coming back in a second.

[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.180]
And Coulter was on with.

[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.020]
Oh, our favorite.

[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.200]
Oh my God.

[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.800]
What was she wearing?

[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.060]
And they were ranting not much.

[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.200]
They were ranting and raving and carrying on about, oh, the liberals in this and that, you know, they're right.

[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.100]
See, I'll tell you who I despise.

[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.480]
I really do. I really despise them because they're supposed to be the buffer when they failed us.

[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.720]
They failed the Constitution. They failed American public.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.420]
And that's a democratic party. They suck.

[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.340]
They used a little bit of common sense and realized that it was going to be turned right around against them.

[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.940]
And then of course the booming of Trent Laude and we didn't invite the vice president there,

[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.100]
which is, you know, his big bundle of oil whatever he was going to bring.

[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.520]
He was going to bring a couple of tankers.

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.120]
Seriously, I mean, they should have understood that, but they don't understand anything.

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.240]
They don't get it. They just don't get it.

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.900]
That's why I think tomorrow's going to be a debacle.

[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.360]
For example, here in the state of Florida, what would they kept telling us up until a few days ago

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.300]
was a very close race and they'll present that they was in here again.

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.700]
And this one keeps coming back. Now the Jebs, there's 15 points ahead.

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.600]
Now I got news for you. Based on the job he's done the last four years, he should be 70 points behind.

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.700]
Based on that grotesque little incident in Pensacola, which they got on tape, he should be 80 points behind.

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.840]
But now he's 15 points ahead. He's going to win hands down your pants and that's going to be the end of that.

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.860]
How do you like that?

[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.020]
Were we just hearing just days ago that was like three, four points?

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.360]
It was very, very tight. And now all of a sudden, like overnight, it's 15 points difference.

[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.500]
He's a head.

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.460]
So you can get pissed off while you want Blenda Democratic Party for being weak.

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.100]
This is, first of all, the two party system sucks to begin with.

[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.280]
But when you got two crappy parties, one that's turned into a way of extremist, dangerous, freedom-suppressing party.

[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.200]
And the other one that's turned into an impotent wimpie, oh well, we don't want to say this, because we're afraid of our own shadow.

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.480]
Well, scrum. Scrum.

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.980]
Well, should we talk about the economy? We don't want to talk about Iraq because it's not popular.

[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.300]
Well, if you don't want to be popular, then let's screw you, okay?

[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:30.420]
If they, if you're worried about that kind of crap, if you don't have any balls, that's the problem that Democratic Party is that very few members of it have got any goddamn balls to stand up and tell it like it is.

[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.400]
That's why I was so tragic that Paul Wellstone died in that plane crash, because here's one guy!

[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:40.680]
One guy out of a hundredth, who no matter what the hell was going on, no matter which way the wind was blowing in the balls to get up and say, this is what I think.

[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.160]
Well, do you like it or not? That's my kind of guy.

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.780]
And how he's dead.

[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.900]
Walter Mondale, who can barely speak, he's 74 going on 104. Have you seen him?

[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.860]
Yeah. Oh my god, it's tragic.

[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.840]
I mean, he never stole a freight train, he's not a bad guy, but I mean, Frank Lautenberg at 78 looks like a teenager compared to Walter Mondale.

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.620]
Seriously, this man looks like a grandma Moses on a bad day.

[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.780]
He could pass for 94 easy, easy.

[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.700]
Anyway, it's not good all whipped up about that stuff because nobody in this audience cares about any election.

[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.620]
They don't care about important stuff, about Richard Freeman. All they wanted to do was do them like that.

[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.160]
And I don't blame him when he came right down to it. Who the hell can blame him?

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:32.140]
Here's something important from Doug and Pember Pines. A hearty thanks to you and Carlos for making it possible to spend Saturday nights in Greek aid concert at the Merck and Airlines Arena.

[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.980]
A somewhat lesser thanks to your pal and some beef, South Beach, Bon Vee Bon, Woody Graber for providing the tickets.

[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.140]
Maybe next time you can also provide par-

[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.960]
He could provide par-

[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.300]
Assutes given how high up we were. Oh, sorry. Brighers can't be choosers. I was afraid to ask Woody where those tickets were. No is bleed, baby.

[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.100]
And next time when he brings us some tickets, at least in the building, not on the roof. No is bleeds.

[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.260]
Next time we're going to have to give a tank of oxygen to everybody wins the tickets.

[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.520]
Anyway, it says in any case, my Kubano wife enjoyed the show. I on the other hand would have preferred kidney stones.

[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.160]
Sorry about that, Doug. Hey, the Harold gave in. Riki, a great review. And by the way, thanks, and Riki.

[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.260]
You'll be pleased to know that after the show on Friday, Carlos came running down in a parking lot.

[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.740]
Oh, I just had a call from Shirley Brooks. Do you know who she is? I said, yes. That's Riki's good friend.

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:27.220]
And then Riki made sure that she called and gave me a personal invitation to come to the concert, which I had to go to the track instead. But nevertheless, Cesar and Riki hasn't, he hasn't forgotten. He hasn't abandoned me.

[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.360]
That's for you, sweetheart. And he got a good right up in the herald today. I was glad to see that because they don't like anybody.

[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:39.580]
They're just nasty and sour and bitter. The herald. They're like Dave Joseph at the Sun Central. Sour and bitter.

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.460]
Like that. How about those Patriots? Got a fax from a New England Paul here. You betcha, baby.

[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.900]
Oh, that way I just was squeezed myself. Tom Brady just picked that Buffalo defensive part. Pick 23 out of 273 at 110 yards.

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:00.380]
Final score, Buffalo 7 New England Patriots 38. All right. A far cry from what's going to happen in Green Bay tonight, but never less.

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:10.940]
It said and Riki had sort of a hip hop mula mula cap on it said, yeah, that's the schmata he wears. At first I thought it was a bandage for some kind of a head wound.

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:24.480]
And Neil, he's so gay or released by that it's impossible not to pick up on it. Yeah. And there were even a couple of boys a few rows in front of us who would obviously come to the show together in certain.

[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:36.000]
Squirt, squirt, sound or it says in any case, all the torture paid off for me the next morning because my wife was all still well again, you know, scored score. Very good. See it worked and paid off, Doug. Thanks, Neil. You're the best even though most of you are those around you suck.

[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:47.100]
Yeah, we have a lot of suck in this place. There's no question about that. A lot of sour pushes around here. A lot of people in no sense. He were in fact, I think some of the people there ought to be working in Fox News Network. Maybe they could all open the John Gibson.

[00:20:48.200 --> 00:21:05.400]
I will say this. I showed George Heather's picture this morning that bitch Heather the call last week. She belongs on five. She belongs on Fox. She is why she's a mindless bimbo and they kind of leads a sucker. See come to find out that she's a big kind of easy to cycle in a right wing bitch, which is no surprise. That's why she works at Fox shocker. Yeah.

[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:15.940]
At any rate. So anyway, New England Paul says I know of becoming a chronic fax your head of fire up the fax machine early day. I think the real thing when Patriot showed up yesterday. And by the way, what's the guy's name of play yesterday?

[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:23.220]
Who write all these assholes, all these experts who don't see the game saying, oh, well, maybe the Patriots made a bad mistake and they kept the wrong quarterback right.

[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:40.200]
The choking gagging drew blood. So every time the Patriots had a big game come up, he would choke. You could see it. Come apart. It looked like Ray Lucas on a bad day as opposed to Tom Brady, who's cool and calm and collected and looks pretty damn good too. Nice going there, Tommy, baby. Pull. Yesterday boy, it's taking me a long time. You know what?

[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:48.000]
It's almost 9 30 already, but Dick Friedman had some important stuff to say. There was pretty boring, but right now it's time to get it on. Right.

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.560]
1589 votes on a poll from last Friday. What event at last 25 years had the greatest negative impact on South Florida answers when we come back after the break?

[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:06.320]
Why don't want to like, you know, give it a look at the shoe. I want a good tease. The response when we come back after the break for those who don't have computers.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:14.420]
Those of you poor bastards who are working in your car look at the tremendous response on the phone. We're getting already with Marbley in election day and Richard Friedman's tremendously inspirational call.

[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:26.060]
What? Now what it was an important call. Okay. Very important. It was important. He is boring, but he's a good guy and he's got a good sense of humor and he likes this show and he helped. He also was very instrumental back in 99 on that thing with a phone.

[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:34.540]
He had a phone. Pawn that over in the summer 99. Try to put it over on the public here. Mayor Penga, Pakenia and his grave robbing friends here in Dave County to you, Mayor Penga, Pakenia.

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:41.900]
In fact, the Bill McBride were smart to kick your ass off the stage the other day. That's that's one of Bill McBride's biggest mistakes besides being boring.

[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:50.040]
See, that's part of the problem. He's boring. We'll talk about a lackluster campaign. I think even Janet Reno had a better campaign than she wasn't running this time.

[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:59.060]
She was up there on the stage with him. That didn't help. 27 after 9 at 5.60. Come on on you. Dark folks vote 5, 10, 15 times tomorrow just to get even okay.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:08.880]
It'd be photos. Damn Republicans put in that pool tax. See, he laughed when I said that, but if they were able to do what they'd bring it back, if they could find a way to sneak it through, they'd bring the pool tax back.

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.200]
It's only the wealthy when there knows up any or only those people could vote.

[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:22.460]
So I hope that every, like I said, every dark person take two liberal Cubans and pull one under each arm. Of course, that'll only be one person, but nevertheless, and drag them to the polls tomorrow.

[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:30.280]
What? Good luck finding one of those. Yeah. No, I said too. One under each arm. That'll be it. Both of you. Well, that's right. You can't vote your legal alien.

[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:39.880]
Georgia's are going to go back with the Haitians, by the way. 27 after 9 at 5. If you can always so baseballs, it's probably make more doing that than you're making here.

[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:59.700]
The lights of West Bokers are placed for all you people desperate to lose some weight. That's right. It's your low carb sugar free. Atkins, diet, superstar. They got a great new selective low carb cookies. That's right. After the election tomorrow, some of us will be tossing them. I'm sure that from three different bakers, no less. They're delicious. And try them all. Peanut butter, chocolate, chocolate chip, lemon, coconut, all sugar free.

[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:14.460]
Or low carb. And of course, it delights these and all the other products in the story can try them before you buy them. Delights has also got a great new low carb bread. It's called sinfully low carb bread. Spread some of the new La Nuba jam on it. You've got a great low carb breakfast. And don't forget as your official Atkins diet retail center.

[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:28.320]
Delights avoid Bokers sales every single Atkins brand product at 25% off today tomorrow, two weeks from circus every day. And of course, you've been here in more and more about how Atkins works for people. The guy on channel four that was on all the different diets, 30 pounds in a month on the Atkins diet.

[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:35.320]
So if you want to go to a store that cater strictly to you, you don't have to worry about what to buy because everything in there is geared for low carb and no carb diets.

[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:48.640]
Delights of West Bokers, the place they're open every day, 10, 10 right on the corner of glaze and 441 in Boka. Call them toll free and 1-877 low carb or see them on the web at lowcarb.com. Don't forget Delights of West Boka, be your official Atkins retail super store.

[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.140]
My life and look all this is 440560. You ain't too a yeah.

[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.420]
To the more on hour at 9 o'clock you'll hear more.

[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.400]
Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mohawada David Show. We have a full duck today.

[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.440]
Including the cavalcade about articulate athlete of yours. You know that pipe smokers still at it.

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:23.200]
Why? Why'd we're singing the songs? They can funnami. They make funnami all the time. I don't know why they don't adore me.

[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.680]
They're everything of the alright moh.

[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.280]
Get your hands off me, a fairy. You're queer. Yet toob jumper. Real men don't touch. Only during the game.

[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.600]
Yes, ma'am. They want singing. I'll give them singing. Get on a piano. Over there.

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.380]
Okay, ma'am.

[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.780]
Now, hit it.

[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.020]
Back in my day men were straight.

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.420]
The end day is hip today.

[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.100]
That's why I can't tolerate.

[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.900]
This gun's lit gaze.

[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.100]
Point holes were in deep darkness.

[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.900]
Stop it, you moron.

[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.000]
What's the matter, moh?

[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.200]
My wing fell off again.

[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.760]
Okay. Alright, where were we?

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.180]
Point holes were in deep darkness.

[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.820]
I'll take it from here. The guys that like the worship men.

[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.740]
Good thing we will see more in your way than that of my gang.

[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.100]
Didn't mean to soothbrush David's.

[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.880]
Or to tickle Harry Taint.

[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.140]
Jesus Christ, I really hate.

[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.080]
Jesus, God's wing died.

[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.580]
933 at 560 WQ. I'm happy Monday to you.

[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.740]
How about those patriots?

[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.820]
Let's say it again for another around 3.5 hours.

[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.740]
Just keep going.

[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.200]
Guess what we got at 1 o'clock today?

[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.860]
Well, we apologize, but the mad dogs up in Green Bay with moh.

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.740]
Moh and the gang up for the big game tonight.

[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.800]
So we got somebody almost as exciting as mad dog.

[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.760]
Yeah, almost as exciting as mad dog in a deep sleep.

[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.220]
Joe Zagaki, between 1 and 3.

[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.880]
Hank Goldberg at Chulis this afternoon.

[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.280]
Then we got count down to kickoff starting at 5 o'clock.

[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.600]
Hank's got another short show today.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.640]
Nice work there, Humper.

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.420]
3 to 5.

[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.160]
5 o'clock, we got our usual four hours of pregame crefs.

[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.220]
We get a lot of spots in there.

[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.660]
And then we got the dolphins at Green Bay.

[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.780]
They're going to freeze their ass off.

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.420]
We'll see if Ray Lucas is like the real deal.

[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.640]
You know what I'm saying? You think he is?

[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:35.980]
No.

[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.640]
Now, anyway, Belafonte won't take back slavery slur.

[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.580]
I hope Jonathan, what's his name?

[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.300]
Gibson ate, listen.

[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.640]
Never liked him since the OJ days.

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.700]
Another one of those OJ, one of the private him and a great event,

[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.320]
a sour ball, all those people.

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.300]
Belafonte won't take back slavery slur.

[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.700]
Harry Belafonte would on CNN's Larry King Live 2 tonight.

[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.560]
Instead of apologizing to Colin Powell for calling him a house slave.

[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.620]
He called national security advisor, Congolese, a rice, a house slave as well.

[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.240]
Last week, the singer activist declared an array of interview in San Diego.

[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.020]
There were those slaves who lived on the plantation,

[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.900]
and there were those slaves who lived in the house.

[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.180]
You got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master.

[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.180]
Asked by King if he would change the statement,

[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.420]
Belafonte calmly answered,

[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.240]
No.

[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:19.600]
No.

[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.400]
I would perhaps put it in the context, but in essence, I wouldn't change the statement.

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.580]
He said, after stressing him at the Secretary of State,

[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.860]
it compromised his ideals and principles by serving blindly for a conservative administration.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.040]
Powell, the highest ranking black official in the history of the US government,

[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.060]
called Belafonte's comments,

[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.740]
and unfortunately, throwback to another time and another place.

[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.480]
On King's show,

[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.500]
Belafonte called Powell a sellout.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.520]
When King asked,

[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.260]
Do you have the same views about Congolese's rice, Belafonte replied,

[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.040]
Yes, absolutely, absolutely, even more so.

[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.080]
Even more so.

[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.500]
How do you like that?

[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.640]
I like it.

[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.060]
You go here.

[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.160]
I think you're the results of the poll.

[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.580]
Did I?

[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.040]
1600 votes over the weekend,

[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.900]
which have ended the last 25 years,

[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.380]
has had the greatest negative impact on South Florida we asked.

[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.560]
Mary L. Bolt-Lift,

[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.580]
that was my vote, 756,

[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.480]
47.1% of the use said,

[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.380]
Mary L. Bolt-Lift, never been the same.

[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.900]
2000 Hanging Chattel X307,

[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.680]
I hate to break the news deal,

[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.320]
but they're already making dream predictions for what's going to happen here tomorrow,

[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.340]
with a very, very long, confusing ballot,

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.780]
and people using the touch screens for the first time ever,

[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.700]
and, oh, just a mess already.

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.200]
But,

[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.180]
you got nothing else going on.

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.300]
Just go at 7 in the morning,

[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.560]
and maybe my midnight you'll be done.

[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.300]
Oh, and also,

[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.360]
well, I got the mic,

[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.280]
Mayo, calm about it,

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.000]
and how about Jev said,

[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.420]
Oh, no, Mary L. Bolt-Lift,

[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.220]
and we're not going to leave the polls open extra time.

[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.540]
That means too many dark votes might give in.

[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.500]
Too many working folks.

[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.520]
Too many working folks,

[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.680]
and dark working folks.

[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.260]
Anyway, 2000 Hanging Chattel X307,

[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.380]
19.1%,

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.100]
Moe Howard David coming to town,

[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.160]
he came from nowhere,

[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.020]
he was a late addition,

[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.260]
and did a spectacular job,

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.460]
moving all the way up to number three,

[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.920]
with 256 votes,

[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.500]
15.9% so that's the most negative impact on town

[00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.940]
of anything in the last 25 years.

[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.780]
How can they say that?

[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.840]
Let me try to get everybody in.

[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.240]
Andrew Lucky was standing still,

[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.560]
Hurricane Andrew 154,

[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.320]
early on, small potatoes easily got 93.

[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.700]
Liberty City riots only 39,

[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.400]
out of 1,607 votes,

[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.760]
pretty impressive total.

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.840]
Here's today's poll.

[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.920]
I know this isn't the sexier exciting,

[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.460]
as a lot of our polls are,

[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.040]
but we got election day coming up tomorrow.

[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.860]
So gratuitously,

[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.600]
we have to ask a poll about election day, don't we?

[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.120]
Yeah. Well,

[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.040]
course how do you feel about tomorrow's election this is the poll today okay how do you feel you feel

[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:38.000]
it's very important it's life and death i'm voting but not excited i'm not voting why bother or

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.660]

[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.260]

[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.220]
did that hatchet peat you know one thing i've discovered nobody watches fox news here nobody nobody

[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.660]
and certainly dark complex and folks today watch fox news no chance just like the clown news channel

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.440]
yeah like i told the heather it's the fascist news network and it certainly is so if they were under

[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.920]
any pretense this fair and unbalanced crap like i told her unfair unbalanced all spin all day if

[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.000]
there was any doubt that the hatchet job they tried doing on me and and this whole other attack on

[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.680]
well liberals are racist yeah right right it's the it's the right wingers that are really going

[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.320]
about for you folks right starting with Reagan he did a good job not renewing the civil rights

[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.920]
act in 1964 that was the first step you know then maybe we can put you back in the back of the bus

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.060]
but anyway near Rogers low blow this was john Gibson's column fried in November one he writes near

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:55.100]
Rogers w of wq m and mimey is joined with singer and dancer her he's a dancer her elephane

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.640]
i never saw dance no in accusing the fence secretary condolese the rice and secretaries they

[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.440]
call in pala being slaves in the bush white house feel hands who are allowed in the big house because

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.920]
they do so well agreeing with the master oh sounds right so far Rogers has taken a step further

[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.880]
by running seemingly seemingly satirical audio tapes describing pal and rice working in the white

[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.520]
house and performing some studio uses cleaning the toilets and worse oh what's worse than that

[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.500]
Rogers also constantly and provocatively uses the n-word well guess what no i do not

[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.200]
constantly we discuss it it's in that one bit that we play that they got all whipped up about in

[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.640]
the first place it's an angry good morning we discuss it in fact i've even got a facts about the

[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.040]
n-word here which i'll get to in a minute but do i constantly know i might say sparzer or spook or

[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:44.180]
clout or whatever what cool but not the n-word the radio talk show host justifies all this by saying

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.100]
he bashes everyone anywhere any time including you john gibson with a bad bad here and because he's

[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.600]
a liberal see there we go again he's a liberal in the sense that he dislikes conservatives and

[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.600]
dislikes the bush white house like balafonte misspelled by the way two else he's gotten here oh my god

[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.000]
john gibson can't even spell right not only is god here he's dancing but he's also got two else in

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.600]
his name like balafonte he'll do anything to make the president and staff look bad i don't have to

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.140]
do anything to make them look bad they're doing a good job themselves in other words his is an

[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.940]
opinion like elbows everybody's got him and so what what rogers is doing is making a lot of ugly

[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.440]
talk acceptable you can be angry at ricer pal for lack of solidarity with their racial political

[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.680]
block if you want but the tone of rogers attacks on pal and rices purely racist if we're directed at

[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.700]
anybody else in my kids lap down very quickly by the fcc but in this case the fcc is headed by colon

[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.300]
pal son michael pal and isn't going to look good for him to be going after rogers if it seems

[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.160]
he's only settling a score for his father so rogers here's the here's one of the funniest lines i've

[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.480]
ever heard my life talk about the power of this show baby talk about so rogers has a free

[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.280]

market possible if he intends to keep it up that's my word says the umxious john gibson i'm fox

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.120]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.160]

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:07.960]

[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:07.960]

[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:07.960]

I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.140]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.420]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.120]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.880]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.620]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.440]

[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:53.140]

[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:53.140]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.260]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.260]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.260]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.260]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.260]

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.280]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:54.880]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.080]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.480]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.260]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.000]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.860]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:58.680]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.500]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.220]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:03.520]
I'm a taxi driver.

[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:03.520]

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.620]
It's pretty good.

[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.000]
Anyway, 10 o'clock at 5'60 in the video queue.

[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.600]
Happy Monday, too.

[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.680]
Well, we had a little discussion there

[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.680]
out here for about two seconds.

[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.840]
Here's the facts I got this morning.

[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.080]
It says, NIGA versus NIGA, are they different?

[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.160]
Posted March 19, 2002, NIGA and NIGA,

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:21.760]
is there a difference?

[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.820]
I don't know what website that's from.

[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:24.780]
Anyway, it says,

[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.140]
San Jose, California, Judge seems to think so.

[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.080]
The Judge ruled that a white teenager

[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.280]
was not guilty of a hate crime

[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.960]
for calling his high school teacher a NIGA

[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.000]
because he used the friendly version of the word, NIGGA.

[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.060]
I always do that.

[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.080]
That's the Canadian version.

[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.100]
NIGGA.

[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:39.940]
Here's what happened.

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.160]
The San Jose teenager upset because the teacher

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.520]
suspended his white friend,

[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.320]
vandalized school property when he spray-painted

[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.520]
thanks and nigger with an arrow pointed to the teacher's name.

[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.740]
After the students have turned he brought in a witness

[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.780]
to testify, there is a difference between the two words.

[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.000]
The Judge agreed and said,

[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.980]
no hate crime was committed.

[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:56.820]
How do you like that?

[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.680]
So, yeah, I guess if we were to change that song,

[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.020]
let's have Brian be doing it.

[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.160]
Kiss and nigger, good morning, as opposed to nigger.

[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.160]
See, nigger bad, nigger good,

[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.180]
all depending on who be saying it.

[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.000]
I'm going to tell you one thing that we need to serve

[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.060]
serves me tremendously.

[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.760]
Of course, it's part of that goddamn plot

[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.720]
to keep us all out of touch,

[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.020]
all us old fogies out of time.

[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.060]
It started out and it was,

[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.360]
OK, and then of course it turned it a sup.

[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:23.940]
Sup.

[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.140]
No more wise up because that was a square and out of the,

[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.780]
and then of course it turned it a watt up.

[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.260]
When I hear somebody say, what up?

[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.400]
At that point I become angry.

[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.500]
I can handle a 7000 different variations of hand shakes.

[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.860]
As a matter of fact, we had a couple of little technical problems

[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.980]
in here last week and Fat Julio, the engineer,

[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.540]
who's doing it.

[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.780]
These are only hope, by the way,

[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.820]
an engineering is Julio.

[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:45.300]
Great guy.

[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.100]
Came in and fixed whatever it was and Carlos

[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.600]
who was sitting in your chair last week,

[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.100]
another spec, Carlos reaches over and he and Julio do the,

[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.680]
Julio puts out like three fingers and Carlos squeezes them.

[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:57.840]
No?

[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.460]
What do you call that?

[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.040]
New one on me and then I call it.

[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.180]
Yeah, he squeezes the three fingers from Fat,

[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.260]
you know what I call it?

[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.420]
Yeah.

[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.340]
Yeah, that's what I call it.

[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.220]
Maybe they were trying two different handshake

[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.960]
and it just met up.

[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.400]
No, no, no, it was this.

[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.140]
I seen it with my own four eyes, man.

[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.100]
Maybe that's the Masonic handshake.

[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.280]
Yeah, it was the secret handshake.

[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.720]
The secret handshake is what I seen last week.

[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.320]
So we got a couple of masons in here.

[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.800]
I think it's time to get pure mason in on a case.

[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.320]
Deputy QAM.

[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:27.800]
Hello.

[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.100]
Hello?

[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:29.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.800]
I am running against Iliana Ross Leitner,

[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.140]
however she says it.

[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.180]
I'm for ending the Cuban embargo.

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.640]
You're running against her?

[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.160]
Yes, I'm Ray Chote.

[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:42.800]
Okay.

[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.580]
Democratic candidate.

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:53.280]
And I want to say that anybody that would work for that Cuban terrorist

[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.380]
mosque could be set aside.

[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:00.800]
Right.

[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.180]
Amen.

[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.260]
Well, good luck to you, Ray.

[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:03.640]
Thank you.

[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.120]
Get some help.

[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.120]
Yeah, Iliana Rosanna-Dena, we don't want her.

[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.400]
She, there's no chance, Ray.

[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.620]
I mean, you know, have a nice time.

[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.800]
Hope you had a good time doing it.

[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:12.540]
While somebody's got a run, I don't like that one.

[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.280]
I see people on a pose like Senator John Kerry

[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:14.800]
and Massachusetts.

[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.040]
You realize there's no Republican running against him?

[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.720]
I mean, I guess they figure out why waste of time.

[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.600]
Like Ted Kennedy last time, also, I had no opponent.

[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.600]
Because they were going to China and China's chance.

[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.420]
In fact, I think we could probably find a China and China.

[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.460]
And he's got a better chance of beating Iliana than Ray,

[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.880]
but especially based on that call.

[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.480]
But nevertheless, oh, and also Attorney General,

[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.420]
which you weren't even aware of this.

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.120]
I wonder if he's, this Charlie Christ has related to Jesus Christ.

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.540]
Because every time I see his spots about the Chang Gang

[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.340]
and the people in the back, I don't have any of these words yet.

[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:43.380]

[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.740]
He wants to bring back the road, the Chang Gangs.

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:46.900]
Yeah.

[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.680]
This is our, he wants to be the John Ascroft of Florida.

[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.920]
Charlie Jesus Christ.

[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.620]
So that buddy or whatever the guy's name is running against,

[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.460]
and not buddy McCay, buddy Nevin's, whatever the guy's name is,

[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.440]
vote for Buddy, okay?

[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.040]
I have no idea who he is.

[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.420]
But he's not, the good thing is he's not Charlie Jesus Christ.

[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.040]
Shackles and Chang Gangs.

[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.120]
All right.

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.060]
That's a good Republican agenda for you, baby.

[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.420]
Don't forget us, liberals.

[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.120]
What a bad guy.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.460]
Is all you dark folks out there.

[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.220]
What a bad guy.

[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.100]
Is anybody buying it?

[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.220]
No.

[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.160]
No, you're not buying it.

[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:16.480]
Sad.

[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.340]
125 votes.

[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.940]
Now they're starting to kick in a little bit.

[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.120]
They're starting to wake up.

[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.380]
See, they all want to stay in, because they realize it's going to be like

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.220]
20 below zero tonight in Green Bay, and the dolphins are going to get their asses kicked.

[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:27.640]
Oh, sorry.

[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.160]
I said that.

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.640]
How do you feel about tomorrow's election?

[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.380]
It's very important.

[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:31.900]
45.

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.420]
I'm voting, but not excited.

[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.040]
34.

[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.380]
I'm not voting.

[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.440]
Why bother 21?

[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.540]
It's life and death.

[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.060]
19.

[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:38.780]
And what?

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.200]
Me, worry.

[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:39.720]
Six.

[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.880]
I can find a case for you.

[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.300]
One of those.

[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.240]
Six.

[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.420]
Two of the most mediocre political parties in the history of the human god damn race.

[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.280]
And I'll say it again.

[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.020]
I blame the Democratic Party a lot more than Republicans any day, the week because you're weak.

[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:53.900]
You're weak.

[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.880]
You're spineless most of you guys.

[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.500]
Like everybody says, well, how come nobody's more concerned about the economy?

[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.620]
I'll tell you because you guys haven't presented an alternative.

[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.240]
There's no case.

[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.220]
There's no program.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.420]
There's nothing there.

[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.400]
Give us an alternative.

[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.200]
Say something.

[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.440]
Instead of like weaseling around and being afraid of your own god damn shadow.

[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.160]
Take it for your word for it.

[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:13.920]
No, okay, good.

[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.380]
You always took me in my word.

[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.200]
I'll present it.

[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.080]
He's an upstanding guy.

[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.000]
Let's see, it's amazing.

[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.380]
I won.

[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.380]
I was running against peace prosperity and comets.

[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.580]
He president Bush, while speaking with Swedish Prime Minister, unaware that the cameras were rolling.

[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.300]
It's amazing.

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.720]
I won.

[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.780]
I was running against peace prosperity and the comets.

[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.620]
There you go.

[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.320]
Well, you didn't win.

[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.460]
You stole it, but you didn't win.

[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:37.740]
Okay.

[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.420]
So maybe it wasn't quite as amazing as you thought.

[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.300]
Back back on November 5th, right?

[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.580]
Steve and Goldstein, October 16th in a sunset.

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.480]
And I'll read it again.

[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.080]
Bush, right?

[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.240]
Floridians are worse off than they were four years ago.

[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:49.860]
Boy, you are.

[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.260]
Absolutely correct.

[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:56.700]
Thanks to Jeb Bush's voodoo economic, smoking mirrors, education reforms, environmental, poison pills, and right wing pandering.

[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.900]
The state is in shambles.

[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.820]
Florida needs regime change.

[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.420]
Here are 24 reasons to vote together out of office tomorrow.

[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:09.400]
One, Jeb has turned the $3 billion surplus he inherited from Lawton, Charles, and with deficit of between 1.4 and 4.

[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:09.760]
$4 billion.

[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.380]
Two, the governor has engineered multi-billion dollar tax giveaways for corporations and the wealthiest Floridians.

[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:23.400]
Three, Floridians, Florida's pension fund lost $355 million on its in-run investments, buying shares in the company even when everybody was selling.

[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.540]
Four, the average wage in Florida's dropped to just 87% of the national norm.

[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:33.320]
Five, Florida's only one of 12 states in which median household income declined in 2001.

[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.360]
Six, the governor promised to eliminate the backlog of 11,000 seniors on the waiting list for services through the Department of Elder Affairs.

[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.680]
Today the list is swelled over 14,000.

[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.300]
Seven, health insurance costs are spiraling out of control.

[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:52.120]
Eight, Jeb's prescription drug plan covers only 68,000 seniors, barely 2.5% of the state's older population.

[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.320]
Nine, in spite of Bushian buzzwords about improving education, FKAT.

[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.640]
By the way, you weren't here with us.

[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.060]
We had the story last week about Neil Bush.

[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.020]
That's what he's doing.

[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.980]
I'm telling you the news.

[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]
Pliting the God damn program for FKAT.

[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:04.420]

[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.820]
Raping pillaging.

[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:06.080]
Right.

[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:14.580]
In spite of Bushian buzzwords about improving education, FKAT A plus plan, vouchers in charter schools, Florida's high school graduation rate has slipped from 44th to the worst in America.

[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:15.820]
The worst in America.

[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.880]
Ten SAT scores have dropped from 40th to 47th.

[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.360]
ACT scores from 35th to 38th.

[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:27.960]
Eleven, pre-Jem, Florida was 29th nationally in spending per pupil in 2001 and fell to 40th.

[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.640]
12, the governor's alleged $3 billion increase in education funding is a figment of his imagination,

[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.500]
factoring inflation in student growth and money allocated per student is risen less than 1 quarter of 1%.

[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:44.320]
13, class size in Florida schools among the worst in the nation dropped from 42nd, 1998 to 44th in 2001.

[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:51.040]
14, research cited by the U.S. Department of Education concludes that reducing class size to below 20 students leads to higher achievement.

[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.040]
But the governor says he has devious plans to plot the constitutional amendment reducing class size of its pastures tomorrow and he's reelected.

[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.660]
15, Florida's teacher salaries have dropped from 28th to 31st in the nation.

[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:11.500]
16, a national study of higher education gives Florida a D minus because of relatively higher college cost and a D plus because comparatively few state residents go to college.

[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:19.820]
17, the governor has grabbed the power to appoint everyone on the state's 26th judicial nominating commissions so we can stack the courts with right-wing judges opposed to abortion

[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.800]
and likely to push his conservative agenda.

[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:30.160]
18, candidate Bush promised to fix Florida's foster care system in six months, governor Bush left the Department of Children and Families become a national scandal.

[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.660]
In 19 on the environment, Jeff talks the conservation talk but doesn't walk the walk.

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:44.560]
In public he says there are things behind the scenes he pushes developers agendas. 20, the governor has appointed anti-environmentalist to water management to strict the Environmental Regulatory Commission in Judgeships.

[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:57.760]
21, ignoring the objections of more than 100 environmental and citizens groups, Jeff signed a law which funds the state's portion of the Everglades Restoration but includes a poison pill that restricts Florida's ability to challenge developers who submit anti-environmental permit requests.

[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:03.940]
22, violent crime in the state increased at six times the national average from 2001 to 2002.

[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:20.080]
23, for the first time since 1996, overall crime incidents in Florida increased. 24, the governor claims his 1020 life laws led to a decrease in gun crime but the firearm crime rate was on the decline before 1020 life and actually increased in 2001 for the first time since 1997.

[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:27.280]
In 1998, candidate Jeb asked to give you to give him four years so he could create a better Florida. Many of you kept your end of the bargain and he did not.

[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.560]
Full me once, shame on you, full me twice, shame on me or like the president says, fool around.

[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:42.040]
The truth of the attitude, not be lost on voters, stop the bushwhacking, whack bush out of office November 5th. Steve Goldstein's commentaries are broadcast on WFCL channel 42 South Florida today.

[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.120]
Nice going Steve. Second time I read that.

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:51.760]
I think it's going to do any good. Well, we'll see. Maybe they're just making these polls up too. It seems awfully strange to me.

[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:57.300]
And now they're saying well, they're debating Orlando, you know, because Mike Broad can't explain where he's going to get the money to pay for that guy.

[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.340]
Well, first of all, it's a goddamn amendment that's on the ballot.

[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:08.260]
If the public says yes, we have to have smaller class size, don't give us this song of dance about how you're going to find the easiest ways to deep six. The will of the electorate.

[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.760]
That's scary. Then anybody would vote for some assholes or something like that.

[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:20.540]
Not to mention his entire dysfunctional family in the hypocrisy of it all while they points to the finger at all the rest of us and we got to be goody two shoes and walk the straight and narrow path.

[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.660]
And there's anybody in this family can like walk out the door without getting to the goddamn trouble.

[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:35.020]
Even on the way to Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Noel. That was a cheap shot. See, what's his name? What's his name again? Give us it. He'll be upside again. Well, she's white.

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:40.960]
What sort of halfway? See, there you go. Pick it on the beaners again. See, blame George. Okay, do a piece about George.

[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:48.920]

The girls who said, ways are torn. And she's living with the women at the funny play toys in the house of the lesbians.

[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:58.460]
When she was young at a restaurant with a boy, he didn't know that she was gay. Until he noticed each time they went out, she went for the seafood buffet.

[01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.880]
And she said, hey, you're good.

[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:11.120]
Just look at all roses, Dyke sisters now. Just look what they have done.

[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:23.280]
The minute she comes home from work to that door, well off her panties come.

[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:36.280]
She laid it down to stop publishing the rosy mag left a laid off staff not paid.

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:48.240]
And Rose is girlfriend who's pregnant right now. I guess she just only got laid.

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:03:00.240]
There is a girl with extra wide jeans entertainer. She's become.

[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:12.880]
And she goes by the name of Rosie O.D. in the house of the lesbians.

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:38.480]
And she's gay.

[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:08.440]
And she's not worth it.

[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.080]
And she's not worth it.

[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.120]
And she's not worth it.

[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.500]
And she's not worth it.

[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.460]
And she's not worth it.

[01:06:52.460 --> 01:07:14.100]
And she's not worth it.

[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:37.520]
And she's not worth it.

[01:07:37.520 --> 01:08:07.500]
And she's not worth it.

[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:22.620]
And she's not worth it.

[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:37.480]
And she's not worth it.

[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.500]
And she's not worth it.

[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:07.460]
And she's not worth it.

[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:24.380]
And she's not worth it.

[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:37.360]
And she's not worth it.

[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.860]
Can someone explain my Al Gore received 540,000 more votes than George W. Bush in the 2000 election?

[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.160]
The answer to my question is fraud and disenfranchisement.

[01:09:48.160 --> 01:10:00.260]
And in the summer of 1999, Catherine Harris, Bush's campaign coach, airwoman, paid $4 million to database technology to go through Florida's voter rules and remove anyone suspected of being a felon as I just indicated with that other story.

[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:09.560]
She did this with a blessing of Governor Jeff Bush, whose own wife was caught by the INS trying to sneak $19,000 worth of jewelry into the country without declaring and paying taxes on a felony its own right.

[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:16.560]
The New York Times reported 344 ballots had no evidence that they were cast on or before Election Day.

[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.800]
Now keep in mind, he won by what?

[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.840]
A little over 500 votes?

[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:20.900]
A legged?

[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:28.300]
344 had no evidence they were cast on or before Election Day. 183 ballots were postmarked in the U.S. This is the absentee ballots overseas.

[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:34.320]
Five ballots came after the November 17 deadline and 19 overseas voters voted on two ballots and had both counted.

[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.480]
So let's see, add up that where layers 527, 532, right there is enough to turn the election right there.

[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:50.700]
Forgetting about the thousands and thousands and thousands of people were turned away, people were demanded to have three forms of ID before they could vote mostly dark folks because everybody wrote,

[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.760]
not to mention all the people who were pulled over by the good old boys, they were the FH peers on a highway, the FH pigs.

[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.460]
All of these ballots violated Florida law yet they were all counted.

[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.900]
These are just some of the many examples of how the Republican Party cheated to get their candidate in office.

[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.620]
So he is now in, there's nothing we can do but accept him and hope for the best.

[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.680]
Maybe he'll not turn out to be a bad president.

[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.120]
Let's see what he's done since he's been in office.

[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:18.880]
He has cut 39 million from federal spending on libraries, cut funding for research into renewable energy sources by 50%.

[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.760]
Cut funding for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks by 28%.

[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.300]
Brokenness campaign promised to invest 100 million a year in rainforest conservation.

[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.440]
Cut 200 million from workforce training program for dislocated workers.

[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.420]
Eliminated prescription contraception coverage of federal employees, although Viagr was still covered.

[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.040]
Abandonedness campaign promised to regulate carbon dioxide emission and may are contributed to global warming.

[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:44.440]
Denied college financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges, although convicted murderers are still eligible for financial aid.

[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.800]
And cut $16 million from programs dealing with child abuse and neglect.

[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.200]
Not to mention, of course, things like stem cell research, little things like that.

[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:59.220]
And the whole list, the whole long list of right-wing fascist judges that he's getting ready to appoint if they have control of the Senate.

[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.980]
Which I'm afraid they will.

[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.740]
You mark my words in spite of all these all the talk.

[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.360]
I think, I think Mondale's got a good chance to lose him in a soda.

[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.640]
I think Gene Carnahan's got two chances in Missouri, none and less than none.

[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:14.660]
Hope I'm wrong.

[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.040]
We'll see.

[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.340]
But you talk about a dummy electric man.

[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.060]
They sit out there.

[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.000]
No, no, no, no, like that.

[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.620]
Oh, he never stole a freight train.

[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.740]
He'd be talking real nice stuff like that.

[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.500]
You know, he just like this last dark, complicated caller a couple of minutes ago.

[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.340]
How could any patient people be voting for Jeb Bush?

[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.660]
That display we saw in the news this morning if he wants enough to make you gag.

[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.980]
Four more years. Four more years.

[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:38.800]
Face down what?

[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.900]
Based on the fact that he and his brother, that his brother comes up with this.

[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.140]
It's still secret, by the way.

[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.940]
He still won't tell anybody when the policy was instituted.

[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.220]
December sometime last year.

[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:51.740]
That's it.

[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:52.940]
Well, what does it say?

[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.080]
We're not saying shut up.

[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280]
Yeah, what was it based on?

[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.940]
Don't ask any more questions.

[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.340]
Government in the dark.

[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:02.600]
Government in the back rooms.

[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.800]
Government in the oil corporation board rooms.

[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.720]
That's what it's all about.

[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.140]
27 after 10 at 560 W.

[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.400]
What am I getting all whipped up about?

[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.760]
Huh? Am I stupid or?

[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.140]
I am. I'm really stupid.

[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.760]
I think somebody who's our stupid and gay.

[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.360]
188 votes. How do you feel about tomorrow's election?

[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.420]
It's very important. 67.

[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.660]
I'm voting but not excited. 55.

[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.620]
It's life in death. 32.

[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.620]
I'm not voting. Why bother 25?

[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.620]
What? Me? Worry?

[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.820]
Guess how many people say what? Me? Worry.

[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.180]
Yeah.

[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.340]
Uh-huh. Good guess, Robert.

[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.420]
Oh, of course, Robert.

[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.980]
He already voted three times for Bush.

[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.500]
We know that.

[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.500]
Self-hating little Jew bastard.

[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.280]
You know, Alan, that's nothing.

[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.840]
Did you see the ads where Bush is wearing a Yarmulcon air?

[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.140]
Oh my God.

[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:42.660]
Woo!

[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.260]
And they're doing the thing with Israel and how good he is for Israel.

[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.160]
He loves Israel.

[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.820]
And he eats potato pancakes on a weekend.

[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.020]
And on the alternate Wednesdays, he eats potato kogel.

[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.220]
Yeah. Who the hell are they, kiddin' man?

[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.300]
These are the same people I want to drag this down the road to Armageddon.

[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.460]
So that everybody except then, the good born against can die.

[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.960]
Well, except the rest of us don't make his offer.

[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.060]
We can't refuse. Kind of like the Spanish Inquisition.

[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.100]
If you recall, I'll have another choice. Again.

[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.180]
Oh, yeah, again.

[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.740]
10.28 at 5.60. Don't confuse them with the facts.

[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.080]
Okay.

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.640]
Here's something that's not confusing at all.

[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.400]
That's dial amatras.

[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.060]
Miguel can barely walk now.

[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:21.860]
He can barely stand up.

[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.700]
He's been screwing his brains out so much since he got his green new amatras

[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.940]
named following on the floor all the time.

[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.460]
That's right. In fact, he nearly got ditched because he used to slip off the

[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.520]
deep end every time just at the wrong moment. Bad move.

[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.400]
Now he's got that great new amatras from dial amatras and you can do the same.

[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.580]
If the old amatras is lumpy and bumpy and maybe smelly,

[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:41.200]
not so good anymore, get you a great new amatras from dial amatras like I always do too.

[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.120]
And Miguel, just call 1-800-MATR-ES.

[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:48.180]
You get the ultimate freedom of choice brand name amatras because they've got them all.

[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.020]
Serta, Ceeley, Simmons, Kingcoyle, no off brand names only the top manufacturers in the world

[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.980]
and no store can match their selection or exceptionally low everyday prices.

[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:58.800]
And because dial amatras has the deepest selective brand name amatras,

[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.640]
they don't have to give you the old bait and swish and send you over at amatras

[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.740]
that you didn't want in the first place.

[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.460]
Exactly the one you want is in stock and you're going to get it almost immediately too.

[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.420]
That delivery deal almost unheard of.

[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.020]
Any two-hour window you pick when it's convenient when you're going to be home

[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.380]
any day, seven days a week, noon to two, one to three, two to four, etc.

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.340]
And the 30-day in-home comfort guarantee to test your great new amatras out to smart way

[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.140]
by sleeping and doing your thing on it, whatever your thing might be.

[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.900]
Call him today. You'll be sleeping like a baby as soon as tonight.

[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:30.320]
1-800-MATRUS. 1-800-MATRES or check them out on the web if you like it, mattress.com.

[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:36.240]
Line and local. We're sports radio 560s. You a-m.

[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.840]
Push back to the moon!

[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.980]
Well, he's a telehazzy Nazi.

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:49.180]
Who got the money from his daddy?

[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.400]
And if I said my little granny?

[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.400]
Whoa, it's an agenda that grabs me.

[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.760]
Well, he's a telehazzy Nazi.

[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.500]
Double-layer Sela.

[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:06.480]
Well, he's a presidential son who doesn't have to run.

[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.740]
No one else is on, oh, and he might as well just move right in.

[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:15.380]
She's hired. She hired. She hired. She hired.

[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.340]
He has the golden spoon. He was born with the pizzazz.

[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.660]
So look out all you Jews. Get ready for the gasp.

[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.360]
He's a telehazzy Nazi.

[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.220]
To give our civil rights a whammy.

[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.580]
I see the telehazzy Nazi. Double-layer Sela.

[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.800]
Well, he's a very wealthy Jew.

[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.000]
With very fascist Jews. Who never paid his dues?

[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.560]
My next year will all be screws. She hired.

[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.280]
She hired. She hired. She hired.

[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.240]
Any smart could win that race against Buddy McKay.

[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.960]
Why do you think they call it Cuba?

[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.380]
Victoria Lanyray. He's a telehazzy Nazi.

[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:57.600]
Whoo!

[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.480]
He'll link the KKK Happy.

[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.660]
Whoa, yeah, he's a telehazzy Nazi. Double-layer Sela.

[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.180]
Come on, let's do stuff.

[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.440]
Come on, little.

[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.140]
Let's go for life.

[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.780]
735-60 W.Q.I.M. Here's the fact.

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.260]
Bush controls the White House, the Supreme Court, and the media.

[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.520]
In the next two days elections, Vini and Demar has a good chance of gaining the Senate as well.

[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.380]
Giving him total control over our government.

[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.080]
He'll think of that as a mandate to activate his most repugnant domestic and foreign policies.

[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.320]
I thought he already did that.

[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.680]
The only force standing between him and his goal of total domination is the voter.

[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.180]
The only candidate capable of debating you are the Democrats.

[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.720]
Your choice, folks, says this facts.

[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.160]
Okay, there you go. Well, we can sit here and pontificate all day long.

[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.900]
I don't think it's going to do too much good because, like I said at the beginning of the show,

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.300]
the Democrats have done a piss-forward job, a pathetic job of bringing a case to the public.

[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.860]
It's tremendously bad job because they're scared and you know, you've got to give him credit for that.

[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.440]
The Bush-Mistors, they've done a great job of that.

[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.740]
Payed it him into a corner.

[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.080]
You're either with us or against us.

[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.900]
He wasn't just talking about Ontarioism. He's talking about everything.

[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.160]
You name it.

[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.420]
This is the great United who was going to do it with partisan politics.

[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:08.860]
Right.

[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.200]
Are you either with us or against us?

[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.060]
Okay, you got it.

[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.160]
That's how you unite people.

[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.160]
Commonista, come on.

[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:15.680]
Yeah.

[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.420]
You make them offer the camera fuse.

[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:24.140]
Don't forget you and the overnight guys doing Mark the Night Night and we're loving a gaspies and Kendall stop out of it when our usual very, very low budget QA and prizes.

[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.940]
And enjoy specials on Crown Royal.

[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.860]
That's why Miguel shows up every Monday.

[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.780]
It's the money that football is that often visit the Packers at gaspies and Kendall.

[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.500]
I hear they're going to be packing it tonight. That's what I'm hearing.

[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.900]
Here's the fact that it says make sure you don't say the word niggeredly.

[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.120]
You don't want to be no racist. That's right.

[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.980]
I'd be thanking you very much.

[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.280]
Yeah, if we just could get together, man.

[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.880]
If we could just all get together, pick it on the moose.

[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.040]
No, I'm not picking on the moosey man. He's a hero now.

[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.120]
And I did see his wife on that board.

[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.540]
Oh, foul mouth bitch.

[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.180]
Here's one that says you see her.

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.080]
No, I see an end.

[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:53.820]
Is the foul mouth bitch?

[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.280]
That might mean she didn't use any.

[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.440]
I was through this last year.

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.060]
I'm repeating material. I already did it with Carl.

[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:58.520]
Oh, sorry.

[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.160]
But you didn't see her. Have you haven't seen her?

[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:00.400]
No.

[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:01.880]
White, blonde, fat.

[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:02.520]
Oh.

[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:03.280]
Oh.

[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:04.300]
Yeah.

[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.460]
Kind of like maybe she'd been some of the trailer parks.

[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:08.860]
Just for a visit. I know the title.

[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.280]
Speaking of that, it says that Rosie's song is the most disgusting song I've ever heard.

[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.760]
Please don't play any song that talks about Rosie's panties coming off.

[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.500]
Okay. Promise me about to it again.

[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.040]
You see the liberals? They pick on the homosexuals.

[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.420]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.720]
And here's the facts which is very long about digital radio and about clear channel.

[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.540]
Cheap channel won't want it until the wait pass 2004.

[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.740]
And of course, because that's the election year and cheap channel supports the Bushmeister.

[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.560]
They'll push it another several years down.

[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.300]
Or just like did it with a DTV.

[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.020]
See what I'm saying?

[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:38.380]
Yeah.

[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.800]
Yeah, because they don't want to go out and spend the money for the technology.

[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:43.040]
So little time is your cause though. He's writing about a beep.

[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.600]
And want to be great that we hear KAT all that classical.

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.780]
Do you think Tom jica listens to classical music?

[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.040]
No.

[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.560]
No, I don't.

[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.240]
No, I don't.

[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.620]
Anybody that belches that much can't possibly listen to classical music.

[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.400]
But he sure is obsessed pandering.

[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.820]
And by the way, those people don't read your column anyway, Tom.

[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.180]
They don't read your column.

[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.200]
They just write a lot of hysterical letters to the newspaper.

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.560]
But they sure don't read what you're writing.

[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.280]
WQAM.

[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.280]
Hi Neil.

[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:07.820]
Yes sir.

[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:14.140]
I think the biggest irony about this five things is that you've given you more publicity over a week than your cheap radio station is giving you.

[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:15.320]
That's a good point.

[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.400]
The only sad part is nobody watches Fox.

[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.380]
Nobody knows about it.

[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:18.720]
You're right.

[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.040]
Well, that's not a sad point.

[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:20.580]
That's good.

[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.680]
And also I watched a little bit of that Michael, that Michael Moore thing.

[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:35.120]
And he found an ad in a newspaper about a bank that gives away guns if you open up an account somewhere in Yahoo somewhere.

[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:43.080]
He went up to the bank and not only did they open his account, they asked him a few questions.

[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.200]
They gave him a vicious background check of almost five minutes.

[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.160]
They showed him the magazine.

[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.080]
They showed him a magazine with like 500 guns in it, which they kept at the bank.

[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.440]
And they gave him his gun right at the bank.

[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.240]
Unbelievable.

[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.320]
You just think of the symbolism involved there, okay?

[01:20:59.500 --> 01:20:59.980]
Give him a gun.

[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.380]
He's the last of me to say you think you're safe giving someone a gun at a bank.

[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:05.940]
Unbelievable.

[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.400]
Have a great day pal.

[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:07.640]
Two.

[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.620]
Vote early and often.

[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:09.640]
Two, three, four times.

[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.240]
Muff is going to go vote tomorrow.

[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.900]
That's why she brought me my birthday card day because you might not see me.

[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.680]
He's going to be on vote tomorrow.

[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.840]
There might be long lines.

[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.820]
That's a real good way of cutting down the number of people who vote especially in day and rowered.

[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:28.840]
Long lines, lots of confusion, not enough fun machines, not enough people who understand how to operate the machines.

[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:33.420]
They said yesterday that people were voting like on Sunday or whatever day it was over the weekend.

[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.600]
It was taken up to 15 minutes of piece to vote because it's such a lengthy ballot.

[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.440]
And because it's confusing because these people have never touched it before in the screen either.

[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.660]
No, seriously, 15 minutes of piece do you understand what that means?

[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.740]
A long time.

[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.500]
And I guess I better do the break first before I get to Mike Mayer's commentary.

[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.740]
It's about time he wrote something worth reading on a show mic.

[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.380]
I mean, this is the second column in about a year since he's been doing the non-sports stuff.

[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.780]
Since he got demoted to the nobody reads this page.

[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.680]
Poor Mike Mayer, you know.

[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.620]
That's what you get for dicking with his show, Mike.

[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.860]
That's what you get for doing that.

[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.880]
Don't you think that it's payback is a bitch car?

[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.940]
What happened to Bob Rubin?

[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:15.120]
Worst and that kid with the Eagles guys, Bob Rubin said something about being Jewish and they hurled put him like on the, you know, back pages somewhere.

[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.640]
Nobody ever sees him anymore.

[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.520]
That's the same hero that endorsed you.

[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.180]
Bush for re-election and the same son sentinel.

[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.740]
I still can't get over that.

[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.680]
I must have been a dream.

[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.280]
It must have been a bad dream.

[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.200]
Is it possible?

[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:28.540]
No.

[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.540]
I don't think so.

[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:37.760]
After they run this series of staving horrendous articles ripping and exposing and tearing and chewing and gnashing.

[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.360]
And oh, well, you know, let's go for him.

[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:48.960]
I don't want to say that like there's any exchange of money involved in that because I have no grounds to make that, but it sure raises some doubts in my mind.

[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.900]
As to what the hell's going on here and speaking of money, didn't I predict this months ago?

[01:22:54.440 --> 01:23:00.720]
That right before the election, you're going to see the market and then a couple of days before the election, you're going to see the stock market zooming back up again.

[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.660]
All controlled, all manipulated like the market always is anyway.

[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.840]
Last week and again, all look at that futures net and the Nasdaqs of 50 points.

[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.080]
Forget about futures. They're already open, of course. Nasdaqs of 50 points.

[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.000]
The S and P's of 20 that I was up almost 200 points.

[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.040]
Does anybody with a brain believe it?

[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:17.980]
Of course not.

[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:23.780]
All the millionaires and a billionaires, they're ported in their baby and then on Wednesday, they have to the election tomorrow.

[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.580]
It's going to like the right back where it belongs.

[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.000]
And then in the meantime, I'll show these big numbers. They're saying, well, by the way, are we in recession again?

[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.880]
You think could be.

[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.700]
That's why everybody's just rushing to call their broker to buy this crap.

[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.780]
Sun micro systems, $2.42 a share, by the way.

[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:39.380]
Want some?

[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.300]
For free.

[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.820]
$2.42.

[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.700]
Remember the conversation we had that day?

[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.580]
They're bargaining at 60.

[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.220]
What a bargain at 60 or 70, whatever it was.

[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.340]
$2.00 in some odd sense.

[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.140]
Stay calm.

[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.520]
Stay calm.

[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.400]
20 to 11 at 5.

[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.720]
At 5.60 WQAM.

[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.320]
Tom Layman always stays calm. He's calm, cool and collected.

[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.540]
Because he knows that you folks are going to keep coming back.

[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.800]
Because he treats you right. That's the way to get customers back.

[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.160]
Treat him right, which is a novel idea here in South Florida.

[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.740]
Where they usually treat you like crap.

[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.700]
Anyway, Tom loves the people listening to the show, which is why he's created that Neil Deal is going on again at Hellett.

[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.240]
Save big dollars at all Pontiacs and GMCs in stock.

[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.340]
If you mentioned you heard about Tom Layman and the folks at Hellett Pontiac on this show, he'll fall on the floor first of all and give even more of a saving.

[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.160]
Stop by Hellett Pontiacs GMC-134-01 South Dixie Highway.

[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.540]
That's US-1 across from the falls.

[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.680]
Where every vehicle is marked with lowest price.

[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.060]
But if you mentioned the Neil Rogers deal, just say Neil Rogers.

[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.920]
J. Feeler, Neil Rogers, like that. And you'll save even more.

[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.800]
Or just mention Mo.

[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.800]
Check out the complete line of GMC.

[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.880]
What are you laughing about? I bet you he's a Mo man.

[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:46.560]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.000]
It's time to get it on.

[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.960]
Check out the complete line of GMC SUVs, including the envoy voted by Motor Trends SUV.

[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.780]
The year and the all new vibe SUV with the power of a big gas-guzzling sports car.

[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.000]
But it's your ain't no Corvette.

[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.820]
What do I love Corvettes?

[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.760]
Hellett's also got a great selection of pre-owned cars, cars, cars, cars, and SUVs.

[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.380]
And when it comes to credit, even if every other dealer in town turned you down,

[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.260]
because you were a clown,

[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.160]
and you were now on for being a deadbeat.

[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.360]
The answer is they'll give you a dead deal at Hellett.

[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.700]
They'll cut it for you and the deal too.

[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.860]
Get a Neil Rogers deal right now at Hellett Pontiac GMC across from the falls.

[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.940]
Open every day of your life seven days a week.

[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.780]
Hellett Pontiac GMC, who'll continue to save in spite of my protestations,

[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.480]
we be professional grade.

[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.800]
It's my life and love all.

[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.780]
This is Sports Radio 5 City.

[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.640]
You ain't too bad.

[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.340]
Let's rape more.

[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.840]
Radio big cars.

[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:37.340]
Oh!

[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.400]
That's how we pass the time away.

[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.180]
Give the gay old jailer a hug.

[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:44.140]
Wow!

[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.540]
He floats good.

[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.060]
Like a Cuban boy should.

[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.820]
He floats good.

[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.860]
Like a wishes mother would.

[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.020]
He floats good.

[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.180]
Like wood, sending back.

[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:05.380]
Wow! He floats good.

[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.020]
Even on a car hood.

[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.620]
He floats good.

[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.420]
He'd save the good.

[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.720]
Floods good.

[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:19.240]
Oh!

[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:19.540]
Oh!

[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:22.220]
Like wood, sending back.

[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:23.960]
Wow!

[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.320]
And don't forget, this is the life we have chosen.

[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.140]
1046-560WDQ.

[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.200]
I saw that again over the last weekend I think it was.

[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.380]
Couldn't turn it off.

[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.360]
I didn't ask.

[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.220]
Didn't ask any questions.

[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.260]
A happy birthday, Neil says Jane and four letters on stay calm.

[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.640]
She says, okay Jane, I was calm as a goddamn cute cover in a pickle patch.

[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.100]
Okay sweetheart, I'm calm.

[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:48.860]
Not.

[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.100]
Somebody's got to get a little whipped up and enthusiastic about this.

[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.540]
We're going to have phone bar.

[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.460]
They come in like crazy.

[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:54.760]
No.

[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.080]
No, it's the same old stuff.

[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:56.900]
I mean that I know.

[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.080]
That I know about this place.

[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.800]
Trying to motivate people in here is like, like, like, trying to like have a party in a goddamn graveyard.

[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.100]
254 votes.

[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.420]
How do you feel about tomorrow's election?

[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.040]
It's very important, 89.

[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.460]
I'm voting but not excited 74.

[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.240]
It's life and death 44, which quite frankly is the right answer.

[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.060]
I'm not voting why bother 31 and what me worry 16.

[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.240]
Yeah, like that.

[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:25.040]
Michael Mayo, who's usually writing, what do I look like that has a pretty good column today.

[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.320]
Nice going Mike, by the time.

[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.740]
Jeb and Feds fiddle in face of a looming election fiasco.

[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.120]
He says, gee, what a surprise.

[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.780]
Governor Jeb Bush isn't exactly bending over back to make things easy run voters who face election day gridlock and Democrat heavy south Florida.

[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.220]
You think he's going to air on the side of democracy and fairness with his job on the line?

[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:48.900]
You think he's going to allow extended hours at the polls and use of provisional ballots to alleviate backups when that could translate into thousands more votes for rival Bill McBride?

[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:49.720]
Yeah, right.

[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.020]
That's about as much chance of that happening as Florida state football coach Bobby Bowden agreeing to play a five quarter game against Florida.

[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.180]
Only this isn't a football game.

[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.560]
This is the essence of democracy.

[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.620]
And considering Florida's wofful recent past, everything that can be done should be done to make sure people can vote.

[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:11.180]
It ought to make everyone's bloodboard US representative LC Hastings of Miramar said at an NAACP town hall meeting Friday and for Lauderdale.

[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:19.240]
On primary day Bush was magnanimous in the face of a meltdown ordering polls to stay open extra two hours statewide because of problems in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.

[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.740]
Of course, that decision that no bearing on his future only those of McBride and Janet Reno.

[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:32.920]
But this time with an absurdly long and confusing ballot and insufficient number of new touchscreen machines, Bush, Twittlesystems and whistles, even as we all see it coming.

[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.760]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.460]
The governor has a lot of discretion in these situations Hastings said so don't tell me he couldn't do something.

[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:43.920]
If Bush's exit polling suggests he's comfortably ahead and the weight gets out of hand and stuff.

[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:49.220]
Florida Hastings figures the governor might extend hours and allow paper ballots midstream toward off charges of disenfranchisement.

[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.600]
But there's no telling how many voters would already have been scared off from the polls mission accomplished.

[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.980]
Wouldn't it be better to be proactive and make adjustments now?

[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:07.820]
That's what Hastings in US Representative Peter Deutsch, Democrat of Fort Lauderdale, asked the US Department of Justice and that's what Broward, Elections Supervisor Miriam Elephant and her shrewd his political move in months, asked the governor.

[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.320]
But Bush and the feds are taking a hands-off approach.

[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.100]
The justice department will send monitors to watch us unravel but apparently doesn't want to do anything that could actually help us vote.

[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:24.600]
And Bush's general counsel Charles Kennedy wrote Elephant that extended hours were unwarranted then tried and we trust that you live up to your duty in commitment to run a sound election.

[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:33.200]
That's a cheap shot. Elephant was rightfully stripped of moisture duties after a botched handling of the September primary forced to hand them off to be hard deputy Joe Carter in the County Commission.

[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:39.980]
She has little to do with this election, a $125,000 year figurehead. In this case though, Elephant is right in trying to do what's best for the voters.

[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.060]
The elections office is a dysfunctional mess with Carter and Elephant barely speaking or knowing what the other is doing.

[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]
The soap opera will only get better after election day.

[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:55.000]
The big question, will a re-elected Bush give Elephant the axe before Elephant gets a chance to give Carter the axe, but first almost get through Tuesday.

[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:59.520]
There will be ironic payback if this election turns out to be another disaster, it will.

[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.580]
Like the father says, it will, Billy, it will.

[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.740]
The County Commission led by Lori Paristorm to take control and during Elephant's demise a little bit too much.

[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:14.540]
Now even if a precinct opens up on time, every worker shows up and every machine functions perfectly, the run-on ballot might trigger a meltdown.

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:20.280]
This time, Parish and the Commission will get the blame which is perfect because they were the ones too cheap to buy enough new machines.

[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.260]
It's inexcusable that Broward has more registered voters than they had bought 2,000 fewer machines.

[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:29.840]
Hard to say, he'll get more perverse pleasure out of Tuesday, Bush or Miriam Elephant.

[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:35.400]
Pretty good column there Mike Mail. Like I said, it's about time. Give me like a little, and not too much.

[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.020]
No one knows.

[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.880]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.480]
This audience is whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:45.400]
They're smoking.

[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:45.740]

[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:48.800]
WQAM.

[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:50.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:56.400]
Oh, I didn't want to go on the air, but I just want to know if anybody calls to close you about how David being on your competitor there.

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:00.880]
About five minutes ago, doing a long football talk, talking about the football weekend.

[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.820]
He was on the Fox Sports Station.

[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.000]
Yeah, on Tony Bruno whatever that show is.

[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.300]
Moa Howard David was on with Tony Bruno.

[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:09.680]
Yeah, nice.

[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.060]
He was on when I first got a call, but I was on hold.

[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.660]
But yeah, remember what happened when I...

[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.980]
The Humper. The Humper ain't never going to do that again, right?

[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.820]
Yeah, well, he wasn't even just talking about the dominance.

[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.500]
He was talking about the whole football weekend, whatever.

[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.880]
That's what I was talking about that.

[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.380]
Well, that's probably good for us.

[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.160]
I mean, a lot of people turned off from them over to us.

[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.040]
That's right. All right.

[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.500]
Thanks for the good news. Thanks for the report.

[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.120]
How do you like that?

[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.020]
Moa Howard David.

[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.160]
I'm getting pounded.

[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:32.300]
Good.

[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.580]
Goes out on what he enemy.

[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.060]
See, this radio station just is just out of control.

[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.980]
Remember we had this with my good friend, the Humper?

[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.880]
A couple years ago, he was on it with Roaming, unless he was on it with Roaming.

[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:49.160]
And one of those jockfest where they all get together and they're like, you know, going on each other's shows.

[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.020]
And I went to Humper, we could overlook it one.

[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.360]
Just this one time, we looked the other way for the Humper.

[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.980]
We looked the other way for Moa Howard David.

[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:56.340]
No.

[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.920]
Maybe from Mogan, David, I might look the other way, but not from Moa Howard, David.

[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.940]
Shameless, shameless, concerning with the enemy.

[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:06.360]
And of course, that makes sense to me because he's not a part of this radio station anyway.

[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.140]
So why shouldn't he be on with somebody else?

[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.600]
And everybody else, who the hell gives a crap?

[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.060]
But thanks for the spy report, pal.

[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.060]
It fits right in.

[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.120]
It fits right in with his bogus operandi.

[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.420]
Coming to QAM.

[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:18.820]
Same thing, you know.

[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.820]
Fireport office, because he listens to him every day.

[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:22.900]
What is it?

[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.220]
He's got the lessons to them every day.

[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:26.640]
Great.

[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.740]
So in other words, he's not only concerning with them, he's promoting their radio station.

[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.260]
Maybe that, thanks for the good news.

[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.440]
Maybe he can go to work out in the morning on that station, okay?

[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.800]
Got to improve on that point one.

[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.060]
They got her whatever to point nine.

[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.860]
I'm sorry, don't exaggerate.

[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.880]
Even though Jim Sarni says they're moving up on Moa, point nine.

[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.200]
Maybe that's why they're putting them on there.

[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.240]
How do you like that?

[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.740]
And you notice we had two calls in a row.

[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.560]
They just heard Moa now they're over talking to us.

[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:51.580]
What does that tell you?

[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.920]
He's enough to drive anybody off the dial.

[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.080]
56670560, 0560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.040]
WNQAM.

[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.360]
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?

[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:01.660]
Okay.

[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:05.860]
That article, you had a few minutes ago about all the things that they did there.

[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.640]
W up there.

[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.080]
Where is the origin of that?

[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.180]
So I can let down low that.

[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:14.020]
Then when I argue with all my stupid, Republican friends on his hands on that.

[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:14.960]
That wasn't an article.

[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.660]
That was some listener fact.

[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.760]
Just send me that facts from where he was.

[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:19.920]
I mean, what newspaper?

[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.200]
Well, he wrote it.

[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:22.060]
Some listener wrote it.

[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:25.900]
Oh, well, I'd love to get a copy of that just coming because I had explained everything.

[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.360]
I get really frustrated with these doubts.

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.500]
I don't understand.

[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.160]
Passholes, yeah.

[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:29.540]
Yeah.

[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.260]
I couldn't get a copy of that from anywhere.

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:32.920]
No.

[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:34.580]
56670560.

[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:35.960]
What are you laughing about?

[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.580]
It's in a waste basket already.

[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.180]
I'm not going to start sending out copies.

[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.720]
We're not like running some kind of a printing press here.

[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.380]
Some kind of a guy with their newspaper over there.

[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.200]
It's a radio show.

[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.140]
It's a little flucky-ass radio show.

[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.920]
That's totally out of control.

[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.620]
I mean, the shift is a drift at the seat.

[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.340]
Even the Humphrey Bogart would be an improvement, okay?

[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.820]
Squeezing his goddamn balls a little bit.

[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.360]
That's right.

[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.620]
At least we get some strawberries anyway.

[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:00.980]
Let's see how it went.

[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:02.540]
I'm just strawberries, nice game.

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.220]
I'm just trying to read it.

[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:03.300]
I'm trying to read them.

[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.940]
I don't have any food in here today.

[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.100]
Didn't bring anything from my sack.

[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.300]
I guess I'm not going to eat.

[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.680]
Who doesn't need to eat.

[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:10.620]
What do you think?

[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.080]
Well, have you weighed a little something there?

[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.020]
I see what I have left to go.

[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.160]
I have my spring roll with a big slice of turkey.

[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.560]
Oh, you had your little schnack, yeah?

[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:17.960]
And then I got a wrap for later.

[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:18.660]
But, hey.

[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.240]
That's gonna be the real.

[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.080]
Ha ha. What who's getting skinny as a real? I said you said I was skinny as a real

[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.960]
They are the two minutes that I popped it on

[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.460]
I was Harlow's who's skinny. Oh, no, I was talking about how you shouldn't be getting any favorite like away

[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.980]
And that's right and they should take care of God and the beast okay, I still can get a picture out of that

[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.860]
Poor Troy Stradford comes in this morning. I'm grilling him about that about Troy with a two earrings over there

[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:41.980]
It's balanced for life. I'm grilling him and he's gone

[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.140]
But I mean but it moved like that and it tells me he's gonna be on the year on the dolphin the five-hour pregame

[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.440]
cluster fork

[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.200]
What do we carry you know you notice it's always some diversion always something happened to do with a bunch of silly-ass sports

[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.600]
Hey look at that. Yeah

[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.560]
What's that over there?

[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.240]
You know the spot I'm talking about yes, what's that the guy what do you think on his I love that

[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.860]
WQ I am yes, you know about the more always I also heard him he's talking about

[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:15.260]
Yeah, being listening to them every day and

[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.960]
That he really he kind of ranked on the stage saying he couldn't hear their station

[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.180]
But he says the psychic managed

[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.780]
This and that but he sounds pretty dumb and they were asking a question and he was like lost in space. I'm getting palad

[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:34.140]
Good it was pretty funny. See you. Thanks a lot of all how are its fire reports there and which mean indicate I don't understand it

[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.480]
How are these people hearing that if they're listening to the world famous Neil Rogers?

[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.520]
I guess these are people who don't want to vote you know the brakes

[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.760]
I'm sure I see doing the break their turn over there because he don't want to hear our fine commercial

[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.200]
So that that pisses me off especially the trash violence spot you got coming up

[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.900]
What they know all about it. Oh

[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.540]
Now let's see it's not this week. It's not gonna be right next week. Okay. I just want to mention that no treasure

[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.920]
I'm this week for George Thursday night from what I'm hearing they had a pretty wild time there Miguel

[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.960]
Isn't permitted to go anymore. His girlfriend got jealous. No, but I don't see what you know that always that what was going on

[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:09.000]
Yeah, he's not permitted to go there any see he didn't tell me the real story

[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.260]
That's the real story. His girlfriend said no, my baby no, my she said and of course what what the no

[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:18.220]
My sister's connected with all depends on what you do on Thursday. I thought I had it bad. Yeah

[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.500]
Well, let's face it you do

[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:26.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.300]
Willen rate me

[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.360]
oh

[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.540]
Hey

[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:01.060]
Okay

[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:05.700]
You always rate me, it must be because I got the school's greatest football's best.

[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.260]
A main part, on my arm like a ramic nally nappa lacoat.

[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.560]
I got things on my nose, nobody knows that under my glows I wear fancy hoes, but that

[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.920]
don't mean that I'm gay.

[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.500]
If you think my arms have had you ought to see my legs, am I as well keep on smoothing

[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.020]
shaved to show little clasped the next time I'm rapin' it.

[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:23.440]
I could go to a surgeon, but that gives me to shivers.

[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.540]
I would not want to walk out looking like Joan Rivers.

[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.300]
But where am I?

[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.940]
I'm higher than the beast, the fat little freak.

[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.240]
I get them up vapin' now again, affordin' me.

[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.600]
The reason I dismissed that sneakin' fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up, and he can't play conestin'.

[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.100]
Hey, somebody talkin' over there, nobody talkin' around.

[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.460]
I rap ten you talk.

[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.500]
Look at me, I'm big head.

[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:45.660]
I ain't no square.

[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.640]
I'm a ding-dong daddy, man, I'm really dead.

[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.500]
I ain't higher than anyone I want, I don't care.

[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.560]
Let's play if they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair.

[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.780]
I got tired myself and even happens to the greets.

[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.420]
Westwood once said you'll get out of here whilst we break your legs.

[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.300]
So now I sit by the pool, life's as good as it gets.

[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:07.660]
With my paladin cartel, placing bits on the jets.

[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.360]
In paradise, paradise, I don't kiss nobody's hair since paradise.

[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:12.700]
Go go go go go.

[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:17.300]
I'll be shoving up the screw kids when I get the chance, but the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants.

[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.260]
How long does it take?

[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.320]
Kelti calling a plate.

[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.620]
It was just a little thought, so what I left this day?

[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.100]
I get sick, that's fine, I want an ugly sandwich, buddy.

[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.340]
I can do what I want, when the management loves me.

[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.880]
If I get something more, something you ought to know, but the longest time I wanted you to be my home.

[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.540]
You and my pal, now I am straight.

[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:33.040]
Hold now.

[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.660]
What do you do?

[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.720]
I won't take no for an answer.

[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:35.980]
Hold it.

[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.120]
What is that?

[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:37.660]
Not you.

[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:38.240]

[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.200]
Put it up there.

[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:39.900]
Put it up there.

[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:40.440]
Put it up there.

[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.420]
Put it up there.

[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.540]
Put it up there.

[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.020]
Put it up there.

[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.740]
Put it up there.

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:46.840]

[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:48.360]
Put it up there.

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.660]
Put it up there.

[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.800]
Guess what the name of the column by Marine doubt in the Uni-Rak times is yesterday?

[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.100]
Eminem Shakira and Osama. Oh great timing. How did all fits in?

[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.600]
I have to draw you a diaphragm and she wrote it from Riyadh Saudi Arabian Oles to great Marine doubt

[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.180]
She says the DKNY shopping bag was delivered to my motel room at 1 30 a.m

[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:17.780]
Inside was a ribbon box from the Al-Nada Philanthropic Society for women containing a black silk abaya with red and blue embroidery on the sleeves and a long black chiffon scarf

[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:24.180]
The tag set size 59 and alarming hopefully metrics that you would never see in that city other city of Palm trees women pools

[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:29.320]
pampered royalty 24 hour traffic and male dominance Los Angeles where the dresses trend towards size zero

[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:35.920]
I wasn't sure if the gift was a polite message that on Friday the holy day would men go to the mosques with their sons and women's stay at home and pray

[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.300]
I might not want to be the only bear-haired woman in town or if it was simply part of the Saudis five million dollar charm offensive to persuade us

[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:43.200]
They're not in the enemy

[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.100]
I had written a column thoughtfully arguing that if the Bush administration wanted to attack a country with ties to al-Qaeda and undemocratic

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.560]
Repressive ways we should invade Saudi Arabia

[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.440]
Taking care of business in a flash the Saudi sent me that rarest of journalistic privileges a visa

[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:01.220]
It's a weird rod-sealing type feeling to drive through a city of four million people and never see a woman

[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:04.560]
Though I did see a shop called ladies photographs for women composed without the veil

[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:11.080]
It's a weird feeling to be barred from the hotel gym and pool and to see separate entrances for women at banks and severed women's malls within malls

[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.940]
It's odd to think that your hair is rude

[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:18.040]
We're old-fashioned shrugged one-saudi courtier making his country sound quaint rather than archaic

[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.940]
We're opening ourselves up but slowly

[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.680]
There are flashes of modernity a teenager leather fadorah propped on his red and white head scarf

[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.680]
Gumps out to of a car to do a hip-hop dance and traffic as an older man mutters

[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.240]
We never had crazy kids before teenage girls dress like Shakira under their robes

[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.800]
A satellite channel brought by on what do you call it? She said as her companions chimed in Jerry Springer in Montel Williams

[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.740]
What's so great about democracy at least were informed she said

[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.660]
Miss Al-Madi said she'd like to drive some day and see Saudi women get more legal rights

[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.120]
But she thinks the issue of women's rights has become a way for the American media to turn Saudis into the enemy

[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.580]
I feel you are obsessed with the abay and what we were under it. She said the problem lies in you

[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.460]
Osama used to be funded by the CIA

[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:00.860]
Right morning down from me on Saudi Arabia yesterday's New York Times, okay

[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.420]
Five six seven boys sure got a lot of open lines considering tomorrow's election day getting a lot of calls about Moha or David

[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.840]
Spirer-Port's being on the Fox Tony Bruno laughing hyena show

[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:16.200]
Not too many calls about what's going on in the world. There's Jesse Ventura you consider life experiences

[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.700]
Outside of government and politics my appointee may be better qualified than either of those two

[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.420]
Major quote major

[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.040]
He's doing the jab bursting with a quote major party. He's appointing some

[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:35.580]
Shmuck somebody off the street to fill the term which is like for two weeks after the Argentine until 19

[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:39.240]
And the meantime while he's doing that simultaneously the debates going on

[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.980]
So he's up staging Mondale and the Coleman by doing this thing now

[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:48.220]
Has a keen sense of what is in the best interest of ordinary minisotans

[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.980]
And we'll put the people's interest before the party's interest

[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:57.360]
Ladies and gentlemen meet the interim United States Senator from Minnesota

[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:01.260]
Independence party member Dean Barkley. Thank you

[01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.850]
You

[01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:06.370]
See all of this was done in a fit of peak

[01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:11.190]
Because he and his wife walked out of that you know that whole I saw that yeah fit of peak

[01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:13.830]
Very sad, but what do you expect from a guy who's like a

[01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:18.590]
Very disappointing former professional wrestler who can't stop like the grandstanding and being the center of attention

[01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:20.590]
Yeah, real disappointment to us all Jesse

[01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:25.230]
So somebody faxes me the salon dot com thing that just read like 20 minutes ago. Thank you

[01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:29.910]
Got to listen to this station. Okay, listen to the Tony Bruno and call over here with Spirer-Port's

[01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:33.810]
That's all about the good, but if you want to know what tell we're doing on the show the best way to do it is listen to the show

[01:42:35.210 --> 01:42:35.870]
Wtq. I.m

[01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:44.030]

[01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:50.550]
Tell me something I've been listening to you from North Dakota to New Mexico to Germany to Amsterdam to France right all by the internet

[01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:54.490]
Great. I don't know if you remember me. I've been a little listener for about 11 years man

[01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:59.170]
Well, I'm finally back in Miami. I'm sorry about that. I'm the low. I'm still in the Air Force

[01:42:59.170 --> 01:43:04.030]
Now I'm a fine recruiters. I want to find some nice young women and a gentleman

[01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:12.030]
Did join our team is join our fight? What do you think about that, Neil? I think find it some nice young gentleman and women

[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:14.550]
Would be a great idea. Yeah, great. There's some chachkies

[01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:18.770]
I beg your pardon the recruiters always have chachkies like pens and

[01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:21.750]
So what are you getting to give it away as an incentive now? Well, Neil

[01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:27.950]
I'm just like George said. I got pens and pencils and water bottles and all that good stuff and and if you guys like I

[01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:29.950]
Like some sex toys would be good

[01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:37.490]
They don't have logos on them though. Well, you can you can paint them on you can one Neil. I'll drop by the station

[01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:40.650]

Yeah, five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:44:31.050 --> 01:44:36.490]
So the MoMysh there goes on a concert with Tony Bruno the hyena and Fox Sports with their fractional numbers

[01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:40.530]
I was gonna say maybe he's looking for an audience maybe he knows something we don't about his numbers

[01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:43.110]
Maybe he figures like a point nine is better when he's gonna have

[01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:49.910]
But we certainly hope not I won't mention the fact he's costing us all money ten minutes after 11 at five sixty

[01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.750]

Ondales kicking some ass so uh, where's uh, Davey gravy line

Were they made by humans or made by some little man who are cream

It was written by him that shallow. I'm a thing on the guy who did six since

If it does, they'll see lots of dollars

[01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:56.510]
Mill Gibson plays a farmer with martians in his yard

Cuz those circles weren't made by aliens on a wild track direct

[01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:11.410]
They were made by Bruce Willis

[01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:14.090]
Sometimes after a dad

[01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:20.750]
Signs signs that you move these signs could find out more you got to stand in line

[01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:23.810]
Get out your eight books and they are

[01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:32.850]
Signs signs that you move these signs studios hoping it will tingle your spine

[01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:36.550]
If it does, it's 16 to 5 60 WQM. I mean there's the water monday

[01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:41.450]
We've been for civil debate in the senate. I've always been doing a pretty good job for an old concert by the way

[01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:45.670]
But I'm not gonna put that on here because uh, is anybody in this state voting for senator from in the soda? No

[01:47:46.150 --> 01:47:48.570]
All I might as well put it on here. We got one call on the board

[01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:53.510]
You know, I'm not gonna say that this is amazing because it's not amazing here is it nothing is amazing in this place

[01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:56.830]
Other than ethnic hate and what he gave it away free. That's it

[01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:00.550]
That's why I stopped taking calls on the show for almost eight months

[01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:03.770]
What's the point baby for election day

[01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:08.390]
Uh more howards on with uh Tony Bruno. Oh, uh, yeah great

[01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:13.970]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:16.370]
To get it off. How do I mow you're right

[01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:20.910]
Man talk about a hopeless case WQIM

[01:48:22.210 --> 01:48:25.950]
Hey, now yes sir. I had talking about spy reports uh

[01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:31.290]
Yeah, George Beasley was on the Bloomberg gambling network a couple of weeks ago. Yeah

[01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:33.650]
touting how good his uh

[01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:38.070]
Company is doing. Well, how come nobody gets their bonus on time except for me. Yeah, I don't know

[01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:41.610]
He's talking about how good Philadelphia station was for admirers

[01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:46.510]
And then he said something very interesting about his old sports station WQAM

[01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:50.810]
He said had been an albatross around the company's neck for quite a while

[01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:55.250]
Did he really say that that's what he said he says because of their

[01:48:56.610 --> 01:49:03.330]
Unfavorable sports contracts. That's right and he says since they've renegotiated it looks like they're gonna see the light at the end of the

[01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:07.770]
That's right because Greg read went outside his ridiculous contracts with the marlins and the dolphins and paying an armor

[01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:13.910]
Like for all these sports in a month of being losing propositions and uh, how many times have I said that that I had to be here to help pay for the marlin loss

[01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:16.930]
That's it. Yeah, and he and he was saying he says now we're gonna

[01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:17.570]
You know

[01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:22.530]
But he actually said albatross around his neck very well said

[01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:27.730]
Okay, Nielsen, thanks for the spy report. Thank you sir. There you go. George Beasley said at this station was an albatross

[01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:31.910]
Remember albatross with Stanley dancer. No and her hairy Harvey before that

[01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:36.290]
That's for my good buddies Dick Feinberg and the Steve Wolf over Pumpkin apart

[01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:40.110]
They'll know they'll know what I'm talking about albatross on the outside here he comes

[01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:44.270]
There's kind of a funny-looking horse, you know great horse, but he was funny looking

[01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:51.870]
Kind of like stick Feinberg kind of funny looking five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the here's a fact that says

[01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:57.710]
How do you like that so the Beasley said then I like that George Beasley always liked him didn't I no that's what I told Bob

[01:49:57.710 --> 01:49:59.370]
Remove and he said ah, but you don't know

[01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:04.990]
The fact says hello, Nielsen, since the alien days when all of South Florida was whipped into a frenzy

[01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:08.570]
That's what they get excited about I don't have back during those days. We didn't have to give the numbers out

[01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:12.950]
Just sit down and but I'm being there go the phones for four hours every day

[01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:18.890]
It says I constantly consistent listen to your shows. I'd grab around lovely South Florida lovely and quotes

[01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:22.850]
Everybody's doing that now with the fingers, you know, I'd like to give him this finger

[01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:27.410]
You make people think even if they don't agree with you make people think about what they believe and I have to agree

[01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:29.350]
A hundred percent with you because you were absolutely

[01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:34.870]
You're absolutely correct about everything it says here. Yes, I am keep up the great work

[01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:39.490]
I entertain you inform you make us think have a great weekend sincerely Janet and Hollywood. Thank you Janet

[01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:43.490]
I'm exhausted now. Man. I'm drained from that

[01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:45.210]
That was sensational

[01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:49.890]
I mean we don't like too much of that crap, but a little bit of sucking isn't all that bad

[01:50:49.890 --> 01:50:54.210]
You know, I'm saying too much sucking not good, but a little bit of sucking can't be all that bad

[01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:59.350]
X-Price jailed in Detroit sex case. I guess he felt the same way, you know it

[01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:02.510]
Oldie problem was a 13-year-old boy. Well, we'll get to that in a minute

[01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:08.450]
W-D-Q-A-N Q-A-N, yes sir. How are you doing today great?

[01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:12.110]
You heard it listen. I hate to break your bubble and burst your bowl

[01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:16.470]
But I've been giving a lot of thought about the lady of Column from the Fox Network regarding

[01:51:17.490 --> 01:51:20.070]
To you by the show. Yeah, I

[01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:25.350]
Think what the problem behind is the whole big picture is that Greg Reed has indicated your show and you just don't know about it

[01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.750]
Yeah

[01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:32.070]
All right, that's it. I'm out. Okay, well, we got a beastly before in the Greg Reed program some inside stuff there

[01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:36.290]
I'm one out of two in bed and how are David report and how are David reports nothing about the election tomorrow

[01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:40.510]
All this other stuff. Have you noticed that? Yeah, now that you mentioned it. What's Hank doing today?

[01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:44.650]
Let's see what is Hank doing today is that Chula's he's gotten that more between four or five

[01:51:44.650 --> 01:51:46.490]
Well, I just do in part of the dolphin pregame

[01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:53.610]
In fact, Joseph Gackie starts the dolphin pregame officially at one o'clock because he's feeling for the mad dog who's up there in green Bay

[01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:55.770]
Reason is a nuts off with the mole

[01:51:57.150 --> 01:52:02.470]
After in green Bay, Wisconsin on the frozen tonnega baby as Bart star gets ready to dissect it off

[01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:07.570]
And then just pick them apart just like Tom Brady did against Buffalo yesterday and they highly overrated valleyhood

[01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:10.610]
Drew Blitzer gets a lot of yards down there on a goddamn score sheet

[01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:15.570]
But in between the like five and ten yard lines. Okay, can't stick it in there one time. He's stuck it in there

[01:52:15.570 --> 01:52:17.630]
Other than that, he can't stick it in there

[01:52:18.170 --> 01:52:23.450]
As opposed to Tom Brady who showed yesterday that when push comes to show he can stick it in there

[01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:33.090]
Let's get this crowd whipped up into a frenzy. Okay, let's get every dark person to go out there and vote nine ten fifteen twenty times tomorrow to make up for lost time

[01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:38.370]
Before they get all these right wingers in there and they bring back the old pool packs

[01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:42.410]
Then we'll have to have like instead of the eruditor, but we'll have the uncle remiss show

[01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:44.890]
Wtq am

[01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.990]
What's going on? Are you doing sir? Good very good

[01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:53.410]
I we could talk about the election since no one else as it seems like

[01:52:53.410 --> 01:52:58.450]
Isn't that incredible? I've been on for two and a half hours and nobody's got anything to say about this direction of our separate

[01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:01.030]
Richard Friedman was very boring, but who had good intentions

[01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:04.710]
Well, you know the dolphins are on the night and I guess I've got everyone there

[01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:10.970]
That's right. Why should we be worried about the future freedoms of this democracy when we got a guy damn full ball game on the night right good point

[01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:12.670]
Exactly, I mean

[01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:18.550]
Reality with the selection. Do you think there's any chance that rationality and sanity will prevail anyway? No

[01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:19.430]
No

[01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:20.770]
In that case

[01:53:20.770 --> 01:53:24.990]
The American people of any of any supposedly freak country of any

[01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:30.150]
Westernized country in the world the American people collectively are the dumbest people on the face of their side even a contest

[01:53:30.150 --> 01:53:35.950]
Yeah, I would agree with that dumb like Frado not smart like me, but dumb like Frado

[01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:42.730]
Yeah, well if that's the case, you know any places up in Canada that's nice to live in or what any place any place across the border

[01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:47.550]
Moose Jaw is good even that's something not this time of the year. Oh, okay hang in there pal

[01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:49.270]
I'll see at the border patrol

[01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:54.250]
How about a Calo it might be nice all them engines up there

[01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:58.110]
Don't be starting to pick on engines again now

[01:53:58.970 --> 01:54:04.010]
And you get the Fox news again all whipped up to a friends again. I guess they're he held there. They don't have any right wing Indians

[01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.630]
I guess

[01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:06.690]
Maybe Chuck has to know is a few

[01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:12.170]
X-Price jailed in Detroit sex case. Oh, oh a retired either patrol

[01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:17.070]
How about a Calo it might be nice all them engines up there

[01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:20.910]
Don't be starting to pick on engines again now

[01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:24.670]
And you get the Fox news again all whipped up to a friends again

[01:54:24.670 --> 01:54:28.750]
I guess at least 30 Catholic priests in Michigan have left them in remove versus spread it from duty since

[01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:31.110]
January 1st amid sexual abuse misconduct allegations

[01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:34.870]
Three other men who once served this priest in the Detroit area also would charge in August

[01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:39.150]
How do you like that huh? He was just looking for a little company a little companionship they get lonely

[01:54:39.150 --> 01:54:45.230]
Yeah, they get lonely the company of God isn't enough ain't good enough although we did say oh God that was good

[01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:50.570]
335 votes on a pool. How do you feel about tomorrow's election? Does anybody feel anything in this place?

[01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:53.650]
There's none there's water on our future. Yeah

[01:54:54.610 --> 01:55:00.030]
335 votes election hour is very important. I'm telling you I listen for Walnut. He's been pretty good for 90-year-old man

[01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:06.090]
He's making all the sense in the world a cool man. See he sits there and looks ancient and cool man sits there

[01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:08.050]
Looks like a guy that's still alive. That's the problem

[01:55:08.630 --> 01:55:11.630]
So even don't confuse people with diverbiage with what's being said

[01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:16.090]
They just look at a screen. They see the one guy over there who's a good never-stolen freight train guy who one week

[01:55:16.090 --> 01:55:19.150]
He's a Republican. He's a Democrat. He's been all over the place this Coleman guy

[01:55:19.150 --> 01:55:22.890]
And then they see Walter Mondale who we used to like a lot when he was under the age of 100

[01:55:22.890 --> 01:55:26.130]
But now he's like you know a step away from the box

[01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:29.750]
But that's Minnesota's problem and the meantime Jesse Ventura

[01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:33.510]
Appointed some independent schmuck to fill in just out of a spite out of peak

[01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:36.410]
I'm surprised didn't put the rock in there

[01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:41.610]
Aren't you over Ross Perot? No the rock some professional wrestling clown

[01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:44.450]
That's right up his alley. That's uh, he wants something he knows

[01:55:44.890 --> 01:55:50.270]
118 said to Mars. Life's very important. Uh, I'm voting but not excited 94 and of course who could be excited with a candidate

[01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:53.750]
We got in this state. It's life and death 59 life and death

[01:55:55.410 --> 01:55:58.610]
I'm not voting why bother 43 and what me worry 21

[01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:02.230]
I mean, why the hell should we be worried about these things huh

[01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:09.850]
26 past 11 at 5 60 WQAM. Hey, I'll tell you a place you go and get away from all these problems

No, a great way to forget about all your problems is to eat oh eat mind your mind and we never got any food coming in here too late now

[01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:25.550]
Much too late now

[01:56:26.250 --> 01:56:30.610]
But anyway emerald coast with three locations for it is a feast that we remember for a long time

[01:56:30.610 --> 01:56:32.730]
At least you remember until you go back into it again, which will be soon

UAM

[01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:02.490]

[01:58:08.170 --> 01:58:10.170]
Oh

[01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.670]
Kama

[01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:27.930]

[01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:28.970]
is Tush.

[01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:32.530]
Falling, howling the masses need grow.

[01:58:33.370 --> 01:58:37.050]
Stepping in bed, she'd had the whim of his white mazer.

[01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:40.650]
Howling the masses need grow.

[01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:45.250]
Kicked us to the knees of the globalist cracker.

[01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:48.530]
Howling the masses need grow.

[01:58:49.170 --> 01:58:52.570]
And of growth, all sun, survey and growth.

[01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:56.490]
Falling, howling the masses need grow.

[01:58:57.050 --> 01:59:00.490]
A twisted, flag-safe, movement spoke.

[01:59:01.710 --> 01:59:04.470]
Falling, howling the masses need grow.

[01:59:05.090 --> 01:59:11.170]
Yo, go limp, go limp, go limp, go limp, go limp, go limp, be a slave, need he grow.

[01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:15.950]
Falling, howling, oh, that what do we do?

[01:59:16.130 --> 01:59:19.250]
Number 31 and 560, don't be too cute, I am happy the Monday to you.

[01:59:19.670 --> 01:59:20.790]
Haven't you heard that one before?

[01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:22.930]
Of course, well, still a long time.

[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:24.570]
Look at a little chocolate, what are you eating now?

[01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:25.170]
My wrap.

[01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:28.430]
Oh my god, he's doing the old colon wrap in there.

[01:59:31.530 --> 01:59:32.670]
You ever have a colon wrap?

[01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:33.670]
Most of you enjoy them.

[01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:37.930]
350 votes on the pool, how do you feel about tomorrow's election?

[01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:41.350]
Evidently not too strongly because we're not getting squat about the election.

[01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:44.070]
Also, I had a slip at the tongue, but you know something I think it might have been

[01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:46.090]
a Freudian slip.

[01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:47.350]
It was pink.

[01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:50.710]
Faxor says you said Bart Starr, you meant Brett Farmer.

[01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:51.370]
What's the difference?

[01:59:51.670 --> 01:59:53.370]
In fact, they can probably start Bart Starr tonight.

[01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:57.750]
It says Go Brett Star Farf, kick those dolphins ass, whatever your name is,

[01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:58.810]
check the tape you said Bart Starr.

[01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:00.090]
I believe you, I'm sure I may have.

[02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:03.490]
You know, when you get to be old in Fibral, like me, when tomorrow you're going to be 60 years old.

[02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:06.550]
Oh, it doesn't matter.

[02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:08.870]
In fact, the maple leaves are bringing back Johnny, Bauer and Gull.

[02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:11.770]
We got two guys that couldn't stop a watermelon from 100 yards away.

[02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:12.790]
Trevor, you've got to be kidding.

[02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:15.310]
And any the beagle bell for.

[02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:18.590]
Man, do they stink or what?

[02:00:19.290 --> 02:00:22.070]
And then of course the Panthers lose to Atlanta, girls team.

[02:00:22.610 --> 02:00:23.910]
Atlanta's first one of the season.

[02:00:24.110 --> 02:00:27.310]
First they tied the leaf on Wednesday or through whatever night it was.

[02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:30.550]
And then they come in here and beat the Panthers three to one on Saturday.

[02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:32.030]
It seemed they couldn't score an empty net.

[02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:34.290]
With nobody else on the ice.

[02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:37.550]
That's not start that hockey talk on the day before the election.

[02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:38.410]
Okay, that's a bad idea.

[02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:39.810]
Let's get Rimmer on the phone.

[02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.710]
Hockey show.

[02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.530]
I got his number.

[02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:45.430]
No, I got his number two right next to Mitch Hershens.

[02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:50.310]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.670]
Don't forget.

[02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:52.930]
Join the overnight guys doing Mark 9 to 11 night.

[02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.990]
Gatsby's and Kendall stuff.

[02:00:54.090 --> 02:00:56.390]
I'd win prizes and joy specials on Crown Royal.

[02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:59.850]
It's Monday night football as that often visit the Packers at Gatsby's and Kendall.

[02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:02.450]
How many Q a M?

[02:01:03.110 --> 02:01:03.750]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.310]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:08.570]
We keep the pose over for a whole month and we can vote in the jails and everything.

[02:01:09.110 --> 02:01:09.570]
That what you want.

[02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:11.650]
Yeah, yeah, especially your vote.

[02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.310]
That's exactly what I want.

[02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:14.410]
I want you to vote from in there.

[02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:16.170]
Is that what I want?

[02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:20.150]
Know what I want is that everybody who's a registered voter gets a fair and decent chance of a very simple.

[02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:21.510]
Nothing confusing about that.

[02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:22.110]
Very simple.

[02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:24.550]
Of course, probably too complex for your nimble mind, but nevertheless.

[02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:26.410]
My little spick friend.

[02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.470]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:01:28.630 --> 02:01:29.830]
We got a lot of open lines here.

[02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:33.650]
Only an hour 26 minutes to go to solve the problems in the world before the election tomorrow.

[02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:37.730]
Correctly saying negotiating from weakness in these issues.

[02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.150]
Yeah, but a bit but about.

[02:01:39.450 --> 02:01:40.910]
Yeah, we got to change the tone.

[02:01:41.050 --> 02:01:44.090]
This norm Coleman Republican Minnesota is up there debating Mondale.

[02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:45.870]
We got to change the tone.

[02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.970]
Didn't we hear that before?

[02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:48.710]
Change the tone and Washington.

[02:01:48.730 --> 02:01:51.950]
We heard that from George W who then told us either you're with us or against us.

[02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:52.710]
Simple as that.

[02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:54.390]
You're the with us or you're good guys.

[02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:55.150]
You're the bad guys.

[02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:56.610]
You're on our side here at Evil Door.

[02:01:58.330 --> 02:01:58.990]
W Q I M.

[02:02:01.210 --> 02:02:01.990]
Q I M.

[02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:03.170]
Neil.

[02:02:03.390 --> 02:02:03.770]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:04.870]
Hey, hold on.

[02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:06.050]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:06.470]
Okay.

[02:02:07.170 --> 02:02:08.010]
Listen, my friend.

[02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:12.310]
I have to call you because I know the calls are painful, but believe me, the bedtime story.

[02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:13.730]
Sometimes they make me a little tired.

[02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:14.090]
Yeah.

[02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:15.190]
It's good to have the call.

[02:02:15.490 --> 02:02:19.350]
But listen, about Friday, the woman who call you from Fox News channel.

[02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:19.650]
Heather.

[02:02:20.190 --> 02:02:21.350]
Yes, let me tell you man.

[02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:22.730]
You were smoking that day.

[02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:25.090]
I believe I was hoping you ought to see when I was smoking.

[02:02:25.530 --> 02:02:26.790]
I tell you I couldn't even move.

[02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:29.290]
I'm listening to you and I hear it and it's just incredible.

[02:02:29.290 --> 02:02:30.410]
You really rip there a new one.

[02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:32.430]
So listen, do me one favor.

[02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:35.110]
If you would like to, I don't like to ask too much of you because you give enough.

[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:36.490]
But I do give enough.

[02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:37.450]
Yes, you do.

[02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:38.230]
I gave it the orifice.

[02:02:39.330 --> 02:02:43.830]
If you can play the one bit about nobody rips you better.

[02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:45.230]
Okay, I haven't heard that one in so long.

[02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:45.670]
No problem.

[02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:47.110]
How you got anything you want?

[02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:48.070]
Okay, puppy.

[02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:48.570]
I love you.

[02:02:48.650 --> 02:02:48.710]
Bye.

[02:02:48.850 --> 02:02:49.030]
Yeah.

[02:02:50.230 --> 02:02:52.710]
Now this big 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:56.170]
It says I just want to remind you that if the Republicans win Congress, there will be nothing to stop.

[02:02:56.170 --> 02:02:59.670]
The right one is to create constitutional amendments like permanent tax cuts for the rich.

[02:02:59.710 --> 02:03:01.150]
Yada Yada woman's choice.

[02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:05.650]
If so, it'll take a super maturity of the House and Senate to overturn the law created by the far right.

[02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:10.210]
If the Republicans win, it'll be almost impossible reverse the freight train of economic rule nation by the other right.

[02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:11.150]
Happy birthday tomorrow.

[02:03:15.090 --> 02:03:17.030]
Yeah, like I'm going to change something here.

[02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.270]
Right.

[02:03:17.330 --> 02:03:18.190]
Am I going to change anything?

[02:03:18.330 --> 02:03:20.630]
No, I can't even give people the express an opinion on.

[02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:22.510]
I'm much less than do anything about it tomorrow.

[02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:24.070]
They got no opinion.

[02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:26.410]
It's by the way ballgame.

[02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.870]
Give me the ball.

[02:03:27.010 --> 02:03:27.330]
Give me the ball.

[02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.810]
Give me the ball.

[02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:30.450]
I mean ball games are a nice diversion.

[02:03:30.810 --> 02:03:31.190]
It's fun.

[02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.190]
It's said are in so on.

[02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:34.650]
But on this station, we get like 20 hours of.

[02:03:34.770 --> 02:03:37.390]
Oh, gee, we're getting screwed by the BCS poor.

[02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:38.870]
What are we going to do about the hercule?

[02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.650]
Yeah.

[02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:42.390]
Do you know anybody?

[02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:46.550]
Other than I don't know anybody other than the beast.

[02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:50.490]
Who went to the university Miami that's got an IQ larger than their thumbnail?

[02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.410]
One.

[02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:52.050]
Okay.

[02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.730]
Yes.

[02:03:53.190 --> 02:03:53.830]
Tony cigarette.

[02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.930]
Oh, no, you don't know.

[02:03:55.170 --> 02:03:56.930]
I said, I can't larger than their thumbnail.

[02:03:57.490 --> 02:03:59.110]
So at least Tony out Tony's okay.

[02:03:59.230 --> 02:03:59.550]
Just silly.

[02:04:00.190 --> 02:04:01.730]
That's why I could never watch channel six news.

[02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:02.570]
He's a silly person.

[02:04:03.550 --> 02:04:05.070]
Whatever happened to Camberl Martian, by the way,

[02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:06.250]
speaking about people with bad lips.

[02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:10.390]
And you know who I saw this morning for the first time in a long time.

[02:04:10.710 --> 02:04:11.050]
Bob Mayor.

[02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:13.750]
I saw my friend Bob weaver the other day.

[02:04:14.230 --> 02:04:15.870]
And all you know what I'm saying?

[02:04:16.210 --> 02:04:17.570]
Hey, Bob, we're not getting any younger, baby.

[02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:19.390]
But they screwed him over so bad at channel four.

[02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:20.070]
Such a good guy.

[02:04:20.250 --> 02:04:20.890]
And he's got to work.

[02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:22.070]
Actually, he's a hundred now poor Bob.

[02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:23.130]
That's the next week I think.

[02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:26.550]
And Bob mayor who we like was sitting on four phone books this morning,

[02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:29.350]
getting old and gay, a gray and you know, we're getting older guys.

[02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:31.270]
Those are good guys to channel six.

[02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:34.310]
And of course our good buddy Joe Rose, you know, yeah.

[02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:36.630]
Did you over the weekend?

[02:04:36.690 --> 02:04:39.850]
I heard about you and him rip and mow and ask behind mows back.

[02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:41.010]
That's that's not very nice.

[02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:43.330]
Yeah, you heard about it from me.

[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:43.730]
Yeah.

[02:04:44.650 --> 02:04:46.530]
And from Joe not not from Joe directly.

[02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:47.010]
Just in direct.

[02:04:47.110 --> 02:04:47.850]
He comes in and buddy.

[02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.930]
But he's got a big mouth.

[02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:51.150]
Now I liked you.

[02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:51.750]
I loved Joe Rose.

[02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:53.650]
In fact, remember the fun times he used to have when it was

[02:04:53.650 --> 02:04:54.250]
fun and D.

[02:04:54.330 --> 02:04:56.690]
Fow and even little little little twirpy ass hanging out here in the hallway.

[02:04:57.010 --> 02:04:58.850]
Right now and all man.

[02:04:59.230 --> 02:05:02.910]
Since you were on vacation all last week, the new deal is he will not.

[02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:04.270]
This is not making a stuff.

[02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:05.230]
You could ask Robert.

[02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:09.910]
He will not leave that studio between a quarter to seven and nine o'clock.

[02:05:10.330 --> 02:05:11.330]
Yeah, what if nature calls?

[02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:12.830]
Well, he's got the bag in there.

[02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:13.230]
You're forgetting.

[02:05:14.210 --> 02:05:15.990]
Oh, it's still over one day last week.

[02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:16.650]
Right on the floor.

[02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:17.130]
Geldie was.

[02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.890]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:05:17.890 --> 02:05:20.270]
He was making all kinds of guttable sounds screaming and yelling.

[02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:22.950]
He had to call what the janitor getting back in here.

[02:05:23.110 --> 02:05:23.330]
Rick.

[02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:24.970]
What?

[02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:26.570]
I I got an idea for some.

[02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:27.050]
Okay.

[02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:29.970]
That's the new motto on the Mohawar church.

[02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:30.890]
It's in the bag released.

[02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:31.850]
It used to be.

[02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:33.570]
No, seriously, if you ever.

[02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:34.530]
And you probably never noticed.

[02:05:35.170 --> 02:05:36.610]
But maybe he doesn't do it all morning.

[02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:38.090]
But when there's a chance that I'm in a building.

[02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:40.290]
You know how that it's set up in there that studio.

[02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:42.770]
Geldie is sitting off to his right.

[02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.810]
Okay.

[02:05:44.450 --> 02:05:45.630]
And he sits in the chair.

[02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:47.810]
Like oh yeah, I noticed.

[02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:48.450]
Have you noticed that?

[02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:53.070]
Like Lini or so I think that it was either it was either so that.

[02:05:53.590 --> 02:05:57.850]
He didn't have to see the big window behind him from the bullpen where either you are could be lurking or.

[02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:00.430]
It's to make room for the bag on the end of the chair.

[02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:03.870]
There are microphones all around that table as you know.

[02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.150]
Right.

[02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:08.030]
So he could sit with his back to the any window he wanted to know.

[02:06:09.010 --> 02:06:09.370]
Now.

[02:06:10.050 --> 02:06:11.150]
Not going to risk that chance.

[02:06:11.290 --> 02:06:15.130]
So if you won't even take a chance in turning around and seeing one of us out of the corner of his eye.

[02:06:15.130 --> 02:06:16.810]
He sure ain't going to be like you know,

[02:06:17.050 --> 02:06:18.150]
frolicing around in the hallways.

[02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:20.310]
Lest he run into one of us and especially me.

[02:06:20.530 --> 02:06:21.290]
WDQ I am.

[02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.630]
Hey, Neil.

[02:06:22.810 --> 02:06:23.150]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:23.890 --> 02:06:25.690]
Listen, I voted on Saturday.

[02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:27.170]
You can go to the library.

[02:06:27.170 --> 02:06:28.110]
I'm both right.

[02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:35.470]
It was a two hour wait, but I got to why was it to our weight because they had three machines per precinct.

[02:06:36.190 --> 02:06:40.950]
And the precinct that I'm supposed to vote in the only had everybody was there.

[02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:43.810]
So was it to our way?

[02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.290]
Okay.

[02:06:44.290 --> 02:06:44.910]
I'm going to vote it.

[02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:48.270]
Yeah.

[02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:50.890]
So you know, they can go.

[02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:54.390]
Avoid lines that can vote today.

[02:06:54.590 --> 02:06:56.510]
If they want to get away, you're absolutely right.

[02:06:56.590 --> 02:06:57.650]
They can do it right to the library.

[02:06:58.150 --> 02:07:01.610]
Chris, most of the people down here, they don't have been in the library in 20 years.

[02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:03.730]
So thanks a lot, pal.

[02:07:03.730 --> 02:07:05.150]
Vote again tomorrow already.

[02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:05.570]
Okay.

[02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:06.290]
Chris, I didn't ask him.

[02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:08.990]
We voted for vote again anyway, just for the halibut.

[02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:11.330]
369 votes on there.

[02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:13.790]
I didn't make that number up about tomorrow's election.

[02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:18.390]
And a lot of people said, you know, like that can't get too excited because they write.

[02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:22.270]
I know when you voted last time, and I'm not even sure if the vote counted back then,

[02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:23.730]
how can you expect people to get excited again?

[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:26.670]
I got some article here.

[02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:28.930]
Somebody faxed me when I was at oh, yeah, let's list.

[02:07:29.170 --> 02:07:30.830]
Dobscon number list off at the Sun Central.

[02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:32.770]
He's the ideal list down.

[02:07:32.970 --> 02:07:33.890]
What do we remember her from?

[02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.690]
What did she write about?

[02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:36.990]
Wasn't it during the whole election thing or something?

[02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.710]
No.

[02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:39.790]
Anyway, she says, landed the losers.

[02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:41.510]
Why can't we get anything right and South Florida?

[02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:43.570]
I might just read that as a bedtime story here today.

[02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:45.850]
Although we want to take a lot of calls between now and one.

[02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:46.130]
No.

[02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:47.510]
We want to take millions of calls.

[02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:52.310]
We want to get to audience fired up into a frenzy to show that Florida is not the piece of turn that most people think it is.

[02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:54.010]
Even though we know it is, but we don't want to admit that.

[02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:59.410]
We want to pretend this is like civilization, like a real place with living and breathing people who care about education,

[02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:05.030]
who care about the important things as in, and not just a bunch of stupid ball games and house parts that are doing by.

[02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:17.810]
Teenagers today need choices that reflect the reality of their complex lives.

[02:08:18.670 --> 02:08:22.690]
Abstinence is often preached, but is really not realistic in today's society.

[02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:26.170]
And same-sex encounters are uncomfortable for most boys and girls.

[02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:27.470]
What's a team to do?

[02:08:27.810 --> 02:08:30.830]
Technical virgins of America has the answer in the butt.

[02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:36.090]
A way you can technically still be a virgin and enjoy a rich and satisfying intimate relationship.

[02:08:36.330 --> 02:08:40.710]
In the butt avoids unwanted pregnancies, but still affords fun for both parties.

[02:08:40.710 --> 02:08:50.670]
So the next time you're ready to strip down for action, remember the motto of the technical virgins, everything but technical virgins of America, offering alternatives for today's team.

[02:08:51.330 --> 02:08:56.470]
I'm 45 and 560 W. Cremacogov, Joseph Gackie for a Germanist because there's nobody else available today.

[02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:59.950]
Cos Mad Dog's up there in Green Bay where a barred star is getting ready to fill in.

[02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:01.230]
Case breath barb can't go tonight.

[02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:04.790]
And this debate, you know, this is a pretty interesting format.

[02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:06.470]
This Coleman Mondale debate you want to know why?

[02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:09.790]
Because they have a two moderator sitting there and they like started off with different questions.

[02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:13.990]
And then the two candidates debating, they like go back and forth.

[02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:17.530]
They're sitting around the table, very comfortable, very conversational, back and forth.

[02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:18.450]
And it's great.

[02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:21.810]
And they're making the audience withhold their applause until the very end at the settlement.

[02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.270]
So why not?

[02:09:22.410 --> 02:09:23.290]
The mental differences.

[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:24.150]
Being done well.

[02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:28.830]
So anyway, speak of Tony Bruno and at Fox, I'm telling you, they're right on our heels, not.

[02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:35.350]
During the summertime, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. during this highly rated show, George, keep in mind that George was on most of the time.

[02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:39.270]
So, but anyway, men 25 54 or 5.9 share.

[02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:43.330]
Guess what Tony Bruno at Fox had WRFX a 1.7.

[02:09:44.210 --> 02:09:49.590]
So that means that even little George had four times, almost four times the audience that they had.

[02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:51.810]
They got average quarter hours of, what is it?

[02:09:52.730 --> 02:09:55.150]
Every quarter hour, I can't find it on there.

[02:09:56.190 --> 02:09:56.610]
Pretty weak.

[02:09:57.110 --> 02:09:58.590]
Pretty freaking weak, okay?

[02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:02.770]
Tony Bruno said this and Tony Bruno laughed at that.

[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:06.710]
And that's on a sports station.

[02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:11.990]
And 9 to 1 also includes Romeo, I forgot for moon to 1 who's probably got the biggest hour of the 4.

[02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:16.930]
I'll do that thing where we get the big national, because I don't know from them sports.

[02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.930]
Well, why not?

[02:10:18.150 --> 02:10:18.990]
You better get with it, mister.

[02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:24.610]
If you're going to work on WQA and get that new contract, that new deal done today, by the way, today's the big meeting about George's deal.

[02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:25.650]
Oh, look at it.

[02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:27.710]
Just as I said that, what happened to my thing here?

[02:10:27.710 --> 02:10:31.330]
My whole page disappeared and there's my wallpaper and there's Tom Brady naked.

[02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:32.450]
Look at that.

[02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:35.290]
Man, he is, oh, it just came back.

[02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:36.470]
That was good.

[02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:37.970]
It kept me going another hour and 10 minutes.

[02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:39.510]
Man, he is something.

[02:10:40.650 --> 02:10:46.790]
Here's the fact that this is, have a happy birthday and you'll have entertained me daily since my arrival on Marco on January 1999.

[02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:48.510]
As far as I'm concerned, you are the best.

[02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:50.830]
Of course, you're a public in front of Marco Island Yale.

[02:10:51.690 --> 02:10:53.050]
Well, have a great day, Yale.

[02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:55.050]
And just don't vote this time.

[02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.910]
Okay, give us a chance.

[02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:57.390]
Give us a fighting chance.

[02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:01.110]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:11:01.190 --> 02:11:01.270]
Good.

[02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:04.110]
In a solid, courageous way.

[02:11:04.450 --> 02:11:06.110]
From the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:07.670]
That'd be a QAM.

[02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:10.350]
QAM.

[02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:11.150]
Hello.

[02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.730]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:12.250 --> 02:11:13.170]
Hey, how you doing, Daniel?

[02:11:13.730 --> 02:11:14.090]
Thank you.

[02:11:14.490 --> 02:11:16.330]
Hey, listen, I just wanted to get you to take.

[02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:22.430]
I love it if you or George had played that new Grand Theft Auto in Miami for a PlayStation.

[02:11:23.610 --> 02:11:24.210]
It's incredible.

[02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:28.030]
It's nothing but speaks and corrupt politicians and drug dealers.

[02:11:28.410 --> 02:11:29.310]
They got it right on.

[02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:30.550]
Sounds like Miami to me.

[02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:31.710]
Yeah, it's incredible.

[02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:32.130]
It's amazing.

[02:11:32.250 --> 02:11:32.910]
No, I haven't played it yet.

[02:11:33.150 --> 02:11:35.430]
George said he's going to play with it right after the show.

[02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:36.410]
When I find it for free, I will.

[02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:40.610]
Well, is it always the odds that you get to take the back of the cover of the spread today?

[02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:45.090]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:11:45.550 --> 02:11:48.210]
Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:49.530]
That's what they're upset about.

[02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:51.450]
The Heracun's didn't cover the spread against Rutgers.

[02:11:51.810 --> 02:11:52.710]
Six touchdown favorites.

[02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:55.370]
They're trailing going to the fourth quarter against the little girl school.

[02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:57.570]
What they don't realize is they're just, they are kind of laying back.

[02:11:58.090 --> 02:11:58.830]
They just lay it back.

[02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:03.110]
To make it look like there's some real competition there so they can continue with this big east forest

[02:12:03.110 --> 02:12:05.930]
and continue playing mostly little girl schools on their schedule every week.

[02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:07.570]
And say, we want 30 in a row.

[02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:08.450]
We want 30 row.

[02:12:08.530 --> 02:12:10.830]
Yeah, but how about maybe 5 and 0 is 30 where against real teams?

[02:12:11.070 --> 02:12:12.270]
And not little girl's teams, huh?

[02:12:13.450 --> 02:12:16.210]
All these silly-ass people with no life who are trying to be these klingons.

[02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:20.470]
Looking for something to cling on here at South Florida to pretend they have a real life.

[02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:21.910]
Oh, where are heracunes?

[02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:22.890]
Heracunes, hurry, low 30 in a row.

[02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:25.570]
And you know something, George?

[02:12:26.250 --> 02:12:27.010]
We are blessed.

[02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:28.470]
Aren't we though?

[02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:31.370]
Well, we used to be until it often lost the Buffalo last week.

[02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:35.850]
And until the embarrassing game against Rutgers, we used to be blessed in this town.

[02:12:35.850 --> 02:12:36.730]
I think we're cursed.

[02:12:37.210 --> 02:12:40.330]
And I think tomorrow you're going to find out with the election disaster you're going to have again.

[02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:41.350]
And believe me, you will.

[02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:43.110]
We are cursed.

[02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:45.530]
WQAM.

[02:12:45.970 --> 02:12:46.970]
A&M IA doing great.

[02:12:47.610 --> 02:12:53.890]
Most important number on the Goldstein list is number 17 where they want to write wing eyes, all the judges.

[02:12:55.850 --> 02:13:01.710]
Naturally, most black or Hispanic or whatever people just don't understand.

[02:13:02.410 --> 02:13:07.750]
And if that actually comes to bear, it's just a white man rules type of thing.

[02:13:07.810 --> 02:13:10.190]
Well, you're saying black and Hispanic don't understand you.

[02:13:10.190 --> 02:13:15.910]
If you checked out the makeup of the white voter in the state of Florida, keep in mind it's not just date and brown.

[02:13:16.050 --> 02:13:16.530]
It's you understand?

[02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:17.490]
And Palm Beach.

[02:13:17.770 --> 02:13:21.410]
Yeah, but if that's not the thing about how many trailer parks there are around the rest of Florida.

[02:13:21.650 --> 02:13:30.130]
So, I mean, they, they're not those two guys out or one guy, one woman in the, the Senate did, you know, when Bush put them on.

[02:13:30.370 --> 02:13:35.190]
And that's all they can talk about is how we have a not doubt these two right wing ideologues.

[02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:41.650]
And yeah, it's just, it's just another way of white man government and it's just the people just don't understand that.

[02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:46.310]
Well, when I see this business about blacks for Bush and Haitians for Bush, it makes me want to gag.

[02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:48.190]
What are these people thinking about? Maybe they're massacres.

[02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:53.570]
Maybe they've lived here in this town for so long that they developed a perpetual massacristic streak.

[02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:55.930]
Yeah, they're not for fairness, that's for sure.

[02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:57.510]
Yeah, okay. Thanks a lot.

[02:13:57.810 --> 02:13:59.990]
Well, that's just a question of fairness. They look like a death wish.

[02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:07.090]
Oh, he's not going to let the polls fail for longer because he doesn't want, he wants to take away just like his brother did,

[02:14:07.190 --> 02:14:09.010]
just like they conspired back two years ago.

[02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:11.510]
They want to take away your right to vote.

[02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:16.410]
And the darker your completion, the less they want you to vote. It's as simple as that.

[02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:21.010]
See, if you happen to be like maybe Condoleezer, Colin Powell, like those two bits we play.

[02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:26.030]
And the more I think about that Fox crap, just stop and think about that.

[02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:29.030]
Think about all the parodies that we play.

[02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:32.790]
All the goddamn sat there that we play on this show and have for the last 400 years.

[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:34.830]
How come they didn't call during Ellie on?

[02:14:35.090 --> 02:14:36.390]
Yeah, how come they didn't call about that?

[02:14:36.590 --> 02:14:40.570]
Oh, your plan, I want you must be an anti-speak. You must be this. You must be a, yeah, right.

[02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:43.050]
I'm surrounded by a CSPX here, okay? See?

[02:14:43.450 --> 02:14:44.290]
Yeah, no.

[02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:49.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:50.210]
What the heck I want to hear before?

[02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:53.210]
I want to call a little while ago. I said I was going to play it.

[02:14:53.290 --> 02:14:53.810]
What do you want to hear?

[02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:54.810]
Nobody rips you better.

[02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:58.950]
Okay. Hey, listen, when you're getting on a verge of as old as I'm going to be tomorrow,

[02:14:58.970 --> 02:15:01.850]
it's a damn good thing I can remember to come to work here every day.

[02:15:03.110 --> 02:15:04.690]
That's one thing about doing the show out of town.

[02:15:04.730 --> 02:15:06.030]
At least I can't forget where to go.

[02:15:06.070 --> 02:15:07.310]
Where I'm going to go to work.

[02:15:08.110 --> 02:15:08.790]
Wait, if you do.

[02:15:08.890 --> 02:15:10.830]
Oh, I must be in that room over there. Yeah, there's the studio.

[02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.630]
WQIM.

[02:15:12.930 --> 02:15:13.410]
Hey, Neil.

[02:15:13.610 --> 02:15:17.170]
Yes, sir. You were talking about Channel 6.

[02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:19.130]
You left off the best one.

[02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:19.810]
And who's that?

[02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:21.510]
Bano Shmit.

[02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:22.710]
Oh, Bino, yeah, Bino.

[02:15:29.370 --> 02:15:32.890]
I wonder if he's keen to that Tom Shmit, Schnitt, God, it's on IOD.

[02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:36.830]
He's a Tom Brokoff fan, he tries to imitate him.

[02:15:37.410 --> 02:15:38.330]
Oh, he's got a speech defect.

[02:15:39.070 --> 02:15:40.010]
Very, very, very.

[02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:41.970]
Okay, well, he belongs here. No question about it.

[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:42.290]
Thank you.

[02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:43.790]
That's Sarah for Bino.

[02:15:44.110 --> 02:15:44.690]
And Bino.

[02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:48.030]
Yeah, we got some real crappy people on here doing who's in this market.

[02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:50.270]
Well, it's a bush league, like John Gibson said.

[02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:52.970]
I'd be working the most bush league little backwater place.

[02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:54.850]
I already am, John. Okay, so this relax.

[02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:57.370]
You think I have some influence here?

[02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:58.110]
Jesus Christ.

[02:15:58.390 --> 02:16:01.970]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:05.030]
And Verizon Wireless Line approaching 400 votes on a poll.

[02:16:05.370 --> 02:16:07.870]
As we get these people whipped up, there's an election tomorrow. Huh?

[02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.970]
Where's that?

[02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:11.410]
WQIM.

[02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.870]
QIM.

[02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:18.750]
Is he just like, uh, like, just playing, being quiet.

[02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:20.350]
It's so funny. WQIM.

[02:16:20.830 --> 02:16:21.790]
Hey, how you doing, you all?

[02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:22.870]
Pretty good. Thanks.

[02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:25.430]
Well, not McBride or Bush at the WECD.

[02:16:25.890 --> 02:16:30.090]
They both admit that they either want to raise taxes or budgets for programs.

[02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:34.750]
My whole thing is McBride is a corporate lawyer who's fired hundreds of people.

[02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:36.590]
And I don't want that kind of person.

[02:16:36.770 --> 02:16:38.150]
Obviously, he's hitting the ads.

[02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:38.590]
Yeah.

[02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:41.310]
And he just hung up.

[02:16:41.930 --> 02:16:43.430]
As soon as you started sensing, he hung up.

[02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.050]
I didn't hang up.

[02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:45.570]
You can see I wasn't paying attention.

[02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:47.030]
I was grabbing stuff off the facts machine.

[02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:49.670]
So don't say that I'm cutting him off because he's not going to build McBride.

[02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:50.990]
You can knock anybody you want.

[02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:51.990]
But he's not making any sense.

[02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:54.250]
He's just repeating the verbiage from an ad he saw.

[02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:57.570]
Just repeating like an automaton, like some kind of a limbing.

[02:16:57.890 --> 02:16:59.550]
Just a monkey-see monkey-do, you know?

[02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:04.330]
See something on a TV ad right away calls up the talk show to repeat the same tired old stuff.

[02:17:04.530 --> 02:17:05.630]
Other train monkey.

[02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:06.350]
Exactly, Mo.

[02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:10.330]
What is this from?

[02:17:10.470 --> 02:17:11.390]
This is the most assent.

[02:17:11.470 --> 02:17:14.170]
Oh, this is October 23rd, McBride now leads. Right.

[02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:15.130]

[02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:19.130]
Hate to break the news to you, but several days have gone by since October 23rd.

[02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:23.130]
This looks like it's from the school of wishful thinking that somebody just...

[02:17:23.130 --> 02:17:26.190]
And pages and pages and pages of propaganda here, okay?

[02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:28.430]
Alan Orlando, thank you, Al.

[02:17:28.710 --> 02:17:30.550]
He says, PS McBride is now heading to polls.

[02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:31.090]
Guess what?

[02:17:32.190 --> 02:17:34.970]
15 points behind us, if yesterday on MSNBC.

[02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:40.230]
And MSNBC is hardly a right-wing extremist network that's going to like fudge the numbers.

[02:17:41.010 --> 02:17:41.770]
Or pack them.

[02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:48.190]
We got one guy that wants to pack the courts, another guy wants to pack the fudge.

[02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:50.730]
Oh, I'm forgetting Bob Coons is on a ballot speaker of that.

[02:17:50.890 --> 02:17:52.710]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.550]
Oh.

[02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:55.310]
Now, what is this?

[02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:58.550]
MSN currently have a volunteer on Congresswoman's Karen Thurman campaign.

[02:17:58.670 --> 02:17:59.670]
Our previous head worked as a...

[02:17:59.670 --> 02:18:01.990]
If I can help any way to McBride, etc.

[02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:03.070]
What is this?

[02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:05.650]
What is all this stuff?

[02:18:05.730 --> 02:18:07.330]
Just a bunch of stuff.

[02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.230]
Man.

[02:18:09.370 --> 02:18:13.990]
MSNBC News, I challenge you to confront the Jeb Bush campaign for the fraudulent advertising they've been doing in Florida.

[02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:16.830]
Recently, I emailed a response from MSNBC cable news.

[02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:22.510]
Is there anything anyone at Fox News help us get a rep from the McBride campaign to appear on MSNBC and speak about this?

[02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:23.970]
Is there anyone at Fox News?

[02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.450]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:24.810 --> 02:18:26.210]
They got a lot of McBride people at Fox.

[02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:27.390]
They got them locked into rooms somewhere.

[02:18:28.650 --> 02:18:29.490]
How do you like that?

[02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:31.830]
And then there's the thing of...

[02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:32.870]
To Mr. O'Reilly.

[02:18:33.290 --> 02:18:34.370]
Yaudi yaudi yaudi yaudi.

[02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:36.890]
So what am I supposed to do with this?

[02:18:37.450 --> 02:18:39.830]
Oh, no. Wait till you see who this is from.

[02:18:40.130 --> 02:18:40.530]
Oh!

[02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:44.690]
Alfred Rogers, a Florida concern citizen.

[02:18:44.730 --> 02:18:46.090]
That can be the Al Rogers that we know.

[02:18:46.130 --> 02:18:46.530]
Oh, no.

[02:18:46.850 --> 02:18:47.250]
Oh, sure.

[02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:48.410]
Probably.

[02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:52.470]
Because it's like the ramblings of a looney tunes kind of person looks like to me.

[02:18:53.370 --> 02:18:54.410]
Just when you think.

[02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:56.550]
Yeah. Just when you think it's safe.

[02:18:58.170 --> 02:19:00.570]
They keep resurfacing over and over again.

[02:19:00.850 --> 02:19:01.990]
Don't forget to join the overnight guys.

[02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.650]
Join Mark tonight.

[02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:03.970]
Nine of 11 against Bees and Kindle.

[02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:06.450]
Stop by to win prizes and joy specials on Crown Royal.

[02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:10.310]
Monday night footballs that often visit the Packers and Bart started out at Kets Bees and Kindle.

[02:19:10.470 --> 02:19:12.290]
I'm just going to keep saying Bart Star maybe he'll show up.

[02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:14.670]
Oh, he could suit up and beat him tonight.

[02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:15.470]
He ain't no Ray Lucas.

[02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:16.190]
That's why.

[02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:18.610]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.

[02:19:18.730 --> 02:19:19.970]
No Tom Brady out there to that.

[02:19:20.090 --> 02:19:20.930]
That'd be a good pull question.

[02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:22.590]
Who'd you rather have a quarterback of that offense?

[02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:23.970]
Tom Brady or Ray Lucas?

[02:19:24.650 --> 02:19:25.690]
Or Jay Feedler, huh?

[02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:27.590]
Good question.

[02:19:27.930 --> 02:19:28.490]
Deputy QIM.

[02:19:30.510 --> 02:19:30.870]
Neil.

[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:31.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:31.690 --> 02:19:32.170]
Good morning.

[02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.510]
How are you?

[02:19:32.550 --> 02:19:32.810]
Good news.

[02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:35.190]
Neil, did you see that article?

[02:19:35.210 --> 02:19:36.330]
Maybe you talked about it.

[02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:37.030]
I don't know.

[02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:38.030]
I couldn't catch your whole show.

[02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:45.810]
But I was more than I was warning about the thoughties blowing us off in terms of allowing us to use their bases or fly over.

[02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:46.010]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:46.030 --> 02:19:49.590]
That was how they had lengthy interviews with the with the his smatha head yesterday.

[02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:50.270]
Neil.

[02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:52.870]
Isn't Saudi Arabia really our enemy?

[02:19:53.130 --> 02:19:53.310]
Really?

[02:19:53.310 --> 02:19:54.190]
When he come down on it?

[02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:57.190]
So it didn't they didn't they give off spring to all those people that bomb us.

[02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.430]
Yes.

[02:19:57.590 --> 02:20:01.230]
And so why don't we just drop a few on the way over?

[02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:06.030]
So Iraq, why don't we just drop a few there and get rid of that man?

[02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:08.990]
No, you're forgetting you're forgetting one thing oily bird oily bird.

[02:20:09.090 --> 02:20:09.870]
They got the oily bird.

[02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:10.170]
Yeah.

[02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:11.910]
Let's let's let's let's let's go.

[02:20:12.210 --> 02:20:13.310]
OIL M O N E Y.

[02:20:13.410 --> 02:20:14.630]
You're not spelling your words right sir.

[02:20:14.890 --> 02:20:16.270]
OIL M O N E Y.

[02:20:16.850 --> 02:20:18.590]
SCRE W E D.

[02:20:19.350 --> 02:20:19.970]
F U.

[02:20:20.970 --> 02:20:22.250]
FINE AND LOCO.

[02:20:22.570 --> 02:20:24.510]
We're sports video 560.

[02:20:24.690 --> 02:20:26.370]
You A M.

[02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:29.150]
The state Goldstein.

[02:20:29.370 --> 02:20:30.370]
But you can call me Kelsey.

[02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:33.490]
Whenever I'm in town I listen to wait a minute I am in town.

[02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:35.270]
It's the 12 to 1 hour.

[02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:40.170]
The walk is the productions comes the cutest little Arabs you've ever seen.

[02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:46.530]
Erifat, Abdullah, Jerusalem and little Jericho 102 Palestinians.

[02:20:46.530 --> 02:20:51.470]
This time the wicked Kurella Barak is trying to separate all the little Palestinians

[02:20:51.470 --> 02:20:53.770]
from their happy West Bay homes.

[02:20:53.930 --> 02:21:00.290]
It's one explosive situation after another with all those Palestinians scrambling for cover.

[02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:08.270]
Don't miss Walt Disney's newest animated feature 102 Palestinians now showing in theaters everywhere.

[02:21:08.610 --> 02:21:10.050]
It's time to get it off.

[02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:14.550]
Oh, speaking of bad news you see who warmed his way back into the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset?

[02:21:36.370 --> 02:21:38.270]
BB.

[02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:40.030]
BB Netanyahu.

[02:21:41.410 --> 02:21:45.910]
We got to get Monday a linear so we're leaving right now to go up there and vote a few times a minute.

[02:21:46.090 --> 02:21:47.230]
Never been a Minnesota view.

[02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:47.770]
Yes.

[02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:49.150]
And beautiful.

[02:21:49.350 --> 02:21:50.010]
Is this beautiful?

[02:21:50.050 --> 02:21:51.270]
Land of the billion lakes.

[02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:55.410]
And went canoeing along those lakes around St. Louis Park in Minnesota.

[02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.850]
Yeah.

[02:21:56.050 --> 02:21:57.870]
And it's a spectacular place.

[02:21:58.050 --> 02:21:58.490]
Kayaks.

[02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:59.910]
No, just canoeing.

[02:21:59.910 --> 02:22:01.950]
All the lakes are like interconnected with canals.

[02:22:02.130 --> 02:22:04.810]
You can canal all around behind the the nice houses.

[02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:05.570]
You ever see Lake Tahoe?

[02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.110]
No.

[02:22:06.510 --> 02:22:08.470]
Oh man is that a beautiful place.

[02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:10.090]
Anyway, I don't know why I'm just rambling.

[02:22:10.350 --> 02:22:10.890]
And you want to know why?

[02:22:10.970 --> 02:22:12.750]
Because I'm thinking about being anyplace but here.

[02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:15.870]
Oh, are we going to have a mess here tomorrow or what?

[02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:17.310]
Is there any doubt about it?

[02:22:17.410 --> 02:22:18.090]
No chance.

[02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:19.290]
It's going to be another mess.

[02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:26.490]
And David Lee, he's going to say this and Miriam Elephant is going to say that and Laurie Parrish is going to say it.

[02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:28.350]
But it will be, but it will be, it's going to be a mess again.

[02:22:29.470 --> 02:22:32.350]
Because basically in Florida we only want the right people to vote.

[02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:35.110]
We'll let a few other or the wrong people vote just to make it look good.

[02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.650]
Not too good.

[02:22:35.650 --> 02:22:37.870]
But we don't only want the right people to vote.

[02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:39.310]
And the right people.

[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:40.450]
The rest of you piss off.

[02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.730]
Okay.

[02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:42.850]
WNQAM.

[02:22:43.350 --> 02:22:44.410]
Hey, you know how you doing?

[02:22:44.430 --> 02:22:44.730]
Okay.

[02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:46.110]
My birthday is on the safe.

[02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.970]
I'm happy birthday to you.

[02:22:47.170 --> 02:22:47.670]
Well, wait a minute.

[02:22:47.810 --> 02:22:52.010]
Let's give us both a little, a little thing of which I already have one.

[02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:53.030]
I'm touched.

[02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.830]
Listen.

[02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:54.230]
I'll bet.

[02:22:56.110 --> 02:23:00.030]
Black guy calling into explain a couple of things to you about Haitians and blacks.

[02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:01.570]
Who was their support bush.

[02:23:02.350 --> 02:23:03.490]
A little bit of money.

[02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:08.510]
Grease and the palms will work for, you know, some people to trans-compuse and pull the masses.

[02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:10.570]
That sounds like something the Kennedys used to do.

[02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.970]
I'm sorry.

[02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:11.550]
Yeah.

[02:23:12.010 --> 02:23:14.350]
Well, but the masses of blacks and Haitians believe me.

[02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:16.730]
I could I spoke to my people.

[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:18.330]
Yeah.

[02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:20.470]
And believe me, there's no end hell.

[02:23:20.610 --> 02:23:23.430]
You're going to have more than probably 2% both of Bush.

[02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:25.710]
Well, we got to have like a better big turnout, man.

[02:23:25.770 --> 02:23:27.410]
You got to go there and drag them out of their house.

[02:23:27.770 --> 02:23:28.190]
Don't worry.

[02:23:28.270 --> 02:23:29.390]
I'm going to get a little brown for you.

[02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:31.490]
All right.

[02:23:31.810 --> 02:23:34.790]
Hey, I called you about a year before Clinton left office.

[02:23:34.930 --> 02:23:35.130]
Yeah.

[02:23:35.390 --> 02:23:38.490]
And you and I were both in agreement that when we went to the goals, we're all going to miss them.

[02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:39.830]
And I miss them.

[02:23:39.930 --> 02:23:40.390]
No, bad.

[02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:46.850]
In fact, every time I see him at one of these campaign stops, like when he was here over the weekend, I see him there and I think, oh boy, how we miss you now.

[02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:48.370]
Oh, do I?

[02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:50.290]
But there was nothing with Bush.

[02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.670]
Trust me.

[02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:53.770]
He knows that he's in trouble.

[02:23:53.770 --> 02:23:56.410]
That's why they're trying to say that he's up by so many points.

[02:23:56.770 --> 02:23:57.830]
He's not about that many points.

[02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.650]
Don't believe it.

[02:23:58.650 --> 02:23:59.370]
Let's hope not.

[02:23:59.790 --> 02:24:00.010]
All right.

[02:24:00.290 --> 02:24:01.410]
Okay, early and often pal.

[02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:02.310]
A lot of.

[02:24:02.490 --> 02:24:02.770]
Thanks.

[02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:07.990]
By the way, I think last Monday was that I had the bad news you were out on vacation about the Jessica Simpson and the Nick.

[02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:10.450]
You were here.

[02:24:10.690 --> 02:24:11.090]
I wasn't here.

[02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:11.930]
They got married.

[02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:13.210]
It's official.

[02:24:13.330 --> 02:24:15.650]
What do you mean who cares?

[02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:18.050]
And she saved it for their wedding night.

[02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:20.270]
And a tupperware.

[02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:22.490]
And a little one of those little plastic tupperware.

[02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:23.230]
She saved it in a box.

[02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:24.370]
Kind of like pop it open.

[02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:27.450]
And it makes that little sound when you pop it open.

[02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:30.430]
There will be the Q.I. am.

[02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:31.350]
Neil.

[02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.930]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:32.250 --> 02:24:32.790]
How you doing, man?

[02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.190]
Great.

[02:24:33.890 --> 02:24:35.610]
First, I want to wish you happy birthday, man.

[02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.230]

[02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:36.630]
Thanks.

[02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:39.890]
And I'm not doing a subgroup call before I make my comment.

[02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:42.490]
I've been listening to you since I was a kid.

[02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:46.350]
My dad tied me onto you, crap, back in like the late 70s.

[02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:46.710]
Yeah.

[02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:49.850]
So I just want to thank you for being a voice.

[02:24:49.930 --> 02:24:51.770]
I'll be reading down here for my whole life.

[02:24:52.130 --> 02:24:54.990]
Because this place is real toilet.

[02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:55.570]
Mm hmm.

[02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:56.630]
You can smell it.

[02:24:57.130 --> 02:25:04.350]
The thing is with the whole voting, you know, it's like you said you're voting for like the

[02:25:04.350 --> 02:25:05.230]
less of the two evils.

[02:25:05.370 --> 02:25:11.110]
I'm not a public game or I'm just kind of vote for the people who are going to take away as many rights

[02:25:11.890 --> 02:25:15.550]
or trying to bring fascism back into fascism.

[02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:26.170]
Even the Democrats are so horrible in their presentation towards the public that it's almost painful to vote for them too.

[02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:28.410]
But I mean at the same time it's still a less than we are.

[02:25:28.410 --> 02:25:29.150]
We got a few of them.

[02:25:31.450 --> 02:25:32.570]
They start calling.

[02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:36.430]
And you know, and the other thing is speaking of the brand of the liberal.

[02:25:36.570 --> 02:25:37.510]
I mean, what's a liberal?

[02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:39.730]
I mean, what's so bad about being a liberal?

[02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:41.650]
It's just like mind your own business.

[02:25:41.930 --> 02:25:44.070]
Whatever you're doing in your own house is your business.

[02:25:44.470 --> 02:25:45.190]
You know, the damn.

[02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:46.750]
It's like build my roads.

[02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:47.890]
Give me my information.

[02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:52.230]
You know, use my taxes to build schools and don't tell me how to live my damn life.

[02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:53.830]
Don't tell me what's right or wrong.

[02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:56.470]
But anyway, man, thanks again.

[02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:57.530]
Have a good birthday.

[02:25:57.610 --> 02:25:58.130]
Okay, hang in there.

[02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.350]
Thanks.

[02:25:58.830 --> 02:25:59.610]
And what was that?

[02:25:59.610 --> 02:26:00.210]
That was Julio.

[02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:02.370]
He decided he wanted to chime in on the show from the show.

[02:26:03.350 --> 02:26:04.010]
Not on purpose.

[02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:06.430]
Oh, I thought I was losing my mind.

[02:26:06.430 --> 02:26:07.170]
I hear this voice.

[02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:08.070]
Don't do it again.

[02:26:08.390 --> 02:26:09.430]
Don't do it again, Julio.

[02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:10.410]
Not if you know what's good for you.

[02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.630]
Okay.

[02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:13.210]
I'll start writing your name on the wall and then allying in Toronto.

[02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:15.830]
Julio found the alley, baby.

[02:26:16.170 --> 02:26:16.730]
He's a man.

[02:26:16.850 --> 02:26:18.610]
He's the kind of guy you want to take anywhere you go.

[02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:22.110]
Because he's obviously he in no time at all finds the lay of the land.

[02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:24.350]
If you know what I'm saying, what a guy.

[02:26:24.730 --> 02:26:25.470]
I knew her.

[02:26:25.770 --> 02:26:26.170]
Yeah.

[02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:29.390]
Percentage of English only household dropping in Florida.

[02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:30.210]
Incredible.

[02:26:30.270 --> 02:26:35.050]
That's an upon beach post and controversial combination of Spanish and English making its way into mainstream.

[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:36.230]
That's in a Boston globe.

[02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:37.810]
It's about Spanish.

[02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:39.730]
Can't stand it.

[02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:44.970]
And it reminded me of those horrible days speaking about can't stand it when we were downstairs on the second floor when we first came over to QA

[02:26:44.970 --> 02:26:50.390]
and Georgia be on the phone with his brother is one of his speak relatives in the morning talking in the most gutterable dialects.

[02:26:50.390 --> 02:26:51.430]
My mother or my aunt.

[02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:54.910]
I have ever heard in my life the most gutterable annoying and oh.

[02:26:55.490 --> 02:27:00.790]
And I'm not one of those people that gets uptight about other people speaking other languages having spent so much time in Amsterdam.

[02:27:00.970 --> 02:27:04.010]
But never I said hey George don't do that again.

[02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:06.610]
He didn't what I can barely speak it.

[02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:08.150]
You can barely speak it.

[02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:08.730]
I sound.

[02:27:08.850 --> 02:27:09.130]
Yeah.

[02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:12.310]
Oh, it was just oh what a I mean there's nothing wrong with Spanish.

[02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:14.250]
You've spoken properly all over we don't want to hear it here.

[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:15.470]
Well, we don't want to hear it here.

[02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:15.790]
I'll hear it.

[02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:17.230]
We don't want to hear it here.

[02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:18.250]
You got it.

[02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.190]
But when we didn't look here.

[02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:19.790]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:24.090]
And I've had a Spanish already especially out there in the acres man.

[02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:26.010]
I'm telling I just can't even go to the gas station.

[02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:27.850]
Walking there.

[02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:29.590]
What is that all about?

[02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:30.610]
What is that?

[02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:32.750]
I don't mind those people getting the jobs.

[02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:33.830]
They're nice people.

[02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.630]
They're competent.

[02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:35.650]
They can add.

[02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:39.370]
Just remember Florida was Spanish territory for much longer than it was English territory.

[02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:39.910]
I see.

[02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:40.430]
Yeah, it's the E.

[02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:41.090]
Fernando.

[02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:42.490]
I'm going to take it back.

[02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:43.330]
Fernando magenta.

[02:27:43.570 --> 02:27:45.530]
Is that why you want one punts that they'll frequently hear?

[02:27:45.810 --> 02:27:45.870]
Right.

[02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:48.410]
Oh, that's where the hurricane's playing it down there on ponds.

[02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:50.590]
The hurricane.

[02:27:50.850 --> 02:27:51.670]
Oh boy.

[02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:53.510]
That's baseball anyway down there.

[02:27:53.930 --> 02:27:55.410]
We're not going to talk about the orange bull.

[02:27:55.610 --> 02:27:57.330]
You know what kind of a bull it is the kind you like.

[02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:58.970]
And do other things in it.

[02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:00.230]
That's the kind of bull the orange bull is.

[02:28:01.310 --> 02:28:01.850]
It's typical.

[02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:06.030]
I think the orange bull like typifies South Florida just one big outdoor toilet.

[02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:08.350]
I used to call it outdoor funeral parlor which I think is close.

[02:28:09.210 --> 02:28:15.670]
And since I've been back here in this town and I've seen people driving, there was a woman in a big catallec yesterday in front of me in a big

[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:16.090]
Jewel canoe.

[02:28:16.530 --> 02:28:18.990]
This woman had to be at least 145 minimum.

[02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:21.530]
And the light changes.

[02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.450]
We got a green light.

[02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:22.770]
Okay.

[02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:24.350]
I mean forget about the right turn on red.

[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:25.170]
Forget about that.

[02:28:25.390 --> 02:28:26.510]
Making a right turn on green.

[02:28:27.450 --> 02:28:28.210]
This bitch.

[02:28:28.430 --> 02:28:29.230]
This old bag.

[02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:31.170]
She's just crawling around.

[02:28:31.390 --> 02:28:34.110]
And we get around a corner and so she lucked this is on university.

[02:28:35.130 --> 02:28:39.010]
And she goes into the middle lane and I wanted to be able to go to the right or left over which I did.

[02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:42.810]
I got to the right just to look and see what what what kind of creature was driving this thing.

[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:48.970]
Seriously, she's like she's like one of those creatures like to like to brought on the small girl last week.

[02:28:48.970 --> 02:28:50.210]
The one who was all I missed.

[02:28:50.490 --> 02:28:51.650]
Oh, it was very good.

[02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:53.730]
When I was sucking the life out of the people.

[02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:55.050]
Oh, that was a hundred years old.

[02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.610]
Yeah, the sucker.

[02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:57.650]
Well, this woman sucked all right.

[02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:59.870]
She was as old as that bitch.

[02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:02.490]
She made Tabitha on passions looking young by comparison.

[02:29:02.490 --> 02:29:06.730]
And she's sitting there like lurch, you know, like she's got like Bob Mayer.

[02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:08.570]
She's got 15 phone books on her ass.

[02:29:08.730 --> 02:29:10.710]
And she's lurch forward and holding the wheel like that.

[02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.430]
Like, Buella the Witch is what she looked like.

[02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:13.610]
Remember Buella the Witch?

[02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:13.930]
No.

[02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:16.530]
That's because you didn't watch Cook, the friend and Ollie.

[02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:17.630]
Ask Bokeh Brian.

[02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:18.670]
He'll remember Buella the Witch.

[02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:21.170]
He remembers all the old stuff.

[02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:24.310]
Of course his mind is rotting anyway.

[02:29:24.730 --> 02:29:26.890]
Nine minutes after noon at 5.60 WDQM.

[02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:29.430]
Speaking of your mind riding, get his guess what we got at one o'clock.

[02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:29.830]
No.

[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:30.290]
Oh, yes.

[02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:31.490]
Yes, we do.

[02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.950]
Perfect.

[02:29:32.310 --> 02:29:35.910]
Wow, because the mad dogs in the green bay getting ready for Brett star and Brett the Bart

[02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:37.070]
Farve.

[02:29:37.150 --> 02:29:38.230]
Oh, no, tell me the facts.

[02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:39.010]
Oh, no.

[02:29:39.010 --> 02:29:39.130]
Oh, no.

[02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:40.510]
Oh, look at that.

[02:29:41.010 --> 02:29:42.830]
I thought our buddy graced all this Jose.

[02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:46.630]
Oh, look at this.

[02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:49.110]
Here's the guy picking on Tommy again.

[02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:50.830]
Well, we'll get to this in a minute.

[02:29:50.890 --> 02:29:51.330]
It's kind of cute.

[02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:54.050]
Tommy don't speak to me anymore since I said he sounded like a Flamer.

[02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:55.090]
He don't speak to me.

[02:29:55.170 --> 02:29:55.510]
That's okay.

[02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:56.530]
He still loves you.

[02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:57.150]
What are you talking about?

[02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:58.430]
It's just when you relax.

[02:29:58.430 --> 02:29:59.390]
It's a radio show.

[02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:00.570]
You're starting to get like John Gibson.

[02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:02.950]
We're going to put your ass on MSNVC with that Heather bitch.

[02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.770]
We're going to hook you up with her.

[02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:04.370]
Okay.

[02:30:05.290 --> 02:30:06.330]
I knew you'd say that.

[02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:08.230]
Hey, Heather, we think you look great.

[02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:10.590]
Okay, even an old bag like me thinks you look fantastic.

[02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:13.330]
Just keep your mouth shut until we tell you it's time to open it.

[02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:14.270]
I'll soften her up.

[02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:15.750]
Yeah, I'm sure in your case.

[02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:17.910]
10 past noon at 5.60 WDQM.

[02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:18.530]
Hey, let me tell you.

[02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:21.890]
Speaking of that, how about putting some, popping some Oliometh in your posts?

[02:30:22.410 --> 02:30:22.810]
That's right.

[02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.970]
Oliometh is a great product.

[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.430]
I got different Mediterranean formulas.

[02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:27.170]
I decided to help different parts of your health.

[02:30:27.170 --> 02:30:28.610]
And I got three brand new ones for you.

[02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:30.230]
Check out the three new formulas.

[02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:31.110]
Want to help you sleep?

[02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:32.770]
Want to help you control your weight?

[02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:35.310]
And Coke you 10 and take it for me.

[02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:36.230]
It's great for your heart.

[02:30:36.430 --> 02:30:36.890]
Coke you 10.

[02:30:37.210 --> 02:30:39.070]
More, how come nobody talks about Coke you 10?

[02:30:39.250 --> 02:30:39.630]
You take it?

[02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:41.230]
Yeah, it's part of my supplement.

[02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:42.230]
It's good for your man.

[02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:46.790]
The difference in your pulse rate when you take Coke you 10, it's like phenomenal, especially

[02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:48.010]
for a fat old slob like me.

[02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:51.870]
Anyway, all the Oliometh products use the benefits of the best olive oil on the planet

[02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:53.450]

[02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:39.410]
Yeah.

[02:31:40.970 --> 02:31:42.050]
Pink push.

[02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:55.210]
I stumble and I bumble just to talk is really hard without prewritten notes from Power

[02:31:55.210 --> 02:31:56.550]
Rover Andrew Card.

[02:31:56.890 --> 02:31:57.790]
Pink push.

[02:31:58.430 --> 02:32:00.730]
My brain is made and do do.

[02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:01.570]
Pink push.

[02:32:02.350 --> 02:32:04.510]
But that don't seem to bug you.

[02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:08.270]
Has no opposition and you have no opinion.

[02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:09.510]
Pink push.

[02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:11.550]
It's post pretty high.

[02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:18.610]
I'm out raised by the sudden wave of white collar crime unless of course the CEO's are

[02:32:18.610 --> 02:32:20.130]
old friends of mine.

[02:32:20.350 --> 02:32:21.090]
Pink push.

[02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:23.890]
That's as little as I'm a girl.

[02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.950]
Pink push.

[02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:27.650]
Not every flasher he's a homo.

[02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:32.270]
The Saudis they attacked us but food don't give a crap it's pink.

[02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:33.530]
Jesus Christ.

[02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:34.370]
There are friends.

[02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:39.710]
That's the shirt we're in for shoot of evil jurors every day.

[02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:43.330]
Just like those drug lords being pursued by OJ.

[02:32:43.730 --> 02:32:44.410]
Pink push.

[02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:47.110]
You don't care what I'm doing.

[02:32:47.610 --> 02:32:48.490]
Pink push.

[02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:51.330]
And I thought I was stupid.

[02:32:51.810 --> 02:32:53.690]
The media controls you.

[02:32:54.210 --> 02:32:55.750]
You do what you told the team.

[02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:58.390]
If you didn't see it on TV it ain't true.

[02:32:59.130 --> 02:33:03.350]
The media isn't our control with stories they're a spinners.

[02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:04.810]
No matter what goes wrong.

[02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:06.630]
They will just blame it all on clean.

[02:33:06.970 --> 02:33:07.830]
Pink push.

[02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:10.890]
I don't have no interest going down.

[02:33:11.090 --> 02:33:11.730]
Pink push.

[02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:13.530]
I'm on a higher ball ground.

[02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:14.950]
Besides I wouldn't know how.

[02:33:15.390 --> 02:33:18.730]
He's a moral grounder and a bug pounder.

[02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:23.890]
Suicide attack at a Mayam shopping mall in Israel is surprised.

[02:33:24.730 --> 02:33:25.910]
Now the suicide bomber.

[02:33:26.650 --> 02:33:28.630]
At least one killed 15 wounded in Israel bombing.

[02:33:28.850 --> 02:33:29.310]
What a surprise.

[02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:33.150]
So here's a fact from somebody who obviously wants to critique the radio station.

[02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:36.230]
Which is entitled to what's wrong with QAM and he's only got three things on it.

[02:33:36.310 --> 02:33:37.390]
Which I'm not going to read number three.

[02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:38.910]
It's about somebody we like a lot.

[02:33:39.010 --> 02:33:40.730]
Not about us but about somebody we're not going to rip.

[02:33:41.810 --> 02:33:44.710]
Number one that flaming queen that does all the spots it's embarrassing.

[02:33:45.010 --> 02:33:48.850]
It sounds like a near-roger show but they cannot find one broadcast that can read copy.

[02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:49.110]
No.

[02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:51.030]
Don't be ripping Tommy.

[02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.390]
Okay.

[02:33:51.490 --> 02:33:52.490]
So he sounds like a flamery.

[02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:53.370]
You're not a finding him.

[02:33:53.770 --> 02:33:55.050]
They all want to get paid.

[02:33:55.330 --> 02:33:56.350]
Oh, paid.

[02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:58.350]
Are you people kidding us or what?

[02:33:59.690 --> 02:34:01.950]
I still can't get over the thing that George Beasley comment.

[02:34:02.010 --> 02:34:03.090]
I wish I would have heard that in person.

[02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:06.150]
I was so great about the broadcast right now.

[02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:08.370]
What I've been saying ever since I sat down in this station.

[02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:12.550]
Pan all that ridiculous amount of money for Marlins which we have 15 people.

[02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:17.650]
Listen to the guy named games on this station and then we have to have us working our asses off in here and getting big numbers.

[02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:19.910]
So we can make enough money to pay for the money.

[02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:23.170]
And they were losing in that crap until they finally got him down.

[02:34:25.050 --> 02:34:25.450]
Let's see.

[02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:27.250]
Anyway, about Tommy to rip and pour a little Tommy.

[02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:28.950]
He can't help it if he's got a squeaky voice.

[02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.630]
He's a good guy.

[02:34:29.730 --> 02:34:30.290]
We like him a lot.

[02:34:30.490 --> 02:34:30.630]
Okay.

[02:34:30.930 --> 02:34:32.810]
Even if he does have a very squeaky, effeminate voice.

[02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:34.430]
He just does this for the money anyway.

[02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:35.030]
That's right.

[02:34:35.130 --> 02:34:36.950]
He isn't give a crap about whether he sounds good or not.

[02:34:37.090 --> 02:34:38.570]
He fits right in with our whole sales thrust.

[02:34:38.730 --> 02:34:39.650]
Just give us the F and money.

[02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:41.190]
We don't care if the spot sounds good.

[02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:42.210]
If we get it right or whatever.

[02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:43.190]
Just give us the money.

[02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:44.030]
Two.

[02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:45.930]
Steve Goldstein all day all the time.

[02:34:46.030 --> 02:34:46.790]
Now you're getting warm.

[02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:51.270]
The morning show with Steve Goldstein that often pregame show with Steve Goldstein.

[02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:52.990]
The Panther pregame show with Steve Goldstein.

[02:34:53.170 --> 02:34:55.390]
Last year we actually broadcast a few Panthers games.

[02:34:56.310 --> 02:34:58.730]
They pay him 26k a year in plug-in everywhere.

[02:34:59.090 --> 02:35:00.230]
I think he's making a little more than that.

[02:35:00.690 --> 02:35:02.410]
But he is getting plugged in is what I'm hearing.

[02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:04.570]
Isn't that what you heard plugged in?

[02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:06.290]
That's what I heard.

[02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:07.610]
I heard it was up the bottom.

[02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.870]

[02:35:09.130 --> 02:35:13.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pop 5 60 on the 18 bars.

[02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:14.210]
You got that fast.

[02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:15.450]
And I haven't lost it, baby.

[02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:16.530]
Haven't lost it.

[02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:17.610]
You know what I am.

[02:35:17.710 --> 02:35:18.910]
Another train monkey.

[02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.350]
That's it.

[02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:20.850]
424 votes on the pool.

[02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:22.410]
How do you feel about tomorrow's election?

[02:35:22.470 --> 02:35:23.710]
There is an election of our by the way.

[02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:24.570]
Anybody care?

[02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:25.010]
No.

[02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:26.570]
It's very important.

[02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.510]
147.

[02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:29.230]
I'm voting but not excited.

[02:35:29.570 --> 02:35:30.010]
117.

[02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:31.890]
It's life and death.

[02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.530]
68.

[02:35:33.130 --> 02:35:35.650]
I'm not voting why bother 59 and want me worry.

[02:35:35.970 --> 02:35:36.390]
33.

[02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:37.890]
33.

[02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:40.190]
Here's a good one.

[02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:41.170]
I'm going to save it for tomorrow.

[02:35:41.310 --> 02:35:43.790]
The great Republican Records and Bush and company stole the White House.

[02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:46.290]
I'm going to save that for tomorrow.

[02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:50.010]
Also Liz Dopp landed loses while we can't get anything right in South Florida.

[02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.690]
She's right.

[02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:55.410]
Oh and also there's a big piece in Saturday sunset.

[02:35:55.410 --> 02:35:56.010]
Look at this.

[02:35:56.030 --> 02:35:56.590]
Look at this picture.

[02:35:57.650 --> 02:35:58.090]
Black voters.

[02:35:58.090 --> 02:35:59.910]
Well it's a continuation of us through on the front page.

[02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:01.690]
Black voters unhappy with Bush.

[02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:04.910]
I think our dark, complicated friend called him in and he go and his thumb right on it.

[02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:05.110]
Okay.

[02:36:05.430 --> 02:36:08.510]
They may find a few Haitians here or there or a couple of other people that got paid,

[02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:09.190]
you know, 50 bucks.

[02:36:09.290 --> 02:36:11.570]
They want to vote for Bush or whatever or at least say they did.

[02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:16.470]
But generally speaking, man, then that's why another reason why they don't want you dark

[02:36:16.470 --> 02:36:17.050]
folks to vote.

[02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.410]
Okay.

[02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:19.350]
So don't pay any attention to Fox News.

[02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:21.830]
John Gibson, Heather, whatever the hell are they?

[02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:22.990]
Is any of these are going to him?

[02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.190]
Okay.

[02:36:23.430 --> 02:36:24.430]
Pay no attention to it.

[02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:28.890]
All they're trying to do is divert your attention from the important task to them are

[02:36:28.890 --> 02:36:30.710]
that is go vote for five times.

[02:36:31.810 --> 02:36:37.150]
And we got a plan to counteract it even for what they did to this in franchise, democratic

[02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:38.150]
voters in 2000.

[02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:39.990]
This year all over the eight county.

[02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:41.710]
We've got people set up.

[02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:45.630]
We've got roadblocks set up to intercept old Cubans everywhere they go on way to the

[02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:45.810]
polls.

[02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:46.870]
Make sure they can't vote.

[02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.710]
How do you like that?

[02:36:48.270 --> 02:36:48.750]
That's right.

[02:36:48.890 --> 02:36:50.910]
All you old Cubans, baby, forget about it.

[02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:52.210]
Don't even leave the house tomorrow.

[02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:57.810]
We got a whole bunch of dark, complex, and police officers from every force in South Florida

[02:36:57.810 --> 02:37:00.830]
going to intercept your ass on a way down the Hershey highway where we were pulling

[02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:01.190]
places.

[02:37:01.430 --> 02:37:02.910]
Everybody should just go lay down in this street and block it.

[02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:06.990]
And if you try walking your pulling place, we got the J-walking police going to come

[02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:08.190]
in and arrest your ass.

[02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.510]
Okay?

[02:37:09.310 --> 02:37:11.450]
Until after the polls close.

[02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:13.510]
Got to get even somehow.

[02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:14.610]
It's the only shot you got.

[02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:16.430]
WQAM.

[02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:19.290]
QAM, hello.

[02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:20.910]
Not there.

[02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:23.130]
That's so depressing.

[02:37:23.350 --> 02:37:26.150]
That was going to be even better than the Richard Friedman call.

[02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:27.930]
WQAM.

[02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.410]
Hello?

[02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:29.970]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.890]
How's it going?

[02:37:31.170 --> 02:37:31.370]
Okay.

[02:37:31.970 --> 02:37:32.590]
All right.

[02:37:32.850 --> 02:37:34.350]
I have never called before, but just.

[02:37:34.450 --> 02:37:34.890]
Sure you have.

[02:37:34.930 --> 02:37:35.730]
Many times.

[02:37:35.970 --> 02:37:36.450]
Not really.

[02:37:36.450 --> 02:37:40.750]
Just for this, just for this election, I just wanted to say that a public official who

[02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:46.430]
is elected by the people that gets caught on tape saying that he's going to go around the

[02:37:46.430 --> 02:37:47.490]
deviating thing.

[02:37:47.490 --> 02:37:47.630]
Right.

[02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:49.130]
The deviating system, right?

[02:37:49.410 --> 02:37:53.790]
Which is if the people wanted, he's going to go around it and there's still people

[02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:55.490]
that support this guy.

[02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:59.170]
And both major newspapers endorse and forget about people because they're supposed to

[02:37:59.170 --> 02:38:00.010]
be stupid and they are.

[02:38:00.130 --> 02:38:02.850]
But the newspapers are supposed to have an IQ bigger than their thumbnail.

[02:38:02.850 --> 02:38:06.370]
They both endorse this guy when they got him on tape saying he's got the biggest plans

[02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:07.630]
to subvert the world of the public.

[02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:09.010]
Incredible.

[02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:14.130]
And another thing, if anybody wants any why not to vote for this guy, just go and talk

[02:38:14.130 --> 02:38:18.990]
to anybody in the education system like my mother who works for the transportation department

[02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:24.110]
and there are buses which are kids standing up, which is illegal because there's not

[02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:26.410]
even enough money to pay bus drivers or buses.

[02:38:26.650 --> 02:38:27.030]
That's right.

[02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:30.950]
Well, 20 or 30 times tomorrow, pal, don't forget.

[02:38:31.450 --> 02:38:32.050]
Good luck to us.

[02:38:32.050 --> 02:38:32.490]
Thanks.

[02:38:32.810 --> 02:38:33.330]
There you go.

[02:38:33.350 --> 02:38:34.210]
I told you it was a good guy.

[02:38:34.350 --> 02:38:35.210]
You wanted me to cut him off.

[02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:36.950]
Why do you hear that?

[02:38:36.970 --> 02:38:37.870]
Holy oaxen right away.

[02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:39.930]
You're such a self-hating spick man.

[02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.910]
Just amazing to me.

[02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.990]
I don't hate myself.

[02:38:42.330 --> 02:38:48.050]
You are to spicks what mad drudges to five six seven oh five sixty to ladies, pound five

[02:38:48.050 --> 02:38:49.510]
sixty on the AT&T.

[02:38:49.650 --> 02:38:50.910]
What the hell is his story anyway?

[02:38:51.610 --> 02:38:53.230]
I think Lynn must have turned him down.

[02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:56.090]
WQAM.

[02:38:57.130 --> 02:38:58.070]
No, there we go.

[02:38:58.130 --> 02:38:58.870]
The Raspberry God.

[02:38:59.070 --> 02:39:00.610]
They would have been, I wouldn't have been complete.

[02:39:00.610 --> 02:39:02.370]
What do you, what do you, don't get all excited?

[02:39:02.890 --> 02:39:04.990]
We haven't heard from him since we started taking calls again.

[02:39:05.450 --> 02:39:06.550]
He calls all the other shows.

[02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:11.070]
He had, he had to save it though because you, you're putting these people right on

[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:13.230]
whole so we had to save it until they could like get it out.

[02:39:13.330 --> 02:39:16.130]
You know, he like, I like the fact he bends over when does that.

[02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:18.270]
WQAM.

[02:39:19.310 --> 02:39:19.630]
Heal.

[02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:20.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:20.490 --> 02:39:22.170]
I am pissed off and fired up.

[02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.350]
Good.

[02:39:22.510 --> 02:39:22.970]
Here's one.

[02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:24.530]
We finally got somebody that's worked out.

[02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:25.690]
You don't sound like it, but nevertheless.

[02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:28.950]
No, I am really wanting to hear my angry voice or something.

[02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:34.250]
Hey, I drive for a living and I notice that I don't see a lot of McBride stickers on

[02:39:34.250 --> 02:39:34.610]
cars.

[02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:36.550]
I see mostly jab, jab, jab.

[02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:41.150]
And the funny thing is, it's always on, you know, like blue hairs or really, really expensive

[02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.730]
nice cars.

[02:39:42.170 --> 02:39:47.270]
But funny thing, you know, being from South Florida or actually living here, I had nothing

[02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:51.910]
to do last night so the wife and I packed up the car and the kiddies and we went around

[02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:53.050]
kicking down jet bush.

[02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:53.430]
Good.

[02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.910]
Excellent.

[02:39:54.330 --> 02:39:54.810]
I love it.

[02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:59.170]
In fact, you know something, there's one in my neighborhood on a pool that I have to pass

[02:39:59.170 --> 02:39:59.990]
by every day at my home.

[02:40:00.370 --> 02:40:01.750]
Today, I'm going to like park the car.

[02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:04.310]
I'm just going to stop the car in the middle of the road, run over and just rip it off

[02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:04.610]
the pool.

[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:06.450]
I'm sick and tired of being having to see that thing.

[02:40:06.810 --> 02:40:07.630]
I will meet you there.

[02:40:07.690 --> 02:40:11.410]
The worst thing is that, you know, people, it's bad enough seeing them on the city street,

[02:40:11.410 --> 02:40:12.910]
but people have got them in their yards.

[02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:13.210]
Yeah.

[02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:14.710]
I mean, that's just tasteless.

[02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:15.110]
Right.

[02:40:15.450 --> 02:40:17.090]
So I'll meet you there and we'll kick them all down.

[02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:17.550]
All right.

[02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:18.430]
Love you, man.

[02:40:18.610 --> 02:40:18.910]
See you.

[02:40:19.230 --> 02:40:20.650]
See you at that big pool tomorrow, baby.

[02:40:20.810 --> 02:40:22.050]
Everybody get out the old big pool.

[02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:24.350]
Well, I need a Roger's boy.

[02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:27.470]
We're going to dissuade him from being on the air because he's got all his influence

[02:40:27.470 --> 02:40:29.730]
that we're, and you know, the best part of that whole deal.

[02:40:30.350 --> 02:40:33.570]
I mean, forget about Tom, chicken, Kevin, back to these people and you know, little

[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:38.030]
leagers in the newspapers here like, they're journalists like my dog is a brain surgeon.

[02:40:38.770 --> 02:40:42.430]
But the fact of the matter is with all the power of the national media, the Fox News

[02:40:42.430 --> 02:40:45.210]
that were impotent, impotent.

[02:40:45.430 --> 02:40:46.230]
Nobody gives a crap.

[02:40:46.890 --> 02:40:48.530]
All you carpet baggers out there, you outsiders.

[02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:50.170]
I think you're going to stick your nose in this market.

[02:40:50.170 --> 02:40:52.370]
I've been on the air here for 400 years, okay?

[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:53.370]
Longer than Dracula.

[02:40:54.970 --> 02:40:57.310]
So don't give me a song and an answer about what the erudges is.

[02:40:57.310 --> 02:40:58.570]
This and the erudges that.

[02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:01.810]
Oh, and also the fact I had before said up until this day and never knew it.

[02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:02.910]
It was Barzini all along.

[02:41:03.610 --> 02:41:06.170]
I'm going to slap that out after they ripped the hell out of a guilty.

[02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:10.070]
Yeah, that guilty boy and tomorrow, because Mo is going to be up there in Green Bay

[02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:13.650]
doing a game tonight, making sure that mad dog don't get to speak too much.

[02:41:13.890 --> 02:41:17.190]
But anyway, so guilty beyond again, solo tomorrow, squealing his way through the morning

[02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.430]
show.

[02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:22.170]
Let's see tomorrow at nine o'clock, okay, when we do the crossover, I'll bet you any amount

[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:23.890]
of money you want that he will not mention my name.

[02:41:24.990 --> 02:41:25.890]
I won't take that bet.

[02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:28.830]
You can be nuts because he is verboten, man.

[02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:30.970]
It's under penalty of death that he mentions my name.

[02:41:30.990 --> 02:41:32.950]
He's out just like the beast against her will not.

[02:41:33.890 --> 02:41:35.330]
I give you about a thousand to one.

[02:41:35.370 --> 02:41:36.910]
Okay, I know you'll take a dollar with that.

[02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:39.450]
And then you'll split it with guilty.

[02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:40.330]
You're not fooling me.

[02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:42.430]
You're not fooling me.

[02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:44.050]
I see you and they're consorting with him.

[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:48.690]
443 votes on our pool.

[02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:52.270]
155 people say this election tomorrow is very important.

[02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:53.650]
35% very important.

[02:41:54.430 --> 02:41:55.610]
I'm voting but not excited.

[02:41:55.970 --> 02:41:56.370]
121.

[02:41:56.470 --> 02:41:57.410]
Well, at least they're voting.

[02:41:57.670 --> 02:42:02.030]
Okay, they're not that highly motivated because it's a choice between usual crap.

[02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.470]
You're right.

[02:42:02.850 --> 02:42:04.110]
I'm not saying Bill McBride is crap.

[02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:06.290]
In fact, the one great thing Bill McBride's got to vote for me.

[02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:06.770]
You know what it is?

[02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:08.210]
He's not Jeb.

[02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:09.030]
He's not Jeb Bush.

[02:42:09.210 --> 02:42:09.510]
Very good.

[02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:11.650]
Steven, even little George knows that.

[02:42:11.650 --> 02:42:12.970]
That's the best thing he's got going for me.

[02:42:13.050 --> 02:42:13.530]
Jeb Bush.

[02:42:14.390 --> 02:42:15.590]
Well, it's life and death tomorrow.

[02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:16.030]
69.

[02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:18.010]
That's what it says.

[02:42:18.130 --> 02:42:18.650]
Look on a pool.

[02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:19.330]
It says 69.

[02:42:19.690 --> 02:42:20.150]
Life and death.

[02:42:21.170 --> 02:42:22.650]
I'm not voting why bother 66.

[02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:26.070]
Oh, if we had another 6 and what me worry 34.

[02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:27.750]
I think we'd left an option out.

[02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:28.370]
What's that?

[02:42:28.470 --> 02:42:30.130]
Like Robi Young says, we're all doomed.

[02:42:31.310 --> 02:42:32.270]
We already know that.

[02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:34.670]
How's Robi doing, by the way?

[02:42:35.050 --> 02:42:35.370]
26.

[02:42:36.270 --> 02:42:38.070]
Oh, and don't let me forget.

[02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:40.530]
One day this week because I didn't do it on Friday.

[02:42:40.530 --> 02:42:42.630]
One day this week I found some more really great stuff.

[02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:44.130]
I love that.

[02:42:44.470 --> 02:42:45.210]
I love that stuff.

[02:42:45.430 --> 02:42:46.090]
It was great.

[02:42:46.410 --> 02:42:46.770]
Yeah.

[02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:47.050]
You missed it.

[02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:48.270]
You missed what?

[02:42:48.810 --> 02:42:49.750]
Didn't you do more last week?

[02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:49.930]
No.

[02:42:50.130 --> 02:42:50.850]
Oh, I forgot.

[02:42:51.010 --> 02:42:51.790]
I didn't want to press it.

[02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:55.810]
But over the weekend at home, I dittled around on the thing and found some more really

[02:42:55.810 --> 02:42:56.310]
good stuff.

[02:42:57.190 --> 02:43:00.610]
So we'll get some more of that on because you know, it takes us back in the days when

[02:43:00.610 --> 02:43:02.350]
we actually had a few freedoms in this country.

[02:43:02.350 --> 02:43:04.230]
We run by a bunch of right-wing lunatics.

[02:43:05.470 --> 02:43:06.790]
26 past noon at 5.

[02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:08.090]
60 WQAM.

[02:43:08.230 --> 02:43:08.930]
Hey, let me tell you.

[02:43:08.930 --> 02:43:10.710]
You're matri-shopping the old traditional way.

[02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:14.230]
That's one thing the new way is better than the old way because the new way means you don't

[02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.750]
leave the house.

[02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:18.870]
All you do is sit there on your fat lazy ass, shove and cheetos down your push and make

[02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:19.570]
one easy call.

[02:43:20.010 --> 02:43:20.990]
1-800-MATRUS.

[02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.890]
1-800-MATRUS.

[02:43:22.890 --> 02:43:24.230]
You'll talk to people to know they're crap.

[02:43:24.370 --> 02:43:25.410]
They know betting inside and out.

[02:43:25.490 --> 02:43:27.230]
They know every mattress that's ever been invented.

[02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:28.590]
And they aren't going to study any crap.

[02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:29.450]
No off-brands.

[02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:31.590]
They carry only the top brands in the world.

[02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:34.410]
SIRTA, SELE, SIMON'S, KING QUIL, you get the drift.

[02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:36.350]
And no other store can match their selection.

[02:43:36.350 --> 02:43:37.230]
They're simply no prices.

[02:43:37.230 --> 02:43:40.710]
And because they got the deepest selection brand name, new mattresses, they don't ever

[02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:41.810]
give you the old bait and swathe.

[02:43:42.090 --> 02:43:43.870]
Peppily a mattress you didn't really want in the first place.

[02:43:43.890 --> 02:43:48.050]
Exactly the one you're looking for, the size, the style, whatever is in stock ready for

[02:43:48.050 --> 02:43:49.090]
nearly immediate delivery.

[02:43:49.530 --> 02:43:52.030]
And after you hang up that phone, they'll be there knocking on the door whenever you want

[02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:58.770]
with an N22R window you like between 1214 and 217 and 317 and 422 and 620, etc.

[02:43:59.210 --> 02:44:01.790]
And they give you the 30 day in-home comfort guarantee to check it out the real way.

[02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:05.590]
Do the smart thing like I've been doing for a long time and Miguel finally got around

[02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.990]
to it now.

[02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:07.790]
He's got a big smile on his face and we know why.

[02:44:08.130 --> 02:44:13.850]
Called Battle mattress, 1-800-MATRUS, 1-800-MATRES, or you can also check them out on that

[02:44:13.850 --> 02:44:16.470]
worldwide web if you like at mattress.com.

[02:44:16.570 --> 02:44:18.170]
My name is Michael.

[02:44:18.770 --> 02:44:22.610]
This is Fort Real 560, you ain't how you a-

[02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.770]
Yeah.

[02:44:24.330 --> 02:44:26.490]
But the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:44:26.810 --> 02:44:28.810]
Nobody repulses you more.

[02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:30.210]
Oh, that is what I was going to play.

[02:44:31.090 --> 02:44:34.030]
I'm sitting here and I have the wrong goddamn thing queued up.

[02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:35.150]
It was supposed to be.

[02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:38.750]
By the time I get through the next couple of minutes, she is going to have to pick every

[02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:42.450]
scab off that putrid, pus-filled body of hers, all right?

[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:45.830]
Nobody rips you better.

[02:44:46.850 --> 02:44:50.370]
So I'm going crazy on this, yes, because this has got to stop.

[02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:52.670]
You make me sick, Pat, you bitch!

[02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.550]
God!

[02:44:54.170 --> 02:44:56.390]
How is it possible to be so stupid, Pat?

[02:44:56.670 --> 02:45:01.550]
Nobody rips you and I stop good at Neil.

[02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:03.370]
Who idiot you asshole you?

[02:45:04.810 --> 02:45:06.330]
Baby, he's the boy.

[02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:09.730]
Well, sing this, you fat slob.

[02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:12.970]
I'm going to take this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his ass, okay?

[02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:17.470]
And I'm going to shove this thing so far up his butt that he's going to be singing a different

[02:45:17.470 --> 02:45:18.530]
tune when I get through with him.

[02:45:18.970 --> 02:45:20.690]
But we have a longer cord than this piece of crap.

[02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:21.270]
Look at this.

[02:45:21.350 --> 02:45:22.730]
Look how short this damn thing is.

[02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:24.930]
We got a hundred assholes running around this building.

[02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:27.930]
They can find another one besides him, although maybe not that big.

[02:45:28.570 --> 02:45:29.990]
Go get it out of there.

[02:45:30.130 --> 02:45:31.330]
Go pull it cord somewhere.

[02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:32.370]
Go do something.

[02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:35.710]
Pull a lot in your case a good question, okay?

[02:45:36.090 --> 02:45:36.310]
God.

[02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:39.450]
Nobody rips you, bro.

[02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:44.370]
Don't start looking once again as always to blame Fatal Neil for whatever you're upset

[02:45:44.370 --> 02:45:44.750]
about.

[02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:48.770]
You disgusting, nauseating old slobs.

[02:45:49.690 --> 02:45:53.550]
Nobody rips you and I stop that.

[02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:55.730]
Old, crappy old bitches.

[02:45:56.110 --> 02:45:58.150]
Neil, if you don't repent, you're going to split your body.

[02:45:58.450 --> 02:45:59.010]
You're from here.

[02:45:59.010 --> 02:45:59.110]
You're from here.

[02:45:59.110 --> 02:46:00.290]
Yeah, I'm going to split it wide open.

[02:46:00.290 --> 02:46:01.350]
You're going to split wide open.

[02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:02.570]
You're a skull with a mallet.

[02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:03.550]
You stupid old bitch.

[02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:05.070]
There we go.

[02:46:05.430 --> 02:46:06.250]
Now we're cooking.

[02:46:10.470 --> 02:46:12.670]
What did I just get through talking about?

[02:46:12.810 --> 02:46:13.530]
It was old bag.

[02:46:13.850 --> 02:46:15.090]
We don't watch you, Lenny.

[02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:16.850]
Okay, go get some knitting outs.

[02:46:16.970 --> 02:46:18.330]
Go find some crossword puzzles.

[02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:22.750]
Go get something like a burger minimal would be good.

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:24.650]
It's 1232 to 560.

[02:46:24.730 --> 02:46:26.330]
Boy, what got me all whipped up then?

[02:46:26.470 --> 02:46:26.490]
Huh?

[02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:27.950]
Must have been on some really heavy duty stuff.

[02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:29.690]
How come we don't have any more of that stuff anymore?

[02:46:30.330 --> 02:46:30.930]
What stuff?

[02:46:31.390 --> 02:46:35.270]
Whenever I was on that day that she got all that stuff off of on that tape.

[02:46:35.970 --> 02:46:40.390]
Anyway, Neil, you said a new salary standard when Jim Paxon, Jim Paxon, I think he made

[02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:47.650]
a buddy bug Paxon, tried to go you down to WIOD and Q, WMQ, WMQ's in Chicago.

[02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:49.790]
Well, he's got a little dyslexical problem here.

[02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:51.770]
I'll pay you what you obviously are worth.

[02:46:51.810 --> 02:46:52.750]
No one held a gun to their head.

[02:46:53.070 --> 02:46:53.690]
Probably should have.

[02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:55.590]
All the other downstairs should worship you.

[02:46:55.730 --> 02:46:56.210]
Oh, yeah.

[02:46:56.830 --> 02:46:57.730]
Should they worship me?

[02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:58.570]
Jesus Christ.

[02:46:58.570 --> 02:47:02.530]
Jim Madd is now uses Howard Davis, New York's decadre style technique of saying the last word

[02:47:02.530 --> 02:47:03.630]
of a sentence quickly or clipping it.

[02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:04.770]
He now sounds like a pro.

[02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.730]
Huh?

[02:47:06.130 --> 02:47:08.110]
We've voted many cities without a thought of any problem.

[02:47:08.170 --> 02:47:10.930]
The election process in Florida must be contrived to be disconcusing.

[02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:13.030]
No, we just have a lot of dumb people who can't do it right.

[02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:15.370]
They don't have to work and try it.

[02:47:15.970 --> 02:47:16.510]
Here's another one.

[02:47:16.570 --> 02:47:19.310]
Tracy and Kendall, let me submit my vote for a survey category not listed.

[02:47:19.650 --> 02:47:20.510]
I voted on 1031.

[02:47:20.850 --> 02:47:21.770]
I'm not only worried.

[02:47:21.870 --> 02:47:23.330]
I'm certain my vote won't be counted.

[02:47:24.690 --> 02:47:28.150]
November 5th, like you say, is windowed resting for the scandal that's already in place.

[02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:29.990]
God help us all down here in Florida.

[02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:33.390]
PS is that Vokabrion singing at Pizza Bobblehead commercial.

[02:47:33.390 --> 02:47:36.210]
You run or come like him and happy birthday, sister.

[02:47:36.290 --> 02:47:37.070]
Tracy, thanks, Tracy.

[02:47:38.410 --> 02:47:40.010]
A lot of good faces today.

[02:47:40.090 --> 02:47:41.770]
Everybody seems to be in a pretty good chipper mood.

[02:47:42.130 --> 02:47:43.510]
Markets way up like I told you.

[02:47:43.570 --> 02:47:44.230]
I'll contrived.

[02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:44.610]
All phony.

[02:47:44.610 --> 02:47:45.450]
I'll be manipulated.

[02:47:45.810 --> 02:47:46.770]
Mass decks up 57.

[02:47:46.770 --> 02:47:48.270]
The S&P is up 22.

[02:47:48.850 --> 02:47:49.430]
Based on nothing.

[02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:53.950]
Based on the fact that a lot of people, a lot of money and a lot of power to gain and

[02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:57.050]
a lot to lose if they don't are dicking around with that thing.

[02:47:57.870 --> 02:48:00.970]
Of course, what we shouldn't know in a long time ago, about several hundred thousand dollars

[02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:03.990]
ago in some of our cases, with there always been dicking around with it.

[02:48:05.130 --> 02:48:07.290]
A big fat phony fraud.

[02:48:07.530 --> 02:48:09.170]
Just ask the folks over there on the gambling channel.

[02:48:10.350 --> 02:48:14.510]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[02:48:15.090 --> 02:48:15.790]
WDQA and hello.

[02:48:16.210 --> 02:48:16.430]
Neil.

[02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:17.010]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:17.010 --> 02:48:17.970]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:48:18.130 --> 02:48:18.730]
All right.

[02:48:18.990 --> 02:48:23.790]
Yeah, I'm one of those millions, one of those million people that are kind of pissed off.

[02:48:24.250 --> 02:48:26.350]
I think the hurricane is being screwed.

[02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:26.950]
OK, good.

[02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:28.910]
Call up Joe Zagaki and discuss it with him.

[02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:29.510]
OK, moron.

[02:48:30.430 --> 02:48:31.770]
The hurricane's in the BCS.

[02:48:32.050 --> 02:48:32.410]
The hurricane.

[02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:32.950]
Oh, brother.

[02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:34.950]
I hear that stuff on this radio station.

[02:48:34.970 --> 02:48:36.430]
It makes me want to just get out of gun.

[02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:38.390]
Not pull my own brains out just a few others.

[02:48:38.390 --> 02:48:39.610]
You know, just to make me feel better.

[02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:42.930]
We're getting screwed with the BCS.

[02:48:43.410 --> 02:48:44.450]
That's floater for you, man.

[02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:47.970]
That's the important stuff is the noles, the coons and the geaters.

[02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:49.130]
That's the important stuff.

[02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:51.990]
This whole state should be just one big trailer park.

[02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.470]
You know what?

[02:48:52.690 --> 02:48:53.490]
That's what it should be.

[02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.870]
It isn't.

[02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:59.950]
Well, I mean, I was going to say you got the condo commandos and the trailer parks.

[02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:01.430]
Other net that's pretty much it.

[02:49:02.890 --> 02:49:07.990]
Just a bunch of Yehuz man and old febrals, senile people driving around in the big

[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.750]
jucanous man.

[02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:09.530]
Not to make you gag.

[02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:12.610]
The hurricane's being screwed.

[02:49:12.610 --> 02:49:13.210]
Good.

[02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:15.290]
W-Q-I-M.

[02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:16.190]
Yeah.

[02:49:16.370 --> 02:49:17.470]
Hey, thanks for taking the call.

[02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:18.490]
Thanks for making your call.

[02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:23.270]
Hey, listen, what this McBride thing where they keep bringing up the fire at all these

[02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:24.270]
people in his law firm.

[02:49:24.510 --> 02:49:24.710]
Yeah.

[02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:26.850]
All he did was privatize those positions.

[02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:27.350]
Yeah.

[02:49:27.930 --> 02:49:29.530]
That's what Jed does all the time.

[02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:32.630]
Well, first of all, what does that have to do with anything when you come right down?

[02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:33.350]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:38.790]
Well, that means that he can take and the jobs that he was paying except all those salaries

[02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:40.130]
for in his own law firm.

[02:49:40.130 --> 02:49:40.350]
Yeah.

[02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:44.850]
He took and he hired out and had those very same services provided for lower cost.

[02:49:45.170 --> 02:49:45.370]
Yeah.

[02:49:45.650 --> 02:49:50.130]
Which is what Jed keeps saying he does when he does all that stuff that he gets his friends

[02:49:50.130 --> 02:49:50.910]
to bid in on.

[02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.130]
Right.

[02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:53.010]
You mean like the F-Cat test with Neil Bush?

[02:49:53.310 --> 02:49:53.590]
Oh, sure.

[02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:59.170]
Anyway, I'm trying to go to vote this afternoon and maybe I can go again tomorrow.

[02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:00.230]
Please, two or three times.

[02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:00.670]
Thank you.

[02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.790]
Thank you.

[02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.230]
Okay.

[02:50:01.690 --> 02:50:05.210]
See, that's the idea since you can vote just about every day now for the last whatever

[02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:05.610]
it's been.

[02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:07.350]
Just go today and then go back again tomorrow.

[02:50:07.370 --> 02:50:08.150]
They'll never know the difference.

[02:50:08.930 --> 02:50:12.810]
I wonder if they got any younger poll workers this year to think because I mean that thing

[02:50:12.810 --> 02:50:13.810]
we had two years ago.

[02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:17.770]
It wasn't just the fact that all the machines were screwed up and the punch cards and the

[02:50:17.770 --> 02:50:18.430]
chads and all that.

[02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:20.570]
But the people manning the goddamn voting.

[02:50:20.890 --> 02:50:26.070]
Oh, older than in fact, I think that woman she must have been on her way to her job.

[02:50:26.530 --> 02:50:29.490]
Her pull a worker job yesterday that old bag in the Cadillac.

[02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:31.150]
Good.

[02:50:31.330 --> 02:50:32.070]
Golly Miss Molly.

[02:50:32.310 --> 02:50:33.990]
I'm sitting there and I'm screaming.

[02:50:34.530 --> 02:50:35.510]
I don't know if you do that.

[02:50:35.770 --> 02:50:37.510]
I'm like a crazy person.

[02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:41.190]
I'm screaming as I go past and I see who's driving that vehicle released who's behind

[02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.470]
the wheel.

[02:50:41.470 --> 02:50:43.410]
I mean driving would be an exaggeration.

[02:50:43.470 --> 02:50:46.370]
And I'm saying, what are you doing in that car?

[02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:47.610]
Why are you on this road?

[02:50:47.610 --> 02:50:48.970]
You crazy old bitch.

[02:50:50.030 --> 02:50:50.310]
Polo.

[02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:55.590]
And seriously, I someday what I would love to do only in probably getting a wreck.

[02:50:55.870 --> 02:50:59.170]
I would love to do is just whip right in front of them, slam on the break and force them

[02:50:59.170 --> 02:51:01.350]
to stop and say, get out of the car right now.

[02:51:01.570 --> 02:51:02.790]
You can use my cell phone.

[02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:03.170]
Here it is.

[02:51:03.230 --> 02:51:04.170]
I'll make the call for you.

[02:51:04.170 --> 02:51:08.590]
Give me the keys and take a cab or have somebody come and pick you up and bring an extra

[02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:09.670]
person to drive that thing away.

[02:51:09.810 --> 02:51:10.490]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:11.190]
I'll I don't.

[02:51:11.230 --> 02:51:11.770]
You have it.

[02:51:11.770 --> 02:51:13.150]
You cannot be driving.

[02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:13.590]
Okay.

[02:51:13.810 --> 02:51:17.830]
You cannot be in a vehicle that is moving unless somebody else is driving it.

[02:51:18.810 --> 02:51:19.170]
Good.

[02:51:19.470 --> 02:51:20.150]
God Almighty.

[02:51:21.210 --> 02:51:22.870]
And those are the people that run this state.

[02:51:22.970 --> 02:51:24.090]
That's why we're in the mess that we're in.

[02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:26.590]
The gay, the a great commandos.

[02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:28.850]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:30.670]
Hello, Neil.

[02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:31.210]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:32.010]
Hey.

[02:51:32.290 --> 02:51:32.990]
Next thing I call.

[02:51:33.270 --> 02:51:33.930]
That was a nice bit.

[02:51:33.930 --> 02:51:35.750]
What was that like at the gas station at Bell?

[02:51:36.450 --> 02:51:38.250]
That was my car just started out.

[02:51:38.450 --> 02:51:38.930]
I love it.

[02:51:39.130 --> 02:51:39.530]
Oh, I see.

[02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:40.950]
It was like the seatbelt bell.

[02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:41.810]
Exactly.

[02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.310]
Great.

[02:51:43.170 --> 02:51:49.910]
Hey, I was just voted on the net about an hour ago and I would jump to the Q-A-M website

[02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:52.150]
and see what they put in there for you.

[02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:54.030]
Where did they get that picture of you?

[02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:57.790]
That was like they took it under police lights or something.

[02:51:57.850 --> 02:51:58.390]
Yeah, they did.

[02:51:59.050 --> 02:51:59.710]
On the beach.

[02:52:01.490 --> 02:52:02.150]
Well, that was it.

[02:52:02.310 --> 02:52:02.810]
Okay, thanks.

[02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:06.490]
I think I've bad pictures here, but I look lovely compared to the one of Moe

[02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:07.590]
that I did animal on his head.

[02:52:08.850 --> 02:52:09.870]
That is my favorite.

[02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:11.610]
If you haven't seen that, go to Q-A-M.com.

[02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:12.430]
Now, it's not under.

[02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:13.370]
What is it under?

[02:52:13.950 --> 02:52:14.310]
Hosts.

[02:52:14.390 --> 02:52:14.890]
Is it under hosts?

[02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:15.410]
Yes.

[02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:18.570]
And check that picture out and notice the sideburns are one color.

[02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:22.010]
And the whatever that creature is in the middle must have been his off day.

[02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:23.570]
You know, he must not have had the good piece on that day.

[02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:27.910]
I still can't believe you tell me he's got different, different two pays for different days.

[02:52:28.610 --> 02:52:28.810]
Right?

[02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.630]
Like different shoes.

[02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:31.470]
A two pay for every day.

[02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.390]
Mix.

[02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:35.990]
Not too pay for every day makes you look gay.

[02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.430]
Yeah.

[02:52:36.930 --> 02:52:37.290]
Wow.

[02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:38.270]
And what is not so good?

[02:52:38.450 --> 02:52:38.810]
What do you say?

[02:52:39.250 --> 02:52:43.230]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and for rising line.

[02:52:43.470 --> 02:52:47.110]
We're getting out of here one o'clock to make room for 8,000 hours of pregame festivities,

[02:52:47.370 --> 02:52:49.110]
starting with the incredibly terminal.

[02:52:49.730 --> 02:52:51.150]
He'll be on for the mad dog at one.

[02:52:51.250 --> 02:52:55.290]
I'll tell you having Joseph Gackey on for Jim Mandage is like having it would be like

[02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:57.730]
having I'm trying to think of a comparison.

[02:52:57.730 --> 02:53:00.910]
Would be like having George W. Bush replace Bill Clinton as president.

[02:53:01.650 --> 02:53:02.190]
There you go.

[02:53:02.310 --> 02:53:02.730]
Good analogy.

[02:53:02.850 --> 02:53:04.210]
Yeah, I think it's very apt.

[02:53:06.170 --> 02:53:07.410]
21 to 1, a QA.

[02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:08.410]
Hey, Joe, they're a good job.

[02:53:08.490 --> 02:53:09.470]
He's at least he's a good guy.

[02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:10.350]
Okay, it's not personal.

[02:53:10.350 --> 02:53:11.130]
Joe, it's just business.

[02:53:11.290 --> 02:53:12.070]
You just pondress.

[02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:15.410]
And then of course, the thing with those hurricane games on a radio, I heard him one game

[02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:15.970]
a little bit.

[02:53:16.390 --> 02:53:19.870]
I was in the car just screaming and yelling to compensate for his boredom.

[02:53:19.930 --> 02:53:21.850]
You know, screaming and screeching.

[02:53:22.410 --> 02:53:23.370]
Just calm down.

[02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:25.990]
Joe, the last thing we need on this station is another screamer.

[02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:27.450]
Hey, let's face it.

[02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:31.570]
You've been hearing us talk about fast train for a very, very long time for a CUNESA.

[02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:32.470]
Joe, sorry, Mr. Gibson.

[02:53:33.090 --> 02:53:33.750]
The facts are simple.

[02:53:33.850 --> 02:53:36.610]
If you have the dedication, fast train will provide you with an necessary train to become

[02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:38.450]
a certified computer professional.

[02:53:38.850 --> 02:53:42.650]
According to Time Magazine and they know their crap at time, the demand for a certified

[02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:45.130]
computer professionals will continue to get bigger and explode.

[02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:47.830]
Their average student completes the training in just for sure.

[02:53:47.930 --> 02:53:49.210]
Months attending school three nights a week.

[02:53:49.470 --> 02:53:52.930]
Once you complete your certification, fast train will assist you in getting you a great

[02:53:52.930 --> 02:53:53.790]
new computer job.

[02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:57.210]
Fast train invites you to come in, visit their train career counselor, and determine

[02:53:57.210 --> 02:53:58.790]
which track is ideal for you.

[02:53:59.150 --> 02:54:01.990]
Mo'Hawk, Woodvine, South of Downs, or Batavia Downs.

[02:54:02.210 --> 02:54:06.310]
Call fast train, tool free at 1-866, fast train to set up an appointment, and of course

[02:54:06.310 --> 02:54:09.030]
with four convenient locations is bound to be one nearby you.

[02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:11.510]
Kendall, Miami, Pembroke, Pines, and Ford Lauderdale.

[02:54:11.550 --> 02:54:15.050]
No forget has the career counselor for a long list of students just like yourself or

[02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:18.490]
currently their dream jobs, making the big bucks with the training they got at fast

[02:54:18.490 --> 02:54:18.890]
train.

[02:54:19.230 --> 02:54:20.990]
So what do you got to lose with that dead end job?

[02:54:20.990 --> 02:54:26.150]
Call them today, tool free, and tell them that old Neil 20 to call fast train 1-866,

[02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:26.930]
fast train.

[02:54:27.170 --> 02:54:32.850]
That's 1-866, fast train, or check them out on the web at fast train you got it dot com.

[02:54:33.070 --> 02:54:37.650]
My big local, this is 65 cities, the radio's all yours.

[02:54:38.810 --> 02:54:39.730]
Q&A!

[02:54:48.110 --> 02:54:53.050]
Ladies, there's nothing worse than a stinky smell emanating from way down there.

[02:54:54.090 --> 02:54:58.690]
Oh, believe me, your love tunnel can get that way pretty fast from improper care.

[02:54:58.950 --> 02:55:02.950]
So if you want to clean, prim and proper love canal, you need to use Cliterox.

[02:55:03.370 --> 02:55:08.210]
It's the industrial strength wedge cleaner, and it comes in a variety of flavors to please

[02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.430]
him.

[02:55:08.430 --> 02:55:11.890]
Hmm, strawberry, my favorite.

[02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:14.950]
Hold your horses big guy.

[02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:21.050]
So if you want to clean fragrant love subway, get Cliterox because soap and water just isn't

[02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:21.310]
enough.

[02:55:21.730 --> 02:55:22.590]
Now where were we?

[02:55:23.930 --> 02:55:23.930]

[02:55:28.470 --> 02:55:29.730]
244562, I'm here.

[02:55:29.730 --> 02:55:32.030]
This is from the independent observer UK.

[02:55:32.730 --> 02:55:37.110]
It says America tackles the real issues, pot pregnant pigs and cock fights.

[02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:42.490]
You know about the pig about the pigment number 10, breed the best.

[02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:45.250]
Well, let's make sure we protect those pigs, okay?

[02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:48.930]
Also known as the Rosie O'Donnell amendment on the ballot tomorrow.

[02:55:49.390 --> 02:55:50.010]
Protect the pigs.

[02:55:52.410 --> 02:55:54.630]
491 votes on a poll were pushing the 500 mark.

[02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:57.910]
Don't forget we got the dolphins and Bart star on a green bay packers tonight.

[02:55:57.910 --> 02:56:02.130]
I think Max McGee is going to come back and make a big catch.

[02:56:02.290 --> 02:56:02.930]
Max McGee is dead.

[02:56:03.070 --> 02:56:03.370]
I think.

[02:56:03.470 --> 02:56:03.810]
Yeah.

[02:56:04.210 --> 02:56:05.410]
He's going to make a big catch.

[02:56:05.950 --> 02:56:09.130]
Who was the great line middle line backer from the green bay packers for those glory

[02:56:09.130 --> 02:56:09.390]
days?

[02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.950]
What was the name?

[02:56:10.890 --> 02:56:10.970]
Chuck.

[02:56:11.810 --> 02:56:12.610]
Come on.

[02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:13.310]
Chuck.

[02:56:13.610 --> 02:56:14.290]
Not yet.

[02:56:14.530 --> 02:56:15.090]
Chuck Naubleau.

[02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.330]
Right.

[02:56:16.030 --> 02:56:16.330]
Chuck Noel.

[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:17.210]
No, seriously.

[02:56:17.350 --> 02:56:17.970]
What was his name?

[02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:19.910]
The great Paula Flame.

[02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:21.030]
Well, somebody will call it.

[02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:23.970]
WDQIM.

[02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:25.630]
Ray Netski.

[02:56:25.630 --> 02:56:26.330]
Ray Netski.

[02:56:26.430 --> 02:56:26.890]
Thank you.

[02:56:27.330 --> 02:56:28.930]
Anyway, you're doing good.

[02:56:29.230 --> 02:56:31.710]
You're doing your part on the election.

[02:56:31.850 --> 02:56:33.030]
That's all you can do.

[02:56:33.130 --> 02:56:33.230]
Yes.

[02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:35.070]
I'm going to be voting for McBride tomorrow.

[02:56:35.370 --> 02:56:35.490]
Good.

[02:56:35.650 --> 02:56:36.250]
Two three times.

[02:56:36.570 --> 02:56:39.670]
And I'd like to give a quick shout out to some of my buddies on the corner.

[02:56:40.430 --> 02:56:40.870]
67B.

[02:56:41.930 --> 02:56:42.370]
37C.

[02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:43.130]
And 22C.

[02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.850]
All right.

[02:56:45.270 --> 02:56:46.110]
Of the yellow shirt.

[02:56:46.330 --> 02:56:46.610]
OK.

[02:56:48.890 --> 02:56:50.110]
Hey, hi to Ray too.

[02:56:50.210 --> 02:56:53.070]
Was it the track on Saturday night at Pompadal Park?

[02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:54.030]
Probably thinks I'll forget.

[02:56:54.170 --> 02:56:54.870]
Hey, Ray, how you doing?

[02:57:20.770 --> 02:57:21.770]
I'm fine.

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.770]

[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:21.990]
I'm fine.

[02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.590]
I'm fine.

[02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.990]
I'm fine.

[02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.290]
I'm fine.

[02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:24.410]
I'm fine.

[02:57:24.410 --> 02:57:24.410]

[02:57:24.410 --> 02:57:24.850]
I'm fine.

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:24.850]

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:24.850]

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:24.850]

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:24.850]

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:24.850]

[02:57:25.350 --> 02:57:26.390]
I'll be just French.

[02:57:26.530 --> 02:57:26.770]
I did.

[02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:29.550]
Come on, Mo.

[02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:31.370]
You can hear the long distance there.

[02:57:31.450 --> 02:57:31.690]
Couldn't you?

[02:57:31.950 --> 02:57:33.790]
You can do that, I'm on the tone, that hum job.

[02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:36.110]
It's time to get it on.

[02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.830]
Get out of here.

[02:57:38.090 --> 02:57:39.190]
Oh, Ray Netski is what he said.

[02:57:39.230 --> 02:57:39.750]
Yeah, Ray Netski.

[02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:41.050]
That was instant response.

[02:57:41.270 --> 02:57:42.630]
See, that's because we got the football crowd.

[02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:43.730]
Listen to this radio station.

[02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:45.030]
Ray Netski, man.

[02:57:45.290 --> 02:57:45.730]
Not Chuck.

[02:57:46.050 --> 02:57:46.530]
Ray Netski.

[02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:47.410]
And of course, Ray Scott.

[02:57:48.490 --> 02:57:49.830]
Anybody remember the great broadcaster?

[02:57:50.370 --> 02:57:51.830]
Ray Scott had a little bit of a problem.

[02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:53.230]
He wasn't any more Howard though.

[02:57:53.930 --> 02:57:54.930]
Everybody, QIN.

[02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:57.710]
QIN.

[02:57:58.310 --> 02:57:58.830]
Hello, Neil.

[02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:59.370]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:57:59.510 --> 02:58:01.170]
Hi, I'm the first lady of the day.

[02:58:01.630 --> 02:58:02.890]
Happy birthday tomorrow.

[02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.490]
Thank you.

[02:58:03.490 --> 02:58:06.810]
And did you know it's a very special day in England of fireworks today?

[02:58:07.130 --> 02:58:07.390]
Really?

[02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:07.850]
Yes.

[02:58:08.270 --> 02:58:09.830]
It's the Guy Forks day.

[02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:11.430]
I bet you're pregnant.

[02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:15.270]
Every year on November with the kids by firework.

[02:58:15.330 --> 02:58:16.290]
See for fireworks.

[02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:19.670]
And everybody has bonfires in the backyard.

[02:58:20.350 --> 02:58:22.910]
And it celebrates Guy Forks who tried to buy the world.

[02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:23.170]
Guy Forks.

[02:58:23.170 --> 02:58:23.210]
Yeah, I know.

[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.210]

[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.210]

[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.210]

[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.210]

[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.210]

[02:58:24.730 --> 02:58:25.430]
Oh, okay.

[02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:29.070]
He tried to blow up the houses of parlor for this at 1600.

[02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:30.130]
I'll be there.

[02:58:30.130 --> 02:58:32.070]
And they found them at the gunpowder.

[02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:33.870]
Oh, no, there's Gary Bauer.

[02:58:34.030 --> 02:58:34.630]
I'm sort of going ahead.

[02:58:34.650 --> 02:58:37.230]
They found the gunpowder and they executed him.

[02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:41.210]
And so every November, this is fireworks day.

[02:58:41.410 --> 02:58:41.810]
I'll be there.

[02:58:42.030 --> 02:58:43.230]
So happy birthday, please.

[02:58:43.230 --> 02:58:43.730]
Thanks a lot.

[02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:44.450]
Thank you, Bauer.

[02:58:44.470 --> 02:58:45.990]
Okay, they like those queens of it in England.

[02:58:46.110 --> 02:58:47.450]
That's why they blow off the fireworks.

[02:58:47.790 --> 02:58:49.630]
Gary Bauer with a blitzkrieg.

[02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:51.110]
President of American values.

[02:58:51.270 --> 02:58:52.530]
Now as we're having this conversation.

[02:58:52.610 --> 02:58:52.870]
Yeah.

[02:58:54.410 --> 02:58:55.410]
Oh, God.

[02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:59.090]
This is what you want to control America's people like this.

[02:58:59.350 --> 02:59:00.030]
What a nebush.

[02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:01.050]
Oh, my God.

[02:59:01.210 --> 02:59:01.950]
People like this.

[02:59:03.010 --> 02:59:04.990]
This whole crowd of right wing fanatics.

[02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:09.790]
And what have changed it in just 20 years we've gone from these people used to be on the lunatic far right fringe.

[02:59:09.950 --> 02:59:10.490]
We used to call them.

[02:59:10.630 --> 02:59:11.890]
And now they're running the goddamn country.

[02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:14.570]
American values my ass.

[02:59:14.990 --> 02:59:16.350]
And there's Gary Bauer saying it's stake.

[02:59:16.610 --> 02:59:17.270]
Control of Congress.

[02:59:17.430 --> 02:59:17.790]
No crap.

[02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:19.850]
No crap because people like him.

[02:59:19.950 --> 02:59:21.210]
That's all we need is people like him.

[02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:24.990]
And Dr. Kennedy and all these other far busier right wingers to be in control of this government.

[02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:27.470]
All I can tell you folks, a little piece of advice.

[02:59:27.830 --> 02:59:29.830]
Squeeze those passports real tight.

[02:59:30.270 --> 02:59:31.610]
Squeeze it as tight as you can.

[02:59:32.170 --> 02:59:33.150]
Although they might be watching.

[02:59:34.470 --> 02:59:35.610]
It's 11 before 1 at 5.

[02:59:35.710 --> 02:59:36.590]
60 WQM.

[02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:38.630]
You know, traveling today can be a real pain in the ass.

[02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:40.630]
Very stressful, especially when you get to the airport.

[02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.590]
You have to start to look for a place to park.

[02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:46.310]
And then of course when you try to drive into the airport, they stick that the mirror you know under your car.

[02:59:46.310 --> 02:59:48.150]
And they're looking for a lot of bomb and all kinds of stuff.

[02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:51.750]
And if you do find a parking space, it's usually a long slip to where you have to go.

[02:59:52.210 --> 02:59:54.190]
National limos can change all of these things.

[02:59:54.410 --> 02:59:59.130]
They'll arrive at your location on time at a brand new sedan, limousine van, whatever you need, to take you where you have to go.

[02:59:59.230 --> 02:59:59.810]
It's hassle free.

[03:00:00.210 --> 03:00:04.490]

[03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:07.630]

[03:00:19.390 --> 03:00:23.350]
For your sports fans out there, there's no better way to get to and from the game than one of National limos,

[03:00:23.530 --> 03:00:27.870]
super-stretch limousines or luxury coaches, while everybody else is in their cars fighting traffic on each other.

[03:00:28.210 --> 03:00:30.990]
If you're looking for a way to get to the airport, the game are just a night around town.

[03:00:31.430 --> 03:00:34.410]
And maybe you know, having a little celebration, let them do the driving.

[03:00:34.570 --> 03:00:39.370]
National limos call them at toll free 1877-376-3200.

[03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:54.870]
We're sports radio 560-UAM.

[03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:58.970]
Fished with the sewer of this place.

[03:00:59.130 --> 03:01:00.770]
Here's Heather from Fox News.

[03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:02.030]
Hi Niel, how are you?

[03:01:02.190 --> 03:01:03.070]
I'm okay, I think.

[03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:04.330]
Thanks for taking her call.

[03:01:04.410 --> 03:01:05.970]
We've been trying to reach you for the past couple days.

[03:01:05.970 --> 03:01:08.690]
Trying to reach me, you've called people I haven't invented yet.

[03:01:08.750 --> 03:01:11.170]
You called dead relatives of mine. What's the story, Heather?

[03:01:11.410 --> 03:01:15.050]
We are working on a story about the CD you're promoting on your website.

[03:01:15.330 --> 03:01:17.250]
That's called Chissa, I won't say it.

[03:01:17.350 --> 03:01:18.270]
End word, good morning.

[03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:19.570]
Heather, are you listening to the show?

[03:01:20.050 --> 03:01:22.010]
Yes, I am. I've been listening to it for a couple days.

[03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:22.490]
And just see you.

[03:01:22.770 --> 03:01:28.970]
Did you hear me go through the entire rationale of what that song had nothing to do with Candeliza Rice?

[03:01:29.350 --> 03:01:29.650]
Uh-huh.

[03:01:30.330 --> 03:01:32.390]
What about the song Candeliza Candeliza?

[03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:34.810]
That's obviously about Candeliza.

[03:01:34.810 --> 03:01:35.390]
Uh-huh.

[03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:38.290]
And I want to know why you're playing this on your show.

[03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:40.950]
No, I see I'd like to know why.

[03:01:41.250 --> 03:01:42.410]
This is really interesting.

[03:01:42.690 --> 03:01:44.990]
Why are you calling me asking me why I should play this?

[03:01:45.050 --> 03:01:47.710]
We make, we have song parodies about Bill Clinton, dozens of them.

[03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:49.310]
Nobody ever complained about that.

[03:01:49.470 --> 03:01:51.870]
We have song parodies about Al Gore, dozens of them.

[03:01:52.090 --> 03:01:53.330]
Nobody ever complained about those.

[03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:58.010]
Well, there's an African-American folks up here in New York who are pretty offended by it.

[03:01:58.130 --> 03:01:58.910]
Well, wait a minute.

[03:01:59.050 --> 03:02:00.050]
Let me say this to you, Karen.

[03:02:00.310 --> 03:02:01.270]
We're not in New York.

[03:02:01.590 --> 03:02:01.830]
Uh-huh.

[03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:04.510]
Okay, we don't broadcast in New York where I'm WQM in Miami.

[03:02:04.510 --> 03:02:10.430]
And the fact of the matter is that except for people like you and the people at that right-wing newsmax.com,

[03:02:10.430 --> 03:02:14.110]
I want to make a big stimulus about this, if it weren't for that, they wouldn't even be aware that we exist.

[03:02:14.610 --> 03:02:14.810]
Okay.

[03:02:14.810 --> 03:02:19.530]
We open up this organization that's offended by it as a national organization.

[03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:24.430]
But the fact of the fact of the matter is we've been playing these songs for many, many, many months.

[03:02:24.570 --> 03:02:26.450]
We've never had one single complaint.

[03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:32.330]
And when interlopers like you from outside, like from Fox News or from some right-wing website, want to tell us what...

[03:02:32.330 --> 03:02:34.950]
I mean, for you to ask me, how come you're playing that? Because we want to play it.

[03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:38.750]
Okay, Neil, but what's the value in it? What does it...what does it do for you?

[03:02:38.810 --> 03:02:39.790]
It's called comedy.

[03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:42.570]
It's called comedy. That's what it's called. Do you have a sense of humor?

[03:02:42.850 --> 03:02:43.570]
Do you think it's funny?

[03:02:43.870 --> 03:02:45.890]
How, uh, to call Condoleezza right?

[03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:50.910]
In addition, in addition, well, here in Belafonte, he called her the House Negro, okay?

[03:02:50.970 --> 03:02:51.950]
So we'll call her whatever we want.

[03:02:52.050 --> 03:02:53.250]
But this is a little bit different.

[03:02:53.650 --> 03:02:54.550]
No, no, it's not so.

[03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:55.990]
He was taking issue with some of the...

[03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:57.590]
It's not the least bit different.

[03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:58.650]
She is the House Negro.

[03:02:58.810 --> 03:03:00.690]
So you people at Fox may not understand this.

[03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:03.230]
Not everybody in the world is the right-winger like Rupert Murdoch.

[03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:06.630]
There actually are those of us who are progressive or moderate-liberal, whatever we are,

[03:03:06.770 --> 03:03:09.390]
who also have the right to speak to express whatever we want.

[03:03:09.690 --> 03:03:12.550]
So, repeat again what you just said for me there.

[03:03:12.650 --> 03:03:13.650]
You think she is a what?

[03:03:14.350 --> 03:03:15.570]
She's the House Negro.

[03:03:16.470 --> 03:03:16.750]
Uh-huh.

[03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:19.210]
And you don't find anything wrong with that.

[03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:22.570]
Well, what do you mean, you're wrong with that? It's a fact. That's my opinion.

[03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:23.590]
Am I entitled to my opinion?

[03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:25.550]
You're certainly entitled to your opinion.

[03:03:26.010 --> 03:03:31.230]
And that's basically what Harry Belafonte said as well.

[03:03:31.290 --> 03:03:36.070]
And so obviously this is why nobody returned your calls, uh, Heather, or whatever your name is.

[03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:39.790]
Because we knew that you were trying to stir up a bunch of crap and take something out of context.

[03:03:40.090 --> 03:03:40.930]
When I asked you...

[03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:42.550]
I don't think there's anything being taken out of context.

[03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:44.070]
Did you listen? Did you listen?

[03:03:44.390 --> 03:03:44.790]
You were not...

[03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:45.270]
You were not...

[03:03:45.270 --> 03:03:47.370]
We're not doing the Belorali show, okay?

[03:03:47.470 --> 03:03:47.490]
I think I'm not going to talk about that.

[03:03:47.490 --> 03:03:49.410]
It's my show and I'm not going to have you scream over me.

[03:03:49.470 --> 03:03:50.230]
You're trying to out-talk me.

[03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.930]
Okay, it's not going to work.

[03:03:51.170 --> 03:03:51.470]
Okay.

[03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:55.410]
You know, I asked you in the beginning of the conversation, which I was very calm,

[03:03:55.410 --> 03:03:59.270]
and I asked you, did you hear me explain the origin of that song, the restitution song,

[03:03:59.730 --> 03:04:00.990]
the fact of the matter is that I don't know.

[03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:04.450]
I'm sure he must have been on your channel, Randall Kennedy, the Black author who wrote the book,

[03:04:04.610 --> 03:04:06.530]
Nigger, the Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.

[03:04:06.750 --> 03:04:07.750]
Not that I'm aware of.

[03:04:07.830 --> 03:04:11.910]
Well, he was certainly on CNN. He was on MSNBC. Maybe he was on Fox because he wasn't...

[03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:14.050]
I don't know. Maybe he just didn't... weren't aware of it.

[03:04:14.430 --> 03:04:14.670]
Uh-huh.

[03:04:15.630 --> 03:04:16.590]
You know, I've got a question for...

[03:04:16.590 --> 03:04:18.170]
Are you aware of that book?

[03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:21.570]
You portray yourself to be the sort of liberal voice.

[03:04:22.230 --> 03:04:23.090]
But yet, you're...

[03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:25.270]
Man, I don't portray... I don't put labels on me.

[03:04:25.390 --> 03:04:26.770]
I'm... for example, looking...

[03:04:26.770 --> 03:04:28.310]
Okay, what would you call yourself, that's a little...

[03:04:28.310 --> 03:04:33.290]
I echo myself a human being. You see, you people on Fox, it's this old liberal and a conservative...

[03:04:33.290 --> 03:04:35.170]
That stuff went out with high-button shoes, okay.

[03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.670]
You know, hold on a second.

[03:04:35.730 --> 03:04:38.230]
I'm thinking, living and dreaming, you're hoping...

[03:04:38.230 --> 03:04:39.650]
In addition to what...

[03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:39.890]
Yeah, no.

[03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:44.990]
Why do I have to add Miami, Florida, answer to some assholes in New York on Fox News,

[03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:46.830]
how I do my show? What is it, your business?

[03:04:46.830 --> 03:04:49.110]
There are a lot of people who care, and there are people in Miami...

[03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:50.070]
They care about this too.

[03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.690]
Who are they?

[03:04:50.690 --> 03:04:51.650]
You're calling...

[03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:54.450]
Who are they? Name me one person in Miami who's concerned about it.

[03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:56.750]
Both we know down there, certainly, and I've got...

[03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:57.450]
Name me one!

[03:04:57.730 --> 03:04:58.330]
Two. Look.

[03:04:58.490 --> 03:04:59.410]
Name me one.

[03:04:59.670 --> 03:05:00.430]
It's offensive.

[03:05:00.610 --> 03:05:02.010]
Name me one.

[03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:03.110]
Name me one.

[03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:04.030]
Of a very high...

[03:05:04.030 --> 03:05:05.610]
I don't care, I don't care what you say.

[03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:06.470]
And you're calling her.

[03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:08.590]
We don't like Connolid's, okay?

[03:05:08.650 --> 03:05:09.010]
I'm calling her.

[03:05:09.010 --> 03:05:09.950]
Have a nice day, okay?

[03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:12.510]
We're calling her whatever we feel like Connolid's.

[03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:13.810]
She's a public goddamn figure.

[03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:17.830]
And blow it out, you're right when ass and you and Bill,

[03:05:18.030 --> 03:05:19.750]
and by the way, O'Reilly didn't make you number zero.

[03:05:20.430 --> 03:05:20.950]
Connolid.

[03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:29.110]
Connolid, Connolid,

[03:05:29.350 --> 03:05:31.350]
The different movies.

[03:05:32.890 --> 03:05:37.450]
Where's your fucking yellow key so far apart?

[03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:42.070]
Connolid, Connolid,

[03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:44.490]
What you be doing?

[03:05:45.770 --> 03:05:48.350]
Get me a fascist like that,

[03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:50.650]
Coconut, Schwarzer, star.

[03:05:51.730 --> 03:05:57.430]
Is you day because you had to bootly-blit me cold?

[03:05:58.570 --> 03:06:03.790]
Is you deflactin' and jamma-meh-ho be smart?

[03:06:05.250 --> 03:06:06.450]
Does that lie?

[03:06:07.230 --> 03:06:08.030]
Are you shot?

[03:06:08.310 --> 03:06:11.070]
That's you's gonna leave the...

[03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:16.910]
All the way you watch and talk the whitet is cause.

[03:06:18.290 --> 03:06:22.790]
George it's you, you're say he trust you, Connolid.

[03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:29.470]
Who tell our allies on the greedy oil wall?

[03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:36.210]
But then he make you clean all the White House bathrooms.

[03:06:37.210 --> 03:06:42.450]
The couple seems the toilet and then scrub the floor.

[03:06:44.250 --> 03:06:49.630]
They tell you don't wear sandals cause they'll leave though.

[03:06:50.470 --> 03:06:55.850]
Your coach it don't help make them want to wretch at you.

[03:06:56.810 --> 03:07:02.350]
Your mappin' legged look your slide get reveal throw.

[03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:08.670]
It's your pee what you to pee that don't piss you.

[03:07:09.890 --> 03:07:16.030]
One day while you pee flippin' fat cake to me real hard,

[03:07:16.290 --> 03:07:21.750]
That's a treatin' you just like your esterone.

[03:07:22.810 --> 03:07:28.370]
That's when your head will move from side to side, from the leeloo.

[03:07:29.350 --> 03:07:34.730]
It till push and from here they be cracked as old.

[03:07:35.330 --> 03:07:37.470]
Oh I forgot to give him a message too.

[03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:39.590]
Okay, forgot to do that on Friday.

[03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:42.470]
Anyway that's gonna do it, have a great day, both early and often.

[03:07:42.570 --> 03:07:45.790]
We got Joe Zagaki coming up next because well he just did.

[03:07:45.810 --> 03:07:46.610]
Bye bye bye!

[03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:51.470]
Go watch your show on FisingTillNQA and Miami for my nail.

[03:07:51.810 --> 03:07:53.970]
Connolingus and Psychi if we brought us to this.
