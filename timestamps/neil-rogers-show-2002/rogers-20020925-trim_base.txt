[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.080]
this is how Florida's only real

[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.140]
for Sam and Strapman's mold when you're all on it for a lot of day

[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.040]
a piece of black ass croot feature

[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.420]
www.QAM.com

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.500]
Happy Strapman's building

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.120]
quite do everything but he looked like he was fine

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.920]
from what I understand if we were playing

[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.340]
you know if we if we were playing Sunday

[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.400]
there'd be no problem that he could play that's that's

[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.680]
best I know okay with with a new secondary it would

[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.880]
basically you have how long does it take for

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.780]
guys coming together and these are experienced people but

[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.460]
still here's today's stock market preview

[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.360]
experts fear the New York Stock Exchange could open

[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.860]
lower again today after Japan's NK index closed down

[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.420]
1.5% on Japanese investor fears that American investors

[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.540]
fear a drop in US consumer confidence because of fears that the

[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.780]
economy may be in danger because of fears of stock market

[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.220]
investors who fear an interest rate hike

[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.700]
meanwhile in America there's fear that those in Japan who fear the fear of

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.440]
American investors could produce fear in other sectors of the economy

[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.940]
which continues showing signs of recovery

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.420]
Amaraya Kastanzakabaro Diazmo

[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.400]
We'll have more stock market news when something else

[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640]
that's not really happening happens in the heads of people who just

[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.920]
happened to be afraid of everything that happens

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.780]
I don't be afraid I fear it okay because the more the

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.100]
future's erupt I'm gonna make a big comeback in it

[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.360]
gonna make a jug and a comeback plunging in with both hands that's what I

[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.060]
would tell you I'm not doing it but you go ahead

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.660]
so anyway uh let me just say this right off the bat Todd

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.300]
records an asshole can I get that out of the way right off the bat okay

[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.180]
see let me just tell you this Todd when you're sitting back there at your

[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.740]
little typewriter and your little desk see everything with him is

[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.580]
little the guys about two feet tall it comes up to

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.260]
George's knee can't including his brain

[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.060]
and when you're sitting back there finally getting around to maybe

[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.420]
fumbling out some copy see I don't understand how can he be sitting back there

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.180]
writing it if the guy at the sponsor is the one that writes it you follow what I'm

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.600]
saying liar basically a liar Todd but anyway when you're sitting back there

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.840]
and belly I can about the fact that well how come he can't do this see if

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.920]
that my job it's not the talent job to write your copy to do your job

[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.120]
in addition to which when you're opening up a big mouth and then PD Lenny is

[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.380]
standing there you know immediately he's gonna come skyrocketing down the

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.700]
hallway open up the door and tell us everything that you just said because that's

[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.480]
the way it works at QAM we have our moles remember when Greg was looking for

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.040]
the mole and discovered we had like 600 of them

[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.280]
even Enrique and Peggy Lee put together aren't in the class with us we got more

[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.300]
goddamn moles than you ever seen so if you want to sit back there belly it can

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.860]
be a bit about the fact that somebody's trying to get you to do your job

[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.320]
and give us something to work with on a year that's too freaking bad Todd okay

[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.340]
because we all hate you like poison everybody in a building we'd like to

[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.500]
step right on your ass okay even duffer like to step on your ass how do you

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.880]
like that Todd we're sick and tired of your bull crap quit belly it can just do

[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.580]
your job back there you scumbag you little Jew and by the way happy circus

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.700]
so anyway oh and what else got me a little worked up this morning I'm sitting

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.460]
here minding my own business you know typing out my bedtime stories

[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.780]
and I'm listening to a little bit of Mo this morning I mean there's nothing like

[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.800]
I might get a little momentum in the morning with Mo another way of work huh

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.920]
we get very little momentum on the station but at any rate so some uh

[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.860]
ass sucking collar and isn't that what I told you about the collar is there much ass suckers

[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.340]
and that what I said I'll tell you something suck holes and sickos that's 95% of a call just

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.740]
like that guy yesterday oh yeah quit me this bedtime stories take some calls

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.500]
right so anyway this is schmuck this morning who's an expert on everything in life including

[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.000]
radio ratings he's going out about wow uh dental bastard something about ratings and yesterday

[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.960]
a meal was slaubing about Hank and his bigger and the trend came out in the bigger

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.300]
number he had in August and in the meantime he didn't bother mentioning the fact that Joseph

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.220]
Gackie was on two weeks in August well guess what mr. Rex Gritzon since I'm sure you're

[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.680]
listening right now you little punk uh the trend doesn't work that way the ratings don't work

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.760]
like August one to August 31 in in September what then worked that way the third week of the

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.800]
trend or rather the last week of the trend log ended like August 24th or 5th or whatever was

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.640]
the last week when Joe was on fill in for Hank that wasn't part of it so maybe he was on for

[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.040]
week but is there anybody out there who really believed that Joe is a Gackie is responsible for

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.960]
the numbers going up no in addition to which anybody called up Mo I noticed that nobody has the

[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.720]
balls to call him in front of him with his pathetic numbers at least I haven't heard it including

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.140]
this little putt wacker who's an expert on the ratings supposedly he's an expert on ratings just

[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.420]
like Todd Rex an expert on choppy so if I was slaubing which I thought it was kind of funny the

[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.040]
fact that we were all day yesterday what why not give the hump a little bit of credit it's due

[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.660]
and I don't need it's due but we like to see that I'd like to see Mo get an umber in there you know

[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.240]
just for the hell of it just to help us out a little bit just so maybe there's a chance

[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.100]
we might get some of that extra bonus money we're in it together in spite of Mo's a sour

[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.920]
a psychotic attitude we're all supposed to be in this ball game together but nevertheless

[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.680]
there's we got all the experts out there and that's another example of the colors now we do have

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.960]
the phone fixed I should point that out to you and yesterday's experiment with that phone man that

[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.320]
that's set the whole goddamn show back and since we got a short show today because the Noon to one

[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.040]
hour it's Wednesday it's Noon to one bit Wednesday and we'll play all comedy bits from Noon to one

[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.280]
to give it like a little chance a little relief in there a little blessed relief from all these

[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.200]
heavy duty depressing stories all these bedtime stories so we might take a collar to hear what you

[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.820]
say now what we have to do is Carlos has to take one and put it on hold like line two that's

[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.600]
ringing right now just put it on hold and then we'll see what it is see just because we want

[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.420]
to technically check this out because many Bob also known as George Corso one of our in uh several

[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.260]
engineers uh yesterday he was that we got to hold him on the phone and I came in here and I

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.100]
diddle with this and diddle with that all of a sudden like Squirt Squirt almost as much of

[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.480]
explosion as a small girl last night which you booker guys both missed um now what just happened

[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.600]
of that the guy disappeared he hung up we can't even do an experiment on here on this phone that's

[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.460]
this audience well you want a real call I don't care whether it's real or make believe just one

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.720]
that we can experiment with I realize we're starting from a a standing still position now following

[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.640]
our great morning show and those big numbers I love that punk to call in it with the expert with

[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.020]
Joseph Gackie did two weeks in August which is not true he may have done two weeks physically

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.200]
during the month of August but the last one in the last one ain't going to show up till the next

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.120]
trend so good luck to you Hank you'll need it and if anybody that's that much of an asshole that

[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.100]
would suggest that Joseph Gackie Hank Goldberg got big numbers on QIMB4 there was anybody else

[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.500]
getting any numbers on it anybody will tell you that in addition to which he don't need Joseph

[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.100]
Gackie to get numbers in fact can you imagine the month they would have had without Joseph Gackie

[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.700]
and a couple of those Marlon games in the afternoon they might have had a 15-year in man Schmuck

[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.240]
everybody's an expert everybody's a radio expert they're all ratings experts and they don't

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.720]
like the tone of the show and everybody's that's out for you that's why it's so pleasant here

[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.540]
it's sunny it's 48 degrees can you believe that I believe it gonna be 68th this afternoon

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.960]
yesterday may have been the most perfect day I've ever seen in my life it was sunny about 72

[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.920]
there was a nice breeze there with no humidity I mean it you just walk out there and you feel

[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.140]
invigorated and everybody's got a smile on their face and it's like a throbbing living and

[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.420]
breathing place and down there the like that one guy said the ventum just comes spewing the fourth

[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.740]
the ventum you can smell it man you can feel it your your hemorrhoids your your verbico's vein start

[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.680]
that's the one with your lucky hop it all over the place you like like you're just gonna

[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.780]
croak from the you from those stress of the psychotic angry people you know it's how it's even

[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.060]
getting to me now I'm starting to get a little whipped up into a frenzy just from taking one or two

[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.000]
causes today when you actually have uh look at that this thing is working primo now baby

[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.160]
here's lottery all by the sea hello Neil God yes sir I bought off and season ticket

[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.580]
what happened to him I give up what happened to him he said he bought off in season ticket

[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.320]
he's still there he's he's back on hold somehow oh don't tell me this thing is screwed up again

[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.920]
I didn't touch it I wouldn't tell you that look I think I'm again are you still are you here

[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.900]
yeah okay I said I bought season tickets as you're just so I couldn't possibly hear Moe Howard

[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.660]
on the radio anywhere really I'd like to whip him like an Irish traveler does our kid

[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.540]
I don't know it's coming up guys talking about Hank's numbers on there and I'm talking about his

[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.840]
numbers I don't know but I'd like to know what they are I'm sure they're pathetic and that's

[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.940]
squeaky delby God I don't even go to the uh listen to the lineups at the stadium because you have

[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.160]
to hear his voice he's doing a lineup announcing at the stadium he's doing something at some p.a

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.480]
did you hang up on it no I did I never touched a thing and I got I had my finger near the thing

[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.240]
but you don't think that could do it do you no I think it's whenever yeah there's something wrong

[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.940]
because whenever I touch a call over here let's hear it for let's hear it for the engineering

[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.600]
staff again if QAM boys and girls I put somebody on hold over here and it goes on hold over there

[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.240]
like whatever call you're on when I put any other call on hold it puts your call on hold oh brother

[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.140]
I'm gonna tell you our engineering staff on a scale of zero they're like they owe points they just

[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.940]
owe points they're in a minus column well let's try one or two more okay because then now there

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.460]
was actually a pretty good guy right plus it was right up in a hell out of mole which we liked that a

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.920]
lot because you won't hear that on mole show in fact mo got all bet out of shape because Gully

[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.760]
read some email from some woman in plantation obviously a very astute woman who understands that

[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.420]
he's still a jetz fan or at least that's what she was claiming and he was like all wounded about that

[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.580]
you see you can't have thin skin it's one thing that varicose veins you know when you get to be in

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.180]
your 80s a lot of guys get those but that thin skin and to be doing a top show can't do it one thing

[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.020]
to be sitting there in the isolation of the broadcast booth you know and and that Charles Elmore man

[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.660]
what a hypocrite that guy is in Palm Beach ripping mole behind his back off the you know off the

[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.340]
newspaper columns but in the newspaper sucking his ass hey Charlie make up your mind up there in Palm

[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.340]
Beach okay I get all the reports I may be up here in Toronto but I get all the reports I got my conduits

[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.120]
see and I don't I don't even know what to make of this thing now here's Miami hello

[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.440]
yes sir George's show is much more entertaining I wish he would go back on the air because you know

[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.260]
he talks to his audience he's a chronic would know the whole summer the contrary that's the

[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.640]
iron chef hello hey Neil president Bush has got to be the stupidest man in the world because he

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.120]
always sounds like he's reading he never sticks in his heart he had to dumbness back us okay thank you

[00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.550]
we got three great calls to start see we jumped to Josh the judge me yesterday and actually those

[00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.210]
last two they stayed on there until they went away well as long as Carlos doesn't touch anything well

[00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.990]
don't touch anything Carlos quit you better learn to teach him a little bit better don't touch

[00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.610]
stuff in there because it's Q.A.M. see in a real radio station you could touch stuff and it would

[00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.350]
work the way it's supposed to the way you would anticipate but our place just everything's a

[00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.670]
little touchy okay so don't touch I'm not don't touch that's what Miguel always said look but don't

[00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.170]
touch that's what Tom Mowelling says and you guys miss small girl last night man I'm telling you there

[00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.110]
was so much blowing in the first five minutes of that show even Peter North who by the way Peter

[00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.250]
North is Canadian we discovered that this morning on a website I was checking out because I was

[00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.950]
looking up Joe Schuster and the other guy that created Superman Canadian boys and there was a lot

[00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.250]
of blowing from those tornadoes in the beginning air just noise and blowing and gnashing and just

[00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.170]
a I thought he's always ripping you that guy he's always ripping me that guy he just missed a

[00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:47.210]
contrary whoever's on the air he's gonna argue and hate them I see like I said sickos and suck

[00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.990]
holes and the basic way that's it 98% although that last part today he's pretty good and the first guy

[00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.390]
was great except he got cut off twice because Carlos keeps touching don't touch him okay talk to him

[00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:03.550]
just don't touch him that's gonna be difficult the exception will be in Todd Dres case when he comes in

[00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.730]

[00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.850]
with all your spots Todd they suck and the reason they've heard about it so many times is because

you and we'd

[00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.170]
solve that problem for the next ten years after standhumpries uh... couldn't play

[00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.170]
anymore because of the uh... concussions

[00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.810]
put us in a position where it was it was tough and uh...

[00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:37.150]
uh... for each coach to think that he would be the one to turn this get around and and uh...

[00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.970]
they couldn't and that so it's uh...

[00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.910]
it's something that you know that i know it hurt a lot of coaches and uh... and uh...

[00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.510]
that they had a lot of money for this kind of spanish so it was uh... you know it

[00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.130]
feel bad for a lot of people in it

[00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.430]
we'll return to regular programming momentarily on wqa m dot com

[00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.070]
until then here's the best of sports radio five sixty q amp is bobby bether

[00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.150]
during the hammer hank olberg on monday august fifth

[00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.490]
bobby bethard is with and bobby this is the thirty of anniversary of the

[00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.790]
undefeated team you were certainly

[00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.930]
uh... part of that and as you look back on a retake with edwin poper in the show

[00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.170]
who

[00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.390]
when in the writers wing of the hall of fame last year and now

[00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:22.470]
and uh... another keep a skin resident and uh... and bobby when you think back

[00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.950]
on uh... on that team uh... everyone was saying that one of the

[00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.890]
one thing it's that strikes about it is that

[00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.810]
uh... we may have seen the last of those guys to go into the hall

[00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:41.050]
unless kuchinburg gets in and nick is the only defense of player to go in

[00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.950]
uh... are there other guys you think who are being overlooked from that club

[00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.510]
oh yeah i think uh... often so i think who should be one i think uh...

[00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:52.910]
on defense

[00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.510]
you know it uh... uh... norm evidence was by here two weeks ago

[00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.830]
and we spent some time together just talking about that team

[00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.430]
and uh... when you measure it by today's standards and height and we wait

[00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.950]
a height wait speed it doesn't measure up but it was

[00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.070]
probably

[00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.230]
all the time i've been in the NFL it's probably the closest i've ever seen to

[00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.810]
what team means those guys

[00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.910]
uh... with our ins bar and shul and how are all those guys coaching it was a

[00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.410]
team probably made fewer mistakes

[00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.330]
and he came out of every been around and they uh...

[00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.470]
so individually when you look the way man he for the end of the play then

[00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.590]
well man he was he was great dick Anderson was great they had

[00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.290]
uh... jake was

[00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.690]
uh... great they had so many good players but i don't know if anyone alone

[00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.890]
uh... would get the recognition

[00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.950]
to be in the hall of fame i'm not saying that's right but i think it was more

[00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.490]
the team should have been put in the hall of fame yeah well that no name

[00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.890]
defense was was called that because everybody contributed nobody really stood

[00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:00.210]
out

[00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.570]
when i say that that doesn't mean they couldn't play they just all played well

[00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:09.390]
together about math is going to go down the the list of players over there

[00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.850]
and they just they put on the board and like that

[00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.650]
he's more popular than ever

[00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.150]
i know that well

[00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.310]
now you do

[00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.150]
and now guard lightfoot boards the wreck of the edmund fits jerald and steers a

[00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.530]
course for disaster in his new tribute album

[00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.390]

[00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.190]
uh...

[00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.790]
he's confused

[00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.070]
gordon whitefoot renders his version of led zeppelin's

[00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.490]
immigrant song

[00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.290]
so

[00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:43.910]
so

[00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.230]
gordon whitefoot sinks led zeppelin

[00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.750]
it's a whole lot of stuff like this

[00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.130]
it's the compact is that's lower than the bottom of lakes of period

[00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.490]
there's a lady who should have been

[00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.930]
cold and cheap by

[00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:18.890]
there's a bustle in your city player don't be alarmed now it's just gordon whitefoot

[00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.670]
sinks led zeppelin

[00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.310]
it's not a team well that's a trend of rough in it so do you remember that song

[00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.510]
no

[00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.070]
that's the record the edmund fits your old they've had

[00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.930]
never heard of my life i told you never found that still i never heard it

[00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.230]
anyway he's canadian a any into an all i'd great

[00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.470]
so speaking of the nori squirt squirt

[00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.050]
now this call that you see is like uh... you got cut off that was everybody who

[00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.070]
was on the other you talk to the back again

[00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.910]
nil god i'm here okay

[00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.110]
you know something we could kill a whole show of you are you with me today we

[00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.030]
can just keep cutting off and you call back again

[00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.210]
i think carlos might be a mole for more that's why he kept me off i don't know

[00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.530]
could be it could be

[00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.730]
but anyway what i was saying you know that he said most of the nice back

[00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.290]
uh... bright harry

[00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.630]
yeah

[00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.050]
anyway what i was thinking people are going to take advantage of this phone call

[00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.110]
thing just to take cheap beach beach and mo go ahead

[00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.830]
uh... anyway all he talks about is how he goes and he's the restaurant does this

[00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.630]
now i think it just does the grubs it up for the free food in the morning or

[00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.630]
something yeah

[00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.870]
that's nothing we should all believe in is getting free meals on his show

[00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.970]
now we guys deserve it you work hard we pay for it all he does is come and

[00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.470]

the dolphin game in town were so gigantic on tv and that it would indicate to

me that nobody was listening to it on a radio they all watch on tv

[00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.310]

okay

[00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.530]
he would certainly it would piss him off because he's against capital punishment

[00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.630]
but secondly he probably would say well in this case i'm a conception

[00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.070]
because of giving some numbers

[00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.770]
and when you got like a point one share like old donahue's got you need anything

[00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.590]

[00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.890]

[00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.310]

[00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.810]
teenager who had not killed about fifty in the motion development of a

[00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.890]

[00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.810]
story given that Bradley's urging she said picket went to the store after they

[00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.010]
with Bradley in a cold stare picket would be sensed like in prison if convicted

[00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:54.330]
good

[00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.230]

to get like two ethnically early in the morning especially after we had

[00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.790]
a real good call from their one sports you see if we did not let him get

[00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.030]
born and we wouldn't have that call

[00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.950]
so it's a tough call isn't

[00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.830]
but in this one case will make an exception

[00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.230]

i realize we've been like handstrong by the fact that everything is like up

[00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.570]
in the air we can do basically what our engineering department allows us to

[00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.910]
do and our sales department those those are the two evil areas you can pick on

[00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.150]
more while you want you can easily dodging old man trying to do the best again

[00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:49.010]

[00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.410]

Priests placed on restrictions after alleged indecent exposure.

[00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.350]

police officer Friday afternoon at Pioneer Park in Blaine.

[00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.670]
I have no idea what state this is in, what public Minnesota is from.

[00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.690]

[00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.610]
Minnesota, I think.

[00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.630]
Okay, Minnesota.

[00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.590]

[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:19.930]

[00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.070]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.790]
Beat the snot out of him.

[00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.370]
So Prano's grilling goals, my Jersey view.

[00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.490]
Now, what is the big sentence with this?

[00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.850]
Are they ever going to stop this crap, all these professional

[00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:34.430]
ethnics?

[00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.130]
No.

[00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.890]
A Miss America page in Judge was run to ask Miss New Jersey about her

[00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.150]
views on the sopranos, the contestant in some Italian American goods

[00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.690]
be saying all very uptight, all psychotic.

[00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.490]
The judge asked Alicia Renee Luciano, what she thought about the

[00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.630]
show was that Luciano, which should be the right way to say

[00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.050]
Natalia.

[00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.930]
No, a couple of words, not too many.

[00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.830]
They asked Alicia Renee what she thought about the show during

[00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.170]
interviews, seven of a Saturday nights pageant Atlantic City.

[00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.790]
The HBO drama focuses on fictional mob boss Tony soprano as he

[00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.770]
juggles organized crime and his family life in suburban Jersey.

[00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:10.370]
The show has been criticized for reinforcing Italian American stereotypes,

[00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.710]
which we don't do on issue.

[00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.250]
I've had to that.

[00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.130]
The Italian people are wonderful people.

[00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.030]
And they make a great pasta and make pretty good little pizza, too,

[00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.370]
as a matter of fact, and there's wood burning ovens and those brick

[00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:20.850]
ovens.

[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:21.650]
Right.

[00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.810]
It all forgets big and a pizza pizza loft.

[00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.110]
The location opens next Monday the 30th out there in plantation.

[00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.310]
Luciano 19 answered that people shouldn't take television so seriously.

[00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:34.150]
And that good parenting should offset violence on TV.

[00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.230]
It was a question I didn't think they would ask of anyone other than some

[00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.950]
of my background.

[00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.970]
She told the daily record of her sippony for Tuesday's edition.

[00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.590]
The biomeurice and spleen be the first Italian American to represent New Jersey

[00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.410]
in the pageant.

[00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.850]
I wasn't expecting that.

[00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.990]
Luciano said everyone else was getting questions about how they

[00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.150]
felt about performance, dance, and the arts.

[00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.090]
Several Italian American groups agreed calling the question

[00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.230]
insensitive and insulting.

[00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.410]
Miss America officials did not immediately return a message left at their

[00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.030]
office yesterday.

[00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.130]
I don't think it was appropriate to Anthony Marci,

[00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.510]
vice president of the North Jersey chapter of fiery.

[00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.210]
A group of students and young adults that celebrate

[00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.930]
the Italian culture.

[00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.730]
F I E R R W F I E R W Y.

[00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.310]
How do you say that?

[00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.150]
Fieri.

[00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.990]
Whatever.

[00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:13.610]
Ferry.

[00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.110]
New Jersey chapter of Ferry.

[00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.150]
It's a television show that should be taken with a grain of

[00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.490]
solitude.

[00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.090]
But at the same time, it's had an American should be cognizant that it adds

[00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.950]
to these stereotypes in this country.

[00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.830]
Despite some changes in the page, including the addition of 16 question

[00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.750]
multiple choice quiz from the five finalists and Wayne Brady is the first

[00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.010]
black every to MC Miss America.

[00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:35.310]
Your ship was down.

[00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.790]
It was down, baby.

[00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.850]
Neil Simini research reports only some prominent people bothered to

[00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.870]
ingency the crowning of Erica Harold as Miss America 2003.

[00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.950]
That's the fewest in page in history and down 1.6 million from last

[00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.190]
year.

[00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.470]
That'll teach them to take bird parks off that show, even if he is dead.

[00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.650]
At the same time, no, the show did run more viewers than any other

[00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:53.450]
prime time programs.

[00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.910]
So beat the competition, but the audience was way down.

[00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.290]
And that's because they're picking on those great attacking Americans.

[00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.590]
Those are the sittions.

[00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.230]
They addressed that on the show by the way.

[00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.170]
What?

[00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.090]
The stereotype they have other.

[00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:10.850]
Where did they send it?

[00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.730]
They addressed it?

[00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.250]
Yes.

[00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.210]
And stamped it.

[00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:14.870]
Barcelona.

[00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.470]
She.

[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.990]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.630]
Nothing.

[00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:21.010]
They had other Italian Americans pointing to them and pointing them out and

[00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:24.310]
saying you people, you're the ones responsible for this negative stereotype that we have.

[00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:25.310]
That kind of thing.

[00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.330]
What does that mean?

[00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:27.470]
In the show.

[00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:28.430]
Let me say it.

[00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.390]
Let me make it very simple.

[00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.510]
OK, I know my Italian.

[00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.390]
I've been around a block a few times in Italy and I've also been in New York.

[00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.170]
There's Guido's and there's real Italians.

[00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.090]
I've told you that for years.

[00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.630]
OK, the people at UC, in fact, the sopranos thing.

[00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.450]
That's why I don't like that show.

[00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.490]
Those are Guido's.

[00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:41.570]
I'm not interested in Guido's.

[00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.030]
I want to see the Godfather.

[00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.050]
There were no Guido's and the Godfather.

[00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.990]
Even the Elywala, his baddest is acting, wasn't Godfather 3.

[00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.150]
And it was an abortion.

[00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.990]
Even his bad thought, maybe we could reason together.

[00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.830]
He should have been shot right there in a spot.

[00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.010]
Forget the Canole's County.

[00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.470]
Godshould has asked on the spot.

[00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:02.070]
But nevertheless, the people depicted on that move in those three movies, they were all

[00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.110]
like real Italians except of course for George Hamilton who shouldn't have been there in

[00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:10.450]
the first place except of course for Tom Hagen who was a crowd-mick whatever he was.

[00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.690]
But other than that, they were like real Italians.

[00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:14.670]
They were Sicilian.

[00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.270]
They weren't a bunch of like Guido's but they had pursuit and all that crap.

[00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.610]
OK, if you want to see a bunch of Guido, go see my friends at Doris Market and see

[00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:22.390]
some of their customers.

[00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:24.190]
OK, some of those in the New York, Guido's.

[00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.830]
Go in here.

[00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.330]
Give me a half a pound of pursuit.

[00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:28.950]
I'm going to give you a pursuit.

[00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.810]
OK.

[00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.630]
How they doing over Doris Market by the way?

[00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.390]
See how I'm out of touch.

[00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.510]
But so there's like Sicilians, there's there's mobsters, there's people who are connected

[00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.910]
and there's people who are disconnected.

[00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.010]
And there's people who should be like most of the caller is disconnected.

[00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:44.490]
You got it?

[00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:45.110]
Got it.

[00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.850]
That's it.

[00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.750]
That's all you need to know.

[00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:51.390]
I mean you got your garden variety like Italians, the people like Joe Castello who don't

[00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.610]
even know how to pronounce his name right.

[00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:55.230]
Which you always say Joe Castello because it's filled with the name.

[00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.510]
Right.

[00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.270]
It's not Castello.

[00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.590]
It's not how you pronounce his name.

[00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:02.310]
And don't tell me he pronounces it that way because I can't be responsible if the guy

[00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:03.710]
just don't know how to pronounce his own name.

[00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:04.950]
It's not Joe Castello.

[00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.190]
In Italian, the A is always pronounced.

[00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.290]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, like when I saw Tom Mulling last night.

[00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.550]
Ah, ah, I would have gone like that.

[00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:17.050]
Got it?

[00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.910]
How's that pool coming on smallville by the way?

[00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:21.650]
96 votes already.

[00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.230]
I don't watch it.

[00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.690]

[00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.790]
64 and a half percent of the sudden still watching.

[00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.910]
Do you have any idea how that frost might ask?

[00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:28.830]
I really don't care.

[00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.410]
I don't care if anybody else watches it.

[00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:31.250]
Although you know something?

[00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.870]
See most of the people who watch smallville are like younger people.

[00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.590]
I mean, we don't have no young people listening to watch anymore.

[00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:37.030]
Do we know?

[00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:38.110]
No.

[00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:38.730]
They're all gone.

[00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.470]
They don't want to hear bedtime stories.

[00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:41.410]
They want to hear.

[00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:42.770]
Hey, Tommy's a douchebag.

[00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.110]
What's this fine?

[00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.350]
Let him fight it someplace else.

[00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.670]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of that, guess who had a really big trend?

[00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:49.710]
Let me give you a clue.

[00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:50.330]
Are you sure?

[00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.050]
Yeah, Bill.

[00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.230]
For the first time in ages, he actually made an impact there.

[00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.770]
I think he was number five in a man.

[00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:56.370]
Oh, nice.

[00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.270]
Like a five share, something like that.

[00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.930]
How do you like that?

[00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:00.190]
That's about time.

[00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:03.330]
Well, that's because you were under in the summer months and every district for some entertainment.

[00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:03.670]
Right.

[00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:05.110]
I don't watch it.

[00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:05.410]
62.

[00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.210]
It's okay.

[00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.630]
Nine.

[00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:07.650]
I love it.

[00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.910]
Nine.

[00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.610]
Lanna, look, it flips my big eight.

[00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:12.310]
Tom Mulling is God five.

[00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.190]
And I love it.

[00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.170]
Or I hated it.

[00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:14.790]
It blows three.

[00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.130]
So they're all over the place.

[00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.470]
At least we got him like a small villain, Tensin now.

[00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.190]
And by the way, Norma, you know, by these amazing things got 16 different TV sets.

[00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.170]
By this amazing thing called a VCR and tape the show, Dumbo.

[00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.130]
How could you miss smallville?

[00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.910]
Of course, if he were up here, he'd see it against I'm like Wednesday.

[00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.470]
I also remember I went to that thing last night when they were like out of sync.

[00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.370]
Son of Miami's top prosecutor of woods jail in pot case.

[00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:42.950]
The 18 year old son of date counties top prosecutor accepted the deal to avoid jail after it was caught carrying marijuana.

[00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.050]
When he tried to board a flight to Puerto Rico,

[00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.910]
that'll teach him to go see them weekends.

[00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.050]
That's what George would say.

[00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.750]
A judge accepted Justin Robert Rundle's entry into a pre-trial diversion program Monday.

[00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:59.090]
The son of state attorney Catherine Fernandez Rundle accepted the deal with Pope County prosecutors August 30th.

[00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:03.370]
You think that's where Pope salad any came from with Pope County?

[00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.450]
His mother decided not to handle this case because of a conflict of interest.

[00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.810]
Under the deal, they misdemeanors possession of marijuana charge against Rundle will be thrown out if he completes.

[00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.570]
We have provident includes classes and community service.

[00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:18.870]

[00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:30.830]
Okay.

[00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.790]

[00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:53.230]
I hope that a gigantic Mac truck comes flying through that parking lot.

[00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:58.330]

Oh, really, oh big shot. That's how we pass the time away in the gay old jail.

[00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:22.830]
All right. 10, oh three at five 60 WQM. Happy Wednesday to you.

[00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:26.750]
Sonny Shionan. Man, it's just beautiful. Oh, that's right. You got all those storms

[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:30.810]
around you there. Yeah. But all right. Just muggy. One of the west and one of

[00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.270]
the east and one is coming. One is going. And guess what the good news is?

[00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.210]
CBS news finally wise up. Guess who Dan Ratherhead on last night to pontificate

[00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:43.030]
about the hurricane, the coming one and the reforming one. Our old friend, Dr.

[00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.730]
Neil Frank, they've been using good guy. Yeah. Good guy. They've been using him lately.

[00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.710]
And I noticed that Brian has kind of vanished into the woodwork. Thank God.

[00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:55.050]
Not that. Here's one of our regular facts. He says I miss small villal too. Does WB repeated during the week?

[00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.370]
If you know, guess I can check the listings. Guess you can check the listings.

[00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:02.270]
Because they repeated. I think it's on global or something here like tonight.

[00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:06.670]
As a matter of fact, but you're not here. So at any rate, I'm not going to watch it again.

[00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.610]
It was good, but not that good. But it would like to tie up all these loose ends

[00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:13.870]
from last year or so many of them. The good news is though, of course, John Snyder.

[00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.610]
He's okay. He looks a little none the better for where they say none the worst for

[00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:22.010]
where he looks a lot worse for where he looks about 90 years old. And mommy.

[00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:26.690]
She's still got that little pinched nose, you know. Good old mommy. And then the

[00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.990]
the spaceship at the end of the show, we see is laying in the middle of a

[00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:35.070]
space. You look like it about the size of your foot. The smallest damn spaceship

[00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.510]
I ever saw. And you sort of think it was for a baby. But it's gotten it looks like it's

[00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:43.690]
gotten even smaller. At the end of the show, they just show that off in a field

[00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.450]
somewhere in it is. It's like a little little opening there in this little tiny

[00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:51.890]
space. You're about the size of your thumb is sitting in there. So somebody's

[00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:59.970]
going to like come across that thing. And we're going to say, oh, Clark can't

[00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:05.310]
sell his bomb material to Iran says the BBC today. How do you like that? Talk about

[00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:09.690]
about about a bunch of hypocrites British officials have ever proved the export of

[00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.870]
key components needed to make nuclear weapons to Iran and other countries known to

[00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.890]
be developing such weapons. This couldn't be the same Tony Blair who made that

[00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:22.490]
impassioned speech yesterday in front of the parliament. Clear. Yeah, it's clear as

[00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.970]
mud is what it's clear clear that you're full of crap that you're a puppet.

[00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:30.990]
An investigation by BBC Radio 4 program file on four will disclose that the

[00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:34.610]
Department of Trade and Industry allowed a quantity of the metal verulium to be sold

[00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:40.890]
to Iran last year. That medal is needed to make nuclear bombs. Britain's had an

[00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.910]
arms embargo to Iran since 1993 and signed up to an international protocol which

[00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:48.810]
vans the sale of verulium, the name countries, including Iran. Liberal Democrat

[00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:52.830]
Foreign Affairs spokesman Menziz Campbell who's been alerted to the BBC program's

[00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:58.830]
material is said to be extremely alarmed. You got it? Extremely alarmed.

[00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.770]
Verulium is a metal with a limited number of high tech uses in civilian

[00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:07.850]
industry but is mostly used in defense application that is a vital component of a

[00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:12.330]
nuclear bomb. The program is also going to be leading nuclear weapons expert in the

[00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:16.850]
UK who says that the Verulium and other items which the DTI is licensed to Iran

[00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:21.670]
add up to a shopping list for nuclear weapons program. The UK has had an arms

[00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:25.470]
embargo against Iran but not a trade embargo. The program highlights the

[00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:28.850]
weakness in the UK's new export control system which was set up to stop the

[00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:32.590]
proliferation of nuclear weapons. It will reveal that Iranian procurement agents

[00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.870]
have been working in the UK to get sensitive material back to Iran and that

[00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:39.670]
Pakistan has also been successful in procuring material for its nuclear program

[00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.330]
from the UK. It is also likely to cause concern among Britain's allies this

[00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:48.290]
says President Bush named Iran as we all know as part of that axis of evil

[00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:52.050]
accusing the Iranian regime of sponsoring terrorism and yet our good

[00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:55.490]
close friends, the Brits are peddling them all kinds of good stuff to help them

[00:57:55.490 --> 00:58:01.290]
make nukes. Man, Maureen Dowd says no more brow worse and that's bad because I love

[00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.230]
my brow worse. God. Don't you like have you ever had the brow worse?

[00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:09.510]
Yes. I tell you it is so damn good. I'd like to hop on a plane to go to

[00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:14.050]
a cologne right now. Fly over to Amsterdam, get on the train, go down to cologne

[00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.190]
and about two and a half hours right there by the train station right in the

[00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:19.970]
train station and that train station in cologne man you could spend a week

[00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:24.990]
there. You even got beautiful turlits you know like if there's a pay thing you

[00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:28.930]
have to put in like it used to be whatever in helikur or two marks or whatever

[00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:32.470]
or a mark and now you have to put I guess one euro and you go through it and

[00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:36.550]
they got like all these towel people and they got like beautiful fancy you could

[00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:41.670]
spend a half a day hanging out of the toilets cruising the tea rooms no more

[00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.990]
brow worse rights Maureen Dowd. Alot leave your drill out there don't be drilling

[00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:49.570]
no glory holes there and you know click it nervous about that aren't they

[00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:55.330]
pre drilled over there? Yes. And the holes too. Maureen says they rule their

[00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.870]
world ruthlessly and insolently deciding who'll get a cold shoulder who

[00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.910]
will get locked out of the power click and who'll get withering glairs until

[00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:05.550]
they gravel and obey the arbitrary dictates of the leaders. We could be talking

[00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:09.230]
about the middle school alpha girls smug cheerleaders with names like Darcy

[00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:13.030]
Brittany and Whitney but no we're talking about the ostensibly mature and

[00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.690]
seasoned leaders of the western world a slender former cheerleader named W

[00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:22.190]
and his high heading click Condi Rummy and Cheney. I used to think the bush

[00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:25.550]
hawks suffered from testosterone poisoning always throwing sharp elbows and

[00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.950]
cartoonishly chesty my way or the highway talker on the world when a less

[00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:32.910]
belligerent tone would be classy and more effective but now we have the spectacle

[00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:36.950]
of the 70 year old Rummy acting like a 16 year old Heather Vixen slapping those

[00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.830]
lower in the global hierarchy trying to dominate and silence the beta

[00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:43.610]
countries with less money and fewer designer weapons and a meeting of NATO

[00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.730]
defense ministers this weekend Warsaw the Pentagon chief stubbed his

[00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:50.030]
urine counterpart Peter Stroke refusing to meet with him only dating the

[00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:53.310]
shake his hand at the cocktail party he was on the dismorning Heinrich

[00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:58.190]
hella rumcell denying this all while he was busy the winnest and I was

[00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:02.390]
been and he didn't shine anybody said full of crap echoing Condi's

[01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.790]
pivishness Rummy announced that the campaign of Gerhard Schroeder who eaked out a

[01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.890]
victory by running against the bush pushed to invade Iraq had the effective

[01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.350]
poisoning in relationship in their eagerness to apply adolescent torture

[01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:16.890]
methods bush hawks seem to have forgotten history do we really want to punish

[01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:20.050]
the Germans for being pacifists once those guys get rolling in the other

[01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:23.190]
direction they really don't know how to put the brakes on who could line

[01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.050]
mr. Schroeder behaved like a good beta tried to align himself with the American

[01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.330]
alphas by dumping his embarrassing friends the justice minister who linked

[01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:33.450]
Mr. Bush's tactics to Hitler's and the parliamentary floor leader compared

[01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:38.470]
W. to Augustus the Roman Emperor who subdue the Germanic tribes mr. Stroke

[01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:42.350]
and the German Foreign Minister Yoshka Fisher or eager wannabes mr. Stroke

[01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.670]
offered more German trips for Afghanistan and mr. Fisher apologized to

[01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:49.150]
Colin Powell the administration's ganna girl the careful listener who'd always

[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.230]
rather build relationships then run rough shot over them here had will have to go

[01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:57.310]
through way of uh more of a shame spiral he can forget about getting Germany a

[01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:00.770]
permanency on the UN Security Council and no more bratwurst on White House

[01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:04.850]
menus the state department wanted a pressure in prison to make nice with the

[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.310]
Germans but W. was like enjoying his hissy fit refusing to make the

[01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:12.290]
customary call to congratulate mr. Schroeder as with alpha girls the president

[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:16.110]
makes leadership all about him he thinks there are only two places to be with

[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:19.830]
him on a rack or with the terrorists after all Germany is not Saudi Arabia

[01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.830]
they have elections over there and surely the bushes have heard of candidates

[01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:25.930]
saying whatever it takes and placating for a special interest to win an

[01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:30.070]
election and then ending the fences afterward three words Bob Jones University

[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:34.770]
all polls know today adversaries tomorrow's ally maybe the bush policy on

[01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.850]
empire and preemption allows us to decide not only you can run a country but

[01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:41.010]
one of the proper issues for other nation's election debates bush senior

[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.790]
was a master of personal diplomacy taking heads to stay down in a cigarette

[01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:47.250]
vote to Orioles games and to the Aaron Space Museum to see the movie the

[01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:52.070]
flood to fly or the fly that would be good one to see I don't like him by the way

[01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:56.550]
what's his name Ron gold gold glum gold glum Jeff go oh he makes me sick the good

[01:01:56.550 --> 01:02:01.670]
version of that was the first one of Vincent Price yes anyway he was a bush

[01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:05.030]
senior was a foreign policy realist to use socializing gossiping notes and

[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:08.430]
phone calls to lubricate relations with other leaders but W who was always the

[01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.690]
Roman candle and hatchet man in the family has turned his father's good manners

[01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.610]
upside down consulting spiritly leaving poor Tony Blair to make the case

[01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:18.790]
against his foes for him and treating policy disagreements as personal

[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:22.490]
slights only the Saudis get away with disobliving the administration on a

[01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.330]

their songs crew summer and Venus but in Britain they had 23 top 40 singles

[01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:53.790]
and ran into the most successful all-girl group in history which leads to a

[01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:58.910]
very important question what the hell is up with Britain look look I really

[01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:02.950]
rather not talk about it after a song reporter broke a two decade silence about

[01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:06.870]

over for the rest of you guys but hop in there anyway oh guess it was on

[01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:54.330]
the end speaking MSNBC guess it was on yesterday show I give up Ron Paul who's

[01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:57.630]
a medical doctor and a public and member of Congress from Texas a conservative

[01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:01.450]
Republican and one of the things that they talked about was this list of

[01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:07.970]
35 questions that he read this on the house floor okay all those questions

[01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:12.210]
that he wanted answers to that he didn't right he never got and he's foaming

[01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:15.650]
at them out and he's see it's amazing the more conservative just like Pat

[01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:18.290]
you can and the more conservative these guys are the less they want to

[01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:20.950]
rattle their spears of war and the more that the questioning what the list is

[01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:26.190]
really all about so anyway Texas Republican representative Ron Paul who's

[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:29.490]
very conservative rather following the house representatives September 10th of

[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:34.270]
this year soon we hope that hearings on the pending war with Iraq here are some

[01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:38.130]
questions I would like answered by those who are urging us to start this war one

[01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:41.210]
is it not true that the reason we didn't bomb the Soviet Union the high-of-the-code

[01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:45.310]
war was because we knew they could retaliate too was it not also true that

[01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:48.850]
we are we are willing to bomb Iraq now because we know it cannot retaliate

[01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:52.730]
we just confirmed that there's no real threat three is it not true that there

[01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:55.110]
were those who argued that even with inspections we cannot be sure that

[01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:57.970]
Hussein might be hiding weapons and at the same time imply that we can be

[01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.690]
more sure that weapons exist in the absence of inspections four is it not

[01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:05.250]
true that the UN's international atomic energy agency was able to complete

[01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:10.490]
its yearly verification mission to Iraq just this year with Iraqi cooperation five

[01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:13.190]
is it not true that the intelligence community has been unable to develop a

[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:16.430]
case tying Iraq to global terrorism and all much less the attacks on the

[01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.250]
US last year does anyone remember that 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi

[01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:24.430]
Arabia and that none of them came from Iraq six was former CIA counter-terrorism

[01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.710]
chief Vincent Canastero wrong when he recently said there's no confirmed

[01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:31.330]
evidence of Iraq's length of terrorism seven is it not true that the CIA is

[01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:34.930]
concluded there's no evidence that a prog meeting between 911 hijacker

[01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:38.550]
Muhammad Ahti and Iraqi intelligence ever took place eight is it not true that

[01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.530]
Northern Iraq where the administration claimed al-Qaeda were hiding up is in

[01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:45.650]
the control of our allies the Kurds nine is it not true that the vast majority

[01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:49.010]
of al-Qaeda leaders who escaped the period of made it safely to Pakistan under

[01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:53.370]
our so-called allies ten has anyone noticed that Afghanistan is rapidly

[01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:57.090]
shrinking into total chaos with bombings and assassinations becoming daily

[01:09:57.090 --> 01:10:01.010]
occurrences and that according to a recent UN report the al-Qaeda is by all accounts

[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:06.210]
alive and well and poised to strike again how when and where it chooses 11 why

[01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.010]
are we taking precious military and intelligence resources away from

[01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:13.130]
tracking down those who did attack the US and who may again attack the US and

[01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.730]
using them to invade countries that have an attack the US twelve would an attack

[01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:21.210]
on Iraq not just confirm the Arab world's worst suspicions about the US and

[01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:25.110]
isn't this what been law and wanted in the first place thirteen how can

[01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:29.150]
it be compared to Hitler when he has no avi no no navy no air force and now

[01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:32.530]
has an army one fifth the size of 12 years ago which even then proved totally

[01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:36.670]
inept at defending the country fourteen is it not true that the constitutional

[01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.550]
power to declare war is exclusively that of the congress should presidents

[01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:44.310]
conquer the constitutional law congress to concur only when pressured by public

[01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:48.210]
opinion our presidents permitted to rely on the UN from permission to go to war

[01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:53.310]
fifteen are you aware of a Pentagon report studying changes that thousands of

[01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:56.730]
Kurds in one village charges rather that thousands of Kurds in one village were

[01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.790]
gasped by the Iraqis which found no conclusive evidence that Iraq was

[01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:02.970]
responsible that Iran occupied the very city involved in that evidence

[01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:06.550]
indicated the type of gas used was more likely controlled by Iran and not by

[01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:10.250]
Iraq sixteen is it not true that anywhere between a hundred and three hundred

[01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:13.410]
thousand US soldiers have suffered from Persian Gulf War syndrome for the

[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.830]
first Gulf War and that thousands may have died seventeen are we prepared for

[01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:21.030]
possibly thousands of American casualties in war against the country that

[01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:25.190]
doesn't have the capacity to attack the United States eighteen are we willing

[01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:27.990]
to bear the economic burden of a one hundred billion dollar war against Iraq

[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:31.390]
with oil prices expected to skyrocket and further rattling already shaky

[01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:34.930]
American economy how about an estimated thirty years of occupation of Iraq that

[01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:39.670]
some have deemed necessary to build democracy there nineteen Iraq's alleged

[01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:43.310]
violations of UN resolutions are given as reason to initiate an attack yet is

[01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.990]
it not true that hundreds of UN resolutions have been ignored by various

[01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.170]
countries without penalty not to mention a names twenty did former president

[01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:53.290]
Bush not set the UN resolution nineteen ninety as the reason he couldn't

[01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:56.190]
march into Baghdad while supporters of a new attack assert that it's the very

[01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:00.530]
reason we can march into Baghdad twenty one is it not true that current

[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.470]
contrary to current claims the no-fly zones were set up by Britain and the US

[01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:07.310]
without specific approval from the United Nations twenty two if we claim

[01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.230]
membership in the international community and conform to its rules only when

[01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:13.690]
it pleases us doesn't deserve to undermine our position directing directing

[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:17.930]
animosity toward us by both friend and foe their thirty five days by the way

[01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:22.830]
well mention that yes twenty three how can our declared goal of bringing

[01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:26.350]
bringing democracy to Iraq be believable when we prop up dictators throughout

[01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:29.410]
the Middle East and support military talents like Moussierreff and Pakistan

[01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:33.210]
who overthrew a democratically elected president twenty four are you

[01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.130]
familiar with the nineteen ninety four senatorings that revealed the US knowingly

[01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:39.630]
supplied chemical and biological materials to a rack during the Iran Iraq war

[01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:43.290]
in his latest nineteen ninety two including after the alleged Iraqi gas attack on

[01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:47.110]
occurred its village twenty five did we notice this satan who seems rise to

[01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:50.830]
power by supporting and encouraging his invasion of Iran is it honest to

[01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:53.510]
criticize satan now for his invasion of Iran at which time we actively

[01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:57.630]
supported twenty six is it not true that preventive horse anonymous with an

[01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.650]
act of aggression and has never been considered a moral or legitimate US

[01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:04.770]
policy twenty seven why do the oil company executive strongly support this

[01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:09.150]
war if oil is not the real reason we plan to take over Iraq twenty eight why

[01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.750]
is it that those who never wore uniform and are confident that they won't have

[01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.930]
to personally fight this war are more anxious for this war than our generals

[01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:18.870]
twenty nine what is the moral argument for attacking a nation that's not

[01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:22.670]
initiated aggression against us and couldn't do it if they wanted to thirty

[01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:25.830]
where does the constitution grant us permission to wage war for any reason

[01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:30.130]
other than self defense thirty one is it not true that a war against Iraq rejects

[01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:32.930]
the sentiments of the time on her treaty of Westpadia nearly four hundred

[01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:36.010]
years ago that country should never go into another for the purpose of regime

[01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:40.350]
change thirty two is it not true that the more civilized society is the less

[01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.930]
likely disagreements will be settled by war thirty three is it not true that

[01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.750]
since world war two congress is not declared war and not coincidentally have we

[01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:51.290]
won since then had a clear cut victory thirty four is it not true that

[01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:54.490]
Pakistan especially through its intelligence services was an active supporter

[01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:58.750]
and key organizer the Taliban and thirty five why not those who want more bring

[01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.190]
a formal declaration more resolution to the floor of congress those are the

[01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:06.090]

From 200 years ago, when they were slaves

[01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:34.890]
But what were dead people dead to you, I have to take the plane

[01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:40.070]
When you're still four and old ninety-eight

[01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:41.090]
Okay

[01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:49.190]
With a can of smelly cherry in fact, instead of forty acres and a mule I have a better way

[01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:54.690]
You've got to, yes a nigger good morning

[01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:59.390]
And one on how we bear a bargain frame of two

[01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:07.010]
Yes a nigger good morning, and that's your restitution for it's lavin' you

[01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:15.330]
Yes a nigger good morning, and kill'em that you're sorry for it's lavin' them all

[01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:23.470]
Yes a nigger good morning, and that's where everybody's who is dead and tall

[01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:26.310]
Every time I play that I can take only one thing

[01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:29.690]
And that is those people that hang those little things from their rearview mirrors

[01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.150]
Little things

[01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:35.510]
Then little things you know like a pine tree or what do they call those

[01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:41.730]
No no I'm not talking about the scent things, oh the air fresheners, the air freshener crap

[01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.270]
Wasn't that where they hang them like usually from the rearview mirror?

[01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:46.950]
The air fresheners?

[01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.530]
Yes, where else you be sticking those?

[01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:53.210]
Canadian vicar under fired dressing is Elvis

[01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:59.210]
A Canadian anglican priest who dresses Elvis Presley for weddings and funerals is under fire for his actions

[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:06.350]
High ranking Canadian vicians have objected Reverend Dorian Baxter for combining the Anglican Gospel with the words of Elvis

[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:14.850]
The National Post has the 53 year olds been singing Elvis songs to sinners since his first ministerial posting in eight 1984, 1802

[01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:23.190]
Often known as Elvis Presley, Reverend Baxter was recently banned from the Pope at the time

[01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:26.510]
He was a part of an Ontario church and has been stripped of his license to perform marriages now

[01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:31.370]
Reverend Baxter says his unusual style is the best way to lure wayward Christians back to the church

[01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:35.210]
And is threatening to form his own Anglican group supportive of his Elvis Presley

[01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:41.190]
I refuse to resign from Holy orders, I have led tens of thousands of people to Jesus through the music of Elvis

[01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:43.630]
This man's some gospel better than anyone I know

[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:46.090]
I'm almost as good as Mahalia Jackson, you know what?

[01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:47.590]
Who?

[01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:49.030]
Mahalia Jackson

[01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:51.190]
Don't you ever heard the big gospel singer?

[01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.450]
No

[01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.870]
Mahalia Jackson?

[01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:56.450]
Oh my God, are you out of touch with reality man?

[01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:57.390]
Mahalia talking about

[01:19:57.910 --> 01:20:02.270]
I've told the bishops all they need to do is buy a few of his CDs and I don't know what they're complaining about he said

[01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:07.790]
Ronald Ferris, the bishop of the diocese of Algoma, where Reverend Baxter used to be a part of the minister said

[01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:09.570]
The mix is in poor taste

[01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:16.770]
Reverend Baxter says he's largely tried to ignore condemnations from bishops although he says church officials who attempt to discredit his ministry

[01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.170]
have never intended one of his weddings or funerals

[01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:20.230]
How do you like that?

[01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:22.170]
The church disinporal Elvis

[01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:26.010]
And he won't know Catholic anyway, he didn't wear them beads

[01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:32.570]
Census, US poverty up and income down, I'll wait till you're which ethnic group is having a worst time

[01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:42.110]
Reversing some of the social gains of the late 1990s, poverty rate and this coming after eight years of almost unparalleled, I think a record setting prosperity

[01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:48.650]
Right, which American public said oh we don't want any more of this, it feels so good we wanted to start hurting again

[01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:56.430]
Reversing some of the social gains of the late 1990s, poverty rates and income equality both rose last year

[01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:03.070]
While the typical households income went down the government reported yesterday largely reflecting the effects of the economic recession

[01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:08.750]
You know it's interesting when Reagan came into office in 81, what's the first thing that we had economically?

[01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:12.730]
We had a recession when Bush won came into office, what did we have?

[01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:14.370]
A big fat recession

[01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:17.690]
Now that W is in office, what's the first thing we have?

[01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:19.990]
And what looks like it's going to be a double dip

[01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.510]
Recession

[01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:27.290]
Hey let's have some more than tax cuts for the rich baby, then do me any good

[01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:29.610]
Hey by the way, Mitch Hersh, thanks a lot you piece of crap

[01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:34.930]
I just figured it out yesterday that I worked the last three years for free

[01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:35.370]
Nice

[01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:41.950]
In its annual report on income and poverty, the sensitive Bureau said that 1.3 million Americans slipped below the government's official poverty line last year

[01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:43.930]
The first increase since 1993

[01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:51.610]
As a result, 11.7% of the population is in poverty, up from 11.3% in 2000, including Georgia and Carlos

[01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.170]
And McGill

[01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:57.530]
But unlike previous recess and the beast, especially now

[01:21:57.530 --> 01:22:02.010]
But unlike previous recessions, most of the increase in poverty was experienced by White households

[01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:06.610]
The rate actually fell for Hispanics and increased only marginally in Black households, where I was wrong about that

[01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:09.850]
Still the poverty rate among blacks, 22.7%

[01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:14.590]
And Hispanics, 21.4% was roughly double that of the population at large

[01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:21.810]
Adjusted for inflation, the Census Bureau reported that the median household income fell 2.2% last year, the 42,228

[01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:23.430]
The first decline since 1991

[01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:30.190]
The decline in income was broad, if not especially steep affecting all but the top 5-10% of households is ranked by income

[01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:31.650]
Isn't that interesting?

[01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:33.570]
Look at that

[01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:37.670]
The top 5-10% of households is ranked by income, got that nice big fat tax break from W

[01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:43.070]
This report signals a significant reversal of what had been a very positive trend in terms of income and poverty said

[01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:58.410]
The second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:58.950]
And the second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:59.430]
And the second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:01.330]
And the second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:04.890]
And the second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:23:04.890 --> 01:23:13.050]
And the second decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in poverty

[01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:43.030]
and the fourth decline in income and poverty was also a significant increase in bars

[01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:48.930]
only marginally black households and that oh I see income fell I see so in other

[01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:52.850]
words these people already were poor see what I'm saying yes also hard to

[01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:56.050]
sit where households headed by females both those with children and oh husband

[01:23:56.050 --> 01:24:00.510]
present down 3.1% and those were females were living alone down 3.7% at the

[01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:03.730]
same time they wage gap between men and women continue to shrink with women

[01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:07.410]
last year earning 76 cents for every dollar earned by men up from 74 cents in

[01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:14.190]
2000 so there you go we're doing it baby the bushmeister well speaking of

[01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:18.590]
people uh more leaders are really pissed off and fired up Prince Charles

[01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:24.070]
fumes over foxes you're you're not gonna know whether to scream or or lick a

[01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:28.290]
spotted dick when you hear that right Prince Charles reported the reported

[01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:31.970]
threat to leave Britain if it banned fox hunting has been welcomed by at least one

[01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:35.810]
lawmaker I think it's wonderful I was keen to vote to get rid of fox hunting

[01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:39.730]
I'm doubly keen now what a bonus then a skin or the governing labor party said

[01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:43.930]
Monday several newspapers reported Sunday that Charles wrote a strident letter

[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:48.110]
to triminist prime minister Tony Blair accusing the government of destroying the

[01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:52.950]
countryside how do you like that he wrote a strident letter to Tony Blair both

[01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:58.410]
the significant number yeah Charles reportedly passed on remarks made by him

[01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:02.830]
made to him rather by a Cambrian farmer that if we as a group or black or gay

[01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:05.970]
we wouldn't be victimized or picked upon a statement the Prince apparently agreed

[01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:10.330]
with how do you like that the mail on Sunday newspaper also said the non

[01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:14.030]
unidentified senior politician had claimed to have heard the Prince on some

[01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:18.490]
unspecified date threatened to emigrate if hunting was stopped downing street in

[01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:21.570]
St. James palace both the client to say whether the letter existed or the meeting

[01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:24.810]
you take in place the Prince of Wales is perfectly in tablet was views the

[01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:27.190]
prime minister and the Prince have a very good relationship said blaze

[01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:31.130]
official spokesman who briefed reporters on conditioning and anonymity he said

[01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:37.810]
keep it mom said I was the queen mom Tony banks a labor party candidate for

[01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:40.710]
London mayor and a prominent animal welfare campaigner said the report of

[01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:44.290]
comments were offensive to true minority groups if it is true and I know one

[01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:47.070]
knows whether it is or not I think a lot of people will find it both in videos

[01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:50.890]
and offensive I love that word in videos and offensive to talk about minorities

[01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:54.010]
whether they're ethnic minorities or minorities based on sexual orientation and

[01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:56.610]
to compare that with a minority of people who want to carry on ripping wild

[01:25:56.610 --> 01:26:00.410]
animals to pieces banks said Charles comments reported on the day that more than

[01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:04.270]
400,000 farmers gamekeepers hunting enthusiasts and real residents gathered in

[01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:08.050]
London for a rally in support of fox hunting in their rural way of life rural

[01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:11.010]
affairs minister Ellen Michael said the government understood the concerns of

[01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:14.250]
the demonstrators including closure of rural schools and hospitals and

[01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:17.890]
falling farm income this is never trying to get his closure yes but he said

[01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.690]
government had legislate for the whole country especially on the issue of fox

[01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:23.730]
hunting opinion polls have consistently indicated that a majority of

[01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:28.490]
Britain's opposed the sport to which we say oh right thank god for that at least

[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:32.530]
okay they may have really bad smelly teeth and bad breath and all those other

[01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.390]
things and be constipated emotionally but at least the majority of more

[01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:40.090]
against this barbaric pile of crap let's go get the hounds okay the hounds of

[01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:47.350]
the bastard bills 230 votes on our poll on small bill 71.7% don't watch it

[01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:31.650]
it doubt pry this out because it'll work for you dry concepts I keep thinking

[01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:35.570]
back to those grotesque days at i.o.d. which is one of the most unsanitary places

[01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:40.190]
anyone's ever been allowed to work in a building that even the roaches were

[01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:43.110]
flying out of it they were like they were going over to channel seven remember

[01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:48.290]
that yep insects rodents everything was fine we had dry concepts come in when

[01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:51.370]
they first came on here with me which is a long no not really they were before

[01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:55.010]
that but I guess at i.o.d. and they said we can clean those carpets down there we

[01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:57.090]
couldn't believe it because they had been clean since the building was built

[01:27:57.090 --> 01:28:01.290]
about six hundred years ago by Mrs. Carl Fisher remember her no no

[01:28:02.050 --> 01:28:05.630]
don't you remember that car we got to come on get wet at anyway they came in

[01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:08.110]
and they cleaned the carpets and made them look brand new and we said to

[01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:11.570]
ourselves if they can make these carpets look brand new maybe they can make

[01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:14.410]
a car a carpisher look brand new again I don't think so though too late for

[01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:17.230]
him and they can do the same for you to make a lungs to be sure they'll take

[01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:20.570]

he's sport

[01:40:39.970 --> 01:40:41.790]
he's

[01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.790]

[01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.790]

[01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.790]

[01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.790]

[01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:46.670]
And he's well, the dog well-eating, my son,

[01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:53.090]
Her man, that he will give thee a swollen crown.

[01:40:58.910 --> 01:41:01.910]
He made the Him small, build the money,

[01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:05.770]
Cash all at all, that he sleeps,

[01:41:06.570 --> 01:41:08.650]
And dreamy, of God,

[01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:13.070]
From stains I want, is dreaming,

[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:18.110]
All on my face, is my windows quiver,

[01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:19.770]
Watching Superman,

[01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:24.610]
And Tom Welley, I'm Welley,

[01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:27.430]
Tom Welley, I'm Welley,

[01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:30.330]
Tom Welley, I'm Welley,

[01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:31.490]
Together,

[01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:34.130]
Word for it.

[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:39.070]
Did he say something about Krispy Kreme,

[01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:41.690]
level 03 at 560 WTQ AM?

[01:41:42.690 --> 01:41:44.710]
Look at this, US troops arrive at the Ivory Coast.

[01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:46.310]
Now, what's you like better? Ivory or Coast?

[01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:48.630]
Neither, safe guard.

[01:41:49.410 --> 01:41:49.590]
Oh.

[01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:51.610]
I kind of like, I resphring myself.

[01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:53.590]
I was shard with Ivory, I resphring this morning for anybody

[01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:54.650]
wants to keep track out there.

[01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:56.830]
Although I usually do like coast fairly well.

[01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:58.190]
Ivory, I hate you, I don't know why.

[01:41:58.410 --> 01:41:59.050]
Why? Floats?

[01:41:59.070 --> 01:42:00.490]
Any, any white soap.

[01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:02.350]
Oh yeah, is like lard.

[01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:03.830]
Got that smell too.

[01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:05.770]
Oh, my mother, always,

[01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:07.390]
Anytime my mother used to stay at the house,

[01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:08.790]
Like to take care of the dogs, you know.

[01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:11.550]
And I'd come back from vacation and sure enough,

[01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:14.250]
There'd be a bar of freaking Ivory soap in my shower.

[01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:16.030]
Whatever the good stuff I had in there before,

[01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:17.490]
That was like already Schmidt can, you know.

[01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.650]
And there'd be a bar of Ivory soap,

[01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:22.230]
Square, right.

[01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:24.510]
And you know, and you know, the soap holder,

[01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:26.730]
The little soap dish that's got like the little pegs on it.

[01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:28.210]
And it always makes like little holes

[01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:29.810]
In the bottom of Ivory soap, you know what I'm saying?

[01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:30.310]
Yes.

[01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:34.730]
And you've picked it up and it's like holding a block of lard.

[01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.270]
Mm-hmm.

[01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:36.210]
And you just want to say,

[01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:37.410]
Faaah!

[01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:39.310]
Ma, your taste is in your tush ma.

[01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:41.070]
So I forget about Ivory soap.

[01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:42.290]
But anyway, they land on the Ivory.

[01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:44.110]
Because there's Louisiana, the big EC.

[01:42:44.590 --> 01:42:45.450]
Why do they call it that?

[01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:47.790]
Because it's easy, I guess, to get laid there.

[01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:50.310]
It's a piece of crap New Orleans.

[01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:52.070]
That's one of the few things I agree with Mo about.

[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:52.890]
I heard him this morning,

[01:42:53.170 --> 01:42:55.330]
Railing on New Orleans in the middle of one of his tirades.

[01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:56.650]
He's right about that.

[01:42:56.730 --> 01:42:58.390]
Oh, speaking of Mo and Arnoone to one hour today,

[01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:01.490]
I think there may be kind of like a special theme to some of the bits we're going to play.

[01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.890]
A block?

[01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:04.650]
Yeah, like a block.

[01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:07.270]
A Mo block.

[01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:10.110]
No relation, of course, to her block.

[01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:10.830]
Remember her block?

[01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:11.370]
No.

[01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:14.350]
Coalition wants to change hotel porn channels.

[01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:16.210]
This is something that I want to have people steaming.

[01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:20.230]
A group that helped pull the plug on explicit adult movies

[01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.310]
that three Cincinnati area hotels met,

[01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:23.890]
Monday in Washington, D.C.

[01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:26.270]
with 14 other grassroots organizations

[01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:30.030]
in hopes of exing out such entertainment at lodging nationwide.

[01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:36.090]
I got any idea how many countries in the rest of the world they have.

[01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:38.490]
They have porn on movies on over the year TV.

[01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:39.150]

[01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:41.310]
We're talking about in hotels.

[01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:46.250]
We're going to put on a full-core press to educate people that hotels are distributing

[01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:47.270]
hardcore pornography,

[01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:51.590]
says field-breast, president of the Cincinnati-based citizens for community values.

[01:43:51.970 --> 01:43:55.130]
One of the groups in the coalition that he says represents more than 20 million families

[01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:57.590]
and meets regularly discussed decency issues.

[01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:03.050]
Perez says the coalition will urge attorney general John Hermann Gehring-Asscroft

[01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:05.430]
and the Justice Department to crack down on hotel porn,

[01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:07.490]
which often is distributed across state lines.

[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:11.230]
Susan Dryden, the Justice Department spokeswoman, says the department is committed

[01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:13.030]
to enforcement of federal obscenity laws.

[01:44:13.890 --> 01:44:17.770]
Hotel room pay-per-view offerings have become more graphic in recent years

[01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:19.610]
showing close-ups of all manner of sex acts.

[01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:22.650]
Perez says he ought to know that but she's making a study out of it.

[01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:28.030]
The pro-family groups say kids can access many hotels conflicts at the click of a button.

[01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:31.690]
In August his group alerted prosecutors to the nature of adult therapy,

[01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:33.710]
Maryotte Northeast and Mason O'Hioh,

[01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:35.710]
and at a Newport Kentucky comfort suites.

[01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:38.950]
Authorities got similar complaints about a Newport travel lodge.

[01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:42.310]
The three hotels agreed to stop the offerings after prosecutors said they violated

[01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:44.090]
community standards of decency,

[01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:46.590]
the court tests for whether material is legally obscene.

[01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:49.750]
Currently the American Family Association of Michigan

[01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:54.090]
is urging prosecutors in that state to go after hotels offering explicit

[01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:57.090]
fear in Grand Rapids, Holland, and Midland, Michigan.

[01:44:57.910 --> 01:45:01.390]
Across the country, perhaps unknowingly, hotels are breaking the law.

[01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:04.090]
A lot of them materialized sell open them up to prosecutions,

[01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:06.170]
as Bruce Taylor, a former prosecutor,

[01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:09.810]
and out present of the nonprofit National Law Center for Children's and Families.

[01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:13.410]
Hotel choice, a chain, say they say something outrageous.

[01:45:13.410 --> 01:45:15.330]
It's a matter of choice. What a concept.

[01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:18.410]
We understand that there's a level of sensitivity in different feelings

[01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:21.490]
about the subject matter, says Roger Connore, Maryotte spokesman.

[01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:24.870]
We provide a wide range of choices, and anyone can block adult entertainment out.

[01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:26.130]
Nobody has to see it.

[01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:29.230]
But many guests are choosing the Racy stuff.

[01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:31.350]
It's a major business in the US hotel market,

[01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:34.490]
approximately $500 million a year, as Leonard Sable,

[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:38.370]
president of cable corporate, which helps hotels build for in-room entertainment.

[01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:42.750]
Typically, 50 to 60% of pay-per-view hotel sales involve adult products,

[01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:46.510]
he says, explicitness is increased because the customers wanted.

[01:45:48.250 --> 01:45:50.730]
Tad Walden, vice president of marketing at On Command,

[01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:53.450]
a leading provider of wide range of in-room hotel entertainment,

[01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:56.410]
says it's in all fair as the same is offered by cable companies,

[01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:58.350]
or said like TV companies for home viewing.

[01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:01.390]
And he says we try to adhere to the various standards and various communities.

[01:46:01.810 --> 01:46:06.150]
Meanwhile, the Omni hotel chain, which voluntarily removed adult movies two years ago,

[01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:10.130]
reports that it's lost revenue, but we have had over 50,000 messages of support,

[01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:11.990]
says spokeswoman Kim Blackman.

[01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:13.770]
One traveling businessman wrote,

[01:46:13.770 --> 01:46:16.070]
thanks for taking away the temptation.

[01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:19.590]
Oh, oh, man.

[01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:24.050]
And of course, those letters of support, those are worth what?

[01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:25.250]
Squad.

[01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.490]
Squatsky.

[01:46:28.050 --> 01:46:28.930]
Here's our support.

[01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:30.770]
Where can I go state your hotel?

[01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:34.010]
I ain't got no money, but here we spent $0.37 in the envelope, too.

[01:46:34.190 --> 01:46:34.490]
$0.39.

[01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:36.930]
Yeah, the stock will show you how much of those letters is a dividend.

[01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:39.650]
And of course, they probably are like four letters anyway,

[01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:41.690]
and they're like, they always do all the American family associations,

[01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:45.110]
and all these other phony baloney, so-called family, focus on the family,

[01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:48.590]
focus on your focus, focus on your crotch, all this other crap,

[01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:50.070]
food, and all these people getting.

[01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:52.350]
I got to read that last line again.

[01:46:52.690 --> 01:46:56.270]
Thanks for taking away the temptation and the Supreme's and Mary Wells

[01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:57.850]
and all these other shortzers.

[01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:00.610]
Thanks for taking away the temptation.

[01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:02.070]
Jesus Christ.

[01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:04.090]
Yeah, he's talking about it, too.

[01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:04.870]
And.

[01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:09.690]
See, at least when I put these things together, I put them like in some kind of logical order,

[01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:10.070]
I think.

[01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:13.670]
Try to mix it up a little bit, but if they're related, you just follow what I'm saying?

[01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.930]
Yes.

[01:47:14.290 --> 01:47:15.490]
My pie on my bedtime stories.

[01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:16.510]
Try to keep the theme going.

[01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:18.570]
A statue of limitations.

[01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:20.530]
This is in the Houston Chronicle.

[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:21.490]
Yesterday.

[01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:23.550]
Ever read the Houston Chronicle?

[01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:23.870]
Nope.

[01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.890]
Conroe.

[01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:27.890]
Remember Conroe texted, there was some crap going on in Conroe.

[01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:28.570]
Sounds familiar.

[01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:32.130]
A group of Montgomery County social conservative is claiming two more victories,

[01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:36.570]
one in the form of a new library review policy, the other in the form of a plaster fig leaf.

[01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:43.190]
The latter recently was placed strategically on a replica of Michelangelo's classic statue of David,

[01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:46.550]
which is stood new to top of sporting goods store in the town of Shenandoah.

[01:47:47.150 --> 01:47:50.650]
The former was adopted Monday, after long debate before commissioners court,

[01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:54.650]
giving the head of the Republican leadership council location to claim another success with commissioners.

[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:59.310]
Although the council failed earlier this year to oust the county Republican Party's long time chairman,

[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:02.710]
council president Jim Jenkins counter the new library policy as a win.

[01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:07.810]
But the head of the county Democratic Party, one of the commissioners could be headed down a dangerous path.

[01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:13.830]
The clear and apparent effort that the commissioners court made over time and incremental steps has been to apiece a very impassioned group of voters

[01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:17.210]
in hopes that each baby step would satisfy them and make them go away.

[01:48:17.290 --> 01:48:18.930]
So Democratic chairman Raymond McNeill.

[01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:20.810]
Raymond McNeill.

[01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:21.570]
Oh, God.

[01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.950]
And listening what he considered as group's recent victories, Jim,

[01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:29.950]
can say the RLC is also persuaded commissioners to use an internet filter to screen computers at the library for pornography

[01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:33.130]
and to put plaques reading in God we trust in county libraries.

[01:48:33.670 --> 01:48:39.870]
The group also supported recent efforts to add the touch of modesty to the statue he said and remove some art from an Italian restaurant.

[01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:43.250]
Are you ready for this?

[01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:44.270]
I'm not following.

[01:48:44.690 --> 01:48:49.730]
To remove some art from an Italian restaurant in a private place of business.

[01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:50.390]
Yeah.

[01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:53.910]
But McNeill warned that the commissioners think they have satisfied the group.

[01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:55.950]
They may be in for a big surprise.

[01:48:55.950 --> 01:49:02.990]
Clearly with each incremental step the RLC and its allies have seen each concession as an energizing, mobilizing rallying point,

[01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:05.350]
wedding the appetite for further gains he said.

[01:49:05.670 --> 01:49:08.790]
County Judge Allen B. Sadler denied that the commissioners were catering to the group.

[01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:13.810]
This is being portrayed as if these were exclusively Republican leadership council extremist issues,

[01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:20.430]
said it was started by the Republican leadership council, but we are not reacting necessarily to the Republican leadership council, whatever that means.

[01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:23.110]
He said the issues reflect mainstream opinion in the county.

[01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:29.110]
Jenkins dislikes the terms arts conservative and far right, but county GOP chairman Walter D. Wilkerson Jr.,

[01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:34.750]
a target of the council's iridescent by the success in switching the county from Democrat to Republican stronghold as a different view.

[01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:37.010]
They are not mainstream on the political spectrum.

[01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:45.550]
He said they are out on the radical right and no political organization or movement has ever succeeded in winning an election when they position themselves to the far right or far left of the spectrum.

[01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:51.890]
He said the council overstated his plans of success noting that it's never back to winning candidate for office above precinct chairman.

[01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:55.610]
Well, then everybody would like to be precinct chairman of what precinct.

[01:49:57.510 --> 01:50:05.070]
Although the reason decision by manners of the Portofina shopping center to place a fig leaf on the statue of David did not result from the RLC's action,

[01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:10.710]
the group expressed support for the move. The statue stands up top and Ashman sporting goods store where it moved from eye level.

[01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:13.250]
They moved it so you have to eyeball it.

[01:50:14.630 --> 01:50:19.170]
Diana Witt of Shenandoah who is completely led to the addition of the fig leaf said she shares the RLC's view,

[01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:22.610]
but prefers to call her protest a personal effort by concerned citizen.

[01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:28.850]
She said she's not satisfied with the fig leaf and will press down the statue with someplace where children can't see it without parental permission.

[01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:36.270]
Oh, oh, far worse than a guy and baby crazy people like that.

[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:42.590]
Like the Bushies man like John Ascroft and Hermann and Gary Rumsfeld is this crowd.

[01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:50.410]
Boy, remember what William Holden's wife what that was her name Beatrice Straight in network.

[01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:54.270]
Yes, she said you're in for some dreadful times and he said I know it.

[01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:57.810]
That that line applies so well.

[01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:01.190]
It applies so perfectly to the poor US today.

[01:51:01.710 --> 01:51:03.550]
Don't forget, forget about all this stuff.

[01:51:03.730 --> 01:51:06.750]
Okay, go get yourself some good times while you still can while it's illegal.

[01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:09.530]
Join George and Miguel Bokobrine and Carlos.

[01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:11.410]
Maybe Carlos look at lucky night. What do you think?

[01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.910]
No.

[01:51:12.610 --> 01:51:16.570]
Five to seven at Treasure Island located off the Palmeiro just north of the 120 second street exit.

[01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:19.130]
Maybe Carlos and Fat Boy is Fat Boy going to be there?

[01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:20.110]
I don't know.

[01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:21.150]
He'll be there.

[01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:24.650]
Maybe he'll let you push his chair while a little bit.

[01:51:24.930 --> 01:51:25.390]
I've done that.

[01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:29.670]
Stop by for our usual crappy prizes and two for one drinks.

[01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:31.010]
That's a Treasure Island tonight.

[01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:34.750]
And of course, if Fat Boy is there, you'll need three for one drink to take a puke at him.

[01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:41.170]
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WQAM, Tom Layman and Haleth Potty Act GMC are doing it big time again.

What I'm saying speaking to him, I'm talking about Fat Boy, not Tom Layman, who's a tall, lanky guy.

[01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:12.470]

This is sports when you buy a secure.

[01:52:56.110 --> 01:52:56.970]
You way out.

[01:52:58.290 --> 01:53:00.010]
Hey hang this up baby.

[01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:02.390]

[01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:16.610]
Jamie said right off the bed later.

[01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:20.230]
He bought an investigation to win it in.

[01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:27.190]
They were getting too close to the towel, headed by the head and checked his wall above and threw it in.

[01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:31.070]
We're talking about pushing the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:34.750]

Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:45.530]
If they don't it thinks this one will be fine.

[01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:48.930]
Three thousand miles will never be a pension.

[01:53:49.630 --> 01:53:51.530]
Push you brain, watch, fucking.

[01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:55.770]

[01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.830]

Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:10.250]
Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.570]
If they don't they're a PRP.

[01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:13.950]
Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:17.550]
Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:20.790]
Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:24.750]
Push it to the side, he butt, fuck up.

[01:54:25.330 --> 01:54:27.510]
That's the question of my patient of goryum.

[01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:31.010]
1118, you just sent me a real popo reman,

[01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:33.850]
watching the x-axis of all time, and two of the worst.

[01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:37.990]
Steve, you didn't bother looking at who those emails were from Steve Dangerfield.

[01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:39.050]
I thought a couple of them were.

[01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.750]
They were?

[01:54:41.530 --> 01:54:42.710]
No, they weren't from him.

[01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:44.030]
He didn't send them to us.

[01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.630]
I'm missing the other name that was on the list.

[01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:47.950]
Oh, I see.

[01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.550]
Yeah.

[01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:50.010]
So when in doubt, toss him out.

[01:54:50.190 --> 01:54:51.690]
Anyway, this one from Adam though.

[01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:52.630]
This is the Adam.

[01:54:52.770 --> 01:54:53.810]
I hope you're still listening, baby.

[01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:55.190]
This is the greatest facts I've ever got.

[01:54:55.210 --> 01:54:56.070]
You know what I'm going to do?

[01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:56.930]
I'm going to save this.

[01:54:57.930 --> 01:54:58.850]
I'm going to save this.

[01:54:59.010 --> 01:55:02.450]
And if not, no, seriously, I think I've got the smoking gun for Todd's wreck.

[01:55:02.610 --> 01:55:03.550]
Thank you so much.

[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.630]
Oh, man.

[01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:10.530]
He says, love you guys more than life itself, meaning George and Neil and Adam, believe me, it's mutual.

[01:55:11.290 --> 01:55:13.390]
I mean, this story here, this is so good.

[01:55:14.010 --> 01:55:15.150]
So freaking good.

[01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:18.730]
Was that Todd Dreck?

[01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:21.090]
This is just amazing.

[01:55:21.850 --> 01:55:23.910]
So we got the goods on Utah, Sweetheart.

[01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:24.350]
Okay.

[01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:26.010]
You little piece of crap.

[01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:27.950]
Hey, Todd.

[01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.110]
Let's get some copy in here and quit belly.

[01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:32.610]
Okay.

[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:35.690]
If we're not going to, he thinks the rest of the world is going to do his job, you know.

[01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:37.410]
The agency's going to do it.

[01:55:37.590 --> 01:55:38.490]
The dog's going to do it.

[01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:39.650]
Somebody else is going to do it.

[01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:40.350]
You do it.

[01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:41.330]
You little piece of crap.

[01:55:41.490 --> 01:55:42.370]
You little piece of Dreck.

[01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:43.110]
You scumbag.

[01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:45.370]
You neanderthal idiot.

[01:55:46.150 --> 01:55:48.170]
See what we get at QIM in the sales department.

[01:55:48.250 --> 01:55:50.770]
Generally speaking, it's the rejects from cheap channel.

[01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.810]
And why do we get that?

[01:55:52.010 --> 01:56:00.870]
Because our sales manager, such as she has screw in, her husband happens to be the sales manager for cheap channel, which is one of the most bizarre arrangements in the history of broad chasing.

[01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:02.930]
Whoever heard of such a thing.

[01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:13.130]
So anybody that he can't handle over there, that he can't take anymore like crazy psychotic PD Lenny with his leather skin or Todd Dreck, running these other misfits, they ship him over to her.

[01:56:13.330 --> 01:56:13.710]
Oh, sure.

[01:56:13.810 --> 01:56:14.370]
We'll take anybody.

[01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:16.590]
And then of course, fat boy.

[01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:19.070]
Fat boy.

[01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:21.710]
They're lucky when hella was not a real fire alarm that day, you know.

[01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:24.150]
No, seriously.

[01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:27.810]
Can you imagine a lawsuit and the grease fire?

[01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:29.070]
Man, I'll agree.

[01:56:29.170 --> 01:56:30.050]
Forget about the grease fire.

[01:56:30.170 --> 01:56:31.330]
Talk about no more bratwurst.

[01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:35.090]
We can chuck him over and open up a separate branch.

[01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:36.690]
We could have been barbecuing there for years.

[01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:38.870]
Here's my Dutch friend.

[01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:40.470]
He says, for the more can deal.

[01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:42.130]
Well, I said that good that time.

[01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.990]
Nice Monday.

[01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:45.310]
You had an interesting pull about the calls.

[01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:47.290]
And so I think it'd be nice to take some, but let me ask you something.

[01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:48.510]
What kind of a show would you like to run?

[01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:51.190]
Talk show collars, reading bedtime stories, bitching with George.

[01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:53.050]
I think it's much more fun with all this.

[01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:54.710]
I think it's an asshole's calling in.

[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:58.110]
You find out what people care about nothing, but it does give some former entertainment.

[01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.790]
Exactly.

[01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:01.290]
I don't care as long as you're on until like it is suck, suck.

[01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:02.750]
Do you think we should attack it?

[01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:03.970]
Oh, brother.

[01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.870]
Wow.

[01:57:07.690 --> 01:57:08.270]
Do we?

[01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:09.290]
Cook's in.

[01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:10.330]
Bye bye.

[01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.830]
Calm down.

[01:57:13.630 --> 01:57:16.530]
He had too much of that bad Dutch food, I think, is what his problem was.

[01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:20.170]
Robert Fisk, the dishonesty of the so-called dossier.

[01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:24.930]
He said that.

[01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:30.730]
Look, dossier, the fact that you can still read teleprompter when you get to be a hundred.

[01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:31.990]
I'll give you all the credit in the world.

[01:57:32.130 --> 01:57:32.830]
Chris, I'll be long day.

[01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:35.090]
You know, and here is his whiteest the first time I ever saw him.

[01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:35.630]
Yeah.

[01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:37.190]
He's pathetic.

[01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:38.590]
He's a daughtering old man now.

[01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.750]
And it's very sad.

[01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:42.530]
You know what would be like it like if NBC tried to bring Greg Jack par.

[01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:44.230]
How's he?

[01:57:44.230 --> 01:57:46.290]
You know, wouldn't it be kind of ridiculous?

[01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:47.230]
He is still alive.

[01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:50.230]
Have you seen pictures of him in the tabloids?

[01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.470]
No.

[01:57:50.850 --> 01:57:58.210]
He looks like, you know, when you get to a certain point and maybe he's had so many faceless, he looks like this skin has been stretched over the skeleton of his face.

[01:57:58.330 --> 01:57:58.710]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.950]
Yes.

[01:57:59.410 --> 01:58:00.330]
And Jack par was great.

[01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:01.170]
I love Jack par.

[01:58:01.330 --> 01:58:02.850]
He didn't have too many bigger fans than me.

[01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:03.930]
He had great guests.

[01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.090]
It was a funny-ass show.

[01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.890]
He was great.

[01:58:06.710 --> 01:58:09.890]
And he was, you know, and he was kind of like, you know, like me.

[01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:12.470]
He was a pain in the ass, which I like that.

[01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:14.990]
I like guys who are pain instead of always that.

[01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:18.050]
You know, that kind of fully happy, go lucky crap.

[01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:19.270]
I'm not into that.

[01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:22.870]
I like guys who occasionally will be like a personickity.

[01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:24.350]
You know, he was up in the impersonickity.

[01:58:24.610 --> 01:58:28.350]
And if they crapped on him, he'd get up and walk out and threaten ever to come back, etc.

[01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:29.130]
It was fun.

[01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:31.190]
But anyway, he's done.

[01:58:31.330 --> 01:58:32.050]
That's what I'm trying to say.

[01:58:32.090 --> 01:58:32.530]
It was fun.

[01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:33.490]
But now he's done.

[01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:34.670]
And the same with Phil.

[01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:40.690]
And in the meantime, see what I don't understand is I guess the liberals are watching Smallville on the WB.

[01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:44.530]
And they're watching Racy shows on Fox or they're watching something.

[01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.130]
They're watching porn movies in some hotel.

[01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:48.330]
But they're sure as hell not watching Donahue.

[01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:52.390]
And of course, the right wingers, they're all, they got their shovels out, man.

[01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:56.250]
They're pooper scoopers and they're scooping up all the crap they can get from Bill O'Reilly.

[01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:58.310]
Don't confuse me with the facts of Riley.

[01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:00.630]
I'll say one thing about him.

[01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:01.750]
He may not be accurate.

[01:59:01.890 --> 01:59:02.770]
Release these consistencies.

[01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:04.050]
He's consistently full of it.

[01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:05.390]
There's no idea what he's talking about.

[01:59:05.850 --> 01:59:05.970]
Yep.

[01:59:07.290 --> 01:59:17.370]
If these pages of trickery are based on probably an if we have no business of going to warrant says Robert Fisk in the UK independent 20.

[01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:23.050]
Blair's dossier on Iraq is a shocking document reading it can only fill a decent human being with shaman outrage.

[01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:32.330]
It's pages are final proof if the contents are true that a massive crime against humanity has been committed in Iraq for the details of Saddam's building of weapons of mass destruction.

[01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:39.850]
If they are correct and it will come to ifson buts and quits later, it means that our massive of destructive brutal policy of UN sanctions is totally failed.

[01:59:40.150 --> 01:59:42.910]
In other words, half a million Iraqi children were killed by us for nothing.

[01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:45.470]
Let's go back to May 12, 1996.

[01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:50.850]
Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, had told us that sanctions worked and prevented Saddam from rebuilding weapons of mass destruction.

[01:59:51.230 --> 01:59:54.230]
Our Tory government agreed and Tony Blair faithfully told the line.

[01:59:54.590 --> 01:59:55.470]
He told it the line.

[01:59:55.470 --> 02:00:02.810]
But on May 12, May, Miss Albright appeared on CBS television, Leslie Stahl, the interview asked, we have heard that a half a million children have died.

[02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:06.050]
I mean, that's more than died in Hiroshima and you know, is the price worth it?

[02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:11.330]
To the world's astonishment, Mrs. Albright replied, I think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it.

[02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:14.250]
Even Bob Barker was washing.

[02:00:15.210 --> 02:00:18.330]
Now we know if Mr. Blair is telling us the truth that the price was not worth it.

[02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:22.290]
The price was paid in the lives of hundreds of thousands of children but it wasn't worth a dime.

[02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:37.990]
The Blair dossier tells us that despite sanctions, Saddam was able to go on building weapons of mass destruction, all that nonsense about dual use technology, the ban on children's pencils, because led could have military use and are refusal to allow Iraq to import equipment to restore the water treatment plants that we bombed in the Gulf War was a sham.

[02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:48.410]
This terrible conclusion is the only moral one to be drawn from the 16 pages that supposedly detail the chemical biological nuclear horrors that the beast of Baghdad has in store for us.

[02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:57.270]
It's difficult reading the full report to know whether to laugh or cry, that agree of deceit and duplicity in its production speaks of the trickery that informs the Blair government and its treatment of NPs.

[02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:59.650]
There are a few tidbits that ring true.

[02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:07.350]
The new ammonium teclarate plant illegally supplied by an Indian company which breaches those wonderful U.N. sanctions of course is a frightening little detail.

[02:01:07.610 --> 02:01:13.910]
So is the new rocket test stand at the Al-Rafa plant but this material is so swamped in trickery and navery that its inclusion becomes worthless.

[02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:22.750]
Here's one example of the dishonesty of the dossier on page 45 we're told in a long chapter about Sodom's human right abuses that on March 1st 1991 in the wake of the Gulf War,

[02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:28.170]
riots broke out in the southern city of Basra spreading quickly to other cities and she had dominated southern Iraq.

[02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:30.190]
The regime responded by killing thousands.

[02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:34.190]
What's wrong with this paragraph is the lie in the use of the word riots. They were not riots.

[02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:40.910]
They were part of a mass rebellion specifically called for by President Bush Jr.'s father and by a CIA radio station in Saudi Arabia.

[02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:49.210]
The Shia Muslims of Iraq obeyed Mr. Bush Jr.'s appeal and they were then left to their fate by the Americans in British who they had been given every reason to believe would come to their help.

[02:01:49.450 --> 02:01:51.030]
Just like the Hungarians by the way in 56.

[02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:54.950]
Yes. No wonder they died in their thousands but that's not what the Blair dossier tells us.

[02:01:55.530 --> 02:02:02.890]
And anyone reading the weasel words no doubt are that are insinuated throughout this text can only have profound concern about the basis for which Britain is now to go and set to go to war.

[02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:06.870]
The Iraqi weapon program is almost certainly seeking to enrich uranium.

[02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:09.950]
It appears that Iraq has attempted to require a magnet production line.

[02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:14.630]
There is evidence that Iraq has tried to require specialized aluminum tubes using the enrichment of uranium.

[02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:19.090]
But there is no definite intelligence that it is destined for a nuclear program.

[02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:23.530]
If Iraq obtained fissile material, Iraq can produce nuclear weapons in one or two years.

[02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:26.870]
It's difficult to judge whether all who say missiles could be available for use.

[02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:33.750]
Efforts to regenerate the Iraqi missile program probably began in 1995 and so that the dossier goes on if sin buts and probabilities and maybe.

[02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:38.830]
Now maybe said on as we started is WMD program let's say it all out 20 times.

[02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:49.070]
Sodom is a brutal wicked tyrant but are almost certainly appears probably and if really the rallying called a scenario or when the years off to the deserts of Kut al-Amara, where the hell is.

[02:02:50.250 --> 02:02:53.690]
There's high praise for you and weapons inspectors and there's more trickery in the relevant chapter.

[02:02:54.030 --> 02:03:01.090]
A course doctor hands blitzed we've been in to that before executive chairman of the wind inspection commission saying that the absence of post 1998 inspections.

[02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:11.370]
It's impossible to verify Iraqi disarmament compliance but on August 16 of this year the very same doctor blitz told the AP that he couldn't say what certainty that Baghdad does possess weapons of mass destruction.

[02:03:11.590 --> 02:03:14.290]
This question is excites on the blood dossier of course.

[02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:21.650]
So there it is if these pages of trickery are based on probably and if we have no business going to war if they are all true we murder half a million Iraqi children.

[02:03:21.930 --> 02:03:23.070]
How's that for a war crime?

[02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:31.230]
Just mention that in passing Tony 1127 at 560 WQM.

[02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.710]
Let me tell you about an exciting thing coming up in just a couple of days.

[02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:45.850]
Pompadot Park is back in action starting this Friday September 27 new first race post time 715 PM and for the first time in the 40 year history of Pompadot Park there'll be free clubhouse and and let me say it again.

[02:03:45.850 --> 02:03:50.210]
Free clubhouse and free grants and admission all season long and it's always free general parking.

[02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:56.490]
Tunnel wagers this season come play the super super with a $10,000 bonus payout or try one of their two pick four wagers.

[02:03:56.870 --> 02:04:02.810]
For opening night this Friday there'll be free prize drawing to win one of five trips for two to the Crystal Palace casino hotel in Assabahamas.

[02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:09.450]
Bring the children out too because opening that will be the first of Pompadot Park's monthly family family fun nights with free popcorn coloring contest,

[02:04:09.450 --> 02:04:15.310]
clowns, face painting, animal balloons, gifts and of course the family was Pompadot Park miniature horses giving rise from 7 to 9 PM.

[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:18.010]
There also be lots of giveaways free spins on the prize wheel.

[02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:24.610]
I think they stole ours and special displays for the parents too for the next three weeks Pompadot Park will be open for live racing your Friday and Saturday.

[02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:29.030]
The track is open of course every day seven days a night a week for simultaneous testing starting at noon.

[02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:31.150]
Pompadot Park power line road blocks out of the line.

[02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:38.390]
People of our don't forget new post time starting this Friday night 7 15 PM free clubhouse free grants that emission and free general parking as well.

[02:04:38.590 --> 02:04:40.430]
Line line local.

[02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:44.630]
Here's sports radio five 60s you a you a M.

Dine up here.

[02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:55.450]
No start.

[02:04:55.690 --> 02:04:56.330]
I'm.

[02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:57.850]
A lot more.

[02:04:59.330 --> 02:05:00.410]
I.

[02:05:00.410 --> 02:05:01.990]
They say their weapons.

[02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.990]
I say.

[02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:10.390]
A couple mega times.

[02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:12.250]
I'm.

[02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.710]
Oh.

[02:05:17.530 --> 02:05:19.110]
In the gold.

[02:05:20.110 --> 02:05:21.730]
Let him off the hook.

[02:05:23.230 --> 02:05:26.570]
I think it's time to give his.

[02:05:29.090 --> 02:05:31.830]
So it's time to.

[02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:32.690]
Those people.

[02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:35.030]
On the right.

[02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:40.750]
I'll be right.

[02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:43.450]
Till the.

[02:05:43.450 --> 02:05:43.990]

And.

[02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:13.590]
If we.

[02:06:14.590 --> 02:06:15.130]
If we.

Because.

[02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:28.430]
I'm.

[02:06:29.590 --> 02:06:34.590]
Bring it to an end.

[02:06:34.590 --> 02:06:40.590]
I'm.

[02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:46.310]

I'm.

[02:07:05.210 --> 02:07:05.970]
I'm.

[02:07:26.490 --> 02:07:27.750]
I'm.

[02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:29.850]
I'm.

[02:07:35.850 --> 02:07:40.050]
I'm.

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.050]

[02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:54.750]
I'm.

[02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:56.390]

I'm.

[02:08:21.250 --> 02:08:21.750]
I'm.

[02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.790]

[02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.790]

[02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.790]

[02:08:21.970 --> 02:08:23.390]
I'm.

[02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:24.930]
328 votes on our pool.

[02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:28.030]
What's your take on TV show Smallville,

[02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:30.150]
which was a very emotional episode last night.

[02:08:30.170 --> 02:08:32.350]
It was just a gut wrencher.

[02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:33.130]
What's your take?

[02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:34.790]
Well, we're good time, Vangel.

[02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:38.190]
So I was in the war and I said, without question,

[02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:42.030]
I can't bring myself to believe that it is.

[02:08:42.930 --> 02:08:46.330]
I can't believe any president or any administration

[02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:48.190]
would politicize the war.

[02:08:50.670 --> 02:08:53.750]
But then I read in the paper this morning.

[02:08:57.110 --> 02:08:59.270]
Now, even the president.

[02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:04.650]
The president is quoted in the Washington Post this morning

[02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:12.090]
as saying that the Democratic-controlled Senate

[02:09:12.090 --> 02:09:17.710]
is not interested in the security of the American people.

[02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:23.910]
Not interested in the security of the American people.

[02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:28.650]
You tell Senator Inouye he's not interested in the security

[02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:29.830]
of the American people.

[02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:34.230]
You tell those who fought in Vietnam and in World War II,

[02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:38.270]
they're not interested in the security of the American people.

[02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:39.550]
That is outrageous.

[02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:41.610]
Outrageous.

[02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:49.690]
The president ought to apologize to Senator Inouye,

[02:09:49.890 --> 02:09:53.210]
and every veteran who has fought in every war

[02:09:53.210 --> 02:09:56.210]
who is a Democrat in the United States Senate.

[02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:59.870]
He ought to apologize to the American people.

[02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:02.470]
That is wrong.

[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:06.450]
We are not politicizing this war.

[02:10:07.650 --> 02:10:11.330]
We are not politicizing the rhetoric about war and life and death.

[02:10:15.110 --> 02:10:18.790]
I was in Normandy just last year.

[02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:23.850]
I've been a national cemetery all over this country.

[02:10:25.810 --> 02:10:28.070]
And I have never seen anything but stars

[02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:32.450]
at the star of David and Crosseys on those markers.

[02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:35.870]
I've never seen Republican and Democrat.

[02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:45.990]
Thomas Pist, Tom Daschel, Piston fired up.

[02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:49.050]
And again, it's that George W. Mantell.

[02:10:49.150 --> 02:10:50.950]
It's the good guys against the bad guys.

[02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:52.030]
It's us against them.

[02:10:52.150 --> 02:10:53.510]
It's the Cowboys and Indians.

[02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:55.630]
It's put on the old Cowboy hat in the six-shooter.

[02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:57.070]
And let's go get the evil doers.

[02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:58.490]
You made the widest or against this.

[02:10:59.430 --> 02:11:02.410]
That whole thing that he started back on a year ago,

[02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:04.310]
right after 9-11, when that first speech about either

[02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:05.290]
widest or against us,

[02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:08.430]
dividing everything into black and white, wooden, evil.

[02:11:08.770 --> 02:11:10.350]
It just cramped.

[02:11:11.590 --> 02:11:13.830]
That's right, my way or the highway is absolutely correct, sir.

[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:17.250]
You'll gunsling in gun-toten bullcrab.

[02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:20.430]
So Tom Daschel actually grew a little pear.

[02:11:20.490 --> 02:11:21.750]
He's a little bit hoarse this morning.

[02:11:21.810 --> 02:11:22.710]
How many people were on that age?

[02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.570]
Small or...

[02:11:23.970 --> 02:11:25.130]
That's all, or...

[02:11:25.650 --> 02:11:28.030]
Well, at least one thing he didn't say this morning was...

[02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:28.670]
Antrague.

[02:11:28.690 --> 02:11:29.250]
He didn't say that.

[02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:31.710]
Okay, 20 before the hour.

[02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:32.510]
Let's get serious.

[02:11:32.630 --> 02:11:33.210]
Let's do the break.

[02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:34.590]
Let's get into that new hour.

[02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:35.610]
Let's give you a few laughs.

[02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:37.610]
We don't want to get all bogged down in his war step.

[02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:38.570]
Even though it's coming,

[02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:41.330]
whether everybody likes it or not.

[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:44.330]
And by the way, in spite of Tony Blair's impassioned appeal,

[02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:47.510]
the overwhelming majority of Brits are against the Brits

[02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:49.750]
doing anything unless the UN drafts a resolution

[02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:50.850]
and they go in there and do the...

[02:11:50.850 --> 02:11:52.350]
And so was he, by the way.

[02:11:53.230 --> 02:11:54.510]
So was Tony Blair in his speech,

[02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:57.190]
which you got twisted out of context yesterday.

[02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:59.430]
He didn't say, hey, let's go in and kick his ass.

[02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:02.570]
He said, do you want to draft a resolution?

[02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:04.050]
And we need to go in there and take a look,

[02:12:04.210 --> 02:12:05.870]
and the scour, et cetera, and so on.

[02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:08.430]
And if they don't comply, then we'll go in there and kick his ass.

[02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:12.290]
Not just because we got the gun tolling cowboy over there in the West.

[02:12:13.630 --> 02:12:14.630]
Very sad, pathetic.

[02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:16.010]
How's that market doing, by the way?

[02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:17.370]
It was off to a good start this morning.

[02:12:18.090 --> 02:12:20.190]
Now is up 73, Nasdaq's up 14.

[02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:21.310]
Nothing spectacular.

[02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:24.970]
77, 57, 51 and 1 and 1 about it.

[02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:26.950]
By the way, some microsystems about 2.5 bucks.

[02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:27.350]
Want some?

[02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:29.250]
Yeah.

[02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:31.370]
Got some palm about 77 cents.

[02:12:31.630 --> 02:12:32.050]
For free?

[02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:37.050]
20 till noon at 5.60 WQIM.

[02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:40.830]
The likes of West Volko doesn't give me anything for free over there,

[02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:41.870]
but just about next to it,

[02:12:41.970 --> 02:12:44.950]
because they got the lowest prices in the universe on Atkins-Died products.

[02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.890]
That's right.

[02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:49.950]
The likes of your official Atkins-Died retail center at All Atkins-Brands

[02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:51.550]
are 25% off today.

[02:12:51.970 --> 02:12:52.490]
Next, Sookas.

[02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:55.130]
Hey, happy Sookas every day.

[02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:57.670]
The likes carry the complete line of Atkins-Died products,

[02:12:57.850 --> 02:13:00.510]
as well as over 500 delicious low carb and sugar free foods.

[02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:02.850]
For you fat people out there who are desperate to lose weight,

[02:13:03.110 --> 02:13:05.590]
believe me, low carb dieting works for a lot of people.

[02:13:06.170 --> 02:13:09.050]
And if you want to store that's entirely devoted to you, this is the place.

[02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:13.430]
The likes of West Volko, they've been your leader in the low carb sugar free diet field for a year and years now.

Over 100 of their slimmer and heavy customers will testify.

[02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:17.590]
There's no better store.

[02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:18.330]
There's no competition.

[02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:19.790]
The likes will not be under sole.

[02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:21.750]
And of course, they got those great pasta sauces too,

[02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:24.450]
which I love, which are some of the best in the world with almost no carbs.

[02:13:24.970 --> 02:13:27.210]
And of course, you can try anything in the store before you buy it too,

[02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.890]
which you won't find it.

[02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:29.550]
Certainly, I'm going to find out in your supermarket.

[02:13:29.550 --> 02:13:32.390]
The likes friendly and knowledgeable staff will walk you through the store,

[02:13:32.570 --> 02:13:35.950]
pointing right direction, show you the mess that TD Lenny left on the floor,

[02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:38.590]
and sure you want as the pounds come flying off your formerly.

[02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:40.070]
Tubby body.

[02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:42.130]
Don't forget there's only one Delights of West Volko.

You'll find them on the northeast corner of Glades in 441 and Volko.

[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:52.610]
You can call them at this tool free number, 1-877 low carb,

and you can check them out on the web if you like it, lowcarb.com.

[02:13:56.150 --> 02:13:57.770]

You'll find out your official Atkins Died retail center.

[02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:02.210]
My, my, and Volko.

[02:14:02.370 --> 02:14:04.110]
This is Fort Real by City.

[02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:06.290]
Where you a-ha.

[02:14:07.650 --> 02:14:09.750]
They have just tasted your snive-ro.

[02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:11.250]
It's big, Nell. It's big in a border.

[02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:19.410]
There is a child living down in Mexico

[02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:24.890]
who has to go to work every day.

[02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:28.750]
She sits at his desk,

[02:14:29.970 --> 02:14:31.870]
making clothes for caffeine,

[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:34.250]
loves the work,

[02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:37.390]
but doesn't love the pain.

[02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:43.570]
They are the kids who make the clothing.

[02:14:45.090 --> 02:14:48.250]
They are the ones who make a bucket of days

[02:14:48.250 --> 02:14:49.230]
of quick-coming.

[02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:53.770]
It's just close to making.

[02:14:55.330 --> 02:14:57.730]
The kind you love to buy.

[02:14:58.510 --> 02:15:01.750]
It's true to make a bucket of day with caffeine.

[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:05.210]
145. What do you want?

[02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:06.290]
That's what Carlos is making.

[02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:07.310]
Now you gotta start slow.

[02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:09.110]
You know, he can't start at the top of the totem pool.

[02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:11.270]
That's what Ron Diaz always said.

[02:15:13.730 --> 02:15:15.870]
246 votes on our pool, speaking of polls,

[02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:16.490]
and we asked,

[02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:18.810]
what's your take on the TV show Smallville?

[02:15:19.150 --> 02:15:20.610]
Certainly one of the most brilliant shows.

[02:15:20.890 --> 02:15:23.210]
See, it's not just the fact that there's a hot-looking people on it.

[02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:24.190]
Show it's a good show.

[02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:26.450]
You don't think?

[02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:28.110]
It's a fine show, not really.

[02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:29.270]
The stories are compelling,

[02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:30.890]
and they're interesting,

[02:15:31.130 --> 02:15:32.710]
and they like leave you hanging for a little bit more,

[02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:33.550]
and whatever.

[02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:36.410]
That bump on the back of Lexus had really bugs, Nino.

[02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:38.590]
Well, I think he may bump them off,

[02:15:38.650 --> 02:15:39.490]
is what may happen.

[02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:42.550]
Because now, as last night's episode ends,

[02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:43.550]
there's still buddy buddy,

[02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:45.630]
and even what he saves,

[02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:47.170]
what's his name, Jonathan's life.

[02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:48.670]
Lex, by shooting the other guy there,

[02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:49.750]
he knows he's a reporter.

[02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:54.030]
And finally, they reach out,

[02:15:54.170 --> 02:15:55.590]
and a little bit of a handshake,

[02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:57.050]
but you just have that feeling like,

[02:15:57.170 --> 02:15:58.230]
this ain't gonna last too long.

[02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:58.810]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:15:59.010 --> 02:15:59.970]
You're gonna last too long.

[02:16:01.190 --> 02:16:02.130]
Send it approves into,

[02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:04.770]
and by the way, something, yes.

[02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:07.790]
I have this new into one hour

[02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:08.730]
that I'm compiling today,

[02:16:08.730 --> 02:16:09.670]
or Wednesday, new to one hour.

[02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:11.910]
I think it's gonna be amazing.

[02:16:12.850 --> 02:16:13.210]
Okay.

[02:16:13.210 --> 02:16:14.470]
I'm just looking.

[02:16:14.570 --> 02:16:15.570]
I'm taking a look at the resources

[02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:17.230]
that we have here available for this hour.

[02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:18.810]
I think it's gonna be pretty entertaining,

[02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:19.790]
as they say in the business.

[02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.950]
Intertaining.

[02:16:23.150 --> 02:16:24.810]
I couldn't be wrong, but we'll see.

[02:16:25.770 --> 02:16:26.710]
Senate approves independent panel

[02:16:26.710 --> 02:16:28.030]
to probe September 11th attacks.

[02:16:28.670 --> 02:16:30.350]
The Senate voted yesterday to set up

[02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:32.110]
an independent commission with broad powers

[02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:33.230]
to investigate the events leading

[02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:34.710]
to the 9-11 attacks in their aftermath.

[02:16:35.210 --> 02:16:36.510]
President Bush again urged Congress

[02:16:36.510 --> 02:16:37.830]
to finish work on his proposed

[02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:39.530]
Homeland Security Department.

[02:16:40.290 --> 02:16:41.870]
The vote to create the new 10-member commission

[02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:44.130]
was 90-8 and came less than a week

[02:16:44.130 --> 02:16:45.130]
after the Bush administration

[02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:46.170]
dropped its opposition.

[02:16:46.710 --> 02:16:48.010]
The measure by senators Jew

[02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:49.630]
Lieberman Democratic Connecticut

[02:16:49.630 --> 02:16:51.410]
and John McCain, Republican

[02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:52.790]
and Arizona, was an attached

[02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:54.370]
as a member to the Homeland Security Bill,

[02:16:54.610 --> 02:16:55.750]
and we're glad to see McCain's face

[02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:56.910]
here and up again too, you know what?

[02:16:58.670 --> 02:16:58.910]
Yeah.

[02:16:59.550 --> 02:17:00.810]
He's looking a lot better now.

[02:17:00.930 --> 02:17:02.350]
He was looking pretty grim there for a while.

[02:17:04.050 --> 02:17:05.250]
McCain said the commission's work

[02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.150]
will tell the American people

[02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:07.190]
the truth about how our government

[02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:08.270]
was not prepared for the threat

[02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:09.910]
of catastrophic terrorism last September.

[02:17:10.410 --> 02:17:13.030]
Earlier, the Senate defeated by a 70-28

[02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:15.030]
measure by Senator Robert Burr

[02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:16.590]
of West Virginia that would have required

[02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:18.370]
Bush to gain additional congressional approval

[02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:20.350]
in three stages over 13 months

[02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:22.450]
as 22 federal agencies are transferred

[02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:23.830]
to a new cabinet level agency.

[02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:25.810]
Bush told reporters after a cabinet

[02:17:25.810 --> 02:17:27.030]
meeting that there's still time to get

[02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:28.130]
a Homeland Security Bill done,

[02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:30.150]
one who will give us all the tools

[02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:31.850]
necessary to protect the homeland.

[02:17:32.970 --> 02:17:35.110]
I think Tom Wellings got all the tools we need.

[02:17:35.930 --> 02:17:37.530]
The commission idea gained a boost

[02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:39.150]
with last week's reversal by the administration,

[02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:40.610]
which had opposed an independent panel,

[02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:41.650]
but it's now endorsing it.

[02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:43.430]
The White House objects to some language

[02:17:43.430 --> 02:17:44.910]
in the Senate measure that McCain said

[02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:46.190]
it compromised with and reached.

[02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:48.390]
The Senate created commission's pro-

[02:17:48.390 --> 02:17:49.890]
would be much broader than a house version

[02:17:49.890 --> 02:17:52.230]
limited mainly to post-9-loven intelligence issues.

[02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:53.630]
The Senate panel would have authority

[02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:55.050]
to look into the roles of law enforcement,

[02:17:55.390 --> 02:17:57.090]
commercial aviation, U.S. diplomacy,

[02:17:57.590 --> 02:17:58.550]
border control, and immigration

[02:17:58.550 --> 02:17:59.710]
in addition to intelligence.

[02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:02.510]
An initial report would be due within six months

[02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:03.810]
with the final report within a year

[02:18:03.810 --> 02:18:05.850]
on recommendations to prevent future attacks.

[02:18:06.210 --> 02:18:07.490]
The measure authorizes $3 million

[02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:09.010]
to cover the commission's costs.

[02:18:09.890 --> 02:18:12.010]
Opponents of the defeated congressional oversight of amendment

[02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:13.670]
said it would unduly delay implementing

[02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:15.190]
a Homeland Security Agency originally

[02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:17.590]
needed to protect Americans inside U.S. borders.

[02:18:18.430 --> 02:18:20.390]
There would be no assurance in the end that anything

[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:22.010]
would be transferred to the new department said

[02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:23.790]
Senator Jew Lieberman Chiefspot

[02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:25.330]
through the Democratic Homeland Security Bill

[02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.510]
it would indefinitely remain a bare-bones department.

[02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:31.690]
The FBI was aware this is in a herald,

[02:18:31.770 --> 02:18:32.430]
so it must be true.

[02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:33.070]
Could be.

[02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:34.190]
You think?

[02:18:34.590 --> 02:18:34.970]
Maybe.

[02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:37.990]
The FBI was aware as early as 1998

[02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:40.130]
that terrorist groups were planning to send students

[02:18:40.130 --> 02:18:41.330]
to the U.S. for pilot training,

[02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:42.550]
and there was some of them in law

[02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:43.890]
and the personal pilot of the 10-day

[02:18:43.890 --> 02:18:44.850]
flight school in the local home

[02:18:44.850 --> 02:18:47.090]
a later attended by Zacharias Musawi.

[02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:50.970]
But those earlier reports along with the Phoenix FBI agents

[02:18:50.970 --> 02:18:53.370]
warning in 2000 about terrorist taking flight training

[02:18:53.370 --> 02:18:55.010]
and the Musawi case in Minnesota

[02:18:55.010 --> 02:18:57.370]
were never analyzed together at FBI headquarters

[02:18:57.370 --> 02:18:59.970]
a joint House Senate investigation revealed yesterday.

[02:19:00.610 --> 02:19:02.490]
You see the one FBI agent who was sitting again

[02:19:02.490 --> 02:19:03.330]
behind the finger and said

[02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:05.230]
you jeopardized my lives by revealing my identity?

[02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:06.030]
No, I didn't.

[02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:07.050]
There was a straight in front of him.

[02:19:07.430 --> 02:19:08.170]
Somebody leaked it out.

[02:19:08.650 --> 02:19:09.870]
I'm not saying that you see him,

[02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:10.550]
but did you hear the other thing?

[02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:11.170]
No, I saw the thing, yes.

[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:12.690]
One many applicants, smart ass.

[02:19:12.810 --> 02:19:13.330]
One many applicants,

[02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:14.490]
a lot of people became so frustrated

[02:19:14.490 --> 02:19:16.710]
that FBI headquarters didn't take on the Musawi case.

[02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:19.730]
Seriously, they told a Washington agent on August 27th

[02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:21.630]
he was trying to make sure Musawi did not take control

[02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:23.770]
of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center.

[02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.550]
A direct quote.

[02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:26.250]
FBI headquarters replied,

[02:19:26.590 --> 02:19:27.490]
that's not going to happen.

[02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:28.690]
We don't know he's a terrorist.

[02:19:28.850 --> 02:19:30.090]
You don't have enough to show he's a terrorist.

[02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:32.050]
And by the way, in that book for bitten truth,

[02:19:32.050 --> 02:19:33.550]
the French surgeon had the information

[02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:35.410]
and gave it to us over and over again,

[02:19:35.470 --> 02:19:36.110]
but we just didn't mock.

[02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:37.350]
We couldn't be confused with it.

[02:19:38.350 --> 02:19:40.350]
The Minneapolis agent said he wasn't speaking literally

[02:19:40.350 --> 02:19:41.970]
but merely trying to get headquarters attention.

[02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:45.330]
Three FBI agents testifying behind a black screen

[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:46.250]
to conceal their identities,

[02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:47.190]
said he yesterday,

[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:49.010]
hearing their communications inside the FBI

[02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:50.170]
have improved since 9-11,

[02:19:50.350 --> 02:19:51.030]
but not enough,

[02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:53.510]
according to the Phoenix agent, not enough.

[02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:56.250]
The investigative staff concluded no one will ever know

[02:19:56.250 --> 02:19:58.370]
whether a greater focus on the connection between those events

[02:19:58.370 --> 02:20:00.430]
would have led to the unraveling of the 9-11 plot

[02:20:00.430 --> 02:20:02.350]
but clearly it might have drawn greater attention

[02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:04.290]
to the possibility of a terrorist attack in the US,

[02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:06.990]
generated a heightened state of alert regarding such attacks,

[02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:08.770]
and prompted more aggressive investigation

[02:20:08.770 --> 02:20:10.950]
and intelligence gathering, it says.

[02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:13.010]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:20:13.810 --> 02:20:14.530]
Like I kept saying,

[02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:16.790]
it seems to me I kept saying in those days after 9-11,

[02:20:16.970 --> 02:20:18.030]
this didn't have to happen

[02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:21.350]
since we were already getting this information back then.

[02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:22.570]
This didn't have to happen.

[02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:25.470]
But when you have a government

[02:20:25.470 --> 02:20:27.350]
where the right hand not only doesn't tell the left hand

[02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:27.910]
what's going on,

[02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:29.550]
doesn't even know where to find the left hand.

[02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:33.830]
West Nile virus stretching health resources CDC says.

[02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:35.830]
The epidemic of West Nile virus,

[02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:37.410]
which has killed 94 people this year,

[02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:39.450]
and made nearly 2000 stick, stick, stick,

[02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:42.530]
has stressed the resources of the US public health system

[02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:43.450]
officials had yesterday.

[02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:46.030]
The virus has also thrown up a few surprises,

[02:20:46.450 --> 02:20:47.590]
spreading faster than predicted,

[02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:50.930]
causing a previously unseen polio-like disease and some,

[02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:53.030]
and getting it adornated blood and organs

[02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:54.410]
officials told US Congress.

[02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:56.670]
Dr. Julie Gerberding,

[02:20:56.890 --> 02:20:58.630]
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

[02:20:58.630 --> 02:21:01.470]
said the agency received $29 million this year

[02:21:01.470 --> 02:21:02.790]
to spend fighting West Nile virus.

[02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:05.150]
That money was used to show up surveillance and tracking

[02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.690]
in birds.

[02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:08.530]
She told a hearing of the Senate governmental affairs committee.

[02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:10.690]
Although the agency responded well with the epidemic,

[02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:13.190]
Gerberding said she thought the system was stretched.

[02:21:13.570 --> 02:21:15.170]
When it doubt, stretch it out.

[02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:18.410]
West Nile first diagnosed an AUGandin woman in 1937

[02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:20.710]
is common in Africa, southern Europe,

[02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:22.810]
and the Middle East but only appeared in the West in 1999.

[02:21:22.810 --> 02:21:25.670]
It spread to much of the country this year as well as Canada,

[02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.970]
Oi!

[02:21:27.490 --> 02:21:28.190]
And the Cayman Islands.

[02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:31.370]
The population were most concerned about the elderly people

[02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:33.310]
who were at highest risk of the severe form of disease.

[02:21:33.810 --> 02:21:34.530]
Gerberding said,

[02:21:35.410 --> 02:21:37.110]
Bird services hosted the West Nile virus.

[02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:38.490]
Let me say it again.

[02:21:38.610 --> 02:21:40.350]
Birds serve as the host of the West Nile virus,

[02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:42.690]
which is spread by mosquitoes to other birds as well as

[02:21:42.690 --> 02:21:44.930]
the people, horses, and squirrels.

[02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:47.690]
Most mosquitoes that transmit this virus

[02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:48.790]
live in suburban backyards.

[02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:51.070]
Gerberding said she advised people to wear long sleeves

[02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:54.190]
and pants, use insect repellents and drain-standing water

[02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:55.870]
from bird bats and outside containers.

[02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:59.450]
Dr. Jesse Goodman, deputy director of the FDA's Center

[02:21:59.450 --> 02:22:00.910]
for Biologics, Evaluation and Research,

[02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:03.130]
said it's important to develop screening tests to protect

[02:22:03.130 --> 02:22:05.830]
the nation's blood supply and scarce donor organs.

[02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:07.710]
Protect your organ at all costs, okay?

[02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.250]
Okay.

[02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:11.730]
Judge declares death penalty unconstitutional.

[02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:12.250]
Oi!

[02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:15.490]
The federal death penalty law was ruled unconstitutional

[02:22:15.490 --> 02:22:17.330]
by a U.S. District Court judge yesterday,

[02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:20.050]
calling into question capital cases all across the country.

[02:22:21.430 --> 02:22:24.070]
Judge William Sessions said a trio of recent U.S. Supreme

[02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:26.890]
Court cases has forced judges to reexamine how capital

[02:22:26.890 --> 02:22:30.170]
punishment is imposed and has made it impossible to continue

[02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:31.290]
using the federal statute.

[02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:34.390]
Capital punishment is under siege, Sessions wrote.

[02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:36.490]
Well, let's take here that too good, which right away then,

[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:37.530]
okay, before they change their mind?

[02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.270]
Let's go.

[02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:42.190]
The federal law unconstitutionalized people convicted the

[02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:44.410]
capital crimes the right to confront across examine witnesses

[02:22:44.410 --> 02:22:46.110]
before they are sentenced to death, he said.

[02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:48.690]
If the death penalty needs to be part of our system of justice,

[02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:51.510]
due process of law and the fair trial guarantees of the 6th Amendment

[02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:54.090]
required that standards and safeguards governing all kinds of evidence

[02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:57.430]
juries may consider must be rigorous and constitutional rights and liberties

[02:22:57.430 --> 02:22:59.370]
scrupulously protect these eb-sand.

[02:22:59.930 --> 02:23:02.790]
To relax those standards invites abuse and significantly undermines

[02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:04.750]
the reliability of decisions to impose the death penalty.

[02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:07.770]
The federal prosecutor in the Vermont case involving a man accused of

[02:23:07.770 --> 02:23:10.370]
card-jacking, kidnapping and murder, said he was nearly certain,

[02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:12.690]
he would ask an appeals court to overrule Sessions.

[02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:16.070]
I anticipate or have every expectation that will take an appeal

[02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.070]

[02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:18.330]
He was attorney Peter Hall said.

[02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:21.350]
And here's some good news for you.

[02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:24.050]
Like I said, here's some bad news for you.

[02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:27.410]
I'm not even going to get to the Rumsfeld story about hermongering Rumsfeld

[02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:30.150]
who says the NATO alliance must, alliance must gain powers.

[02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:33.350]
I think he's losing it.

[02:23:33.430 --> 02:23:35.230]
I think he's become William Hague all over again.

[02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:37.430]
Alexander Hague, whatever the hell the guy's name was.

[02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:38.290]
Hydro Kimberler.

[02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:39.310]
Alexander the Great.

[02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:43.690]
Fred Olaink, whose tips are frequently a target for nutrition,

[02:23:43.690 --> 02:23:46.570]
said yesterday, it would eliminate an especially harmful type of

[02:23:46.570 --> 02:23:49.050]
fat from its products and offer more reduced fat snacks.

[02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:50.850]
Like I said, bad news.

[02:23:51.690 --> 02:23:54.310]
Fast food and snack makers have come under increasing pressure to help

[02:23:54.310 --> 02:23:57.590]
reverse a trend toward moral obesity, especially among American children.

[02:23:58.370 --> 02:24:01.190]
By early next year, Fred Olaink said they'll switch from hydrogenated oils

[02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:05.490]
containing trans fatty acids who's been screaming about those for years on his show,

[02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:06.010]
by the way.

[02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:08.870]
To Corn Oil.

[02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.870]
Of Corn Oil is no good.

[02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:12.370]
In cooking some of its most popular salty chips like Doritos,

[02:24:12.370 --> 02:24:13.410]
Doritos, Doritos and Cheetos.

[02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:14.350]
I do like Doritos.

[02:24:14.970 --> 02:24:15.390]
Mm-hmm.

[02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:16.110]
And Doritos.

[02:24:16.650 --> 02:24:17.230]
And Cheetos.

[02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:18.130]
And Cheetos.

[02:24:19.870 --> 02:24:21.050]
And one of those orange things.

[02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:22.190]
Those are Cheetos.

[02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:23.770]
Like I said, I like them.

[02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:24.970]
I don't eat them, but I like them.

[02:24:25.310 --> 02:24:27.690]
The company will also rule out reduced fat versions of its layers,

[02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:29.290]
potato chips and Cheetos in the next few months,

[02:24:29.610 --> 02:24:32.870]
do any lighter products such as its baked layers and baked Doritos chips.

[02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:34.510]
I like baked layers, too, as a matter of fact.

[02:24:35.050 --> 02:24:36.950]
You can't eat only one bag.

[02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.850]
I don't like the baked ones.

[02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.810]
Oh, I like them.

[02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:40.550]
You can't eat only one pound.

[02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:44.130]
Feeder Lays also available in products such as broccoli flicked.

[02:24:44.390 --> 02:24:44.570]
Flicked.

[02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:46.770]
Broccoli, flicked chips.

[02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:50.310]
Oh, brother, let's try that one more time or not, as the case may be.

[02:24:50.970 --> 02:24:53.290]
Broccoli, flicked chips to appeal to health conscious consumers.

[02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:54.530]
Some of those are like a dog.

[02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:57.290]
And more like that is broccoli in there where I have flicked broccoli.

[02:24:58.650 --> 02:24:59.370]
Albarado Brew.

[02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:02.650]
Cheap executive of Feeder Lays North America said that Feeder Lays

[02:25:02.650 --> 02:25:04.610]
working to be part of a solution in the obesity problem.

[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:08.310]
He said sales of healthier snacks are growing at 20% a year.

[02:25:08.310 --> 02:25:11.150]
Almost as fast as our waste lines are growing is what he said.

[02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:13.850]
Can't eat only 5,000 is what he said.

[02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:15.470]
Axe murderer.

[02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:20.230]
Don't forget, join George and Miguel and Boca Brian and Carlos and maybe Fat Boy,

[02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:21.510]
Treasure Island 9.5 to 7.

[02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:24.850]
Prices 2 for 1 drinks and maybe get laid, maybe get some head.

[02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.830]
Who knows what you're going to get?

[02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:28.750]
There'll be some head on your beer anyway at Treasure Island.

[02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:31.310]
He's speaking of a fat boy.

[02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:31.950]
What good timing?

[02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:34.310]
A good segue by accident and the balance for life spot.

[02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:37.370]
The beast is on vacation this week and is coming back to get fired next week,

[02:25:37.370 --> 02:25:39.370]
although he already knows it off that morning show.

[02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:41.030]
He's lost 55 pounds.

[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:44.150]
I guarantee you we saved his life.

[02:25:44.250 --> 02:25:46.670]
I mean, maybe not immediately, but over a period of time,

[02:25:46.930 --> 02:25:48.250]
this man didn't have a long way to go.

[02:25:48.350 --> 02:25:53.030]
He's 5, 4, he weighed almost 300 pounds and he's lost 55 pounds in just a few months and balance for life.

[02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:55.470]
And the reason he can do it is because you're not starving.

[02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:56.810]
You don't have to count calories.

[02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:59.950]
You don't have to like do your own discipline because they do all of that for you.

[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:03.430]
They bring you that little black sack by 6 o'clock in the morning every day of your life.

[02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:05.150]
You just fill out your little menu choices.

[02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:08.070]
You've got two choices for each meal and that's the only choice you have to worry about.

[02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:13.330]
No counting calories, no counting carbs, no counting anything except counting on the fact that the sack will be there every day

[02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:13.790]
with you will.

[02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:18.710]
And in your black sack, there are three delicious gourmet meals made with the finest ingredients and money can buy,

[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:22.030]
good fresh stuff, lots of veggies and stuff that's good for you, but very tasty.

[02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:24.630]
And two delicious snacks are in there, two in a bottle of water as well.

[02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.670]
So what else here?

[02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:26.490]
What more could you want?

[02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:31.050]
All the food you want is in there for the entire day and you don't have to worry about not being full because believe me,

[02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:32.150]
you'll be full of the poop.

[02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:35.430]
So I pick up that phone and call balance for life today and start losing weight.

[02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:42.170]
The painless, easy, delicious way by getting on a balance for life program called 954-568-3229.

[02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:45.390]
And tell that to Troy by the way to slow down a little bit on that spot.

[02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:51.410]
He sounds like he's on helium 954-568-3229 or check out their website if you like it.

[02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:52.890]
BalanceForLife.com.

[02:26:52.970 --> 02:26:57.330]
My life and love this is 420-561.

[02:26:57.730 --> 02:26:59.410]
Way to go, way to go.

[02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:05.830]
Well, it'd be the 12-1 hour on WQ Air.

[02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:07.890]
That's for being nice to me today, Mo.

[02:27:08.130 --> 02:27:09.730]
And don't mention it, Goldie.

[02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:11.830]
You're not going to get raped again today, I Mo.

[02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:13.090]
Yeah, you know why.

[02:27:13.410 --> 02:27:14.230]
Why's that, Mo?

[02:27:14.410 --> 02:27:18.190]
Because rape's not funny, but I ain't going to be a mean man no more.

[02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:20.590]
If they think that's funny, it's fine by me.

[02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:22.670]
Wow, you really changed your way.

[02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:23.950]
Ah, forget about it.

[02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:26.250]
I'm turning over all new thing Newton Leaf.

[02:27:26.250 --> 02:27:29.090]
You have a nice, daily and power, and nice, my coolly friend.

[02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:31.730]
Hey, Mo, look out for that truck!

[02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:33.850]
Look out, look out, look out!

[02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:39.190]
Mo, look like the shapeless pile of gold.

[02:27:40.470 --> 02:27:50.470]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, I'm gonna show my respect, I story you, you, you, you, I wasn't even told before that last one, boosted my shoes.

[02:27:50.470 --> 02:27:58.530]
I don't wanna say I'm glad outside of being a messy old schmucky wasn't bad

[02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:03.910]
It's a machaya, oh how it day is day to day to the death

[02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:08.090]
Oh how it day to death, but it's weakness time

[02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:12.510]
Oh how it day to death, but it's weakness time

[02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:16.150]
Oh how it day to death, but it's weakness time

[02:28:16.850 --> 02:28:18.050]
Oh how it day to death

[02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:22.570]
Forget about it, that's what I say, as that for a funny show idea

[02:28:22.570 --> 02:28:25.530]
If I may borrow a phrase from the great Marty Allen

[02:28:25.530 --> 02:28:28.510]
Hello Dair, everybody in Paradise Land

[02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:34.530]
I'm Howard Davided, I hope you'll join me each and every Friday for my forget about it, Joel

[02:28:34.530 --> 02:28:38.670]
That's what I opened the phone lines to all three of my regular low-income co-alers

[02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:41.430]
and led them venture on what's bothering them

[02:28:41.430 --> 02:28:43.610]
I was up all night dreaming this one up

[02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:46.930]
At first I thought I'd go in with hand puppets like Sandy Becker

[02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:50.170]
or I'll maybe uphold the werewolf aquist for quake

[02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:54.110]
But management and I agree, this will be a real show stopper

[02:28:54.110 --> 02:29:00.090]
Now I run a family type show here so I don't want more references to fixed gigaboo's or faggages guzzlies

[02:29:00.090 --> 02:29:06.350]
Other than that, I promise you a hilarious decafony or high jinks and open conversation

[02:29:06.350 --> 02:29:12.090]
Forget about it Friday, that goes for listening to 5.60 WQAM

[02:29:12.090 --> 02:29:14.190]
Welcome back to the Mohawad Davided show

[02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:17.810]
We're a juck full of zany but good clean family fun

[02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:21.370]
You know that pipe smoke and jizz guzzled thinks rape is funny

[02:29:21.370 --> 02:29:22.590]
Is that funny?

[02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:25.090]
Plane's crashing into buildings is funny too, huh?

[02:29:25.530 --> 02:29:25.570]
What?

[02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:26.030]
What?

[02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:30.710]
Since when it's gang rape funny, especially when it's me get my teeth back grabed

[02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:33.450]
What a jackass

[02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:35.130]
Hey, how about some puri tea?

[02:29:35.250 --> 02:29:37.110]
No no no no don't go tap there so when I talk

[02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:39.590]
This is important, they don't know comedy

[02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:41.010]
I'll show them comedy

[02:29:41.010 --> 02:29:43.550]
Today I brought my collection of lumenabna tapes

[02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.910]
Oh?

[02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:45.450]
Lumenabna you're more on

[02:29:45.450 --> 02:29:47.530]
They even named the restaurant after lumen

[02:29:47.530 --> 02:29:49.690]
Ah yeah, cluelish muck

[02:29:49.690 --> 02:29:50.870]
We'll get back to that later

[02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:54.970]
Right now it's time for our transcendent mid show snack

[02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:57.870]
Bring the morning mayor his food

[02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:01.070]
Ah here they are

[02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:03.230]
My favorite place to die

[02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:04.770]
Is I goat suboker?

[02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:05.930]

[02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:07.770]
Hmm what is it, Svint?

[02:30:08.430 --> 02:30:09.090]
Looks like a donut

[02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:12.810]
Looks like the vained umberials from plant-parent hood

[02:30:12.810 --> 02:30:13.810]
They're in the hood

[02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:15.850]
But it's good

[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:19.250]
Try it with the uh, cocktail sauce

[02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:20.390]
I-I beast

[02:30:20.390 --> 02:30:22.410]
We'll play that Alice Cooper record

[02:30:29.730 --> 02:30:32.490]
There's a little atmosphere for you to help it go down the collect

[02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:37.410]

[02:30:39.690 --> 02:30:41.410]
I'm a head stirrup

[02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:44.370]
If these folks only know what was good

[02:30:46.690 --> 02:30:47.170]
Here

[02:30:47.170 --> 02:30:49.370]
I have some more transcendent here

[02:30:49.370 --> 02:30:50.550]
Can you blend your pellet this?

[02:30:50.770 --> 02:30:51.630]
Thanks Smell

[02:30:52.470 --> 02:30:53.130]
All right

[02:30:53.130 --> 02:30:56.070]
Or we got the meathead mad dog coming up at one

[02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:58.950]
Followed by that fat Joe right after the queer and the sprick

[02:30:58.950 --> 02:31:00.010]
What's that?

[02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.810]
It's a plane

[02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:01.770]
The plane

[02:31:01.770 --> 02:31:02.410]
Quick, where?

[02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:04.210]

[02:31:04.210 --> 02:31:05.690]

Thank you Howard

[02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:16.650]
Forget about it

[02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:19.970]
Carthagridly after days of intensive shock therapy

[02:31:19.970 --> 02:31:22.710]
Management emerged with a brand new lineup

[02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:24.670]
For the vacationing Howard David

With periodic sports updates by guilty

[02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:38.530]
That's the

[02:31:42.310 --> 02:31:46.810]
560 WQAM presents the Moen Joe Show

[02:31:46.810 --> 02:31:49.490]
Meetings tank bad with our last failure

[02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:51.330]
So we're gonna try this now

[02:31:51.330 --> 02:31:52.810]
At least we're consistent

[02:31:52.810 --> 02:31:54.810]
To get in touch with Moen Joe

[02:31:54.810 --> 02:31:57.350]
Just uh what's the point

[02:31:57.350 --> 02:31:58.990]
This is Howard the David dead

[02:31:58.990 --> 02:32:01.250]
Welcome back to the Moen Joe Show

[02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:02.490]

Well it's nice to be here

[02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:06.850]
You don't mind this 18 hours shift

[02:32:06.850 --> 02:32:07.330]
Fuck it

[02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:08.550]
Oh no not at all

[02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:10.270]
You were getting paid extra for this

It's the kids that they don't know what's good

[02:35:08.050 --> 02:35:09.270]
It's like that song

[02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:11.410]

I'm the king of paradise

[02:35:56.670 --> 02:36:00.810]
I came down here after losing my charm

[02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:03.930]
But to be a big fish

[02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:05.750]
In a little pond

[02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:09.050]
When they kicked me off the US

[02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:11.850]
Filion they told me don't come back again

[02:36:11.850 --> 02:36:14.350]
I had some problems with wise guys

[02:36:14.350 --> 02:36:16.490]

[02:36:16.490 --> 02:36:18.770]

10 minutes past noon at 5.60

[02:36:53.010 --> 02:36:55.250]
I was just thinking of a great name for the new bokeh brand CD

[02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:56.110]

[02:37:00.090 --> 02:37:00.970]
Isn't that cute?

[02:37:01.450 --> 02:37:01.990]

Here we play all bits between noon to one on Wednesday

[02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:14.190]
Moe bits are Moe often

[02:37:14.190 --> 02:37:15.130]
On Qion

[02:37:15.130 --> 02:37:15.610]
And why not?

[02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.250]
It's like in the middle of the week

[02:37:17.250 --> 02:37:18.870]
We decided this is a really good day

[02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:19.810]
Propicious moment

[02:37:19.810 --> 02:37:21.570]

See what I'm saying

[02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:26.510]
We don't want to hear all the scraps

It must be because I can't

[02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:12.330]
It's purple

[02:39:13.570 --> 02:39:16.190]

Nobody knows that under my clothes I wear pentihors

[02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:23.150]
But that no mean that I'm gay

The reason I dismissed that sneak and fat bastard

Is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play conest

[02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:49.470]

Okay

You're not supposed to mean now

[02:44:23.890 --> 02:44:24.450]
Yeah

[02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:25.570]
I really tell it

[02:44:25.570 --> 02:44:26.950]
That's Mr. Bates you got now

[02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:27.330]
Don't I

[02:44:27.330 --> 02:44:28.130]

No

[02:44:30.330 --> 02:44:31.590]
Take it away, Mom

[02:44:32.130 --> 02:44:32.410]
What

[02:44:32.890 --> 02:44:34.330]
You're just gonna leave me here

[02:44:36.090 --> 02:44:37.170]
We'll be right back

[02:44:37.170 --> 02:44:38.590]
I'm 560

[02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:39.310]
Hmm

[02:44:39.890 --> 02:44:41.030]
I feel so used

[02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.690]
But don't don't

[02:44:42.210 --> 02:44:43.410]
And that's why I think I just

[02:44:43.410 --> 02:44:45.170]
I'll have a championship season

[02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:46.430]
And where did I tell you

[02:44:46.430 --> 02:44:47.450]
You don't talk

[02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:48.950]
Do I say you can talk

[02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:50.190]
This is the beast

[02:44:50.190 --> 02:44:51.270]
I said shut up

[02:44:51.270 --> 02:44:51.970]
That's all

[02:44:51.970 --> 02:44:53.150]
That you're like a father to me

[02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.850]
You don't talk

[02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:55.150]
Talam done talking

[02:44:55.150 --> 02:44:56.250]
When I'm done talking

[02:44:56.250 --> 02:44:57.170]
Then you talk

[02:44:57.170 --> 02:44:57.850]
Okay, I'll

[02:44:57.850 --> 02:44:58.290]
Hey beast

[02:44:58.290 --> 02:44:58.770]

[02:44:58.770 --> 02:44:59.450]

And then it's

[02:45:06.370 --> 02:45:06.810]
They come in

[02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:11.870]

[02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:17.390]
Would you win, folks

[02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:17.910]

[02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:19.350]
Dorete of my mattress

[02:45:19.350 --> 02:45:21.450]

[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:42.710]
Chowertop

[02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:43.770]
We got 10 minutes

[02:45:43.770 --> 02:45:45.410]
It was to be safe and easy

[02:45:45.410 --> 02:45:46.470]
No both times

[02:45:46.470 --> 02:45:47.110]
No man

[02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.690]
In Lodha

[02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:48.670]
New Linda Blau

[02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:49.070]
But that

[02:45:49.070 --> 02:45:50.250]
It's so pretty

[02:45:50.250 --> 02:45:50.830]
Now man

[02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:51.190]
Okay

For a person like that

[02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:54.070]
You know who I am

[02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:55.850]
Okay man then don't pick it up now

[02:45:56.610 --> 02:45:57.750]
All right

[02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:59.790]
But I expect a print in the policy

[02:45:59.790 --> 02:46:00.630]
I might just come

[02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:01.390]
That's not true man

[02:46:01.390 --> 02:46:01.950]

[02:46:02.350 --> 02:46:03.110]
A book time

[02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:04.150]
I'll pick the truck

[02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.870]
This is

[02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:05.250]
This is

[02:46:05.250 --> 02:46:06.070]
This is

[02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.610]
This is

[02:46:06.610 --> 02:46:09.850]
This is

[02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:11.170]
The warden will see you now

[02:46:11.170 --> 02:46:11.790]
Thanks

[02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:12.750]
Well

[02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:13.930]
Mr. David

Jack ordered

[02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:17.870]
How can it help you

[02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:18.790]
You see Warren's

[02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:19.030]
Yeah

[02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:20.210]
I keep getting raped

[02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.510]
To

[02:46:21.370 --> 02:46:22.450]
He's a vatish

[02:46:22.450 --> 02:46:23.030]
Yeah

[02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:24.630]
Jaluk is who it right away

[02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:25.190]
Thanks Warren

[02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:26.070]
It's about time

[02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.630]
Somebody

[02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:28.010]
It is now drop your path

[02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:30.170]
I said drop your path

[02:46:30.170 --> 02:46:31.050]
This is odds

[02:46:31.050 --> 02:46:32.950]
Favours don't come to you

[02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:34.330]
Do

[02:46:34.330 --> 02:46:34.530]
Do

[02:46:34.530 --> 02:46:34.990]
Do

[02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:36.230]
Let's rape

[02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.730]
Oh

[02:46:36.730 --> 02:46:37.990]
Radio

[02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:39.250]
Big shot

[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:42.730]
That's how we pass the time away

[02:46:42.730 --> 02:46:44.310]
In the G.O.J.

[02:46:44.490 --> 02:46:45.730]
The pause

[02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:47.630]
Toppins

[02:46:48.470 --> 02:46:50.030]
Can't afford any mistakes

[02:46:50.030 --> 02:46:51.730]
This play is crucial

[02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:54.270]
Acts are at an eye for nation

[02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:56.970]
That means from my vantage point

[02:46:56.970 --> 02:46:58.470]
There's shaped like a letter i

[02:46:59.010 --> 02:47:01.150]
Kind of like the Jaluk dances

[02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:03.510]
That has to be the most

[02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:06.530]
Frick and frick and stupidest thing I ever heard

[02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.850]
Most

[02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:08.130]
Then the secondary

[02:47:08.850 --> 02:47:09.610]
And thirdly

[02:47:09.610 --> 02:47:12.910]
The outcome at his game is invariably contingent

[02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:14.490]
On how adroitly

[02:47:14.490 --> 02:47:17.090]
They do put the thing in the thing

[02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:18.250]
Are you

[02:47:18.850 --> 02:47:20.390]
Watching the same game

[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:21.190]
I'm watching

[02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.790]
Can you

[02:47:21.790 --> 02:47:26.610]
So now it's time for a transcendent mid-game interview

[02:47:26.610 --> 02:47:28.510]
So binky are you happy

[02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:30.270]
I hate to be cute again

[02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:33.510]
And I had it up to here with your show

[02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:33.950]
Hope to

[02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:36.050]
All right sportsman

[02:47:36.050 --> 02:47:36.990]
Toppins

[02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:38.870]
Are in a critical situation

[02:47:39.430 --> 02:47:41.450]
They need this field goal

[02:47:41.450 --> 02:47:43.410]
If they expect to win this game

[02:47:43.410 --> 02:47:46.070]
And they go all the time out

[02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:48.410]
So let's go to the phone

[02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:49.070]
Shall we

[02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:51.210]
Fast steady in Galiaciti

[02:47:51.210 --> 02:47:52.510]

[02:47:52.510 --> 02:47:53.930]
You're a great game hower

[02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:54.730]
Thank you

[02:47:54.730 --> 02:47:56.010]
What you take on the board

[02:47:56.010 --> 02:47:57.410]
Well if you ask me

[02:47:57.410 --> 02:48:00.230]
And do you mind if I'll be called the game here

[02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:01.310]
Why are what up

[02:48:01.310 --> 02:48:03.310]
They missed the field goal

[02:48:03.310 --> 02:48:04.150]
No well

[02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:05.930]
Let's go to our sideline

[02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:06.610]
Reputem

[02:48:06.610 --> 02:48:07.690]
Take it away

[02:48:07.690 --> 02:48:08.330]
Galdi

[02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:08.890]
Acts

[02:48:08.890 --> 02:48:09.930]
That's a ball

[02:48:09.930 --> 02:48:10.570]
And

[02:48:10.570 --> 02:48:12.710]
It's a freshly-painted goal

[02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:14.110]
Close you got stuck

[02:48:14.110 --> 02:48:15.490]
Then it goes out

[02:48:15.490 --> 02:48:16.910]
Pushes the paint

[02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:17.870]
Tastes it's you

[02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:19.890]
And do you have it

[02:48:19.890 --> 02:48:20.710]
I uh

[02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:23.070]
I had about all I can take of this

[02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.970]
What are you talking about

[02:48:23.970 --> 02:48:25.630]
Sit down and shut up

[02:48:25.630 --> 02:48:26.990]
You see this hand

[02:48:27.550 --> 02:48:29.230]
I'm gonna take this hand

[02:48:29.230 --> 02:48:31.510]
And crush your head like a peanut

[02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:32.730]
You want me to kiss your ass

[02:48:32.730 --> 02:48:33.890]
I don't kiss nobody

[02:48:36.370 --> 02:48:38.010]
You catch a hand

[02:48:38.010 --> 02:48:38.710]
Go for me

[02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:39.070]
You'll be

[02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:41.230]

[02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:42.210]

[02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:48.290]
Boom

[02:48:49.890 --> 02:48:52.030]
Club 26 at 560 WDQM

So we have a new beast bid in

Break when we come back right out of my uh

[02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.430]
Dropping

[02:48:58.570 --> 02:49:00.430]
What a great half hour that was you know

[02:49:01.250 --> 02:49:02.430]
I'm almost breathless

[02:49:02.430 --> 02:49:03.290]
I need a towel

[02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:05.570]

[02:58:11.370 --> 02:58:14.830]
Oh how he's of a hoar.

[02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:21.250]
He's just a shmuck's horn hole in hell,

[02:58:21.250 --> 02:58:25.590]
The kind that drag read lies.

[02:58:26.370 --> 02:58:30.450]
He's just another New York failure,

[02:58:31.050 --> 02:58:36.470]
First to move to paradise, no show.

[02:58:38.190 --> 02:58:40.850]
Oh howard has no show.

[02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:46.350]
His two babies with smell and fire,

[02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:48.690]
Oh howard's baby,

[02:58:49.150 --> 02:58:49.450]
Blow.

[02:59:01.770 --> 02:59:03.430]
The party went to the one at five,

[02:59:03.430 --> 02:59:04.630]
60 W to Q.A.M.

[02:59:04.690 --> 02:59:05.910]
So again we'll do the same thing again,

[02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:06.810]
if you got something else there.

[02:59:07.210 --> 02:59:07.350]
Yes.

[02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:08.310]
Well why not?

[02:59:08.610 --> 02:59:10.550]
Alright, when it's done, let's pull it out.

[02:59:11.210 --> 02:59:12.590]
You know, I'm discovered things here

[02:59:12.590 --> 02:59:14.670]
that I have maybe played only like once or twice,

[02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:15.130]
you know that?

[02:59:15.430 --> 02:59:16.090]
Yeah, I know.

[02:59:16.090 --> 02:59:17.510]
Did you see the lines ringing by the way?

[02:59:18.730 --> 02:59:22.690]
For what the phone lines that you noticed them ringing I wasn't paying any attention. Oh

[02:59:23.250 --> 02:59:27.970]
What does that mean? Well the phone lines were all ringing during the past half hour for what?

[02:59:28.750 --> 02:59:33.990]
Well, that's what I wanted to know so I had Carlos picks them up. Yeah people are dying dying on the other

[02:59:35.910 --> 02:59:41.210]
All right, well sure this is great entertainment folks and if some people would lighten up a little bit they'd understand that

[02:59:41.790 --> 02:59:45.810]
They'd understand it but of course we got some hard-ass people and of course you know when you got bad viral

[02:59:46.170 --> 02:59:51.270]
Cosmere is probably like a hardening of the arteries hardening of the ass, too, you know

[02:59:51.270 --> 02:59:55.150]
Which leads to hemorrhoids and then those people do become a pain in the ass and anyway

[02:59:55.150 --> 02:59:58.770]
We're just having our usual when's they knew in the one good time tell everybody in the world

[02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:04.670]
This is the time to like lighten up and get away from all the bull crap, you know all the gloom and doom and the world is coming to win

[03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:09.910]
Who the hell needs that you know some people take things to a serious? I think and that's kind of stupid

[03:00:10.390 --> 03:00:14.590]
See now I'm starting to do that again. I had weaned myself off of that crap and I'm starting to do it again

[03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:51.050]

I like to get the role.

[03:04:17.210 --> 03:04:18.870]
Back when my wife got pregnant,

[03:04:19.050 --> 03:04:20.210]
I'd practice contraception,

[03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:22.270]
more contraceptive way down to my balls.

[03:04:22.690 --> 03:04:24.090]
It's been brought to my attention

[03:04:24.090 --> 03:04:25.550]
that it wasn't my erection

[03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:27.630]
and discovered that it wasn't me at all.

[03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:29.110]
Was that considerate?

[03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:30.370]
Was that nice?

[03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:33.830]

[03:04:35.570 --> 03:04:37.110]

[03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:48.710]

[03:04:49.630 --> 03:04:50.890]
I hate Greg,

[03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:52.450]
I was Georgia Jones today,

[03:04:52.890 --> 03:04:55.390]
I talked about women like he does every day,

[03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:56.750]
I talked about women,

[03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.770]
butter day.

[03:04:57.910 --> 03:05:00.610]
Well, they're not as exciting as sport-hole things,

[03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:02.270]
reading positions,

[03:05:02.770 --> 03:05:03.690]
sport at homes,

[03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:05.110]
relic and gusset,

[03:05:05.410 --> 03:05:06.390]
most brown holes,

[03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:09.870]
can't get permission to make George go away.

[03:05:10.930 --> 03:05:11.270]
No!

[03:05:11.770 --> 03:05:14.590]
So I set up my thing in Gucci shoes,

[03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:17.430]
and make the man's that they refuse,

[03:05:17.430 --> 03:05:20.710]
who at least let me suspend him

[03:05:22.330 --> 03:05:24.110]
for a day.

[03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:31.390]
1248, I'm almost breathless,

[03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:32.130]
and I'm just sitting here

[03:05:32.130 --> 03:05:33.110]
at punching buttons, yeah.

[03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:35.890]
418 votes on a pool,

[03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:37.450]
what's your take on the TV show,

[03:05:37.570 --> 03:05:38.830]
a small villa on the WB?

[03:05:39.070 --> 03:05:39.650]
I'm one of brothers.

[03:05:40.510 --> 03:05:43.410]
I don't watch it, 273.4%.

[03:05:43.410 --> 03:05:44.790]
Don't you think that gooseed up a little bit?

[03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:46.710]
That, well, could be,

[03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:50.930]
I don't know, if the fake guy was voting,

[03:05:51.570 --> 03:05:52.350]
and he vote for,

[03:05:52.430 --> 03:05:53.150]
I hated it blows.

[03:05:54.690 --> 03:05:55.570]
Who the hell knows?

[03:05:56.710 --> 03:05:58.910]
And you say guy, as in singular,

[03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.770]
Lana flicks my,

[03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:01.930]
flicks my back,

[03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:03.030]
licks it, 30,

[03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:04.910]
it's okay, 27,

[03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.910]
I love it, 23,

[03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:07.110]
I hated it,

[03:06:07.230 --> 03:06:08.110]
blows 20,

[03:06:08.430 --> 03:06:10.370]
and Tom Walling is God, 11.

[03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.850]
Hey, by now you've heard,

[03:06:12.930 --> 03:06:13.970]

[03:06:13.970 --> 03:06:15.970]
and Todd Drek, I know is positive

[03:06:15.970 --> 03:06:17.670]
that you've heard about the incredible learning potential

[03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:19.210]
of a computer professional.

[03:06:19.390 --> 03:06:20.470]
There's big bucks to be made.

[03:06:20.770 --> 03:06:22.170]
You've heard us talk about the incredible demand

[03:06:22.170 --> 03:06:23.810]
for certified computer professionals.

[03:06:23.810 --> 03:06:24.670]
They need lots of you.

[03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:26.510]
So you've also heard us talk about the great people

[03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:27.130]
of fast train.

[03:06:27.250 --> 03:06:28.190]
So do yourself a favor,

[03:06:28.470 --> 03:06:32.570]
pick up the phone and call fast train at 1-866-FAST-TRAIN.

[03:06:32.730 --> 03:06:33.490]
I think starting tomorrow

[03:06:33.490 --> 03:06:34.870]
we'll give Todd Drek's home phone number

[03:06:34.870 --> 03:06:36.430]
on this to in case their line is busy.

[03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:37.730]

high-paying career,

[03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:43.230]
making some real serious cash.

[03:06:43.230 --> 03:06:45.790]
Fast trains got four convenient locations in Dayton,

[03:06:45.790 --> 03:06:48.190]
Howard, they've got convenient day eating weekend classes

[03:06:48.190 --> 03:06:49.290]

Get on my nerves with your smarty pants braids.

[03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:31.330]
Talk about sex and that drives me insane.

[03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:34.230]
Don't hold sports and that's us your dying gay, of course.

[03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:35.970]
I can't take this.

[03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:37.290]
Hey, George, you're fired.

[03:07:37.730 --> 03:07:39.970]
You're not a sport holding you dressed like a sly.

[03:07:39.970 --> 03:07:42.970]
Wow, the manly jocks will, they just don't make you a heart.

[03:07:43.290 --> 03:07:44.510]
It's women all the time.

[03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:47.310]
That's why the die can't take this.

[03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:48.430]
Hey, George, you're fired.

[03:07:49.050 --> 03:07:51.170]
If you kiss me off, you'll be fired.

[03:07:52.390 --> 03:07:53.970]
Ooh, I thank you.

[03:07:54.750 --> 03:07:55.890]
You go to hell, bitch.

[03:07:57.130 --> 03:07:59.610]
And pack your hand lotion and fake movies too.

[03:08:00.170 --> 03:08:01.170]
You're not died.

[03:08:01.650 --> 03:08:04.270]
A straight guy, and responsible for making the

[03:08:04.270 --> 03:08:05.750]
cry, cry, cry, cry.

[03:08:06.010 --> 03:08:08.270]
Don't bother asking when your neck's drois are.

[03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:11.210]
Will she be back in your old repo job?

[03:08:11.810 --> 03:08:13.850]
You may not like guys, or you're not like that.

[03:08:14.190 --> 03:08:15.630]
But I can't take this.

[03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:16.870]
Hey, George, you're fired.

[03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:19.690]
The sooner bonus can't lay, please.

[03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:24.810]
No, well, who will you aggravate me?

[03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:27.890]
The spike the big number in your summer book.

[03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:32.590]
You're not a sports guy, and I hope you die, especially for making the

[03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:33.990]
cry, cry, cry, cry.

[03:08:34.290 --> 03:08:36.810]
Before you go, I have one question for you.

[03:08:36.810 --> 03:08:39.330]
Now, how do you like the way I look in my news, too?

[03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:43.710]
Now, I ask my wife, hey, she said fine, because I can't take this.

[03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:45.110]
Hey, George, you're fired.

[03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:48.050]
Roll another part.

[03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:51.350]
Oh, right.

[03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:57.170]
La la la la.

[03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.690]
La la la.

[03:08:59.190 --> 03:09:00.110]
La la la.

[03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:01.030]
La la la la.

[03:09:01.850 --> 03:09:02.970]
La la la la.

[03:09:03.250 --> 03:09:04.230]
Look, she's la la la.

[03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:05.990]
La la la la.

[03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.350]
La la la.

[03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:11.850]
I was going to clean my room until I got hot.

[03:09:13.430 --> 03:09:17.650]
I was going to get up and find the broom, but then I got hot.

[03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:19.830]
La la la.

[03:09:19.890 --> 03:09:21.930]
My room is still messed up.

[03:09:22.390 --> 03:09:23.430]
And I know why.

[03:09:23.610 --> 03:09:25.110]
Why, man, yeah, yeah.

[03:09:25.330 --> 03:09:26.190]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:27.670]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:29.370]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:29.950 --> 03:09:30.830]
La la la.

[03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:34.890]
I was going to go to class before I got hot.

[03:09:34.890 --> 03:09:35.850]
Come on, y'all.

[03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:36.330]
Check it out.

[03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:39.230]
I could have cheated, and I could have passed.

[03:09:39.850 --> 03:09:40.650]
But I got hot.

[03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:42.870]
La la la.

[03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:44.850]
I'm taking a next semester.

[03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:46.410]
And I know why.

[03:09:46.770 --> 03:09:47.250]
Why, why, why?

[03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:48.350]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[03:09:48.470 --> 03:09:49.410]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:49.810 --> 03:09:50.990]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:52.230]
Because I got hot.

[03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:54.030]
Go to class, go to class, go to class.

[03:09:54.970 --> 03:09:58.050]
I was going to go to class before I got hot.

[03:09:59.730 --> 03:10:02.270]
I was going to pay my child support.

[03:10:02.770 --> 03:10:03.790]
But then I got hot.

[03:10:03.790 --> 03:10:04.470]
No, you went.

[03:10:04.810 --> 03:10:04.990]
Hey.

[03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:07.950]
La la think, turn my whole paycheck.

[03:10:08.730 --> 03:10:09.550]
And I know why.

[03:10:09.850 --> 03:10:11.550]
Why, man, hey, hey.

[03:10:11.650 --> 03:10:12.450]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:13.870]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:15.330]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.910]
La la la.

[03:10:17.730 --> 03:10:19.730]
What they going to run from the cops?

[03:10:20.270 --> 03:10:21.050]
But I was hot.

[03:10:21.450 --> 03:10:22.610]
I serious, man.

[03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:25.410]
I was going to pull right over and stop.

[03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:26.910]
But I was hot.

[03:10:28.330 --> 03:10:29.370]
La la la.

[03:10:29.390 --> 03:10:31.590]
Now I'm a pair of pleats, chaper.

[03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:32.690]
Because I know why.

[03:10:32.890 --> 03:10:33.530]
Why, man?

[03:10:34.610 --> 03:10:35.550]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:37.010]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:37.450 --> 03:10:38.730]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.970]
La la la.

[03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:42.850]
I was going to make love to you.

[03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:44.290]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:44.810 --> 03:10:45.410]
I'm serious.

[03:10:46.250 --> 03:10:48.110]
I was going to eat your pussy.

[03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:50.150]
And I got hot.

[03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:52.250]
La la la.

[03:10:52.650 --> 03:10:54.290]
Now I'm jacket off.

[03:10:54.430 --> 03:10:55.990]
And I know why.

[03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.750]
For the s*** off.

[03:10:56.850 --> 03:10:56.970]
Yeah.

[03:10:57.470 --> 03:10:58.590]
Because I got hot.

[03:10:58.730 --> 03:10:59.030]
You know?

[03:10:59.190 --> 03:11:00.010]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:00.010 --> 03:11:00.610]
I told you I don't want to.

[03:11:01.490 --> 03:11:02.050]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:02.050 --> 03:11:02.330]
No, no, no.

[03:11:02.330 --> 03:11:02.750]
Go.

[03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:04.830]
I miss it.

[03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:07.330]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:07.650 --> 03:11:07.770]
Go.

[03:11:08.490 --> 03:11:08.490]

[03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:11.730]
I lost my keys to white.

[03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:13.230]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.910]
Stay with me.

[03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.630]
Stay with me.

[03:11:15.130 --> 03:11:17.570]
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk.

[03:11:17.890 --> 03:11:19.070]
And I know why.

[03:11:19.210 --> 03:11:19.790]
Why, man?

[03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:21.870]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:22.250 --> 03:11:23.330]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:23.550 --> 03:11:25.310]
Because I got hot.

[03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:26.490]
La la la.

[03:11:27.010 --> 03:11:28.930]
I was about singing the song.

[03:11:28.930 --> 03:11:30.430]
Because I'm hot.

[03:11:30.690 --> 03:11:32.710]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:34.890]
I was singing this whole thing wrong.

[03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.210]
Yeah.

[03:11:35.410 --> 03:11:36.250]
Because I'm hot.

[03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:37.070]
Bring it back.

[03:11:37.290 --> 03:11:37.750]
Bring it back.

[03:11:38.310 --> 03:11:40.810]
And if I don't still want to copy,

[03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:42.810]
I'm a white man.

[03:11:43.210 --> 03:11:43.210]

[03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:44.870]
Because I'm hot.

[03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:46.390]
Because I'm hot.

[03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:47.870]
Because I'm hot.

[03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:49.530]
Are you light on me?

[03:11:49.950 --> 03:11:50.050]
Yeah.

[03:11:50.270 --> 03:11:51.410]
La la la.

[03:11:51.430 --> 03:11:51.970]
La la la.

[03:11:52.430 --> 03:11:53.290]
La la la.

[03:11:53.490 --> 03:11:53.810]
OK.

[03:11:53.930 --> 03:11:55.930]
You talk about a sense of accomplishment.

[03:11:56.770 --> 03:11:58.690]
I feel this could go on to the great hours

[03:11:58.690 --> 03:11:59.730]
in the history of the human race.

[03:11:59.810 --> 03:12:01.850]
I couldn't be wrong about that, but I don't think so.

[03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.930]
There's two more minutes left.

[03:12:03.690 --> 03:12:04.450]
I figure, pardon.

[03:12:05.410 --> 03:12:06.730]
No, we don't have two more minutes left.

[03:12:06.930 --> 03:12:07.950]
I got to do the promo again.

[03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.710]
I got to read the result.

[03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:10.910]
Hey, listen, I've been around a block a couple of times.

[03:12:10.970 --> 03:12:12.010]
You think I don't know what time it is?

[03:12:12.090 --> 03:12:13.010]
It's 12.50.06.

[03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:16.150]
I'm not talking about on this silly website of ours.

[03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:17.630]
I'm talking about the exact time.

[03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:18.050]
You're right.

[03:12:18.210 --> 03:12:20.350]
It's 12.50.13.

[03:12:20.370 --> 03:12:20.590]
What?

[03:12:20.970 --> 03:12:21.650]
By our clock, too.

[03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.650]
Well, there you go.

[03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:24.470]
So I'm right on top of it.

[03:12:24.530 --> 03:12:25.590]
Man, I got to start with science.

[03:12:25.690 --> 03:12:26.830]
I got my shirt on here already.

[03:12:26.830 --> 03:12:28.150]
I'm ready to go out for a beautiful lunch.

[03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:32.850]
As a matter of fact, it's right now 66, 65, and the son of

[03:12:32.850 --> 03:12:34.270]
Shining, it's a low humidity.

[03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:35.150]
It's heaven.

[03:12:35.250 --> 03:12:38.390]
It's just like yesterday, a little bit cooler, maybe, like yesterday, all over again.

[03:12:38.610 --> 03:12:38.790]
Period.

[03:12:38.950 --> 03:12:39.510]
It's paradise.

[03:12:40.370 --> 03:12:41.170]
How do you like that?

[03:12:42.230 --> 03:12:44.350]
Well, those of you who can't be in paradise, you're stuck there.

[03:12:44.370 --> 03:12:48.870]
But go out tonight and join George and McGill and Volkabrion and Carlos and, uh, fat,

[03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:50.670]
Jeff High, five to seven.

[03:12:50.730 --> 03:12:53.690]
I treasure Island off the Pomato just north of the 120-second street exit.

[03:12:53.690 --> 03:12:56.490]
Stop by for crappy QM prizes because we got no budget.

[03:12:56.590 --> 03:13:01.670]
But get two for one drinks as well at the treasure Island tonight between five and seven.

[03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:02.770]
Okay, that takes care of that.

[03:13:03.210 --> 03:13:06.330]
Pull quickly on small hill, which these people, what can I tell you about them?

[03:13:06.370 --> 03:13:06.450]
Huh?

[03:13:06.750 --> 03:13:09.250]
They don't watch it 314, 73 and a half per se.

[03:13:09.310 --> 03:13:12.210]
Well, yeah, I mean, what TV show would have more than that though when you come right

[03:13:12.210 --> 03:13:12.790]
down to it, see?

[03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:15.430]
Lana Flix, my big 31.

[03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:16.890]
It's okay, 27.

[03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.650]
I love it.

[03:13:17.850 --> 03:13:18.210]
23.

[03:13:18.530 --> 03:13:19.230]
I hated it.

[03:13:19.230 --> 03:13:23.630]
It blows 21 and Tom Walling is God 11 out of 430 votes.

[03:13:23.770 --> 03:13:24.530]
So we're getting there.

[03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:25.370]
We're working on it.

[03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:28.310]
In fact, a lot of the people who were watching it last night are probably still working

[03:13:28.310 --> 03:13:28.830]
on it today.

[03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:31.250]
Anyway, we got the mad dog who's always working on it.

[03:13:31.310 --> 03:13:31.730]
He's coming along.

[03:13:31.930 --> 03:13:32.330]
You know what I did?

[03:13:32.430 --> 03:13:33.610]
I just tore up the, uh, here it is.

[03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:34.130]
Here's the pay.

[03:13:34.850 --> 03:13:36.490]
Mad dog is next.

[03:13:36.830 --> 03:13:39.190]
Then we got the Humberhank, the highly weighted Hank Goldberg shows.

[03:13:39.330 --> 03:13:41.870]
I'm slaubing all of our Hank's numbers, even though what's his name?

[03:13:41.970 --> 03:13:42.290]
Perfect.

[03:13:42.570 --> 03:13:43.450]
It was on for about five minutes.

[03:13:43.970 --> 03:13:47.090]
And then we got to the Marlon crap, which is going to be thankfully over very soon.

[03:13:47.090 --> 03:13:52.470]
Any K after baseball and the dirty boys with a bevy of poro people, Joe and Mark overnight.

[03:13:52.470 --> 03:13:53.450]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:13:53.790 --> 03:13:55.090]
Take me to your budget show.

[03:13:55.250 --> 03:13:57.030]
I'm fighting to get you QAM.

[03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:58.170]
Might be for my head.

[03:13:58.310 --> 03:13:59.250]
Yo, yo, yo.

[03:13:59.810 --> 03:14:00.770]
Let's rate, oh.

[03:14:01.090 --> 03:14:03.790]
You're listening to the best of WQAM online.

[03:14:04.230 --> 03:14:06.890]
We'll have you back to regular programming in just a few moments.

[03:14:07.230 --> 03:14:09.430]
But until then, here's Howard David with dolphins.
