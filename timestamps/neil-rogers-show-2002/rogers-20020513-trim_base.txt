[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]
We're number one, dammit!

[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.880]
He was America's golden boy.

[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.480]
The one who could have been, but never was, and really didn't want to.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.560]
Oliver Stone brings to the screen the tragedy that shocked the nation.

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.780]
J.F.K. Julia, starring Will Smith.

[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.200]
Yo!

[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.840]
J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K.

[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.160]
Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia, J.F.K. Julia.

[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.720]
J.F.K. Junior Yo

[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.980]
J.F.K. Junior Yo

[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.260]
J.F.K. Junior Yo

[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.520]
J.F.K. Junior Yo

[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.360]
J.F.K. Junior

[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.780]
Also starring Yo Peshki

[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.140]
He was an enigma

[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.200]
He was like a...

[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.140]
A stores its back in a...

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.180]
A cock of it

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420]
Alright, then what happened to a f***ing wife

[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.000]
Hey we're all fake a team

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.660]
We're all fake a team

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.160]
We're all fake a team

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.120]
You'll watch it

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320]
Alluring into a theater near you

[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640]
The one with the lights on

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.160]
You know, so you can see that

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.660]
Yo, check it out

[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.240]
I'll tell you one thing if he walked into the door right now

[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.700]
And you know the ghost of J.F.K. Junior walked into the door right now

[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.640]
And I'll try to shake my hand

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.560]
I would do just like that guy did with Cardinal on

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.280]
Whatever the hell was Friday

[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340]
By the way he's still giving more depositions today

[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.760]
But anyway the guy refused to shake his hand

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.740]
He stuck it out and he refused to shake it

[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.720]
That's a good message for all your kids out there

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.820]
If the priest sticks it out, don't shake it

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.300]
The message of our show today is...

[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.260]
Have our buries got a huge pair of stunk

[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.220]
But anyway the message...

[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.020]
I guess he would know

[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.380]
He's always been sniffing around

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.200]
The message of today's show is people with a big pier

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.920]
Like those maple leaves baby

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.580]
He already got two hockey facts

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.500]
How do you like that?

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.500]
We'll get to that

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.320]
Well this town and after being psychotic Friday

[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640]
With that non-call, that grotesque non-call

[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.780]
And the dirty hit from behind by Daniel Alphardson on Darcy Tucker

[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660]
Which it was, hit from behind two minutes

[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.680]
Did they call it? No

[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.160]
And then a guy who did the Alphardson who does the penalty

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.280]
Doesn't give a call, he waltzes in all alone

[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.180]
Uncovered and scores the goal, it wins the game

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.200]
Nice going boys, Rob Shch

[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000]
Oh shick, I almost said it

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.940]
Ooh, and Stevie Wacom

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.960]
They suck, but anyway the leaves are

[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.720]
Just bruised and bloodied and injured and all

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.220]
Like a minor league team

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.100]
Half of the team is from San John's man

[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.500]
And they still kicked it last night right there in Ottawa

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.640]
So last night about 10-15 all over this city

[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.060]
The horns were honking and were honking

[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.800]
And were honking all over the place

[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.140]
Just to go and nuts, you'd have thought they already won the cup

[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.060]
And anyway I know George is excited about that

[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.120]
Let's do a hockey show

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880]
Alright, not call it right now

[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.520]
Yeah, alright

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.280]
Call Rimmer and tell them they stunk

[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.880]
1283 votes on our survey

[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.040]
Well they're not really votes

[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.740]
Well it's more than that now but

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.860]
See I don't have time to dittle with that when they put these last minute things on there

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.240]
Which are you we asked

[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.940]
Because naturally, now who was it that fact is that 800 paid sting that you faxed me on Friday

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.420]
Like some puts

[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.600]
Yeah, some puts

[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.940]
About all these different studies

[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.520]
How can you study something when everybody's in a closet most people lie about it anyway

[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.640]
So just as kind of an out on this pool

[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960]
I you know gave a couple of gag choices there which run over very well

[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.760]
They like gagging it

[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.960]
Which are you exclusively heterosexual

[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.460]
790 which came up to 61.6%

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.740]
Just horny

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.760]
Test horny 282

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.060]
22%

[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.540]
Exclusively homosexual 85

[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.600]
6.6%

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.280]
Desperate 66

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.700]
Desperate and honest 5.1%

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.040]
And bisexual 64.6%

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.780]
Now some people would say well that doesn't mean anything because you put the that's the idea see that gives everybody an out

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.920]
We don't know and we don't care but it was kind of fun. We had a lot of people logging on it

[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.120]
Which was a lovely thing

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.820]
So here's a couple of quick faxes here

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.000]
About my maple leaves

[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.720]
As we continued tomorrow night meant now tomorrow is going to be real dilemma you know why

[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.380]
Why? Oh tomorrow's aim 7 of that series

[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.260]
And also tomorrow's Tuesday night smallville

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.340]
So being the emotional coward that I am

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.080]
I've already if Pete Lenny has sent me another god damn oh Jesus Christ. Oh

[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.800]
PD Lenny go away okay

[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.300]
PD Lenny good don't ever give the sls people this fax number again

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.320]
Okay, this man is is like a gigantic tumor on my brain

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.720]
PD Lenny go away PD go go to the airport with Dion Warwick get lost get out of my face

[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.900]
Go have a date with Mohawar's wig just get out of here

[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020]
Anyway here's two faxes

[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.480]
Neil what a game absolute heart and grit that's what we saw in the ice last night this team is like an old truck driving down the road

[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.400]
Miss firing and parts coming off but just keeps running

[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.860]
There's a game 7 baby see a Tuesday down the cbc go least go

[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.080]
Absolutely correct that's her man

[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.220]
Oh!

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.760]
Gary Roberts and Alan McCulley and all those other glam

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.400]
Yes so tomorrow got that of course it's very easy for me being emotionally like I started to say cripple

[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.060]
I'm what I'll do is I'll tape the game have it on in the living room

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.320]
And then I go in my bedroom and close the door so I can't hear it and I'll watch smallville see what I'm saying yeah that's good idea

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.140]
So that way there's no stress

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.360]
And then I come back out and hope for the best now I'm a basket case I can't handle all the pressure another game 7

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.000]
Two straight series with a game 7 by the way the real story corner the Toronto Sun about why

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.220]
Chuck Fletcher got candy as the GM of the Panthers the real story which evidently down there

[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.000]
They don't have and even if they did Geldie probably wouldn't do it because he's sucking around the organization

[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.220]
Because he wants a jigsmagnonal job but anyway the real story is quite of the Sun that they offered Chuck they made him an offer he could refuse

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.460]
They offered Chuck Fletcher 400 grand to stay on his permanent GM and he said no that's not enough money and he said oh okay well have a good life

[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.000]
And Rick Dudley who was waiting in the wings my keen and old buddy they said hey come on in Rick he'll work cheap

[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.200]
And of course based on what he accomplished is caretaker and auto offered two years and is like Tampa like they wanted him out in Tampa

[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.740]
So I don't want to like predict any bad things but the organization once again is search selling you short drift how would that goes

[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.360]
Here's another hockey facts how do you like that to get started to blow the whole audience off that's okay I don't care it's that time of the year

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.940]
Oh and speaking of sports by the way what a joke

[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.760]
Now I already asked George before the show but you know George sometimes he lies a lot because he's a troublemaker

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.700]
So I asked Miguel did it rain there yesterday?

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.480]
Little bit

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.540]
Well now what what kind of an answer is that for like five minutes of rain in my house oh

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:26.540]
In other words it wasn't one of those gray nasty rainy days it was hot yeah it was very hot very hot very sunny a beautiful day to be at the old ballpark

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.100]
The South Florida baseball team which they keep talking about

[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.280]
On this radio station like somebody cares when every year I have to go through the same thing because it frost my ass

[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.440]
Talk about beating a dead horse

[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.740]
Nobody cares

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.920]
For the Dodgers big three game series with those big pitching matchups they had 12,953 on a Friday a big 19,000

[00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.680]
767 on Saturday the second biggest crowd of the season and yesterday the first place South Florida baseball team first place

[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.100]
They wound up winning in a smashing victory yesterday 11 to 3 6 out of 7 they will now what do you think the attendance was have you looked?

[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:15.100]
I looked no I'm talking to Miguel. He's a big baseball his father loves the South Florida baseball team I didn't catch the crowd

[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.260]
No, you didn't catch it you could have caught it in a butterfly net

[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.520]
7,930 people was Mother's Day

[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.640]
Oh, that's right it was Mother's Day now Montreal of course was the lowest in the majors

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.680]
But they had the Canadians were playing or supposed to play against Carolina

[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.480]
But they failed to show up after

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.780]
After their coats blew that game to the night, but anyway Montreal 55 28 the South Florida baseball team

[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.180]
39 30 and even the West Florida they devil raised the Tampa devil raised 10,264

[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.400]
So the South Florida baseball team continues to have these second worst attendance all the major leagues a disgrace a non viable franchise

[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.680]
Bap-bap-bap, they're young. They're exciting their first place nobody cares bulletin nobody cares

[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.840]
Here's another fact that says even with a bad knee Stevie isamans better than most players and you are absolutely

[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.940]
Correct, so although I must say this in all the fences Stevie like BM once told me good old Brian Murray

[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.520]
At that dinner that I bought for him and Rimmer

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.760]
Like old BM once said to me it's too bad that Stevie's too small to ever be a great player nice gone air BM

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.180]
And are you a jackass is he an asshole or what no? Oh, that's right. He's a genius. I forgot all the memories are geniuses and and vote I too

[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.740]
Anyway, it goes on to say it's BS. They say he intentionally hurt Chris prongard

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.120]
You notice that with all the black people in Detroit there wasn't one of the stands. That's correct

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.780]
Nine players over 35 years old are still kicking ass. Go Leafs go. We got him now

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.600]
There you go two hockey fans to get us started all ready today

[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.220]
Oh, it's about time. It's a boot time is what I would say

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.580]
I think they're still hunking horns out here. They're just going nuts and rightfully so big balls

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.000]
That's what I'm talking about today like the maple leaves have got

[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.820]
Big balls what what was that horns honking and

[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.360]
crap are you starting with your honky crap again? Oh

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.000]
And today I'm going to give the audience the poll question they've been waiting for I said I wasn't going to do this

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.520]
But I also said I wasn't going to take any calls and I did do it a week ago Friday and you know was it was

[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.520]
What did it amount to P hole in the snow, you know didn't amount to too much

[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.560]
But I'm going to give them the opportunity that they've been waiting for and not that I'm going to necessarily pay attention

[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.280]
The response but I might you never know that's always keep them dangling out there keep them on the hook

[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.300]
Keep them twisting in the wind

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.900]
Here's our pull question you ready Eric? No come on put down the goddamn my Ruben sandwich

[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.120]
A lot of people would say it's only a nine o'clock in the morning who the hell's eaten a Ruben sandwich at this time in the morning the answer is Eric

[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.580]
What are you dislike most about Neil show don't you think that's a simulating pull wow

[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.940]
And wait till you're all the choices I've got

[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.700]
What do you dislike my when I forgot to put George in there?

[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.300]
Now he's got enough problems, okay, that should be the problem

[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.520]
I guess his problems are over now that he and Greg bonded last Thursday had a wonderful

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.660]
They kissed and made up they they did high fives they did the fist routine

[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.000]
I don't want to tell you where they put each other's fist, but it was exciting it was emotional is what I'm hearing

[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.900]
What do you dislike most about Neil show no phone calls

[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]
Too much reading

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.200]
Don't like the tone

[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.820]
Nothing it's fine. What does that mean the tone wait when you shut up see I've got to put you on here if you don't stop

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.460]
I've got a whole long list here

[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.000]
Let me go back to the start again poor Eric. He's trying to get these into it. That you're getting starting to get just like JD

[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.500]
John Davidson hey, by the way JD who says that it was illegal hit by Alfred's in Friday night

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.040]
You're full of crap JD you're a good guy and I like you, but you talk way too much in your full of crap other than that

[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.580]
Gonna make you go on to make you a lop without straking what an asshole anyway

[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.260]
What do you dislike most about Neil show no phone calls too much reading don't like the tone tone and capital letters by the way

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:58.580]
Nothing it's fine nothing I like it better than ever too many a priest stories too many comedy bits or not enough comedy bits

[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.860]
What do I do good pull or what I've done even on the worst days on this show and they're been a few

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.800]
But I do a pull like nobody has ever done a pull

[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.120]
In fact, I keep running around downtown same boy. Do I do good pull and they all run a scatter

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.860]

18 at 5.60 W.N.Q.A.M. By the way you're welcome, all my good friends

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.520]
At the mommy hero, the ones who pretend they hate me like poison but listen religiously everyday like they're listening right now

[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.540]
You're welcome for that story about Al Goldstein

[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.280]
Saturday's hero, no less Saturday

[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.820]
Which was a day after it was like in all the New York papers of course

[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.440]
Although I, for example, let me give you an example

[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.580]
You know the Schwarzscher songwriter, what that was his name, Otis Blackwell?

[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.100]
Blackwell, yes

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.000]
Yeah

[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.180]
His obituary was in the hero this weekend

[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.560]
Now we talked about it last the middle last week didn't we?

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.180]
Yes we did

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.860]
Well I mean you people at the herald I think basically the cut cost over there what they pretty much done is they just

[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.300]
They cancel the news wires and what they do is they just go online and steal stuff off of the newspapers

[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.600]
And they don't have much of a staff left so it takes them a few days to get to it anyway

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.540]
Although they do have the big story about the Kevin Baxter

[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.280]
There's the one guy at the herald even though I'm never speaking to him again

[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.020]
Kevin Baxter's got this story about magic because of the changing their playlist

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.120]
Finally after all these years it's about time Bob Hamilton

[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.420]
They've named a city on terrier after that guy such a schmuck Bob Hamilton what up puts

[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.280]
And also speaking to kid curry don't let me forget about that about Mike Disney picking on kid curry

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.920]
Okay

[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.440]
The story that I told you to be for the show. I got so much crap man

[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.220]
Yeah, what kind of a guy who's like 60 years old calls himself kid?

[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.840]
That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. Yeah, well bug off

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.560]
They're just ripping him an ass over here on PYM. I'm party radio in between the rodents after he duo

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.600]
They're ripping him an ass a big fat old pimple ass and I thought I'm a squee had the big ass

[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.880]
Poor kids scurvy man that guy's got serious problems now over there at power

[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.480]
They've taken away all his audience. They're ripping him an ass and they're also running promos

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.380]
speaking to people stealing stuff from me

[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.600]
Running promos about the fact that kid curry was offered all the music that the

[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.560]
The PYM is playing now with their big numbers and he turned it down in last year and a half and you know what that

[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.540]
Alligation is absolutely correct. That's right

[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.500]
That is correct

[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.860]
Wasn't good enough for power and now they're playing a music kicking his ass with it

[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.160]
So anyway getting back to what the story on Saturday's here. I'll porn mogul falls ill in court

[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.580]
this is this is

[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.360]
shameful

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.520]
And you know the only reason they even bothered checking the daily news was because of the fact I talked about it here on a year

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.260]
We talked about it at length remember both the story from the daily news in the post

[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.680]
Henri Pett and Smutsal the Zat Sound from meteor al Goldstein was rushed to a hospital

[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.440]
Which has pains after a judge sentenced him to 60 days in jail for harassing a former secretary with x-rated phone calls and letters the new

[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.380]
York daily news reports is there and it goes on to report the rest of the story verbatim from the daily news

[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.980]
Boy are you people kidding anybody or what no you're not well, I guess a few dumb people

[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.600]
I keep wasting their money on your paper. I do it only because I have to do this show

[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.060]
Although now that I get it online, I might have to cancel when I get back

[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.740]
Deon Warwick is I'm sure you already know and of course if she's a psychic

[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.560]
How come Miss Cleo gets it all at hot water and Deon Warwick never got thrown in the slam or whatever else, huh?

[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.140]
How come nobody said fake or fake or liar liar

[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.240]
Good, but she's a psychic she should have known that they were gonna find them joints Deon Warwick arrested for a marriage

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.420]
Jeweanie possession in Miami

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.520]
Sing around psychic friend Deon Warwick was arrested early yesterday morning when she tried to get through security at

[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.920]
MIA with 11 mirror Jeweanie cigarette stuffed inside a silver lipstick container. Dave County, Poli said

[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.080]
11 joints in the lipstick. I guess I guess that's conceivable, huh?

[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.080]
Must be a pretty big lipstick container

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.820]
Or maybe they were like very small joints maybe like a pin joint like clearance Thomas likes to smoke

[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.180]
Warwick 61 to as homes in Brazil and New Jersey was headed to LA on American Airlines flight 906

[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.440]
But mr. Plane police said I can't imagine why

[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.560]
Bagged screeners have concourse D of the airport called polis when they saw his suspicious item inside her carry on bag

[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:38.360]
Poli said she was charged with possession of marijuana totaling less than five grams and released after she signed an affidavit

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.160]
Promising to appear in court police said

[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.820]
Her sister D.D. Warwick who answered the phones that the families New Jersey home yesterday afternoon said she was shocked by the news

[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.920]
I'm sure Deon doesn't use drugs. She does not use drugs. I don't understand how to secure it

[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.380]
I think someone put that honor. It wasn't true. She said yeah, they planted them

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.400]
Don't you think that's a viable story? They planted a joints in her lipstick case. Make sense to me

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.820]
Maybe somebody packs her bags for her. I think she's been packing it

[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.620]
Warwick is one five Grammys the first in 1968 for you know the way to San Jose where they have really good weed

[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.260]
She holds a doctor in a master degree some hard hard college music and hard for big deal

[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.880]
She's also well known for being singer Whitney Houston's cousin. Did you know that?

[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.220]
Yes, I did I never I never knew that

[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.540]
Well, you see the connection now the drug connection between Whitney Houston and Deon Warwick you see that like

[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.860]
Birds of a feather

[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.680]
Smoke together

[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.820]
In fact, you probably got this stuff from George if you asked me was on a Sunday was on a weekend

[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.040]
He and doing much no appearances this weekend. She got the weed from George

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:48.520]
Anyway, Whitney and pitch woman for now defunct psychic friends network did they ever uh they don't recall them ever given her any grief because of the fact that she's a fake

[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.500]
She's not any psychic

[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.040]
I don't know if she claimed to be or

[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.760]
A or the other schmucks that she had on her and those other damn broads yet on her they were about a psychic is my little dog

[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.040]
In fact, I'll guarantee and you know this for a fact

[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.580]
I'm a hell of a lot more psychic than any of them. Oh, yeah, you should start your own line

[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.560]
Now what's happening with your mic there that just cut out? I don't know

[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.600]
Are you having a problem with that switch again? Oh, and by the way, I just mentioned in case there's any program director in the building

[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.880]
But I doubted where case any engineers are in the building, but I doubted that um

[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.700]
I'm still waiting on this new fax machine up here. It's only three months later

[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.640]
I just mentioned that in passing because since I'm spending my own money for supplies

[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.220]
Which I have no problem with doing but I hate to go out and buy like a bunch of toner and stuff for this machine if it's gonna be gone

[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.080]
But I guess I'm stuck with it

[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:39.100]
What a what a place in 1985 she had a brief comeback with that's what friends are for some with Elton John's

[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:46.480]
Stevie Wonder Gladys knife which raised millions of dollars for AIDS research warwick is considered the first black female pop and soul singer to achieve international

[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.200]
Stardom

[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.380]
In other words, he was before your re-thra

[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.540]
Oh, yeah, all those

[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.080]
Hurt back-or-rack tunes that was before you re-thra are you sure? I'm gonna have to look it up and look it up

[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.560]
But I think so yeah, she was also the first black female performed appeared before the queen of England and a world command performance

[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.880]
How do you like that? She likes them queens?

[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.620]
Oh god reaching over for this big heavy book you have no idea

[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.380]
Now who am I looking for you re-thra Franklin

[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.160]
And yeah, of course it's this international

[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.140]
So no matter what I find in here, they're gonna give me crimp a wreath or Franklin's first big hit was

[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.860]
Never loved the man the way I love you

[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.500]
67 although she had rocked by your baby with the Dixie melody that she stole from Al Jolson in 61

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.520]

You do I do I think you're full of it myself

[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.480]
Of course, I thought that before you said that let's see don't make me over 63

[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.340]
Say yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:54.520]
Your re-thra was still like fairly obscure until about 67 like I just said she was the first the on first international whatever

[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.240]
Bush Gardens Lion maim's worker do you see this grotesque story? Yes

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:03.380]
They tamped Tribune reports of this way much better than the story that was in the Yokel papers a

[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.480]
350-pound African Lion ripped off the armor of a bush garden zookeeper yesterday while she was giving her family a private tour

[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.160]
Oh

[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.380]
Yeah, that makes it I mean I'm not gonna say it makes it worse

[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.780]
But you know what I'm getting choked up about makes it worse yeah, it does for the family right there

[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:27.440]
Disgusting the amusement park wouldn't release the name of the 21-year-old zookeeper was giving her parents her boyfriend

[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.700]
Oh and her and his parents a mother's date tour of the Lion's Night Quarter is near the edge of Africa attraction

[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.500]
The 145 PM accident didn't take place in front of guests

[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.000]
Officials still investigating say the zookeeper might have placed her hand between the metal bars of the cage

[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.120]
Possibly to feed the animal her right arm was severed near the elbow the woman was taken to him

[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.000]
Tampa general hospital in serious condition her severed arm was also taken to hospital

[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.800]
Bush Garden said the lion a 12-year-old named Max would not be euthanized Max has been a bush since 1997

[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.760]
Bush owns one other lion a female

[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.100]

We the Congress in order to form a more right wing union established more roles and cut funding for public TV

[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.480]
Lick me new. Yes, big an ooty. Just got divorced from a second wife nice going note. Oh, he's doing it

[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.200]
Remember the first wife of course who was dying from cancer in the hospital. He went. They took the divorce papers. They're for a design

[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.860]
I remember

[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.200]
Yeah, a lovely guy

[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.140]
Gay prom battle ends with a wall. See I talked about big balls. Here's a kid 17-year-old kid who's not only out of a closet

[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.740]
Got the balls for that, but I guess it's not that unusual especially here in canadae

[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.100]
Which is much more like light years more progressive than the u.s. of a which still is still living in a stone age with people like John

[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.940]
Askcraft etc

[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.940]
But nevertheless it still takes big balls to like take on a Catholic church

[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.800]
As if they don't have enough problems of their own

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:26.120]
They dance the night away mark all the shy blue quatt 17-year-old Asha was student who wouldn't take no for an answer

[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.600]
When told he couldn't take his boyfriend it was high school prom one a major court victory for Catholic students on Friday

[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.780]
In a comprehensive and clear decision granting halls request for an injunction

[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:42.000]
Mr. Justice Robert McKinnon of the superior court of justice said a ban on same-sex dates that the prom was a clear violation

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.240]
Of Hall's constitutional rights in order to the Durham Catholic District school board to allow hall and john Paul Dumont

[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.480]
21 to attend the dance which they did by the way and had a wonderful time a lovely time

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.940]
School board chair Mary Ann Martin said while the board was extremely disappointed with the ruling

[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.040]
Hall in his date would be allowed to attend the prom if they wish and like I said they did and had a lovely time

[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.920]
While Hall's legal team said the ruling would set a precedent for gay and lesbian rights in the education system

[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.720]
Martin disagreed saying the ruling applied only to the prom

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.880]
Can't have no fags in the church

[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.460]
Hahaha

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.180]
It's okay to have a bunch of child molesting priests. That's okay

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:22.000]
But we certainly and part of the whole argument here. This is the best. I don't know if it's in this story or not

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.240]
Which I'm gonna go through but nevertheless

[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.020]
One of the representatives for the a Catholic school board said

[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.220]
That going to the prom was like an act of romance and therefore an act of romance was like

[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.020]
uh close to an act of sex

[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.600]
You're following all of these things yeah

[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.420]
And of course if the heterosexuals are going to the prom

[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.740]
I guess that's an active romance which also could be an active sex and since they weren't intended to make no babies

[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.940]
That would also be a mortal sin would it not I would think last time I checked with the father

[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.500]
The board will continue to apply the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church to school sponsored activities

[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.440]
She said both aboard and halls lawyers say they're ready to continue with the full trial down the issue and take it all away

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.160]
The Supreme Court of Canada if necessary

[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.760]
Nice going air mark like I said a big pair

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.560]
But for hall in his date last night was the time to celebrate as they wrote in a long black stretch limo to the prom

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:15.840]
This was Saturday hall in a white tuxedo in blue tile like I said it was Friday said he was very unhappy and so excited that we won

[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.300]
When he first heard the news from his lawyer at home in Ashewa he said I was jumping up and down and everybody was shouting

[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:27.280]
I feel at ease now knowing that we're free of discrimination said the grade 12 student mon senior John Paramek heathal

[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:35.240]
High School and it goes on and on a great life, but the good news is we won we all people not just gave people not just Mark

[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.800]
Holland's boyfriend John Paul whatever's name is but everybody all

[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.700]
Progressive open-minded people who want to take on the bigots and the hypocrites like the Catholic Church for example

[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.340]
How's the pool coming by the way? Here's your big chance today? Here's your golden opportunity

[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.040]
Don't you may never get this again?

[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.840]
Although probably will but not for a long time didn't I say I wasn't gonna do this I said that but I lied

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.520]
Just like I said I wasn't gonna take phone calls and I did that one day and more I think about it the less I feel that was a good idea

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.080]
I remember that very first call that day

[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.660]
Do you recall a guy who was saying that because I'm not there?

[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.640]
I'm not in touch because everybody was so upset about the murder the angel girl and so on right?

[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.340]
I remember see if I was there just like during alien

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.680]
I wouldn't listen anything any different than my being here. I'm very familiar with the story

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.300]
I read the story we talked about it on the year and my feelings wouldn't have been any different people are getting murdered and butchered all the time and

[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.860]
The picking shoes like one from column A and column B that the community is all been out of shape about that's unacceptable to me

[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.080]
It's it's ridiculous on the face of it

[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.720]
As if somehow one life is worth more than somebody else's life

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.040]
And I'm not talking about scumbags and murderers who get killed or game, you know mobsters. That's not what I'm referring to

[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.200]
But nevertheless so my my comment would have been any different where it no matter where I'm sitting

[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.540]
See that's what I'm talking about big balls, baby a big pair

[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.180]
Just tell it like it is and let the chips fall where they may right on most a bald spot

[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.080]
How's he doing by the way don't hear or mention anybody's name not even not just my name anybody's name. Oh boy

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.800]
Anyway, here's the pull here's the pull so far. I'm just asking out loud don't say anything

[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.300]
59 votes on there already

[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.340]
What are you dislike most about Neil show see and then I could ask what do you like the most?

[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.600]
You know and have you sucky sucky sucky which isn't the purpose of the pool

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.620]
Let's be honest. Let's lay it right out there on a goddamn table. Okay, I can handle it

[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:31.000]
An old fag like me with a big pair of balls. I can handle the truth unlike a goddamn Tom Cruise

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.840]
And you know something Tom Cruise can't handle the truth

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.120]
It's interesting that it's interesting that Jack Nicholson told him that line in that movie

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.000]
You know when you stop and think about it. I thought about it. Yeah, he can't handle the truth

[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.860]
At least his career can't handle the truth because it's not good for business. How about that spider-man by the way?

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.900]
We'll get to that

[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.860]
Now do you really expect me to read this through about Rick Sanchez? I guess they want me to oh

[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.060]
It's just because it was from Tom jikka. Oh

[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:05.040]
It's wrong. I didn't see that yet. I hadn't the look that far from Tom jikka man. Is he an asshole or what?

[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:11.020]
Sanchez hits stride at MSNBC. Oh little Tommy man. Oh man and

[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.640]
And we have nothing against Rick Sanchez

[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.980]
We you know poke a lot of fun at him

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.680]
Of course a lot of people in San Florida hate him like poison and they still they still hold that dead guy against him

[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.120]
You know what?

[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.820]
What's wrong with them?

[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.800]
He's still dead. Here's a couple of more facts is excellent one. It says I'm glad you brought it out

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.360]
These from the same I'm not really sure no

[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.040]
Here's one. It says glad you brought up the comments that JD made regarding the Alfred Sidhid on Tucker

[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.800]
I'm sure JD's panties would have been in a knot if his girlfriend Theo Florey or Pavl had been hit in the same manner

[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.380]
You're absolutely correct sir. I talked to JD on a phone yesterday. Thanks to Rimmer

[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.940]
Bapapapapa, on and on and on, Rimmer's phone rang 17 times during a conversation by the way and JD and I were both a guest

[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.940]
I mean JD's a good guy, but it's just a talk's way too much and he's full of crap and I told him that I said Sam Rosen is

[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.200]
They're gonna jump out of the booth one of these nights if he don't shut up

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.560]
It says it's clear to everyone in the league that there exists two sets of rules those for Supermer stars

[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.260]
No, it's for the muckers and there's no question mucker rhymes with Darcy Tucker and other things Darcy's a hard-nosed guy

[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.880]
Yeah, he did the peck a hit and the one on the gun. Charna couple others this season

[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.520]
But the fact is rules are rules and in the late stages of a vital playoff game

[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.840]
Just to look the other way because you see it's number 16

[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.920]
And they were broken bone in his shoulder and unable to get back into play and let play go right on

[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.660]
Unreceptible a hit from behind and I don't care how much JD gives me a song to dance

[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.860]
It was a hit from behind which the league is trying desperately to crack down on we got screwed

[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.520]
But you know something unlike all the people say we're a bunch of winers

[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.620]
We just continue going out there and grind it away right Gary Roberts. Let's go and Gary

[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.320]
We just turned 150 years old. They still kicking ass

[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.200]
Here's one it says your pull for today has a major flaw

[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.580]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha let me save this for after the break you read it

[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.900]
I guess uh sure it's great. How come you're taking so much crap

[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:01.420]
Oh by the way when I'm on vacation next week Joe and George are gonna be doing the show together to take take the pressure off

[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.880]
You know don't you think that's a great idea? It's a wonderful idea

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.940]
You don't like it. I think you and I like it together. We were great together and then if it turns out great

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.960]
You can split the credit and if it turns out crappy then you can blame Joe

[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:21.120]
But then of course it's gonna work that way right no it'll be great 20 till 10 at 5. It will be great

[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.720]
Gonna be in the 70s and Amsterdam. Oh man

[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.680]
I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about that gonna be sunny in 70 degrees

[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.740]
Hmm can't wait

If you've tried atkins and scatkins and still men and this one and that one and Jenny Craig and your failing

[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.760]
Well, the answer is balance for life because it really works because you don't have to make any choices other than the

[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.080]
They let you choose between two alternatives for each meal every day that you run a program

[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.100]
You have a little sheet you fill out and pick whatever you want

But other than that those are the only choices you make you don't have to go to the supermarket and buy and count calories or carbs

Or any of the thing that's complicated because even as complicated as own base nutrition is the good deal is that the people at balance for life

A little black sack and man life is sweet when you got your little black sack

That's what Stevie Wonder said that's his favorite is his little black sack and we said Stevie

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:38.180]

The bridge is underway on sports radio 560

[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.700]
Beware of exploding balls

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.360]
Sing my song

[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.780]
But you're not looking at my mouth you stare so long

[00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:52.990]
Something that's a bit further south and it's not my base

[00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.530]
Where both your eyes

[00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.730]
Right under my clothes is my biggest

[00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:13.470]
Underneath my clothes there's a great big booty all right bigger than J. Love

Rachans all right

[00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.950]

[00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.150]
Ladies

[00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.790]
A

[00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.110]
Green

[00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.750]
Within

[00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.910]
A

[00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.190]
Please

[00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.330]
Got aよ

[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.260]
One vote's on the poll. What do you dislike most about Neal's show?

[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.340]
Nothing, it's fine 25. Don't like the tone.

[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.940]
Got to hand it to the crank people out there. They always pick a good one.

[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.220]
You know what? They're picking it right now.

[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.880]
Just a little bit.

[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.000]
Yeah. Oh wait a minute. Just change. Nothing, it's fine 27.

[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.000]
Don't like the tone 24. Well they got to have something to hang their head on.

[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.440]
Hang your head on this. Nothing I like it better than ever 19.

[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.340]
No phone calls 18. That's like 16.6%.

[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.980]
Guess what? We'll see how this works out. Too many pre-story 7, too much reading 7.

[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.100]
Not enough comedy bits 5 and too many comedy bits only 1.

[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.700]
Too many comedy bits. Hey listen I put them on there.

[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.800]
You vote for whatever you really think and then it cranks too.

[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.600]
Okay? With a tone. They don't like the tone.

[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.780]
You know what we ought to do every morning when we start the show.

[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.700]
What do they call those little harmonicas?

[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.820]
No, it's not a real harmonica. You know what I'm talking about?

[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.580]
Like a kazoo.

[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.640]
No, no. Wait you like what a when somebody sings like they were going to get the pitch.

[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.220]
Right, you know the tone. Oh like a vocoder like a sampler.

[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.400]
They don't call it a sampler. Oh, oh to get the key.

[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.540]
That little just the one note harmonica.

[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.640]
I don't know what they called.

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.720]
Well somebody will fax us in okay. 650198.

[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.400]
It's 305 650198 fax us because we're not taking no calls okay.

[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.840]
We're not taking any calls today. Maybe you know when you least expect it will take some here and there.

[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.820]
But anyway getting back to this fax which I'm sure you enjoyed tremendously.

[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.900]
I'm still laughing.

[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.400]
Your the faxes today are great.

[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.680]
Oh, we finally turned the corner which is a miracle because I was telling Miguel before the show and this is the truth.

[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.940]
After Easter and Passover and you heard me say this for years but it bear saying again since it is the 13th of May.

[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.200]
Every year then soft food unfortunately it's still a bush league seasonal town.

[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.200]
I mean whoever heard of a city would like or at least a tri-county area with four five million people whatever it is.

[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.260]
By the way did you know Toronto was the number four market in all of North America right after Chicago?

[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.040]
No idea.

[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:59.680]
Five million people. But at any rate after a Easter and Passover half a soft load of bails out not half but what percentage would you say like 30% 40% at least the good 30%?

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.660]
A solid at least.

[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.760]
A lot of people just bail out of there.

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.600]
And I was putting out to George that on the domain report on our website.

[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:17.160]
The number of hits on a website every day from Canada is staggering which means it's not because I'm doing a show here in Toronto because there ain't nobody listening on the radio in Toronto or anywhere else in Canada.

[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.320]
But they're listening on a website which means there are people who are like snowbirds or down there during the winter time.

[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.280]
I love the show and they're listening.

[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.740]
So a special hello to them.

[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.700]
Police going.

[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.000]
And Ottawa sucks.

[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.960]
Oh sorry for all our friends in Ottawa which I'm sure we don't have any to them.

[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.300]
Okay.

[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.060]
School them.

[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.700]
Make me sick to my stomach.

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.200]
And they're talking about whiners.

[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:43.200]
This is a franchise that had to go to the government for money because they can't the Toronto fans develop a place most of the time except the front running phoneies that they get during the playoffs like in Carolina.

[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.260]
Oh my god.

[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:52.300]
Nothing could be finer than get rid of Carolina and a Canadians after blowing that game the other night fooled up like an accordion there yesterday just might as well not have even shown up.

[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.520]
Poor Josie theater and he still looks good.

[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.340]
Anyway, here's this facts.

[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.960]
How come I'm so damn wound up today?

[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.800]
You know, I don't know.

[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.420]
I don't know what it is.

[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.440]
I don't know what the hell it is.

[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.780]
Your poll has a major flaw today says this fact.

[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.900]
I love your show with calls without calls more bits less bits more reading less reading.

[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.040]
I couldn't give a crap.

[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.880]
It's all good.

[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.580]
I listen every day.

[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.480]
I've been for many years until I love this fact until mumble boy.

[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.360]
How could you not include them on your pool when that pot head mumbling ass eating, Jew hating, Arab loving,

[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.720]
spick is trying to imitate you and failing miserably.

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.200]
I simply turn to another station.

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.600]
You have to include that butmuncher.

[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.620]
But let me just say this.

[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.520]
You don't forget it's going to be Joe and George when I'm on vacation next week.

[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:40.020]
So don't be don't be hurt and Joe and me also because this next thing it says you probably won't see this facts because you won't forward it.

[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.640]
So if you're reading this George F you.

[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.140]
Hey F you George.

[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.440]
Okay, I got it.

[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.180]
A lot of people went to school at F you.

[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.060]
It's up there in Kingsville.

[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.800]
Also now is this rack?

[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.820]
Is that a name rack?

[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.300]
That's what's on there.

[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.880]
Rack in Miami says I was happy to see a diary my mailbox last week.

[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.540]
It's been seven years since they last sent me one.

[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.340]
It'll be interesting filling in the book when the spick is on.

[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.380]
Thanks for letting me vent.

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.720]
Hey don't be hurting me because this is on okay.

[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.240]
That's what we put Joe on air is a buffer because we know a lot of people don't like this.

[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.920]
So don't be hurting Joe and Neil just because you see what I'm saying.

[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.400]
You just keep listening and do it in stereo.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.620]
And just turn down the whichever speaker George is coming out of you can't stand him.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.780]
Just turn him down or off and listen to Joe.

[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.020]
See the way that works out?

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.520]
Well you're getting really sensitive.

[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.560]
What are you talking about?

[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.440]
I think pretty soon you and more are going to start bonding because you're both incredibly sensitive.

[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.440]
I said that's not what are you talking about sensitive?

[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.600]
Let me ask you do you think he's ever going to loosen up or is he just going to he's going to have up that bug up his ass for the rest of his life?

[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.080]
That's right you can't comment just when you made peace with Greg and everybody and I'm trying to get you in trouble again.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.420]
Especially when on the heels of that hostile facts where he hates you like poison.

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.660]
Like I said, rack or Rick or whatever your name is.

[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.200]
I love you and all that other stuff but don't you know don't punish us.

[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.440]
We got enough we got enough to hand you kept overcome as it is without you like picking on poor George in the a diaries.

[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.300]
Okay so listen religiously which is what I always suggest being a religious guy that I am.

[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.160]
Here's the facts from Johnny.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.780]
How you doing Johnny?

[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.040]
It says I was listening to Matt drug your Sunday night show yesterday on 610 W.I.O.D.

[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.140]
Well if you listen to that I don't have to ask how you're doing Johnny.

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.400]
He was talking about Bill O'Reilly and what a hypocrite he is and he's right about that.

[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:21.340]
Anyway a caller called up and brought up your name he said something like O'Reilly wouldn't stand a chance if he won't as on against you.

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.120]
Drudge laughed and said something like I don't know what Neal would do with Bill O'Reilly probably having for breakfast lunch in dinner.

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.780]
In other words kick his ass is what he's trying to say and Johnny says I'm not sure if that was a homosexual reference or a fat reference.

[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.740]
What do you think Neal?

[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.920]
Neither of the above okay because the Matt Roger's a fat whatever he is.

[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.060]
Queen.

[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.140]
My good buddy Matt Roger I'm sure he's listening right now nice going Matt.

[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.960]
And you're absolutely correct.

[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:47.660]
Oh that's right we'll have a chance to kick his ass because he's not noon to do or noon to whatever he's on on the light bulb.

[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.620]
You think he's going to give us any competition?

[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.160]
No.

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.520]
He might take like a half a point from a from fat ass limbo.

[00:42:54.340 --> 00:43:02.880]
And all this crap about all there's all these liberals in the media can you tell me seriously can you tell me any like prominent liberal talk show host that you know of?

[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.180]
Oh prominent?

[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.180]
Yeah.

[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:19.480]
I was going to say Randy but then you said prominent right anyway look at look at all the right wing fashion you got all in north you got Gordon Liddy you got limbo now you got Bill O'Reilly adding to the mix in there.

[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:26.100]
Who's the other one from the I mean there's a zillion of these guys each Allen keys there's another one.

[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:37.600]
All right wing Bible thumping phony baloney hypocritical full of crap egotistical assual lunatics okay all in bed with the religious right.

[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.440]
Oh but the liberal media right there ain't no liberal media.

[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:48.280]
I love this facts about the inebriated gentleman doing that one spot but I guess if we want to keep that on the areas that is that a trade out that spot or they pay for that.

[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:54.840]
I think they pay for that they pay for it so I'm not going to mention the sponsor but it says something about the inebriated gentleman doing a spot.

[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:07.840]
I guess everybody else will know exactly what that is speaking of a nebriated what a segue Sanchez hits stride at msnbc writes Tom jica in today's sunsend all time are you a clown or what what a joke.

[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:18.860]
I guess you time don't like the toe of the show either you know it and he doesn't like the fact I'm reading these newspaper magazine articles except he'll like this one again because it's his article.

[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:31.180]
See it's okay a permission from a little Tommy to read on the air as long as he wrote it anything else it's ponderous it's boring I should be carping about south Florida carp carp on this go go out in the bands you can catch one Tom.

[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:42.440]
He writes Rick Sanchez isn't anticipating a rookie of the year award for his first season in the big leagues of TV news but the brash from a rancor of channel seven says he's no mighty case either whiffing in his big opportunity.

[00:44:43.060 --> 00:45:03.800]
It was a year ago that Sanchez and ardent baseball fan announced he was leaving south Florida take a job at msnbc to see if he could have major league pitching his first couple of swings on national stage where a humbling experience I struck out an awful lot he acknowledges his detractors would relic sing in fall on his face should shouldn't be leaping to their feet with glee however Sanchez says I'm hitting it pretty good lately said he's hitting it.

[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.060]
Just like that guy hitting further stadium.

[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:19.540]
Oh that's bad that's terrible did I really say that you did I better interrupt myself and do the break because that that's bad but I do want to read all of time jikers column because it's very important about one of our very very favorite people.

[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:34.880]
The key to key Sanchez and the guy hitting further stadium there under very do be a circumstances the bad news is he's still dead how do you like that as a matter of fact I must confess you over the weekend I don't remember what day it was I did see on msnbc there was fat face pudgy.

[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:56.500]
The ricky ticky Sanchez and guess what I did change that change their real fast excellent choice change that channel real quick while you know I have my own predatory prep heta juices he was our next to a neighbor for a long time the most interesting thing about Rick Sanchez to maybe side the fact that guy he hit is still dead is the fact that when you meet him in person he's about three feet tall.

[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.320]
Did you ever meet him when he came over to the station he was sitting down that one time.

[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:12.120]
Oh, when he stands up he comes up to your kneecap he comes up to Maddie Bell's ankle that's how short ricky ticky is so they must sit him on a whole bunch of phone boots like my good friend Bob mayor channel for 9.5.

[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:27.300]
Olding Bob mayor is a good guy 9.56 at 5.60 WQM here's another good guy Tom Layman who loves me loves the audience of this show everybody who listen to this show has got a special place in Tom Layman's heart that's why he's created the big needle deal at Hallett save big dollars and all Pontiacs and GM seasons stuck just

[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:38.700]
mentioned you heard this commercial on the Euras show stop by Hallett Pontiac GMC 13401 South Texas see highway that's on US one right across from the falls where every vehicle is marked with the lowest price but if you mentioned my name the

[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:52.100]
Euras is deal you'll save even more check out the complete line of GMC SUVs including the envoy loaded by motor trend is the SUV of the year plus while you're at Hallett be sure and take a peek at the all new vibe SUV it's got the power of a big expensive sports car to

[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:59.700]
factor the price how it's also got a big selection of pre on cars trucks SUVs you can depend on and if you've been turned off for credit any place else have no fear Tom

[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:06.640]
Layman will take care of you the cut your deal of Hallett so get yourself a nea Rogers deal at Hallett Pontiac GMC and you'll find them again at 1.30

[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.500]
for a one South Texas see highway on US one across from the falls the same great location they've been doing people right for over 35 years open

[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:19.320]
every day seven days a week you can call them at 305 238 40 40 don't forget at Hallett Pontiac GMC we

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:40.700]
you've seen him on Channel 7 news first as a two-bit reporter now as a two-bit anchor that wears more makeup than Tammy Febaker and Mary K.

[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:55.860]
combine Rick Sanchez sings here the dulcet tones of the men who brought you

[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:30.420]
to the face tour over higher it's one show you all want to miss state for a good one

[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:51.720]
Rick Sanchez he loves his audience I accept you as a precious gift from God hey George this time Jekker

[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.580]
you just pass along to the LN but the reason I call was I thought maybe you can help me I've been trying to get those goddamn ratings

[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:03.940]
tough Lindsay's gone home sick gosh Darryl says he doesn't have the authority to give them to me you know call Greg Reed I couldn't get him

[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:10.060]

[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:16.360]
king his homage anyway I'm only kidding but that is the problem that I do want to do a story on and I'm just having trouble

[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:22.680]
get me so I'll talk to you but we're not here Tom God and you know I didn't even notice my name is in this

[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.000]
article about Rick Sanchez did you notice that no I did not oh I get a mention in here I'm really

[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.140]
excited now thanks a lot little Tommy see I'm getting to Tom jikka I'm getting a little Tommy I don't

[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.460]
care whether it's good or bad just keep putting the name in there I need all the help I can get Tom

[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:40.140]
especially when you work for Greg Reed who lies a lot oh yeah we're doing billboards we're doing it I

[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:46.540]
lied I lied what's no Greg he lied anyway going on about Rick Sanchez who says he's hitting it

[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:52.040]
pretty good lately and don't count him out he hits his stride little Tommy jikka writes he's been tapped

[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.700]
on several occasions this step to even a higher level filling in for NBC news breaks he didn't

[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.900]
during last summer's Wimbledon tennis championships and he also was on call and president Bush choked

[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:06.540]
and faded I got a lot of airtime then Sanchez says I got to debrief NBC correspondent David Gregory

[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:11.660]
at the White House whoo his familiarity with this region also led date line NBC to assignment

[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:16.840]
interview one of these survivors of the anthrax maillings in Palm Beach several factors are responsible

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.100]
for the turn around not the least of which is overcoming rookie jitters anxious to make a good

[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.260]
impression it was initially over preparing for interviews I would write down 52 questions to

[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:29.600]
ask and I was so intent on asking him I missed opportunities for obvious follow-ups one thing I've

[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.040]
developed is a real respect for Bill O'Reilly people like Bill O'Reilly and Larry King who have a

[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.620]
knack for always asking the question of your would just watching how the masters do it has helped

[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:45.460]
him Sanchez says he's obviously elevated his game he's an nominee for an Alma A award a precious

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.860]
national prize for Hispanics and media how many Hispanics do you know in the media George beside

[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:56.680]
Ana squeak down here 100 and you're forgetting Isabelle de Cassada and he's in some pretty fast

[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.280]
company it says other nominees in category are Soledad O'Brien oh she a lightweight or what

[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.880]
a merideth v era and her rather Rivera September 11th also he's in his transformation to feeling like a

[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.840]
real part of his new team he was in makeup preparing for his normal shift when the first plane hit

[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:15.260]
his instincts immediately took hold I ran to the control room and said send me there I just got

[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.520]
out of the car when I saw the first building crumbling down he didn't leave Manhattan for five days

[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.620]
the first day I was on the year for 20 hours it was a lot like hurricane Andrew you get a short

[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:28.100]
catnap here and then go back to work he was really shocked when Sally Fitz showed up turn around and

[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.600]
said to him perhaps the biggest boo Sanchez came from a most unlikely source cramogenly Don

[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.040]
I miss has become fun of him and has made an extended member of his program which is simulcast

[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:44.600]
on MSNBC cramogenly Don I miss which is a very general way Tommy of saying a dead man in a chair

[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.760]
can you imagine a radio talk show host who actually likes me Sanchez says a rye reference to the

[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:55.860]
beating he took actually continues to take from Neil Rogers let's hear it for Tom jikah oh

[00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:01.780]
not only has my name in here but spelled it right now what does that mean a beating he took from me

[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:09.880]
what is that you beat me I never beat up on Rick Sanchez I just had some fun with him

[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:15.400]
see and of course it was just business not personal I don't just like him personal

[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.320]
of just business as opposed to some other people where it's business and personal not to

[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.120]
mention any names Sanchez who's regular MSNBC shift is 9 a.m. to noon connected with I'm

[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.280]
doing news cut-ins during the simulcast it was typical I miss at first Sanchez says he'd ask

[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.160]
who's this big fat jerk doing the news I figured the best thing to do is play along so I asked

[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.040]
his producer to put me on with him I just had fun doing exaggerated Spanish accent things

[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.820]
like that he must have liked it because now he uses me a lot in fact we have a clip from

[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:53.200]
Rick Sanchez's favorite TV show all right

[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.220]
Sanchez figures his future also bright and when NBC bought the telemundo network I'm one of the

[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.380]
few people who when big stories break could move comfortably between English and Spanish

[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.380]
networks I think that makes me really valuable to them says Ricky Tiki Sanchez the same traits

[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.980]
I'll also have him well positioned for a major role in what could be the first colossal news story

[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:15.680]
of the 21st century the inevitable turmoil when Fidel Castro passes from the scene when Fidel

[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:21.260]
passes gas I salivate about that Sanchez says it's the huge story I've been preparing for all my

[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.660]
life who else has the sense of perspective and background I will bring to that story wow there's

[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:31.040]
no way go there at all is there no however humbling in his early days the big leagues might have been

[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:35.860]
he obviously has gotten over it says Tom jica a little shot there at the end in other words he's

[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:41.100]
not so humble anymore nice going Tommy that was pretty sweet huh look at suck job what's all this

[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:46.540]
stuff that you just fact me here man oh man pretty good notes oh it's called a pitch pipe yes it's

[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:52.920]
a pitch pipe it also makes a good one hitter in a pinch oh come on give one to a Dianne Warwick at

[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:57.980]
the airport now why are you facting me is there something of interest to me on this

[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:06.240]
about this page five of seven it's all a bunch of different things but they're all in they're all

[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:13.480]
taking away I see at midnight Spanish broadcasting system flipped rocker KJXO San Francisco to KPTI

[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:19.820]
the Bayer is pure dance channel 92 7 party in English language all dance jockless music outlet

[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:25.020]
oh what seems to be going big man party radio where the ripping kid Korean ass talking about

[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.820]
what's an old man like that who's 70 years old what does he know about the music young people want

[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.460]
to hear that we're playing now and I'll come he turned down a chance to play all this music like a

[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.940]
year and a half two years ago when John and the Abraata to them huh yeah next thing they'll be using

[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.780]
my name on here go right ahead Disney I don't care piss kid Korean Greg off but who they'll give

[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.960]
us a crap okay because it happens to be the truth we brought them all of that great music that

[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.740]
euro stuff okay I'll let the trans stuff all that the you know what I'm talking about I do all

[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.760]
those four records are playing saffery duo and derude over and over again brought them tons of

[00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:01.740]
good stuff did he play most of it no now anyway KPTI will be programmed by the team of sbs executive

[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:08.120]
vice president programming build Tanner national PD of PO Pharaoh and VP of programming Jesus

[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.180]
Salas who runs programs for the oh no who programs the company's three Miami FM stations

[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:22.640]
I don't understand you don't three stations are those I don't get any of this

[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.820]
according to a tenor the gay area the abay area is an actual for this format will be the

[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:32.940]
music sensitive format with no disdockeys while pure dance music is the star those looking to

[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.580]
become mixers are part of KPTI three teams should get their packages to build Tanner oh don't

[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:42.960]
let Bill Tanner touch your package oh not a good idea don't send your package over to Billy Tanner

[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:49.420]
he might squeeze it I think this is that FM station they were talking about for you oh really

[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:54.380]
that's what the answer was no see so they put on a station where they just play music and not

[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.480]
paying any money so it must be a real loser and of course they'll probably get big numbers now

[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:03.080]
so it's a good thing I didn't it made no sense it made no sense it just got to slap me on a station

[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.160]
San Francisco with a morning show and I'm talking about Rick Sanchez and South Florida this and

[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.740]
all this other crap they don't have any idea what I'm talking about boy that's got to be one of

[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:18.540]
the dumbest ideas and of course the look where it came from anyway accused how's that pool coming

[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.820]
by the way this is a very important pool today I said I wasn't going to do this pool because we

[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:26.520]
don't want to give people a lot of opportunity to take a cheap shot but why not who cares I can

[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.940]
handle it I'm not thin skinned like some assholes I know 195 votes on the pool what do you just

[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:38.400]
like most about Neil show come on we can hear it 195 nothing it's fine 48 don't like the tone 43

[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.680]

[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:50.140]
maybe we ought to have that bitch pipe nothing I like it better than ever 34 no phone calls 30 that's

Bubba's love child did you see that story no I didn't he's got a love because you don't read

[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.140]

[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.220]
here on the show weeks and weeks and weeks ago before he was actually charged with a murder I like

[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.400]

Macarthei pastor the northwest side church one of their own priests had fled the country after

[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:24.980]
being accused of sexually abusing a teen girl the congregation gasped the latest bombshell in

[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:30.000]
that nationwide pre-sex abuse scandal was exploding right in front of them right now I'm sure

[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.200]
your heads are spinning Macarthei said just like Linda Blair my head's been that way for a week

[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:39.300]
earlier in the day the Archdiocese of Chicago announced that the Reverend Sleva Policety 43 had

[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.220]
been moved from his position as an associate pastor week after allegations surfaced church officials

[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:49.900]
believe Policety fled to India where he was originally ordained how do you like that we're fleeing

[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:56.160]
over here our minds are filled with concerns for our young people and for our parish Macarthei said

[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.640]
in his stunning letter to parishioners St. Tarsiss a warm wonderful parish we cannot forget that

[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.660]
right you just keep donate man you just keep giving money all those goddamn child molesters

[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:11.360]
have a good time doing it with a clear conscience and keep rubbing your rosary beads and the

[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.760]
patching around with all the chotch keys is now what you like to do in your spare time is

[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.740]
patchy with some chotch keys it's my favorite thing to do yeah let's go patchy with a

[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:24.620]
chotchkey man sounds like a lot of fun to me and didn't the didn't Jesus say something about the

[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.540]
idols and all the sudden graven images didn't the Lord the warn against that I think that was Moses

[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:34.220]
that said that well what the hell did he know he was just an old Jew he didn't know no Jesus just

[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.880]
like what's his name Frankie of potentially he didn't know no godfather Moses didn't know no Jesus

[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.880]
he didn't know no Yoschki he knew Yuschki though he knew to meet you your scavenge and he said man how

[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:49.580]
to hell are we winning without him with that blood clot but Sam sneaking all the hockey stuff here

[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.440]
just to make a rumor in JD happy I bet you JD's listen to the AC five carbony's prep list them

[01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.200]
and that hey JD shut up already will you you bug me 12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQ I tell you one

[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.060]
thing I like the tone of this show today I don't care what anybody says I like the tone I like it a lot

[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.100]
George don't like it because there's too much hockey talking too much George vashing

[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.260]
he can handle it he can handle it after the last month of baby crap at QM he can handle almost

[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.880]
anything he's been conditioned to handle it here's a simple question for if somebody offered to give

[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.520]
you several thousand dollars over the next few years would you accept it better than right you would

[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.860]
what I just say in other words yes it'd be a little foolish not to which makes it really

[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:35.720]
foolish to pass up the opportunity to refinance or buy a home at just 3.95% here's the deal

[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.560]
there's a Fannie Mae program available 3.95% for both refinancing and purchasing of homes

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.600]
think about it just 3.95% and all you have to do is call financial group to get the info how this

[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:55.580]
works call 1-800 940 53 63 that's 1-800 940 53 63 to be more specific you can get 100 grand

[01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.620]
with payments of only $475 a month or 200 grand with payments of only 950 bucks a month

[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.140]
you'll save yourself thousands and thousands of dollars so be done right stupid to pass up a

[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:09.040]
chance like that do the math and do the next logical thing get the details by calling financial

[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:17.540]
group 1-800 940 lend that's 1-800 940 53 63 equal housing lender credit restrictions do apply

[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.780]
and rates are subject to change if you wait to

[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:37.020]
what is a buffalo bill what kind of a father was Robert Blake not your average mother what is that

[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:43.980]

[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:50.500]

[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:56.780]
committed this crime or ordered this crime to be committed yes has your father said to you

[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:05.280]

paper from him that says he did it and my father is severely guilty nice Pablo it's a 1018 at 560

[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.080]
WQ markets are going up I think today is today's in the field of canchants like a turning point in

[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:25.500]
human history can't you smell it or maybe fat boys running around farting in the hallway well

[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.440]

bad the liberal biases then he said that to listen to non-bias newscast we had to listen to

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.700]
rush limbaugh I almost barfed up my coaxes big Arnie and we paid this guy a hundred bucks to talk

[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.940]

[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.080]
Pope couldn't do remember the Pope he was up there with Adele and they both were really crappy

[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.540]

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.900]
thing a lot of people be saying oh Jimmy Carter see he was a Democrat so because he's there

[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:39.160]
egan encouraged abusive to stay in priesthood here's a shocking shameful story from news day in

[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:45.240]
in long gion carnal edward egan once encouraged a priest who admitted sexually abusing a teen

[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.180]
age to continue to serve in the priesthood a newspaper reported on saturday the revelations came

[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:54.100]
in videotape testimony produced five years ago for a civil trial involving a lawsuit against

[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.860]
the roman catholic diocese of bridgeport canetticate a copy of the videotape was obtained by the

[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.860]
washington post which reported saturday that egan said at the time he would not similarly

[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:08.520]
suspend a priest even in the face of shocking allegations of sexual abuse he said diocesan

[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:14.040]
priest were self-employed and not the bishops responsibility let me read that paragraph again

[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:19.260]
boys and girls a copy of the videotape was obtained by the washington post which reported

[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:23.920]
saturday that egan said at the time he would not similarly suspend a priest even in the face

[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:29.840]
of shocking allegations of sexual abuse he said diocesan priest were self-employed and not the

[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.600]
bishops responsibility i would have to know the complete circumstances that egan who's now

[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.580]
had of course the art stasis of new york and under enormous heat a lawyer then presented a

[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.720]
hypothetical case with a fact pattern identical to the martin ellicase what if this priest was a

[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.860]
teacher the lawyer asked and sexually assaulted a student and bit the students penis that would be

[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.860]
sufficient cost for suspension i'm sure in many bishops minds egan in many bishops mind egan

[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:58.420]
responded then the lawyer asked would be sufficient cause in your mind i would have to know all

[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.580]
the details he can reply the suggestion is so strange i'd want to know more about it he want to

[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:08.720]
see pictures i'm sure he'd want to see pictures of the penis biting incident in fact maybe you

[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.960]
want to go and see an instant replay see it like you're revisited it all over again

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.020]
the nineteen ninety seven lawsuit was filed on behalf of frank martin elli who claimed that the

[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:22.400]
Reverend Lawrence Brett sexually assaulted him three times over two year period ending in 1963

[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.560]
including biting him during oral sex a lawsuit was eventually settled a amount of the settlement

[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:35.820]
without the suppose i hate that me too hate biders of course in your case you know it's a good

[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:41.900]
way to get rid of that forskim egan who was appointed bishop of the bridge port diocese in 1988

[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.580]
met with bread in nineteen ninety when the priest expressed concern that past allegations might

[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.840]
interfere with his work are you following that they might interfere with his work according to

[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.320]
the post egan read from a memoranda he wrote soon after that meeting that bread made a good

[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.640]
impression on me he spoke with grace he also testified at the time he was who the hell's grace

[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.560]
he also testified at the time he was inclined to write bread a letter encouraging to go on with

[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.740]
his work egan eventually suspended bread amid mounting allegations of sexual abuse bread was

[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.820]
barred from the active priest that in stripped of his authority to administer sacraments or pursue

[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:18.400]
his ministry or rubbed the rosary beads even although egan is never directly acknowledged missteps

[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.740]
in handling allegations abuse against priest he recently addressed the issue in a pastoral letter

[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:27.180]
if in hindsight we also discovered that mistakes have been made as regards prompt removal of priest

[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:33.160]
and assistant to victims i am deeply sorry he wrote how do you like that that's good yeah

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.420]
Saturday the Connecticut Post of Bridgeport report that court record show the Reverend Martin

[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.680]
Federici was picked up by police in 1968 for allegedly molesting a boy in his car police didn't

[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.760]
arrest the priest but reported the incident to the diocese how do you like them apples huh

[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.120]
Kevin Baxter about the only one at the herald who's got any clue what's going on in the world

[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.040]
except they have to listen to this show and get all the information from me like that al goldstein

[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.000]
story and they have to look up the daily news and then reprinted verbatim i mean i understand when

[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.480]
you're you know printing things off wire services verbatim but the New York daily news do we

[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.340]
usually see stories in the daily news in a herald i don't think so stolen from mother show

[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:18.440]
new god which you notice little Tommy jikens fight of the fact i've been abusing him a lot lately

[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.740]

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.340]
he told the copy to be right back which we never heard of before in our lives

[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.880]

[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.140]
he's okay he said we had some fun with him he didn't take it personal he was one of these

[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:04.380]
uptight assholes who takes everything personally and had thin skin only assholes are like that

[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.980]
but rick sanchez always had a good sense of humor about it remember he called us on to your

[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:14.320]
couple of times absolutely came by yeah visit right so he wasn't personal i was business

[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.680]
personal with me or with george or anybody else because it didn't affect us it was just reporting

[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.220]
the news that's all reporting the events as they happen the guy still dead that's all and then

[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.820]
of course the audience jumps on the back hey how's that guy rick sanchez it there's another

[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:36.660]
example of great cause we get which by the way when we take calls again keep him coming but nevertheless

that the dirty boys doing mark overnight two to six edmonton a canadian man's attempt to make

[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.140]
off without paying a prostitute for a services failed miserably on friday when he left behind

[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:43.700]
some crucial evidence his employer's trucking inside of it much of his finger police said

[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:47.620]
there's a lot of lessons here and they're all really apparent edmonton police spokesman

[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.460]
west bill morris said residents of an edmonton neighborhood alerted police just after daybreak

[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.000]
with reports of a man and a woman fighting and yelling in and around the pickup truck saying

[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.240]
the man was bleeding from his hand witnesses reported the young blonde woman eventually jumped

[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:05.160]
out of the truck pulled up her pants and ran to a nearby home police said when officers arrived

[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.260]
on the scene they found the pickup with blood stains on the door clumps of blonde here in the cab

[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:14.640]
and three quarter inch two centimeter piece of a finger police also found the woman after a

[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.180]
daughter to research that she explained that she was working as a prostitute and at the fight

[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.440]
broke out when the man refused to pay her for services rendered officers believed she bit the

[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.620]
man's finger off it didn't think police said long to locate the man described as heavy sentence

[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:32.120]
mid fifties it was a company truck with a big name and the phone number on the side so that helped

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.560]
our investigators are pretty smart bill morris said our investigators got in touch with them at

[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.560]
the hospital and he's having what's left of his finger put back together again bill morris said

[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.320]
the man was not arrested but may face a salt charges later on now why would he face a salt

[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:51.260]
maybe he attacked her i see well there you go in edmonton while something a sentence going on

[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.960]
there anyway probably not too much here's something exciting i started this thing with Kevin

[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.880]
back to a long time ago i went to the refrigerator got me some provolone cheese

[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:06.600]
noise this this is the best this is the best provolone ever and it's out of a it's like a package

[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:13.520]
thing you know like we're nearly said they got package deals provolone cheese from my everything

[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:19.240]
on a labels has to be in english and in french all the frogs i don't i don't see any frogs here

[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.480]
i'm sure that there's some around don't see no frogs thank god overly moldy oldies are

[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.740]
chucked at magic about time oh god now this isn't going to make that one old fart happy the one

[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.340]
that wrote the letter the guy that's a hundred years old wrote that letter we read from the

[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:40.180]
hero on friday about how he wants dorsday music and pericomo and all of that crap he wants the big

[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:44.780]
bands back bany goodman how many stations went out of business uh trying to play that crap about

[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:49.660]
five hundred something like that yeah let's hear pericomo again come on find a wheel

[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.480]
the wheel spin the wheel you're gonna talk it up here and we

[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.180]
prop them up boys prop is head right up there on a pillow

[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.340]
kevin kill it kill him

[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.460]
kevin backstored writes in the hero just the thought of an oldie station updating its music

[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:12.000]
seems so contradictory the words don't seem to go together sort of like military intelligence

[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.580]
or starring freddy prince junior well what does that mean he's taking a shot at freddy prince junior

[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.660]
no i understand but why because uh he's just a pretty face

[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.020]
he's not so bad he's not the the worst actor i've ever seen he's no mad dillon

[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.520]
and i'll tell you one thing he's a lot better looking at mad dillon and a better actor which ain't

[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.360]
saying a lot but that happens to be true how come you didn't put mad dillon i guess kevin back

[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.760]
you know this thing with kevin backstored who's got a wife there's some real story there's

[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.720]
somewhere you know it because then you always tell me he was a real swish he found it that way

[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.380]
he found it that way in the phone but then you found that way in the air when you're doing the show

[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.040]
how come you don't sound that way any or what i'm doing the show i have no idea what that happens

[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.540]
see i think you know what i think what do you think i don't know i was gonna say the microphone

[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.980]
but you're in the same studio as when you would be doing the show of course when joe is in there

[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.480]
with you doing the show one day you'll be in one room and the next day you can like uh go back

[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.280]
and forth and see which one you son more macho one all right i think it'll help

[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.840]
it says but jarring as it may be bob hamilton program director for south florida oldies outlet

[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.840]
magic one oh two point seven insist that even oldies have to change with the time

[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:25.800]
i mean we like that but how many times can you hear that right yeah

[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:30.320]
yeah right so once in a while you'd like to maybe hear it if they're gonna play beachboy songs

[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.940]
maybe we hear something a little bit different once in a while on magic like

[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.680]
when some loud cracker tries to put me down like that

[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:44.740]
our as our age demographic gets older tastes change he says as we get older the amount of songs

[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:48.940]
from the earlier parts of the rock and roll era will fade slowly because they're not as memorable

[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.560]
uh-huh there's no question and see i don't i don't think he understands it

[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.300]
i'll go on and read this whole thing by Kevin Baxter because it'll kill some good time and people

[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.300]
interested in what's going on in the radio biz but i don't think he gets it which is why he

[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.760]
you can't our good close friend Kenneth or whatever's name was the duop shop guy what was that

[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.500]
what was that guy's name ken hill i don't know come on he's our close personal friend

[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:17.120]
and now he's had a bias way on here on waxy was 90 uh-8.2 uh-008.000

[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:21.980]
whatever it is whatever jica said what do you call it seven ten it's seven ninety time and you

[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:27.280]
still haven't changed it on your website you putt whacker you silly person you you bald headed geek

[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.140]
there's no question magick has long been in either of a shake up says Kevin Baxter which is

[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:38.500]
precisely why hamilton a radio fixer who turned around stations in LA in San Francisco was broad

[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:45.020]
in three years ago sure taken his time as any magick has consistently hovered just outside the top

[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.940]
thin in the south florida arbitrage rankings and for a time was even losing the ratings battle

[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:56.100]
with rhythmic oldies station wmge smegmo103.5 which used to be she used to be a great station once

[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:01.660]
upon a time but of more concern was the fact that magick's audience like that of all these stations

[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:06.880]
across the country was aging while advertisers were focusing on young consumers who want to hear

[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:15.960]
stuff like this well maybe not you think you're in people like the beach boys no no no

[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:23.700]
well how can you not how can you not play the beach boys hey look if you want to change

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:28.240]
by i think the answer is derude and saffery duo okay let's quit beating around a bush nobody wants

[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.680]
here the beach boys anymore nobody wants your fats domino anymore unfortunately certainly nobody

[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.540]
wants your deon warberg unless she shares her stash with him so so what are we talking about

[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.980]
that fruit in fact if you see deon in the airport you know what the best suggestion is what

[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:51.060]
walk on by i didn't see that coming at all oh blindsided on that anyway we'll get back to this in

[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.320]
a second because it'll kill some good time then we got this grotesque pre-stuff from joliet illinois

[01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.300]
from the chicago sunday and we got the bubble love child which is a very long story but i think

[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:05.040]
everybody wants to hear about that uh-huh in fact i might have to even interrupt my Kevin Baxter

[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.260]
reading for bubba's love child at least for little tease because everybody wants to hear about

[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.100]
bubba's love child and of course if it's in the national enquire there's a very good chance in fact

[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:18.740]
overwhelming chance it's got to be true as opposed to the other tabloids which just have like they're

[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:24.220]
usually fun in here what's what's that one that has all those into the world ones the one that's

[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:28.900]
the the world weekly news is that it that's one or this i guess no that's the one i was thinking

[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.400]
this one but no the weekly one that one's a trip the one that's always got to like a black and white

[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.880]
cover right space aliens yeah why wait why waste the color ink you know when a world's going to

[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:42.280]

[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:22.780]

the ring also was tied to money laundering and satellite tv equipment theft simpson was not charged

[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.020]
in the raid a federal jury acquitted teleto developer mark no akaske and march of charges

by detectives who watched the former nfl running back and actors ranch style home oh man

[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.960]
one of the wiretaps led to no akaske's arrest because in equitence in mimey used to call

used his call rather to make a drug deal only tried again used his call cell phone that's what

[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.820]

that's yours i'll need it at first hamilton bit this is about the pd at magic bob hamilton for

[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.640]
those who weren't listening earlier see when you get involved in a whole bunch of different

[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:35.720]
stories at the same time it's confusing too bad pay close attention keep up with the bus

[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.000]
at first hamilton busy themselves improving the station's brand of visibility but in

[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.100]
December he turned to the music in an effort to renew the audience certainly the most challenging

[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:46.880]
part of the job after all how do you create a cement and draw new listeners when a music hasn't

[01:32:46.880 --> 01:33:00.600]
changed in 40 freaking years ask kevin backster 40 freaking log ponderous years when they're still

[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.600]
well as wrong with that

[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:08.600]
not you're not playing that are they they play that i wouldn't know well let's let's get the

[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.140]
playlist okay from bob hamilton if we can dissect it right here on a year set it over to somebody

[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.860]
who knows what it's all about one of magic's DJs hinted at the problem last year when he confessed

[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:21.360]
that i don't listen to the station when i'm not there i've heard all those songs a million times

[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.440]
i couldn't say a better myself we've heard all those songs until we're ready to puke from them

[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.400]
hey i'll tell you one thing if they play gladdest night in the pipside listen to it i'd even find

[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:40.220]
a way to listen to it up here leaves me breathless this song breathtaking

[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:48.540]
oh

[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:48.960]
oh

[01:33:52.720 --> 01:34:00.540]
is she is she greater what huh gladdest lover she's a pimp anyway although magic is almost constantly

[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:04.960]
testing its playlist with listeners hamilton's December research session was unusually intensive

[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.600]
500 people were gathered here eight to ten second hooks of hundreds of songs from the 50s to

[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.460]
the 70s that has to choose their favorites and just a little clips little hooks from the songs like

[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:22.080]
like that oh you know who that was oh god sure enough the favorites were solid 60s hamilton said

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.500]
we found that the 50s music was important but not as important as it used to be the key was we

[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:33.100]
found that 1964 was our pivot point year what showed was the british invasion the motown sound was

[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:37.720]
the real effervescence of where magic was to what i'm saying the motown sound man it's where it is

[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.220]
schmuck

[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.060]

always be where a guy's who are like that age with a real high squeaky voice always be where

[01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:00.420]
as a result hamilton added about 55 songs a couple 55 songs are you ready for that can you have that

[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:07.640]
holy crap all a man he added about 55 songs accounting for nearly 10% of the

[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.280]
stations active playlist now what does that tell you are you can see what that means that that

[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:18.180]
means that they're playing 500 songs oh you see what a scandal that is

[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:23.200]

[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.800]
can get it right Clintons love child baby here it is

[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:11.720]
Bill Clinton is in broad on a secret love child scandal and now the ex-husband of his former

[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.020]
mistress is telling all this according to a very reliable national inquirer who do not lie

[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:21.560]
in an exclusive interview with the inquirer Paul Pearson who was married to Dolly Kyle Browning

[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.380]
for 10 years while she carried on a toured sexual affair with Clinton has broken his silence with

[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:31.580]
revelations so shocking they could destroy the former president's fragile marriage once and for all

[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:38.380]
are you shocked not at all they're shocking a devastated Pearson reveals that Dolly was avoiding

[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:42.920]
sex with him and having frequent steamy sex sessions with the then governor of Arkansas at the

[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.460]
time her son Anthony was conceived our sex life at all but withered away recalled Pearson a 55

[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:54.380]
year old former lawyer from Dallas who was Dolly's husband from 1975 85 but Dolly was always very

[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:58.680]
very sexually active she was obviously getting sex somewhere and it wasn't at home she'd go to

[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:06.100]
little rock to see Bill for several days at a time maybe she liked a good cigar by the time our

[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.500]
son Anthony was born August 20th 1981 everyone was telling me she was cheating including Dolly's

[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:14.220]
own daughter almost everyone I knew was trying to convince me that she and Bill were having an

[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:18.680]
affair once it finally sunk in that Dolly was cheating with Bill only months before Anthony was

[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.720]
born of course I questioned whether he was actually my son who wouldn't during the Paula Jones case

[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:28.920]
in 1998 Dolly Kyle Browning a friend of Clinton since childhood publicly admitted she had carried

[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:35.000]
on a 17 year long affair a sexual affair with the former president but questions whether she had

[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.120]
given birth to Clinton's love child have not surfaced until now and the news the news is bound to

[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.480]
develop the Clinton's troubled marriage and yet another scandal this could destroy their

[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:47.020]
marriage citizens close to the Clinton's it's one thing for Billy to fool around with this guided

[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.600]
intern like Monica Lewinsky but it's quite another for Hillary Daphne D with the possibility of a

[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.100]
love child by a 54 year old woman whom Bill is romance since his high school days if it's good

[01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:03.160]
enough for Jesse Jackson now come it's not good enough for Baba huh why not the bad news is Jesse

[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:07.840]
it was tricked into a hospital in Chicago with like some whatever I got that later on here I might

[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:14.700]
have to schmit can but the bad news is he's out he's okay dammit and the inquire has learned

[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.940]
exclusively that Pearson has never had a DNA test to find out if Dolly son is his or the

[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:25.760]
ex-presidents I think they should do that on Mari I think they should do that on passions

[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.400]
and then of course what's your name can always fake the results of the test because Eve is

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.400]
going to threaten her with whatever Pearson decided to come forward with his sensational

[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.860]
disclosures after years of humiliation at the hands of his wife's famous lover who the betrayed

[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:45.000]
husband claims did little to hide his hot and heavy affair with Dolly the lawyer insisted Clinton's

[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.480]
brazen in dollar he destroyed his life he told the inquire that over the years the anguish caused by

[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.980]
his wife's affair with Clinton Robbins marriage his family is self-esteem his partridge in his

[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:59.800]
piratry and devastated his professional life in a steady downward spiral he went from prosperity

[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.020]
to near poverty today he's alone rarely works and lives off his meager savings in a Dallas

[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:11.120]
motel how do you like that i'm convinced if bill had stopped seeing Dolly we could have made

[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.100]
our marriage work but she was so distracted by him that we never had a chance at Pearson

[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.400]
i've never been able to recover from the heartache i suffered from Dolly's affair with Bill Clinton

[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.700]
there have been times when i've just been solo i wanted to stop living altogether

[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.640]
Pearson met in Mary Dolly after she divorced her first husband by whom she had three daughters

[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:33.880]
Dolly told him on the next page she'd been Clintons lover he said but had no idea the

[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.900]
affair was still going on i knew that bill Clinton and my wife were involved because we were ever

[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.720]
before we were ever married because she would boast about it and rub it in my nose constantly

[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.980]
Pearson recalled she'd rub it in his pus Dolly used to brag that bill was very well in doubt

[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:51.860]
and that they would sometimes have sex four times in one hour how do you like that

[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.480]
sports court sports court sports court sports court sports court sports court sports court

[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:01.400]
huh what's wrong with having an important present huh she said they'd secretly meet in

[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:05.580]
the rock and have steamy sex till the early morning hours sometimes she'd brag that even do it in

[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:10.900]
the backseat of her car hearing stories about her sex with Bill was very hurtful but every time it

[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:16.480]
came up so to speak she promised me that the relationship was over and like a fool i believed

[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:21.180]
to reset Pearson struggled to deny the awful truth of his wife's adultery even though we found

[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:25.340]
much of her behavior hard to explain her frequent trips to Little Rock and her contacts with Bill

[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:30.980]
Clinton made him uncomfortable at the time between 1979-1980 i was a prominent attorney in Dallas

[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:34.120]
and governor Clinton was referring some civil cases to me from liberal rock Pearson recalled

[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.600]
but i didn't want to believe that the governor of Arkansas the same man who appeared to be trying

[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:45.180]
to further my career was also having an affair with my wife on October 13th 1980 when i want a very

[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:49.180]
large case for the client he had referred to me Bill sent me a letter on Arkansas governor's

[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:53.340]
stationery that read thank you for all your help i'll never forget it yeah i've had you never

[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.700]
forgot it because Dolly's trips to Little Rock and become as frequent as three and four times a

[01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:01.080]
month he says a source close to the family says it was the birth of Dolly's son Anthony 20 years

[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:06.720]
ago that fourth Pearson to face the painful truth about his marriage over seven years family and

[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.560]
friends began to express doubts about the baby's paternity noting that Clinton and Dolly had

[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.560]
had sexual relations she's relations frequently around the time that Anthony was conceived then

[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.780]
finally Pearson himself became suspicious things really went from bad to worse after Anthony was

[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:25.060]
born a source told the inquirer in the 18 months span prior to Anthony's birth Dolly was traveling

[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:28.580]
as much as four times a month the Little Rock where she and Bill would meet secretly at the

[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:35.000]
camelot in and spend evenings in the throes of passion i think they were just watching reruns of

[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.340]
passion Paul grew extremely frustrated that Dolly was abandoning their family to spend so much

[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:46.080]
little time in Little Rock but he really loved her and couldn't convince her to stop whenever Dolly

[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.780]
was at home pulse as she'd practically ignore him and their children and was constantly complaining

[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.980]
that their sex life had all but stopped then seven years after Anthony was born the rumors people

[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:58.440]
were telling Paul about Dolly's affair with Bill finally began to sink in by 1985 Paul knew

[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.020]
all the tour details of Dolly's affair with Bill and it started to question whether Anthony was

[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:07.260]
actually his biological son and the story goes on and on and I'll let you go out and buy it okay

[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:14.700]
in the inquirer but on page 35 here are the pictures can you spot the resemblance how young Anthony

[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:40.880]
watching at the Montreal game in Carolina yesterday that said performances of Canadians fold it up

[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:46.200]
after the coach blew the game the other night but I'm gonna tell you something Carolina now

[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.300]
now see you're always talking about North Carolina how much you love it right this is in um

[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:55.840]
rolly okay I love the mountain by the way you have been there I love the mountains

[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.720]
of North Carolina where there are no people that's what I like about it

[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:05.360]
see they started their franchise carolina which is the most vulgar franchise in all the sports

[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:10.340]
besides of the south Florida baseball team in Montreal but they started the franchise in Greensboro

[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:14.180]
because the new arena wasn't ready yet and then they said oh when we move to rolly the permanent

[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:18.460]
facility there it's gonna be the greatest I just want to make sure it's in rolly okay I don't

[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:22.600]
want to get this wrong let's see where's the story about the uh where's the story about the

[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:28.800]
thing there how they don't even have a damn uh uh geez what kind of crap is this it's in rolly

[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.000]
so the first couple of playoff games at home they could even sell a mouth Carolina that's what a great

[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.880]
hockey town in sport I mean what do they know about hockey they don't know about nothing nothing

[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.860]
nothing so so now of course they're all in the bandwagon they were in the second round they got

[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.560]
a three-to-game suit to lead in Montreal they're one game away from advancing to the next round the

[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:51.800]
conference finals and I noticed a shot in the crowd they showed his big fat tubby typical red

[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.320]
necki looking guy and it looks like a buford puzzle you know that kind of looking guy and I thought

[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.000]
to myself oh they can't all look like that all 18,000 plus people in the stands there they can't

[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.220]
all be a bunch of mug ones so late in the game they actually uh the camera they they had some time

[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:10.380]
and they like pan the crowd even the young people looked like that I mean everybody looks like that

[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:15.520]
like they like the people from Nashville like they uh were hatched in a uh in a cave somewhere out

[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:23.760]
of a out of a big old egg that's them yeah that's them all right north Carolina man hockey town my ass

[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:29.820]

[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:36.060]
folded up they folded up their tent since the netty airport terminal evacuated hebron Kentucky

[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:42.260]
that sounds like a Jewish thing don't a Hebrew Kentucky I thought hebron was in Israel it is

[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:47.580]
hebron Kentucky police evacuated the main terminal at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport

[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:51.700]
for three hours on Sunday after a passenger tried a border plane where they cigar cutter in his

[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:56.740]
boot when a screen read a security checkpoint found the small life the man ran into a secure air

[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.260]
of the terminals of Kathleen Bergen a spokesman for the west department of transportation the terminal

[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:05.760]
which handles 92% of the airport's traffic was shut down to 910 am and the three concoors were

[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.600]
evacuated and searched all reopened by 1210 pm passengers were allowed back in after being re-screened

[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.200]
passengers on the ten flights that left the airport during the event evacuation were screened upon

[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.840]
arrival their destination and you know what the investigation turned out when they finally got a

[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.780]
hold of this guy a cigar cutter and what else do you think he had here's the clue the guard

[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:30.280]

1132 at 560 WQM happy Monday to it.

[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:36.060]
Not a bad day.

[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.900]
How's it there about 150 degrees in the shade?

[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.500]
At the moment it'll get hotter.

[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.120]
Do you know everybody I talked to there has got one thing on her mind and that is the

[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:46.820]
story that I mentioned last week was in a paper a few days ago about the fact that it's

[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.420]
going to be maybe the hottest summer on record and sound phone.

[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:53.420]
It's going to be just unbearable right unbearable.

[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:56.720]
I mentioned in Miguel before the show started today while you were taking one of your

[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:57.540]
14 craps.

[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.420]
The fact that once it gets to Easter and past over and I mentioned this already on a year

[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:02.180]
because I lose track.

[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.280]
Yeah, you mentioned it.

[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:05.900]
Oh, well, let me mention it again because of the heat and the humidity.

[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:08.100]
Nobody who can afford to get out of there stays there.

[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.660]
I mean the snowbirds leave and everybody else leaves too if they can if they can afford to

[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.380]
go someplace else like here or anywhere.

[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:18.660]
I mean good golly Miss Molly just going to be well anyway.

[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:21.620]
I don't want to rub it in because the weather here's nothing to write home about but

[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:25.140]
an Amsterdam it was pretty good at least in the a the telegraph.

[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:28.960]
How's my friend Hans doing out there I have a terrible story I guess I should find it now.

[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:34.420]
I hate to do it two bad stories in a week from Amsterdam to violent stories which is pretty unusual.

[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:37.200]
Here it is blast rip support car and needle on.

[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.600]
We just tell them like it is we let the chips fall where they may okay the Schmidt fall where it may.

[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:47.720]
Run some nettle and explosion ripped apart a car in front of the house of a local politician

[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.860]
in southern ethylons on Saturday five days after the lead of a national political movement was shot to death.

[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:57.820]
No one was injured in the blast which severely damaged the car belonging to the wife of another politician,

[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.720]
a city alderman and Brunsson near the German border in about 12 miles from the Dutch city of Maastricht.

[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:05.440]
Police said the explosive may have been a grenade.

[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:09.560]
The politician was identified as Jay Steiner of the local Christian Democratic Party.

[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:13.060]
Steiner told police he feared the motive was political and requested police security.

[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.720]
The national broadcasting company NOS reported.

[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:18.800]
Last summer the car Brunsson's mayor was set on fire.

[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.120]
A suspect was never found and police were investigating whether the two attacks could be linked.

[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.620]
The attack came five days after Dutch politician Pimforto was assassinated in a parking lot after finishing a radio interview.

[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.060]
Police have charged a thirty-two year old Dutchman with a killing but have not found a motive.

[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.420]
The attack in Brunsson seemed to be unrelated.

[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:35.780]
How do you like that?

[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.460]
There are a control in needle on.

[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:40.480]
A lot of crazy people that's a bottom line.

[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:43.940]
Crazy people everywhere who don't know the difference basic difference like I said last week

[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:46.440]
between right and wrong between killing people or trying.

[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.700]
Like that punk kid Luke Helders, Shosh Melder, whatever Helderskelder whatever his name is.

[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:52.560]
That's a good one.

[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.260]
Yeah Luke Helderskelder.

[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.020]
Well we have to find out what was troubling him and we have to examine his motives

[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:05.500]
and we have to examine the writings and the happy face and see the symbol as we are right.

[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:06.200]

[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:10.000]
Anybody 21 year and then they're interviewing the teachers again.

[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:10.740]
It's been on CNN.

[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:13.180]
CNN knew people over there should croak a wicked death.

[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.580]
I can't stand except for Bill Hummer.

[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:18.340]
He's a good guy and used to look pretty good without the makeup.

[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:20.520]
But I mean what a network that is.

[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.580]
The crap news network CNN.

[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.140]
And they got that Paula on there asking these stupid idiotic and stupid questions.

[02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:30.060]
And then we got Wolf Blitzkrieg interviewing yes or I'm a fart.

[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:33.380]
You know it would it they could bring Hitler back if they found he was still alive.

[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:37.800]
I could just see tonight Wolf Blitz or interview's eight off Hitler says are you still going to be a meanie

[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.700]
or are you going to be a nice guy and work for peace you know.

[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:41.680]
Why what kind of crap is that?

[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:47.800]
CNN is for people who got like the the intellect of a three year old which is why I watch it.

[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:51.080]
Joliet what does call something that was boy.

[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:54.480]
I think I'm coming down with something after hearing those calls.

[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:01.560]
Oh we missed the calls Neil that's what made the show right.

[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:03.000]
That's what made it unbearable.

[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:04.140]
That's what made it terminal.

[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:06.720]
That's what made it freaking ponderous and unacceptable.

[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:13.860]
In the past two months 10 of about 200 priests affiliated with the Roman Catholic diocese of Joliet Illinois have been.

[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:17.640]
Now if I can read this this has got to be the smallest printing that you just facts me a little while ago.

[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.800]
Did you take a look at this?

[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:19.560]
It's pretty small.

[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:20.640]
Man.

[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:30.640]
Have been suspended or presided in allegations of sexual misconduct with minors giving these suburban dioceses one of the highest percentages nation of priest removed from their ministry since the national

[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:51.380]
purgey sexual abuse scandal broke in January according to the Chicago sometimes analization of reported cases finding by comparison the arts diocese of Chicago which took steps to deal with sexual abuse by minors of priest decades ago or eight decade ago has removed one of its nearly 950 active diocese priest from its ministry since January because of allegations of sexual misconduct.

[02:06:51.520 --> 02:07:00.300]
In other words only one out of nine 50 but in Joliet 10 out of 200 which is one 20th which is 5% in the Cleveland diocese which has 480 diocese and priest.

[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:18.800]
11 have been removed which what's that one about 2% okay yeah I'm good on that math baby I'm sharp on this if you think I'm going to try to read the rest of this teeny if the audience could see it they'd say holy crap that old guy still got good eyesight but of all that fish food and that is these turtle man.

[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:26.120]
You have to have a goddamn telescope to read that crap too much reading the elats the problem oh let's take some more great calls.

[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:31.440]
Oh sorry or let's put on CNN.

[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:35.400]
You're going to make it a new one.

[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:41.160]
That's another one of those shows that everybody raved about Mary Tyler Morsho hated it.

[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:50.560]
I don't this like her I mean she's okay I can take her reliever she's alright she never stole her freight train but I just hated that show I didn't like Dick Van Dyke I can't stand him he makes me sick of my stomach.

[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:52.200]
Do you think he's funny?

[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:59.500]
No I don't never did hated Dick didn't like to show either now they mention it and I never got it yeah never got that show.

[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:10.940]
It's just just out of funny show and you know who else was on that show I think it was that show was Rose Marie wasn't she on there I think she was stick to Hollywood squares honey I'm sure she's got to be dead.

[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.760]
Well I get so excited when I have the Hollywood squares on there now the ones with all dead panels that's great.

[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:21.780]
Flynn Ford and Charlie Weaver and Paul Lind and just a whole bunch of dead folks.

[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:33.880]
Here's that story about Hillary which I think you're going to find shocking it wasn't bad enough we had to stir and of course that above a thing if that comes out to be true this could really throw monkey wrench into her plans you know it.

[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:43.140]
Hill for VEEP in 2004 question mark this is in the New York Daily News idea of Senator in number two spot generating a quiet buzz it says.

[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:50.940]
She has promised unequivocally not to run for president in 2004 but what if Democrats wants Senator Hillary Clinton for VEEP instead.

[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:58.960]
The idea is being peddled quietly by some Democratic power brokers including her husband Bill Clinton that Philandering douchebag that we all love.

[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:07.060]
Sources say that when he's asked whether his wife might just run for president in 2004 Hillary's booster in chief talks are up his the bottom half of a Democratic dream ticket.

[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.740]
I think she'd make a better vice presidential candidate Bubba said.

[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:18.380]
Karen Dunn Hillary Clinton spokeswoman will only say that her boss has said repeatedly that she'll serve out her full six year term and a say don't they always all say that.

[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:23.440]
Always. Yeah we don't believe it but other Democrats were less circumspect.

[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:30.920]
She'll probably be at the top of the list at political consultant Tom O'Donnell former top a to a likely 2004 presidential candidate.

[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:36.500]
House Minority Leader Richard Gebhardt Democrat of Missouri who you can't complain about his personality because he doesn't have one.

[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:43.420]
She's got a pretty good following O'Donnell added Dan Good fundraiser I think she'd be a damn good asset whoever the nominee will beat.

[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:49.700]
Damn it. He even said damn about 16 times in there. Just like Tom Jicke and that voicemail who said God damn over and over again.

[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:55.140]
Can you believe little Tom Jicke? Good nice ball hit a guy like him saying God damn on the radio.

[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:05.180]
A senior Republican official agreed she'd added tremendous amount of energy to the ticket officials said the left wing women's groups hollywood unions they'd love it.

[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:17.060]
What connected Democratic political operative told the Daily News that former first lady to be resounding plus for the ticket and a particularly good match with Gebhardt or Senator John Edwards Democrat of North Carolina was made no secret of his intention to run.

[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:23.260]
He wants to be president. Now there's Southern Mugwam. Why he's not a mugwam but he's just I don't know. You ever see him? No.

[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:31.360]
He's just a guy lingering bad blood from the 2000 presidential campaign however probably rule out an Al Gore Hillary Clinton tandem.

[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:39.860]
Hillary still angry that Gore criticized her husband scandals of a court or a credit sources said they don't talk much to the Clinton insider and evidently she hasn't read the inquiry yet.

[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:52.880]
I said Hillary Clinton would be a polarizing figure for the GOP base which loves to hate air but wouldn't vote Democratic anyway and her presence on the ticket would give Republicans a potential opening to resurrect the scandal baggage that played both Clinton's during their White House years.

[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:59.240]
But Hillary Clinton brings assets that no one else on the party's radar screen can touch star power and fundraising prowess.

[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:07.780]
She quickly raised more than $1.6 million for the political action committee she opened soon after the 2000 election and she's handed out checks to the Democratic House and sent a candidates across the country.

[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.920]
She's also in heavy demand as a fundraiser for a congressional and party colleagues and my colleague, Adam Kirschner.

[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:28.240]
Political service say Clinton would get a pass from her 2000 campaign plan to serve her full six year term made in the context of whether she'd run for president if she were tamper the number two spot if the ticket lost she still keep her Senate seat and could be well positioned for a presidential run in 2008.

[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.540]
Are these people dreaming or what?

[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.940]
Man like I said forfeit just put up the big sign there forfeit.

[02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:42.560]
I mean do you have any idea how many people hate her like poison? Yeah everybody.

[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:52.420]
Yeah and the only reason she won so big in New York was because Gore won New York in a jug and a landslide so she got sucked in by the co-tails you know but she was like barely head of that little twerp.

[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.200]
What was that guy from Long Island that she ran against?

[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.940]
Oh out of sight out of mind he was a little bit more.

[02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:05.700]
He was barely a couple points ahead and it was nippin-tuck until the election when Gore won New York by 80 trillion votes and she got sucked in.

[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:15.120]
20 till noon at 5.60 WQ AM he don't get sucked in with some of those ads in the yellow pages for carpet cleaning places because almost all of Mara scam.

[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:45.100]

They want us to find a way to reimburse and for back pay no from 200 years ago when they were slaves when I only have a mobile home.

[02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:09.100]
A people in a pinch of school so if you want to ask me how here's what I got to say you've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:12.760]

I want to give you a kiss that's for everybody to his dead and call.

[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:36.100]
If I was born in 1802, I would enslave things something I do but what were dead people did to you I have to take the plane.

[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:50.240]

[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:56.100]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:59.040]
You're playing on how they fare it for good.

You tell him that you're sorry for it's labor.

[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:24.600]
You got yes nigger good morning and that's forever but it's who is dead and gone.

[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.920]
46 and 560 WQA of happy Monday to you.

[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.360]
Here's the fact that says you show us 100% better without calls I can actually learn something while I work.

[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:37.500]
The only thing I ever learn from your call is the rule of 21.

[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:41.600]
Rule of 21 is 20 out of every 21 people are morons.

[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:43.620]
Absolutely correct.

[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.200]
There you go.

[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:45.880]
Good point.

[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.620]
421 votes on our survey already they are sponsoring response.

[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:51.340]
What?

[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:52.740]
You said 21.

[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.680]
Like I said the rule of 421.

[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.000]
See how he see he's very attentive to them I'm not really sure why I think he's still a little bit nervous.

[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:04.140]
Uh huh. He's still like on pins needles.

[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.160]
What are you talking about?

[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:05.980]
He's a little bit nervous.

[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.860]
Miguel told me you're sitting like right on the edge of the seat.

[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:11.360]
Of course Miguel you haven't worked a long enough to understand what that means.

[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:13.860]
There's more coming from what he dropped this morning anyway.

[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:19.240]
What are you a dislike most about Neil show we asked nothing it's fine 106.

[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.240]
That's 25.1%.

[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:25.380]
Uh nothing I like it better than ever 85 another 20%.

[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:26.320]
How do you like that huh?

[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:32.500]
We got a pretty happy audience it sounds like to me and especially those way through your four calls I took those were sensational man.

[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:34.240]
But no phone calls 68.

[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:39.480]
Don't like the tone 54 they kind of like eased off on that they backed off you notice.

[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:45.500]
Yeah. Too many pre stories 29 too much reading 29 not enough comedy bits 21.

[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:47.300]
Gold leaves go 16.8.

[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:53.580]
And too many comedy bits 13 sucking win in last place anybody would say too many comedy bits.

[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.200]
Just a people don't look a book about what's his name?

[02:16:57.860 --> 02:16:58.280]
Book a broad.

[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.620]
Speaking of what's his name Robert Blake flips out.

[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:06.320]
His family and friends are for our worries gonna kill himself you familiar with this story.

[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.780]
Nope. Are you familiar with gays candle rocks the spice girls?

[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:10.300]
No.

[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:11.280]
They're gay.

[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:11.560]
Go.

[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:13.780]
Got some good stuff here for you.

[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:14.640]
Right can't wait.

[02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:28.140]
Both from the inquirer I should point out that he inquirers great the other tabloids you know if it's like for fun and games you want to kill some time on a plane like I do get the other tabloids and didle around with him you know but if you want to learn something that's actually once in a while pretty true.

[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:32.120]
In fact look at this inquirer evidence keeps Blake and jail.

[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:37.780]
This is shocking I hadn't even seen this it's like down in the bottom corner of the story.

[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:52.300]
Los Angeles County Superior Court judge Lloyd Nash has allowed prosecutors to introduce blockbuster evidence obtained by the inquirer in the Robert Blake murder case last year the inquirer handed over to detective shocking audio tapes that Blake's frightened wife

[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:57.680]
bodily bakedly recorded before her murder detailing threatening conversations she had with the Beretta star.

[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:02.440]
The inquirer also gave police handwritten letters from bakedly to Blake that document their troubled marriage.

[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:13.420]
The transcript of one conversation in which Blake confronted bakedly in 1999 was presented inside the Van Ayes California courtroom is part of a 60 page prosecution motion opposing Blake's release on bail on first the

[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:22.500]
Remurder charges the motion mentioned that the tapes have been provided by the inquirer the 1999 conversation Blake told bakedly you deliberately got pregnant for the rest of your life

[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.200]
you'll have to live with that and for the rest of my life on ever forget it.

[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:42.020]
After the court hearing report us from newspapers and TV stations scrambled for copies of the transcript but inquirer readers were way ahead of them they knew all about the blockbuster recordings when we first reported the details exclusively in our May 29, 2001 issue after reviewing the tapes and letters judge Nash tonight Blake bail honey like that.

[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.760]
The inquirer is doing it man.

[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:53.220]
If we can just get the inquirer to nab O Jam put his nasty ass away once and for all then then we really hit the jackpot.

[02:18:54.660 --> 02:19:03.980]
Anyway it says the robber Blake is flipping out inside his tiny jail cell throwing fits screaming crying complaining constantly and saying he'll kill himself rather than spend the rest of his life behind bars.

[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:07.480]
You know what he wants most in that jail is what I'm hearing?

[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:09.420]
I give up.

[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:10.460]
A cockatoo.

[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:18.380]
I thought you remember burrito I remember Blake is going nuts and inside of the inquirer he's having a total breakdown.

[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:33.020]
He's complaining he can't sleep can't eat can't read he's driving the jailers crazy he's got a new complaint every few minutes he told the jailers I can't lie on this about the old mattress he said maybe out of called dial amateurs there you go Bobby they deliver an idea for you.

[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:35.800]
He said I'm a frail old man this is inhumane treatment.

[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:43.980]
It's gotten to the point that when he start screaming for something the guards just ignore him they let him scream for a long time before they even acknowledge him they're fed up with him.

[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:51.380]
He's barely eating he's already lost weight the guards have snickered that he sure acted like a tough guy before he got there and now suddenly he's a frail old man.

[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:59.000]
They believe he's just trying anything he can to think to get out of there but his screaming is making them ignore him so the more he fights it the worst things get for him.

[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:05.640]
People involved in the investigation believe that if he thinks he's going to spend the rest of his life behind bars he's going to find a way to kill himself.

[02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:06.780]
How do you like that?

[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:17.160]
The former movie star now spends his days locked in an 8x10 foot cell in the 7100 high power module of the men central jail in Los Angeles known as MCJ.

[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:20.680]
Oh do you hear his latest record by the way MCJ?

[02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:21.220]
Nope.

[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:31.700]
He's rapid and hammered instead of his tailor made clothes black is wearing an ill-fitting blue smock with MCJ on a back and blue pants the source of the present totally inquirer.

[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:34.440]
Well it's a good thing he's not wearing them checkered pants like South Florida.

[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:41.120]
Instead of expensive shoes he wears black slippers that inmates have to shuffle and to keep them to keep them on their feet.

[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:50.420]
He has to wear a red plastic wristband signifying he's a high security inmate and he wears a white t-shirt and white boxer shorts with Los Angeles County jail written on him.

[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:51.020]
Oh geez.

[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:58.240]
He sleeps on a hard metal bunk with sheets in a blanket and no pillow the cell is just a sink and a turl it without a seat.

[02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:01.180]
Oh I hate those toilets without a seat don't you?

[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.900]
How can you never mind?

[02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:04.920]
I guess very uncomfortable.

[02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:09.140]
You've never taken a squat on a toilet without a seat?

[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:09.680]
No.

[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:12.920]
I can't imagine.

[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:17.760]
Well in other words the answer is yes how about Miguel have you ever taken a crap out of toilet with no seat?

[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:18.360]
No.

[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:20.520]
Well what's wrong with you guys man?

[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.540]
I mean we're not in any of the place like a restaurant or something you go in and a seat has been busted or whatever.

[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:29.560]
It's like sitting off to the side and you got nothing but a nice porcelain bust there.

[02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:30.780]
Hey cold.

[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:36.920]
It's a good way to learn balancing man delicate balancing so you don't like your ass don't fall right in.

[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:43.620]
Blake is in a cell in front of where the guards are so they can constantly constantly see it with cell through a window in the door.

[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.760]
They're keeping Blake away from the other inmates in high power many of whom are dangerous gang members who would kill him in just a minute just to make a name for themselves.

[02:21:50.560 --> 02:22:00.860]
Blake has to eat every meal in his cell he doesn't like the food one night he had beans and hot dogs for dinner and cool cuts on a roll for lunch and oatmeal for breakfast.

[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:07.440]
He gets to shower every other day and will get clean underwear sheets and towels once a week clean underwear once a week.

[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:14.980]
Another prison source told the inquired that when Blake first arrived after being charged with killing his wife Bonnie Lee Bayclay he was shaking and crying.

[02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:21.860]
I'm scared what they're going to do to me he cried he didn't look anything like the cocky actor used to tell funny stories onto the night show with his old buddy Johnny Carson.

[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:34.140]
Blake freaked out when he was forced to strip for intimate physical examination said the prison source he began to shake in terror as the enormity of what he was facing hit him he realized that for all intents and purposes his life is over.

[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:42.960]
Oh the inquired were learned that in the time of despair Blake has reached out to his old pal Johnny Carson like I just mentioned only moments ago Blake calls him collect from the jail.

[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:54.500]
Blake is despondent as told Johnny that he's been on a suicide walks at a source close to Carson Johnny told Blake to remember he's innocent until proven guilty and assured him he can make it through these trying times Johnny lifts his spirits like no one can.

[02:22:55.340 --> 02:23:07.960]
Maybe Ed McMahon calls and you think Ed calls like they get on like a conference call and that's when Blake picks up the phone and he goes here's John you know just to cheer him up a little bit and Johnny comes on you think they do that no I don't.

[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:24.400]
At a May 1st quarter parents Blake was denied bailed and incredibly that came as a great relief to his close friends and family Robert's family and friends are worried sick that he's going to kill himself said a family source is daughter Delina and pal pals don't want him released on bail they say he's not at risk of fleeing he's at the risk of committing sausages.

[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:34.060]
Blake phoned a pal from jail and was nervous and babbling his buddy is really worried because even before he was arrested Blake you told him he'll never go to jail how he'd kill himself before that happened well better like that never.

[02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:41.220]
So you don't want that you think he's a good guy I don't think he's a good guy I think he should just get life or whatever.

[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.960]
Gay scandal Iraq Spice Girls. Oi!

[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:53.880]
The Spice Girls have been plunged into a gay scandal by shocking allegations about the intimate relationship between Mel B and Jerry Hallowell.

[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:58.220]
You know not that I think of it at Jerry Hallowell she's pretty butch looking you know what I'd ever noticed.

[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:00.780]
She makes me sick.

[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:19.020]
She did it's raining men which definitely didn't need to be redone now it's raining men if you're going to do a video of that it lends itself to having like a lot of hunky hot guys in there and instead she's busy showing off her hot new body after like whatever they did you know like post-suction or whatever they did and like you know who they want to see her she's a beast anyway.

[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:26.060]
Yeah let's hear the weather rules okay instead of freaking Jerry phallow well.

[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:31.480]
Nice one. Good morning and I was pretty good talk I can't even hear it.

[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:39.300]
The affuting pair of enemies now but a one time Mel B scary Spice and van made Jerry were very close friends as Mel Zaksabi Jimmy Gullsar.

[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:52.900]
Jimmy made the lesbian charges in the documentary that Mel tried to have banned from broadcast on the BBC a her bitter exes lifted the lid on what he calls the not so platonic relationship between his former wife and one time Spice World Jerry trumpeted a London newspaper.

[02:24:53.380 --> 02:25:02.320]
Oh they love that stuff and London man careful not to explicitly spell out the exact nature their relationship Jimmy tells viewers that the pair was in him it as he was with Mel.

[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:11.660]
Jimmy you got divorced from the Spice Girl after 16 months also told an interview that Mel and Jerry had a relationship with each other that goes deeper than a lot of people think really deep.

[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:18.420]
Rumors about Jerry sexuality have been swirling around the pop world for a long time that holds the music insider she's never had a long term boyfriend.

[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:28.600]
She seemed closer to oh wait till you hear this. She seemed closer to a British singer than anybody and he's you know what is no George Michael.

[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:31.540]
Oh so people are proud to speculate.

[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:42.820]
But Jimmy's gone further than anybody and suggesting that Jerry had a gay relationship with Mel it's shocking because Mel has always been seen as the sexiest Spice Girl and there's never been a hint that she's bisexual.

[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:55.000]
No wonder she wanted this English TV documentary band. Since she went solo in 98 Jerry's Ranchie's Day Genics have hit the headlines and sparked outrage at one London concert when she was licked funneled and kissed by her female dancers live on TV.

[02:25:55.860 --> 02:26:02.960]
Wild, child Jerry took a swipe at a roll group when she performed a one woman gig at a London gay club backed by lookalike Spice drag queens.

[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:11.240]
Last year Jerry threw on more logs on a fire when she confessed she was going through a gay phase and admitted she found Jennifer Lopez curvy behind very sexy.

[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:20.580]
Even Mel C's Sporty Spice who boasts 10 tattoos has felt compelled to deny on several occasions that she's a dike says Mel C. The fact is I'm not gay.

[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:21.580]
How do you like that huh?

[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:23.840]
Who cares about them anyway?

[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:30.600]
Let me 50 seven at five sixty WQM. Hey, I'll tell you somebody who's not anything. He's just a horny bastard and that's our good friend Jeff Cohen at Pizza Love.

[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:34.340]
Jeff was in there Friday bringing you a beautiful lunch. I'm sure it was.

[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:42.520]
It was a beautiful thing that he actually hoard his way on the air. By the way, I'm not giving you my number up here. Jeff, so leave me alone. All right. Between you and PD Linny, I don't want to be bugged.

[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:51.140]
Your great guy, a good friend, but go away. Anyway, Pizza Love is one of the world's best pizzas. You know, they're located in the Pizza Love class university driving Davey between Griffin and 595.

[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:57.100]
Tonight and every Monday is lasagna night at the loft Tuesday's eight plant night. My one of these dinners on these nights get the second one for only five bucks.

[02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:03.720]
Wednesday kids eat free with adults. They can see Jeff's name is magic show Thursday's bike night at the loft. Come on a motorcycle by one didn't get the second one for that price.

[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:11.800]
Try it all, baby. The best garlic rolls in the world. Three different kinds of pizza, great Italian chicken dishes and veal and seafood calcones, super subs. And don't forget coming very soon.

[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:18.620]
The second of the loft, a second opening or the opening of a how do you say that? A new location right out there by me and Westbrow in the plantation acres area.

[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:24.000]
A knob Hill and sunrise right beyond Walgreens. They're going to be opening a new pizza lock this summer. When do you say at the end of the summer?

[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:31.460]
How do you say what? Yes, anyway, for take out or let's see, you're not keeping up, man. You got to go real fast to keep up with the bathroom.

[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:42.540]
For take out or delivery or catering call a pizza lock that nine five four nine one six eighty eight eighty nine one six eighty eighty nine.

[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:47.920]
Ocean Cadillac wants to know your name.

[02:27:48.180 --> 02:28:01.440]
The Neil Roger show on five six. He's only Q a. M. I. N. For learning.

[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:10.880]
Mr Blake's behalf regarding this case. We could not get any statements from attorney Braun at this point. However, we understand that a white cockatoo name Fred.

[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:19.540]
Best known for sitting on Mr Blake's shoulder in the TV series, Beretta. Okay, we see Fred has entered the room and is about to address the media here.

[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:25.880]
Do you have any information where Mr Blake might have been at the time of the murder?

[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:37.780]
The bird has just mentioned something about filthy now. I'm not sure if that is indicative of the condition of this cage at this point Fred, would you be willing to testify in court?

[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:48.080]
The white cockatoo is just mentioned the word milky again, something sort of non-sequit or not really directly related to this case.

[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.980]
Fred DeBaker, Sun Tons did Mr Blake ever get angry enough at you that you thought he would hurt you.

[02:28:56.620 --> 02:29:04.320]
Interesting bird had mentioned apparently Robert Blake's go T that he wore in the TV series back in early 1977 as a disguise.

[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.620]
Is there anything else we need to know about Mr Blake?

[02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:20.360]
He cockatoo has just made reference to Gayle T. Perhaps a Miss Gayle T and all the acquaintance of Mr Blake perhaps prior to meeting the Bonnie Lee backly?

[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:37.300]
Fred is hungry and must exit. So that is the end of this news conference. However, thanks to Fred's statements today, perhaps that will lead investigators to answer some very perplexing questions regarding the nature of this murder case.

[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:43.200]
This will take you back to headquarters in Washington now. Very sad they just don't get it. I've spoken about cockatoo in my time and you know what?

[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:45.320]
What? You know what he was really saying? What?

[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:46.960]
Gelldy.

[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:52.420]
Trust me.

[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:53.060]
Gelldy.

[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.740]
Talking on a sports show.

[02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:59.460]
Trying to be my show.

[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:07.880]
Your voice sounds just like a seven year old girl. A little sports host.

[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.760]
What else are you there for? Gelldy.

[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:14.200]
Gelldy.

[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:16.320]
Talking like a baby.

[02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:19.140]
Who needs a little training?

[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:22.260]
Why can't you understand?

[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.380]
You don't sound like a man.

[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:32.480]
Remove the rubber bands that choke. Your scrubs come to Gelldy.

[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.080]
Gelldy.

[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:38.620]
Gelldy.

[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:44.240]
Your lucky management don't care. Cause Gelldy.

[02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:49.940]
You don't belong there on the air. And Gelldy.

[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:59.120]
Those sports can't wait to your voice cracks. Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:04.760]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:06.360]
Gelldy.

[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:07.860]
Gelldy.

[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:13.000]
When you're gonna grow up. You make us wanna throw up.

[02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:18.900]
You feely squeaky poop. Go to broadcasting school.

[02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:26.060]
You're free to mess it boys. Makes you sound like a butt.

[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:28.960]
You're a butt.

[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:32.320]
You're a cockatoo assand.

[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:35.080]
They just need to get it.

[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:39.880]
You know I did it again. I did it again speaking of Gelldy.

[02:31:39.980 --> 02:31:40.620]
Can you believe it?

[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.380]
No what. I better get in the swing of things.

[02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:50.160]
I stayed goalsy. But you can call me Gelldy. Whenever I'm in town I listen to. Wait a minute I am in town.

[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:51.960]
It's the 12th of one hour.

[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:54.580]
How can I have done that after all this time now?

[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:56.400]
So we started that in January right?

[02:31:57.380 --> 02:31:59.460]
So this is like four and a half months we've been doing this.

[02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:00.200]
I got it right yet.

[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:00.880]
No. No.

[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:03.620]
I'll get it. Here's somebody who got it.

[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:09.860]
Look at how old this man was. Joseph Joe Banana's banana. Notorious mafia leader dead at 97.

[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:13.580]
97. How do you like them apples huh?

[02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:14.240]
He died.

[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:18.540]
Tucson. Joseph Banana, the notorious gangster known as Joe Banana,

[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:22.200]
is a one of the most powerful mafia groups in the 1950s and 60s.

[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:24.700]
Died Saturday he was 90 freaking seven.

[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.200]
Banana who retired Arizona 1968 and it suffered from several health problems in recent years.

[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:32.780]
Died of heart failure said his attorney Alfred Skip.

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.440]
Dotto. He said Banana died peacefully surrounded by his family.

[02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.580]
Is that with the capital F?

[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:45.560]
Banana was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital on Monday and he literally just faded away

[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:49.360]
said Dr. David Ben Asher, Banana's physician since the late 1980s.

[02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:50.920]
He was an interesting guy.

[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:53.260]
People were in contact with him at unsurving loyalty.

[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:55.120]
Really incredible, Ben Asher said.

[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:56.540]
They would have done anything for him.

[02:32:56.540 --> 02:32:58.380]
He really engendered loyalty and people.

[02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:00.200]
In other words, sometimes he made an offer.

[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:01.700]
It couldn't refuse I guess.

[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:07.060]
At the height of his power, Banana directed one of the five original crime families in New York City.

[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:12.240]
The public knew him as Joe bananas and it didn't he tested by his own admission.

[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:16.920]
It was a member of the commission which acted as an organized crime board of directors in New York City and other major US cities.

[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:22.940]
He did not engage in such on manly activities as narcotics trafficking or prostitution though authority said otherwise.

[02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:32.020]
He's probably the first mafia godfather to die of natural causes said a Butler Yates the Turd who dealt with Banana while serving as US attorney for Arizona until 1981.

[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:37.540]
I don't think anybody back in the 50s and 60s ever thought that he was going to die of natural causes.

[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:45.100]
Banana fell from grace during the 1960s repeatedly for trying to become the boss of bosses and what became to be known as the Banana War.

[02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:51.660]
The battle among the crime families resulted in his eventual exile to Tucson where he was hanging out under the protection of the what was the family?

[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:53.020]
Oh geez.

[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:54.300]
Don Vincenzo.

[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:55.760]
Okay.

[02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.600]
Whatever I don't remember that.

[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:01.000]
Whatever they sent the Don Francisco, Don Vincenzo, whatever they sent.

[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.100]
Was there they sent Frado De Vegas?

[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:03.080]
Right.

[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:04.220]
To go see his buddy Movin.

[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:11.740]
His crime family anyway, but I know still bears his name though he maintained his 1983 autobiography that I'm not a father anymore and there is nobody.

[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:12.820]
I know family anymore.

[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:13.420]
Right.

[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:15.040]
So did he have no knowledge?

[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:17.960]
Did he have an orange in his war?

[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:18.860]
Why?

[02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:20.600]
Did he have an orange in his hand when he died?

[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:24.020]
See, I pretended not to hear it.

[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:25.020]
I didn't hear it the first time.

[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:28.720]
Even in his waning years, Banana was...

[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:29.480]
I probably had one.

[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:29.840]
I'm probably not.

[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:30.640]
I think a Tangerine.

[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:31.400]
Or a Banana.

[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:35.720]
Even in his waning years, Banana was unable to avoid the attention of prosecutors.

[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:42.300]
In 1988, this succeeded in getting the only felony conviction against him from obstruction of justice for trying to block a federal grand jury investigating his sons.

[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:48.900]
Evidence that led to the conviction was obtained by an narcotic strike force that stifled that he stifled through his trash.

[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:49.700]
What is it?

[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:50.540]
Oh, that sifted.

[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:50.920]
I'm sorry.

[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:52.340]
Sifted through his trash for years.

[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:53.740]
No excuse and ice facts.

[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:03.480]
A federal judge eventually reduced his five-year sentence to a year in Banana was served nearly eight months in Lexington, Kentucky, Federal Prison, before being paroled in July 84.

[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:06.560]
Anticozaun about he served in this, he served in...

[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:14.400]
Banana appeared in 1983 on CBS TV 60 Minutes and collaborated in writing a man of honor, the autobiography of Joseph Banana, which came out the same year.

[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:21.540]
In 1984, he sued his publisher for 18 million dollars over what he said was a depiction of a cheap gangster on the cover of the paperback version.

[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:27.880]
Banana was born in the Adi-adi-adi-adi, he was arrested numerous times, Adia, he was accused of transporting guns for Al Capone.

[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:33.680]
Through his crime family, he established nearly 1930s Banana rose to become a member of the commission.

[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:41.160]
But he denied them off he existed, writing in his book that the term refers to a process, a special set of relationships among men.

[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:42.200]
Men, men.

[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:45.900]
I stay away from the term because it creates more confusion than it's worth, he said.

[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:53.560]
He described himself in his book as a venture capitalist who invested in business with owners who invited him to become a partner because of his connections.

[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:59.800]
He said prostitution narcotics, extortion and kidnapping were unmanly and restricted in Anacroix.

[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:00.340]
He's dead.

[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:04.420]
Jobananas is dead, long live Jobananas.

[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.940]
I'll tell you what's not dead, it's bigger than the Mary Tyler Moore and the six million dollar man and Phyllis and Roda all put together.

[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:13.840]
Yeah.

[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:14.460]
Spider-Man.

[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:16.300]
Boy.

[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:25.100]
It says, now you know why they call him the amazing Spider-Man with 72 million dollars in its second weekend, a number that would be a tremendous debut weekend for almost any film,

[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:31.680]
Spider-Man knocked off Star Wars Episode 1, the Phantom Menace become the fastest movie ever to hit 200 million dollars.

[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:38.180]
Spider-Man passed this mark on Saturday, it's ninth day of release, it took the Phantom Menace 13 days to reach 200 million.

[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:47.840]
The comic book adaptation starring Toby McGuire directed by Sam Remy has roast 223.6 million dollars in 10 days according to studio estimates yesterday.

[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:55.720]
The movie had been the second, had the best second weekend ever, beating the 57.5 million that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone took in over the second period.

[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:58.260]
They did 72 million Harry Potter 57.5.

[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:01.780]
God.

[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:11.160]
This is one of the second weekends, it's almost more impressive than the first of that, it's possible, said Paul, Dera, something or other, Dera Garabedian with 400 letters in his name.

[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:18.320]
President box office tracker, exhibited relations, the firm is relentless and it's a cool of money, it's relentless man, just like you George, it's relentless.

[02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:19.340]
I thought that was you.

[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:19.720]

[02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:31.960]
After huge openings, films often know, knows that by 50% or more in the second weekend because so many people have already seen them, Spider-Man held up strongly despite its phenomenal premiere, it's revenue is dipping just 37%.

[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:40.400]
That's probably the most gravity-defying feat of Spider-Man to hold up like from a number of that size, said Jeff Blake, head of distribution at marketing at Sony, which released the film.

[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:42.440]
And on and on a coast.

[02:37:44.780 --> 02:38:04.760]
Spider-Man at $72 million over the weekend on faithful 14.2 not even close, in fact, if you take the, I think if you take the next nine together in the top 10, let's see 24, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, the next nine together have less than 40 million and Spider-Man took in 72 million.

[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:05.580]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.140]
Great.

[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:11.840]
For old Spider-Man, he's doing it, baby, and you want to know why that's because we talked about it on the show last week.

[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:12.600]
It's all ours.

[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:18.020]
That's right. We want our chunk, we want our chunk, we want our piece, we want our little piece of the pie, that's all.

[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:21.820]
We just want to taste, I want to wet my beak, just a little bit.

[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:27.780]
Now, how come I got the window open and it smells like somebody's cooking something outside? How's that possible?

[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:30.300]
Maybe they are, maybe somebody else with their window open is cooking something.

[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:32.620]
Oh, man, it smells good. Smells like pasta.

[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:35.380]
Oh, I can't eat pasta, la pasta, baby, can't eat that.

[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:40.360]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 WQM, here's a simple question for you.

[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:47.220]
If somebody offered to give you several thousand dollars, give you over the next few years, when you accept it, you'd be a fool, you'd be stupid not to take it.

[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:53.560]
So, it makes it really foolish to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at just 3.95%. Here's the deal.

[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:58.580]
There's a Fannie Mae program out there at 3.95% for both refinancing and purchasing of homes.

[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:06.720]
Just 3.95% and all you got to do is make one easy phone call to financial group toll free. It's 1-800-940-5363.

[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.300]
I'm telling you that, that's definitely spaghetti.

[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:13.620]
Oh, the smell of that pasta sauce, enough to drive me to the window to jump.

[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:23.760]
Call 1-800-940-5363 to be more specific. You can get yourself 100 grand with payments of only $475 a month or 200 grand with payments of just 950 bucks a month.

[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:28.280]
You'll save thousands and thousands of dollars to be downright stupid, the pass up a chance like that.

[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:32.700]
So, do the math and do the next smart thing. Get all the details. There's no obligation by calling financial group.

[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:40.800]
There'll be ecstatic to answer all your questions. Call 1-800-940-Lend, LED. That's 1-800-940-5363.

[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:44.940]
Equal housing lender, credit restrictions do apply and rates are subject to change.

[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:50.660]
And rocking is tonight from Poor Steel in Colorado.

[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:55.300]
Come and start at 830 on sports radio 5-16-EQAM.

[02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:57.920]
Get a mandate. I f**king come out!

[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:32.280]
Hello children, welcome to Yasur's Territors Kindergarten. You know what time it is?

[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:36.540]
It's in the bottom line, isn't it? That's right. And what do we want to be?

[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:39.720]
We want to be partners. And how do we do this?

[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:43.480]
We are partners in Hilux Railies. And who are our heroes?

[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:47.520]
We are talented modern. We are the best people in the world.

[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:51.640]
And now when we fund our activities with money for vital things,

[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:55.560]
we'll solve your baby and use it aboard the Black Rim and the Red Carrier.

[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:57.860]
Children, do we want peace with Israel?

[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:01.180]
No, we want to kill them and drive them into the sea.

[02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:04.720]
Very good children are scrapped on your bones at times.

[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:07.320]
It's in the bottom line, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:11.100]
One is your group in mind, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.560]
It's in the bottom line, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:19.900]
One is your group in mind, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:24.120]
It's in the bottom line, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:32.960]
It's in the bottom line, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:34.980]
One is your group in mind, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:34.980]

[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:35.740]
One is your group in mind, isn't it? That's right.

[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:38.340]
From 18 to 560 WBM, so I took a little while,

[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:39.760]
but we found the answer to our question.

[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:41.660]
We got a lot of action on the fax machine today, No.

[02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:43.580]
Amazing! Action Facts!

[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:45.280]
Rose Marie is still alive.

[02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:49.200]
It's been us. She's surviving Hollywood squares for 85 years and she's still alive.

[02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:52.880]
And the reason we know that is she was one of the more mourners at Milton Brawl's funeral.

[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:59.440]
And look at this. Among the other mourners were Norm Crosby,

[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:02.540]
Buddy Hackett, who was a lot on Hollywood squares.

[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:05.580]
Jan Murray, did we talk about him last week about Hollywood squares?

[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:10.760]
I don't recall. Yes, we did. He's still alive and he's 84. You better get with it, Mr.

[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.100]
I don't know from Jan Murray.

[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:18.180]
Buddy Hackett, Jan Murray, Rose Marie, Sidd Cesar, Martin Landau, and

[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:24.400]
Fivish Finkle. Fivish. Who the hell is that? Fivish Finkle is very popular Jewish actor,

[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:29.440]
you anti-Semite. Get out of here, Fivish Fink. He's on Boston Public, as we speak.

[02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:35.620]
A hit show. Cox a hoist, Fivish. What kind of a name is that? Fivish. He's been in a million things.

[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:43.180]
Probably a goi. Anyway, speaking of goi, I'm here's a real, I'm telling you, the aroma of that sauce.

[02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:47.180]
Or whatever that, oh, I can come out through this window, it's just wafting through here.

[02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:51.460]
I'm trying to think, is there like an Italian restaurant close enough here that's like,

[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:56.920]
no, not that close. Man, just overpowering, you know what I mean? I know what you mean.

[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.660]
Maybe if the window below you, there are a few things in the world that like when they're

[02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:04.840]
cooking the aroma of it just practically overpowers you.

[02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:10.540]
And that's one of them. You know what else is like? A good like that? Brownies.

[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:13.460]
Oh yeah. Are you going to start with the chocolate again?

[02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:19.280]
Chocolate spaghetti. Although they do make chocolate spaghetti. I'm talking about pasta. Forget

[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:25.560]
about the brownies. Okay, just and another thing like fudge. Here we go. Do you know how many years

[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:29.160]
it's been since I've had fudge? In fact, last time I had fudge, probably was on the show.

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:33.820]
We had somebody once upon a time when I would be bringing us in fudge and I just about died.

[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:37.660]
And just like the day that the woman brought into QA a couple of years ago, what did she bring in

[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:40.560]
that day that nearly killed me? Cookies. Rugle-A?

[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:48.560]
Rugle-A? Yeah, she brings in Rugle-A. I mean just like taking a needle and just having an injection

[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.640]
of sugar right into my bloodstream and my head started spinning, I thought I was going to puke

[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.560]
and the pass out right there in a goddamn floor. Weren't those those supposedly sugar-free

[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:59.480]
gruggles? Here in the infarction some smarties to the hockey game. No thanks, there's plenty of

[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.480]
smarties up here if I bought any. No. No, and a smarties ice cream sucks by the way. Blows.

[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:08.640]
Anyway, speaking of your good close personal friend Bonnie Lee and you'll be pleased to know she's

[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.640]
still dead. Good. Says in this article right here from the New York Post, Bonnie Lee is just as dead

[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.820]
as the guy that Rick Sanchez hid in front of P.P. Park. But anyway, a year before her murder, Robert

[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:23.300]
Blake's wife told probation officer she had six post brushes with death while living a fast

[02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:27.640]
paste life according to a letter obtained by the New York Post. In a previously undisclosed note

[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:32.620]
to Arkansas law man, penned in early 2000, Bonnie Lee baked, he said she wanted to move to California

[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:37.160]
with Robert Blake or Christian Brando, thus attaining the start-up she so desperately sought.

[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:42.320]
But Blake Lee murdered May 4, 2001 outside of Studio City, Italian restaurant Vatelos,

[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:45.820]
after having dinner with Blake, said her drive for fame came with a price.

[02:44:46.900 --> 02:44:50.040]
Blake Lee wrote that her poor upbringing made her anxious to find fame and fortune,

[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:56.000]
even if it put her in harm's way. And this is why I'm driven, almost being killed a half

[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.660]
a dozen times, I know better not to waste any time, Blake Lee wrote asking her permission to move

[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:05.080]
to California. Blake Lee was on probation in 1966 for an arrest in Arkansas for having fake

[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:11.280]
ID and stolen credit cards. See, she was an upstanding bitch, right? In that 2000 letter to Arkansas

[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:15.540]
probation officials, Blake Lee, and by the way, all you punks out there don't ever say,

[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:20.040]
be odd, just say bitch, okay? Be odd, son, so just come right out and say bitch, you know,

[02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:26.440]
right? I couldn't agree more. Why be around a bush? That fucking bitch. There you go. See,

[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.380]
like, Lee Bailey, man, say it like you mean it, not be odd, so like you have to be a polygetic

[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:35.100]
person, a bitch is a bitch, okay? Just like there are men who are assholes, of course,

[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:38.800]
there are women who are assholes too, but whatever, there are men who are schmucks and there are women

[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:44.240]
who are bitches. And, Bonnie Lee was one of them, of course. In that 2000 letter to Arkansas

[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.740]
probation officials, Blake Lee repeated a recurring theme in much of her correspondence,

[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:52.520]
her insatiable needy rise above poverty and marry for that security if necessary. I was brought

[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.320]
up dirt poor and always had the dream to either become famous or to marry someone who's already

[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:01.120]
as famous as I wanted to be bakedly-ro. Well, bad mistake, honey, because you're still dead.

[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.580]
Sometime being, you know, like just an ordinary schlep is not a bad idea. I know. Yeah, like George,

[02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:15.800]
being kind of like pasty and nondescript. In a quiet New Jersey cemetery yesterday, a scene of

[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:21.560]
tragic sadness played itself out. As fallen backs of all star Jason Williams made a terriide visit

[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:25.940]
to the grave of the man he's charged with killing. It wasn't the first time Williams has made this

[02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:29.480]
pilgrimage. Sources told the New York Post he's come to the grave of Costa's Gus,

[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.180]
Christophe, almost every week since the Valentine's Day shooting that left the limo driver dead.

[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:39.160]
During yesterday's visit to former New Jersey net center lead flower struggled with tears

[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:43.480]
and read from the Bible as he stood before the rose called a headstone. And the Bible says,

[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:50.060]
you know what the Bible says? Kill him on. Right. He comes a lot. I've seen him twice, but the

[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:53.660]
security guards says he comes all the time. So the grave dicker, the hillside summit is Gorge Gort.

[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:58.480]
He comes and stays about 10 minutes, puts down some flowers and leaves. We just stand by and watch

[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:03.680]
nobody bothers him. Williams, most recent visit before yesterday was made turd just two days after

[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.600]
was indicted, unaggravated manslaughter and other charges linked to Christophe's killing. And

[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:12.180]
he said, when attempt to make it look like a suicide yesterday, Williams arrived just before

[02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:16.500]
2.30 p.m. when I'm not identified woman in two bookays of flowers. Now, says in this story, I

[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:19.980]
identified woman. I noticed that Mo this morning was psychotic about that because he said it was

[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:26.020]
his mother because he's like biracial and his mother, I guess, is white. So get with it in your

[02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:29.640]
post because the Mo is in the know on this one. He said it was his mother. He said it was your mama.

[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:34.740]
Didn't that nice on mother's day to take mom to the grave of the guy who just murdered?

[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:41.140]
Okay. Yeah, what a wonderful gift for mom. The pair misted up with tears as they laid the floral

[02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:45.460]
gifts. Then they stood and silently read from a Bible before Williams kneeled by the tombstone

[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:49.940]
and laid a hand on it. The pair then started to walk away, but it apparently overcome Williams,

[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:53.640]
turned back and huged Christophe's headstone. He hugged it and the headstone too.

[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:58.220]
I just can't talk about it. The soft book in Williams said, listen, you have a happy mother's day.

[02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:03.020]
He added the sister of the 55 year old Christophe said she was surprised by the visit. No, I

[02:48:03.020 --> 02:48:06.080]
didn't know he went there. I don't know what to say about it. And we add him to before declining

[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:11.300]
further comment. In addition to being a limo driver, Christophe was a drug abuse counselor who

[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:17.300]
would overcome his own addiction to health mothers. Williams is accused as we know of a shooting

[02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:20.780]
Christophe with a 12-gay shotgun. When the chauffeur visited the basketball stars,

[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:25.980]
hundreds of new jerseys mentioned February 14th after driving some of Williams' friends. Williams

[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:31.660]
was free on $270,000 bail offered his condolences in March to Christophe's family. The driver's

[02:48:31.660 --> 02:48:35.880]
family doubled the multimillionaire's in Syria. They're doubted his sincerity. Doubted and doubled.

[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.100]
The only thing I can say about his apology when he went to court, it was too little too late. His sister

[02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:44.980]
told the post earlier this month, Williams faces up to 30 years in prison on manslaughter charges. His

[02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:49.420]
lawyer, who could not be reached for comment, described the shooting as a tragic accident. Always a

[02:48:49.420 --> 02:48:56.480]
tragic accident. And if it doesn't fit, you're full of Schmidt, okay? Boy, let's go take mom to the

[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.660]
cemetery on Mother's Day, huh? I'll tell you one thing, it's your better than taking her to the

[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:06.820]
ark. I'll take my mom to the cemetery on Mother's Day. Oh boy. In fact, I think there's some

[02:49:06.820 --> 02:49:10.620]
similarity there when you come right down to it. Going to the ark and going to the cemetery.

[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:16.120]
26 past noon at 560. I'll tell you one thing, this show is just flown by today. Is it just me or

[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:21.740]
you? No, no, it has. It's like a heartbeat. It must be all those calls we took. That's what it was.

[02:49:22.380 --> 02:49:25.740]
In case you tuned in later, tuned out and tuned back in. We took three or four of the most

[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:31.020]
simulating calls in a history of radio. It was something. I don't think we can say that word on a year.

[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:35.520]
I know we can say, Donald mattress, 1-800 mattress. I've been telling you folks for a

[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:39.540]
cooln's age that this is the only intelligent way to get you a great new mattress and replace

[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:46.960]
your back, bad for your health and all the way around, bad for the way you feel. So get you a great

[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:51.320]

[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:56.620]
a simple thing can do. Just reach over and grab that thing and call 1-800 mattress, 1-800-MATTR-ES

[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:07.960]
Donald mattress has the deepest selection of brand-day mattresses, they don't have to switch

[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:26.660]
convenient for you when you're going to be there. So instead of sitting around and you're asking all

[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:30.360]
they waiting for delivery and hoping somebody shows up, do the smart thing called Donald mattress

[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:35.320]

[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:57.340]
It's the out of the closet collection.

[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:01.000]
Rack them.

[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:07.880]
No.

[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:20.380]
Come here, Tom.

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:21.700]
Just one second.

[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.440]
I want to show you something.

[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:32.640]
Touch me.

[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:34.500]
Yes, right there.

[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:36.580]
We're me.

[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:39.880]
See me.

[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:42.240]
Yes.

[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:45.460]
Feel all of me.

[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:48.200]
Touch me.

[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:49.760]
No.

[02:51:50.980 --> 02:51:52.220]
Meir me.

Crap it all records presents these previously unreleased tracks.

Catch Pete's seeing these songs the way they were meant to be.

[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:01.060]
The Ruck Boy is Slitz Scurts. Pete Townsend.

[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:02.420]
The In My Box Set.

[02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.680]
And since I'm on the On-Bot, I'm having silver balls.

[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:07.480]
So hold down and brighten.

[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:09.320]
Man, I always need to call.

[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:11.400]
Vaincy doesn't like it.

[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:13.020]
And then it bads them stall.

[02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:14.920]
My name is Peter Townsend.

[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:17.620]
And I shall play a meme, Chen Paul.

[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:21.400]
We're in it right now and you'll get a CD bonus track of Pete singing that

[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:22.360]
Hell It Ready Classic.

[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:23.520]
I am woman.

[02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:24.920]
Vizzo or Mastercard except.

[02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:25.400]
All right.

[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:26.680]
1232 at 560.

[02:52:26.780 --> 02:52:27.520]
Oh, this is great.

[02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:30.320]
Say something, mumble something all the way here.

[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:30.960]
A fax coming out.

[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:31.260]
What do you want?

[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:32.680]
I'm by the mic.

[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:33.600]
Where would I be?

[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:34.560]
See now I can hear you better.

[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:35.280]
You want to know why?

[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:35.580]
Why?

[02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:37.520]
Because I got the...

[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:39.180]
Remember I told about these headsets that I bought?

[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:39.580]
Right.

[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:41.720]
We were talking about that during the break.

[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:42.720]
Why can't Neil hear me?

[02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:44.680]
That song that I was playing I was blasting it.

[02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:46.740]
And you said you could barely hear it.

[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:47.380]
Right.

[02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:48.620]
When I was playing it's raining mountain.

[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.040]
Well, well, now you don't understand.

[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:53.100]
The return that comes back up here like during the commercials,

[02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:57.240]
the level where I have to keep the speakers is like very, very low.

[02:52:57.380 --> 02:52:58.940]
In order to keep the level balanced.

[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.340]
Otherwise, if I turn them up real loud, they're going to get feedback.

[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:01.760]
Right.

[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:03.540]
But now the headphones, if you let me finish,

[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:04.940]
you were just talking about that during the break?

[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:06.080]
With Miguel.

[02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:07.180]
Why couldn't Neil hear me?

[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:08.020]
Oh my God.

[02:53:08.180 --> 02:53:09.400]
Psychic Neil strikes again.

[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:09.780]
Oh!

[02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:10.260]
Wow.

[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:13.600]
Because now I realize why you can't hear half the things that I say

[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:15.360]
is because the return is so goddamn low.

[02:53:15.580 --> 02:53:15.840]
Right.

[02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:16.460]
That's right.

[02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:19.160]
But now I hear you like just like your next door making that spaghetti.

[02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:20.600]
Oh, by the way, the aroma change.

[02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:21.880]
They must have already eaten.

[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:24.240]
Oh, changed in a hurry.

[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:25.280]
It took a turn for the voice.

[02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:26.460]
Now what does that smell like?

[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:27.840]
I don't want to tell you.

[02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:29.080]
Yeah, that should give you an idea.

[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:31.400]
Like I said, they already they already dug in.

[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:34.580]
No, but in these headsets that I bought, the great,

[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:36.380]
I mean, I don't want anybody to see the way these look.

[02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:39.680]
But I got like the left ear on and the rest of it is like up on the back of my neck.

[02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:40.780]
In other words, like on an angle.

[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:42.280]
Oh, you don't want to waste.

[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:44.280]
Because I can't I can't wait a whole thing where I get ahead.

[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:45.120]
It gets so uncomfortable.

[02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:45.580]
Yeah.

[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:47.100]
So I only have it coming in one ear.

[02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:48.700]
Well, now you look like a club DJ.

[02:53:49.360 --> 02:53:49.640]
Right.

[02:53:50.100 --> 02:53:50.460]
Exactly.

[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:51.080]
That's right.

[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:52.620]
I'm a club club talk host.

[02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:55.720]
An old fart, the club talk host with my headphones.

[02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:56.620]
And it's great.

[02:53:56.740 --> 02:53:57.640]
I can actually hear myself.

[02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:58.600]
I hear the spots.

[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:00.720]
I hear you, which you know, speaks for itself.

[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:02.340]
How do you like that?

[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:03.580]
I think it's great.

[02:54:03.660 --> 02:54:04.220]
A great thing.

[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.940]
So I think we saw the problem here where it is a world is a way.

[02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:11.260]
Because you know, technically we get so much assistance from.

[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:13.060]
Well, I have no complaints in it.

[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:14.540]
A wonderful job setting this place up.

[02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:15.560]
And I got to do a great job.

[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:16.200]
And I'm sitting in.

[02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:18.780]
In fact, the room around the building is there's like 14 different engineers.

[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:20.400]
Some who don't even work for this company.

[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:23.720]
Or volunteering to go to Amsterdam to set up my studio there very soon.

[02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:26.020]
How's that pool coming on?

[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:26.820]
There's a spaghetti.

[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:27.780]
Wafting back in the winter.

[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:29.700]
Oh, must be on for seconds now.

[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:30.480]
Mama, Kuala, only.

[02:54:32.500 --> 02:54:33.620]
483 votes on the survey.

[02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:35.460]
What do you dislike most about Neil's show?

[02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:37.340]
See, we give you the opportunity to vent.

[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:38.720]
Here's the chance.

[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:40.480]
Of course, the people are really hated the new format.

[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:41.540]
They're already gone.

[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:42.660]
You know, let's find.

[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:43.100]
Bye-bye.

[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:43.740]
I see you.

[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:44.200]
Sure, there.

[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:46.900]
120 say nothing.

[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:47.440]
It's fine.

[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:48.940]
93 say nothing.

[02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:50.060]
I like it better than ever.

[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:51.680]
No phone call.

[02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:52.520]
78 said that.

[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:55.140]
Of course, obviously they must have tuned out when we had those four great calls.

[02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:57.340]
Yeah, sums it up well.

[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:01.140]
Don't like the tone of the show that's tone and capital in the italics.

[02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:01.820]
Underlined.

[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:03.480]
54.

[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.300]
And you notice how that hasn't changed?

[02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:05.780]
Right.

[02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:09.300]
That hasn't changed in the last maybe 45 minutes because they're all fake.

[02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:10.440]
All fake.

[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:12.160]
All you clowns out there.

[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.040]
Still hasn't changed.

[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:17.000]
The thing just rebooted still hasn't changed.

[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:17.820]
What does that tell you?

[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:19.380]
Too much reading 38.

[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:20.900]
Too many priest stories.

[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:21.520]
33.

[02:55:22.100 --> 02:55:23.440]
Not enough comedy bits.

[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:24.180]
27.

[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:25.300]
Gole Leafs go.

[02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:25.900]
24.

[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:27.240]
Oh, oh, oh.

[02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:28.420]
Too many comedy bits.

[02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:30.740]
17 out of almost they're getting close to five-meter votes.

[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:31.780]
Pretty impressive.

[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:32.720]
Total if you ask me.

[02:55:32.900 --> 02:55:34.160]
And of course, most of them real votes.

[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.620]
Here's the worst story of that.

[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:38.680]
So far the most depressing news.

[02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:39.540]
I promise to this.

[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:40.880]
Well, this is great.

[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:42.140]
I can I can like hear myself.

[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:45.500]
And if you mumble or mutter something, I can hear you.

[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:46.860]
See?

[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:47.980]
Love which isn't so great.

[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:50.160]
Jesse Jackson released from hospital.

[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:51.620]
This is the bad news.

[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:53.380]
Proving that nothing is perfect.

[02:55:54.100 --> 02:55:56.280]
The Reverend Jesse Jackson was released from a hospital yesterday.

[02:55:56.340 --> 02:56:00.180]
After he was admitted for muscle pains in his shoulder, a hospital spokesman said.

[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:03.160]
Jackson who heads the Rainbow Push Coalition,

[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:05.720]
checked himself at the University of Chicago Hospital Saturday.

[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:08.000]
And doctors kept him overnight for observation.

[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.500]
Jackson's symptoms likely related to an auto accident that the civil rights leader was in

[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:13.300]
several weeks ago.

[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:15.540]
Test yesterday found no additional problems.

[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:17.320]
And Jackson was really shortly afternoon.

[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:17.940]
Damn it.

[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.480]
Remember McClusky when Tom Hagen showed up?

[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:21.700]
Yep.

[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:23.220]
Damn it.

[02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:25.660]
We've been able to rule out the other problems.

[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:27.440]
It's looking more and more like what everyone thought it was.

[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.720]
A muscle pain as a result of his accident.

[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:30.760]
This spokesman said.

[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:32.040]
Maybe it was a pain in his...

[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:32.340]
Reckoning.

[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:33.700]
That's what he gives all the rest of us.

[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:35.560]
Jackson left the hospital in good condition.

[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:37.340]
But doctors told him to take it easy.

[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:41.840]
He was encouraged to work with a little, get a little rest in recreation into his schedule.

[02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:45.120]
In between the father and more illegitimate childrens.

[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:49.980]
Police had this depressing, very disturbing.

[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:52.340]
But of course it's everything, the 9-11 thing.

[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:53.560]
There are million stories on that.

[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:56.620]
Where they bungled and they shouldn't know about it.

[02:56:57.220 --> 02:57:00.200]
Police in Littleton, Colorado had evidence before Columbine shootings.

[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:05.700]
Hours after Dylan Cleebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people at Columbine High School of

[02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:08.540]
30s obtained search warrants for their homes using year old evidence.

[02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:13.580]
Sheriff's officials had said in 1998 there was enough evidence of a crime to pursue reports

[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:16.400]
that Harris and Cleebold were threatening others and making bombs.

[02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:20.800]
After the two killed 12 students in a teacher before killing themselves April 20th 1999.

[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:24.680]
At the school near Denver, those 1998 reports were used to obtain search warrants.

[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:26.900]
According documents released Friday and to record order.

[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:30.980]
They show for the first time that a warning about Harris from Randy and Judy Brown

[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:34.060]
had been used to get permission to search Harris's home and Cleebolds.

[02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:37.860]
In March 98, the Browns gave authorities violent writings from Harris's website,

[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:41.540]
including a death threat against their son Brooks and description of pipe bombs.

[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:47.120]
Investigators drafted an effort to justify search of Harris's home, but they never showed it to a

[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:52.960]
judge and eventually dropped the case. This is before Columbine. They dropped it.

[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:53.840]
They dropped it.

[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:55.620]
I beg your pardon, Cleebolds.

[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:57.080]
I couldn't hear that time because you're stepping on me.

[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:57.960]
Don't step on me.

[02:57:58.060 --> 02:57:59.400]
Oh, sorry. They dropped it.

[02:57:59.480 --> 02:57:59.680]
All right.

[02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:00.480]
Is what I said.

[02:58:01.140 --> 02:58:01.840]
Oh, they dropped it.

[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:05.060]
The longer I think about it, the matter I get Judy Brown said,

[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:07.940]
the documents which were released after an open record request by the Denver Post.

[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:09.840]
Sheriff Spokesman Jim Shire said,

[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.040]
Friday that the full value of the Browns report may not have been clear until after Columbine.

[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:16.580]
Obviously, anything that's going to be in hindsight is 2020.

[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:17.080]
He said,

[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:18.740]
which sounds like a real good excuse to me.

[02:58:19.540 --> 02:58:20.780]
And that what it sounds like to you?

[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:21.060]
Yes.

[02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:21.620]
Yes.

[02:58:23.860 --> 02:58:25.520]
Release of laws, transcript blocked.

[02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:28.360]
He's testifying again today, which I'm loving it.

[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.900]
Every second about, I hope he's squirming.

[02:58:30.140 --> 02:58:32.260]
I hope he gets pneumonia out there in the rain, even with the umbrella.

[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:32.840]
Teehee.

[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:37.500]
Cardinal Bernard Law answered questions for a second day in a pre-sex abuse case on Friday,

[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:41.540]
but a judge granted a request by the Arts Dices to block the release of transcript from the session

[02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:43.540]
until law had 30 days to review them.

[02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:47.960]
The Cardinal's been questioned under oath by attorneys in the lawsuit, brought by 86-led victims

[02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:50.300]
of child molesting priest John Gagan.

[02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:51.740]
On Friday,

[02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:54.460]
lines had questions for about four hours after the morning round of questioning.

[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:58.360]
He left to celebrate Mass at a church in Boston's Roxbury section and offer prayers

[02:58:58.360 --> 02:58:58.820]
of the victims.

[02:58:58.900 --> 02:58:59.460]
And believe me,

[02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:00.900]
believe me,

[02:59:01.320 --> 02:59:03.440]
if you live in Roxbury, you need a prayer.

[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:06.660]
Attorney Mitch Giroffede in representing Gagan's alleged victim said,

[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:09.080]
law was asked again about the church's supervision of Gagan.

[02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:12.880]
And the decision may third by the Arts Dices Finance Council to back out of a settlement

[02:59:12.880 --> 02:59:16.560]
agreement worth up to $30 million, but the ruling provided details from Friday's questioning

[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:17.180]
from emerging.

[02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:18.780]
And it goes on and on about.

[02:59:18.860 --> 02:59:19.700]
He's speaking again today.

[02:59:19.820 --> 02:59:20.360]
He's testifying.

[02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:21.480]
He's lying through his teeth.

[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:26.300]
And I love the fact that the one of his victims or one of Gagan's victims refused

[02:59:26.300 --> 02:59:29.400]
to shake hands with Cardinal Law because he knows that he's part of the, he's a willing

[02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:30.460]
co-conspirator.

[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:32.700]
He said, go shake this, schmuck.

[02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:33.700]
Puts.

[02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:37.200]
20-1 till a gym manager comes along at one o'clock.

[02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:39.340]
How'd you like to have a really big one like the mad dog?

Raudi-izzard.

[03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:43.640]
Do you win?

[03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:46.680]
I, Papa Juan Paolo.

[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.880]
It's the scariest movie since scary movie.

[03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:51.140]
I'm scared, Daddy.

[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:53.220]
Just scared even with my pants.

[03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:54.160]
Panic Room.

[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:57.620]
There's no toilet paper.

[03:00:58.060 --> 03:00:58.820]
There's no newspaper.

[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:00.780]
And there's no domestic one.

[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:02.620]
Somebody help me, please.

[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:03.700]
Panic Room.

[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:04.460]
Show me now.

[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:07.880]
I've got a meeting in two minutes for the love of God.

[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:09.620]
Somebody help me.

[03:01:09.740 --> 03:01:12.360]
Splatterproof plastic tarps for the first five rows.

[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:14.220]
I'm going to get it right time.

[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:19.540]
1244-560 WDQAM.

[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:21.660]
Dying inmate to lawyer, you're fired.

[03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:27.700]
And goal of Louisiana, a man convicted of raping and killing a 19-year-old college student in 1991,

[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:29.660]
was executed by injection-fried tonight.

[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:32.340]
Leslie Martin, 35, made no final statement,

[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:34.740]
but after the drugs were injected, could be seen,

[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:35.460]
mouthing the words,

[03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:38.460]
you're fired to his defense attorney who watched the execution.

[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:41.400]
The lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith,

[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:44.380]
later said Martin's remarks are part of a long-running joke between the two.

[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:45.040]
Right.

[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:47.020]
And that cute?

[03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:48.840]
I liked it.

[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:50.280]
Way to go on running joke.

[03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:51.000]
Leave him smartly.

[03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:51.280]
You're fired.

[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:55.080]
I got a story next to the like, right in line with this, it's even more depressing.

[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:59.420]
Martin was convicted in 92 of killing Christina Bergen, a student at McNeese State University in Lake

[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:02.880]
Charles. She was last seen alive, leaving a lounge with Martin on June 20, 1991.

[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:07.420]
Her decomposed body was found nearly two weeks later in a pump house in rural southwestern Louisiana

[03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:08.300]
town of Iowa.

[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:13.920]
In the rural southwestern Louisiana town of Iowa, there's a town called Iowa, Louisiana.

[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:14.600]
You ready for that?

[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:15.700]
No idea.

[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:16.960]
So what it says,

[03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:18.760]
Prosecutor said Martin, rape,

[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:21.720]
burg, and then strangle her to keep her from turning him in.

[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:22.580]
And she didn't.

[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:23.760]
And you know what he's still dead?

[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:24.680]
But you're fired.

[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.920]
And right in line with that, from news day comes this, right to die activist, pretty dies.

[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:33.880]
Well, that's what you wanted.

[03:02:34.420 --> 03:02:35.540]
Diane Pretty, that's her name.

[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:38.680]
A terminally a woman who fought a non-successful legal battle for the right to have her husband

[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:40.580]
help her commit suicide, has died.

[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:42.160]
Her family said Sunday she was 43.

[03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:43.780]
This is in London, by the way.

[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:48.900]
Pretty who suffered from a motor neuron disease died Saturday at a hospice near her home in

[03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:49.460]
central England.

[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:53.200]
A husband, Brian said, she'd been experiencing breathing difficulties for several days.

[03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:57.280]
Pretty, whose illness left her paralyzed from the neck down and confined to a wheelchair,

[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:01.240]
fought in the British courts for her husband to be guaranteed immunity from prosecution if he

[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:01.760]
helped her die.

[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:07.080]
Suicide is legal in Britain, but helping somebody else commit suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14

[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:07.780]
years in prison.

[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:12.200]
After a case was defeated in Britain's highest courts, he went to the European Court of Human

[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:16.200]
Rights in Strasbourg two weeks ago, a panel of European judges agreed with the British courts.

[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:19.580]
Pretty, who was diagnosed with the degenerative disease 1999,

[03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:23.720]
it said she wanted the right to take her own life because she feared a slow and painful death

[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:24.580]
from a speciation.

[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:29.660]
On Sunday, Brian Pretty said his wife had to go through one thing she had foreseen and was afraid of,

[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:30.740]
and there was nothing I could do to help.

[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:34.660]
Now he said she was free at last, just like Martin Luther Cohen said,

[03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:35.540]
free at last.

[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:37.020]
She wanted to die, now she's dead.

[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.400]
Stop the suffering, stop the pain, stop the agony.

[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:41.960]
It's kind of like working at QAM.

[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:43.440]
Stop the pain.

[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:49.580]
Here is one of the most interesting stories that I've ever seen in my life.

[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:53.160]
Interesting, not the spectacular, interesting.

[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:58.620]
A Florida family on Friday became the first to be implanted with computer chips that researchers

[03:03:58.620 --> 03:04:02.960]
hope will someday become an easy way to provide emergency room staffers with patient medical

[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:03.560]
information.

[03:04:04.660 --> 03:04:08.640]
Jeff and Leslie Jacobs, along with their 14-year-old son Derek, had the tiny chips implanted

[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:13.540]
in their arms, each chip is about the size of a grain of rice, and insertion takes about a minute

[03:04:13.540 --> 03:04:14.640]
under local anesthesia.

[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:19.580]
The chips called the Vera chip were designed by Palm Beach-based applied digital solution zinc.

[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:22.800]
They're similar to chips implanted in pets to identify them if they're lost.

[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:25.900]
The family wanted the implants in case of future medical emergencies.

[03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:30.080]
We're doing this as a security for us because we've worked so hard to save my husband's life,

[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:31.660]
said Leslie Jacobs 46.

[03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:36.620]
Her 48-year-old husband has suffered through cancer, a car crash, a degenerative spinal

[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:41.220]
condition, chronic eye disease and abdominal operations. His injuries have forced him to quit

[03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:44.900]
his dental practice. It's been really easy and I feel a lot better than I have it he said after

[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:49.280]
the implant. The chips used by the Jacobs family contain only telephone numbers and information

[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:53.360]
about previous medications. The data can be read by a handheld computer and printed out.

[03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:58.520]
The FDA said in April that it would not regulate the implant as long as it contains no medical data.

[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:02.460]
Company officials said they were free to proceed because the implant contains ID numbers that

[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:05.180]
correspond to personal medical information in a separate database.

[03:05:05.940 --> 03:05:09.320]
The FDA did not consider the implant to be a medical device company official said,

[03:05:09.580 --> 03:05:12.720]
and FDA spokeswoman in Miami did not immediately return a phone call like everybody else

[03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:16.060]
sees busy. The FDA head said regulation would be needed if medical records were stored

[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:20.360]
in a regard against storage of outdated records. Company officials hope to eventually include more

[03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:23.640]
extensive information that companies said it would be particularly valuable for those who suffer

[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:27.420]
from Alzheimer's disease, others with difficulty providing medical information on their own.

[03:05:27.940 --> 03:05:31.500]
Very chips expected to sell for about 200 bucks, a scanner used to read information contained in

[03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:36.620]
the chip would cost about between 1 and 3,000. The chip which could also be used as a security

[03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:41.580]
tool is through debate over its potential uses a big brother device to track people who invade the

[03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:45.600]
privacy of their home's or workplaces. Jacobs and his family brush aside those arguments,

[03:05:45.800 --> 03:05:49.360]
anybody can be tracked through the internet and email credit cards and cell phones they say,

[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:54.580]
I think it's great. Not the one who really is a big trustee in the government,

[03:05:54.760 --> 03:05:58.260]
I think it's a great idea. It's a nice one idea especially for your children.

[03:05:58.800 --> 03:06:02.720]
I was just going to say how come we only are doing it for pets, how come for children that we

[03:06:02.720 --> 03:06:06.740]
got all these lost kids and abducted kids and all of these things, huh? As a matter of fact when

[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:10.900]
they figure out how to do a low jack thing with it, then it'll really be great.

[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:15.600]
Yeah, but we're going to have a stick it. I know I seriously, I think it's a great idea.

[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:19.560]
Interesting stuff. But big brother is going to come with you then it'll be the

[03:06:19.560 --> 03:06:22.380]
builder burger, the trial ad rule commission and the illuminati. Right.

[03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:51.900]
1249 at 560 WQM, too bad we don't have the tape of that where he goes and says,

[03:07:53.800 --> 03:07:54.580]

[03:07:55.280 --> 03:07:57.080]
Suck it in and hold it.

Roll another blunt.

Roll another blunt.

[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:27.480]
Roll another blunt.

[03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:27.580]

[03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:27.580]

Roll another blunt.

[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:29.380]
Roll another blunt.

[03:09:29.380 --> 03:09:32.600]
I wasn't gonna run from the cops but I was high.

[03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:34.180]
Oh I'm serious man.

[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:38.580]
I was gonna pull right over and stop but I was high.

[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:39.580]
Uh uh.

[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:40.900]
La la la la.

[03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:44.300]
Now I'm a pair of plain shaking I know why.

[03:09:44.380 --> 03:09:45.220]
Why baby?

[03:09:46.220 --> 03:09:47.020]
Because I got high.

[03:09:47.540 --> 03:09:49.860]
Because I got high.

[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:52.020]
La la la la la.

[03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:54.400]
I was gonna make love to you.

[03:09:54.460 --> 03:09:54.860]
Oh.

[03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:55.900]
Because I got high.

[03:09:56.040 --> 03:09:56.580]
That's a big thing.

[03:09:56.840 --> 03:09:57.040]
I'm serious.

[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:00.100]
I was gonna eat your pussy too

[03:10:00.100 --> 03:10:05.820]
Oh, no, I'm jacking up

[03:10:05.820 --> 03:10:07.580]
And I know why

[03:10:07.580 --> 03:10:10.100]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You go, you go, you go, you go

You go, you go, you go, you go, you go

[03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:21.440]
You go, you go, you go, you go

[03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:23.160]
I lost my keys to white

[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:25.760]
You go, you go, you go

[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:29.140]
Now sleep in the home this sidewalk

Why be a big girl like I have

Be a big girl like I have

[03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:38.860]
La la la la, da, da, da, da, da

[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:40.520]
I'm gonna stop singing this song

[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:41.940]
Because I'm high

[03:10:42.900 --> 03:10:46.360]
Baby, I'm singing this whole thing wrong

[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:48.040]
Be a big girl like I have

[03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:50.000]
Bring it back, bring it back, come on

[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.200]
And if I don't still want coffee

[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:53.980]
I'm a wild one

[03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:56.960]
Be a big girl like I am high

[03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:59.920]
Girl like I am high

He rely on you

[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:11.080]
Yeah, I get this 12.5.7.5.6.0

[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:12.120]
WQM, you're gonna be here

[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:13.440]
And a lot of baseball talk on his stage

[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:14.060]
You wanted to watch

[03:11:14.060 --> 03:11:15.260]
Cause there ain't nothing else going on

[03:11:15.260 --> 03:11:16.960]
Not a damn thing

[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:18.320]
Any football going on?

[03:11:18.380 --> 03:11:18.520]
No

[03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:20.920]
Any hockey play offensive for the basketball

[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:21.380]
Not

[03:11:21.380 --> 03:11:24.060]
Now how about that soccer team? No, they're gone

[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:29.420]
A lot of baseball talk but there is no interest and it just it's frustrating to me because I keep hearing

[03:11:29.420 --> 03:11:31.020]
Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh!

[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:34.240]
Yeah, word number one. We're uh in first place. Nobody cares

[03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:39.960]
7,930 on a perfectly sunny and beautiful salary day in South Florida yesterday

[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:43.740]
7,930 against the Dodgers

[03:11:43.740 --> 03:11:48.100]

[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:49.760]

[03:11:50.380 --> 03:11:53.840]
Just a joke Norm a savior stupid fax is okay and grow up
