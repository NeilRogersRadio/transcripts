[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.040]
57% of the people had one answer that was right. You know what I'm saying? There were two of the three answers that were acceptable.

[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.380]
Then that's not as bad as it looks on the face of it.

[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.380]
Even your own people disagreed with you. Well, that's too bad.

[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.000]
Because many of my own people are full of crap.

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.900]
Anyway, we asked yesterday, should Augusta National be forced to admit women?

[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.360]
Much later on, I got a little piece by Rudy Marzko and that because they're not backing off.

[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.100]
Those militant bitches, those dikes, they're not backing off.

[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.060]
But anyway, should Augusta National be forced to admit women?

[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040]
No, it's a private club. Three of them, 36 people said that. 43.2%.

[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.940]
In other words, it's a private club unless they want to get in.

[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.340]
Then of course, different story. I don't care. Golf is crap. That was an excellent response. 286.36%.

[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.880]
And the correct answer, yesterday discriminating 153.19.7%.

[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.140]
So anyway, speaking of American Idol, which I'm sure George Washington's in thirdity last night, all two hours of Pandora's boredom.

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.180]
Not a second of it. Neither did I.

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.940]
Another shame. So how do I look when you talk about it? Well, anyway, Matthew Gilbert, who writes for the Boston Globe,

[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.220]
I saw, I got 50 different reviews of that show last night, including a great one in the National Post year in Toronto, but it's too long.

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.580]
Scaving, just ripping and scathing. And isn't it great that TV continues with their originality?

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.120]
Yeah. You know, this Simon Cowell, who is a caustic bitchy britz, is the key to all of these shows.

[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.800]
First it was Ann Robinson, and now Simon Cowell, you know, bitching people out nasty British caustic assholes, which you know, I guess it's been redundant.

[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.000]
Yeah, but he's a snappy dresser. Is he really America crowns Kelly Clarkson, it's new idol.

[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180]
I was reading quotes from some of these broads out there who have evidently have no lives at all.

[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.220]
And they were saying, Oh, gee, now what are we going to do? I mean, we devoted our whole, we devoted our whole summer to the show.

[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.140]
And it was like the centerpiece of our lives. And what do we do now? And I'm thinking to myself, isn't it sad? Maybe they taped it.

[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.180]
So many lifeless assholes and so little time in keeping with the spirit of last night's drawn out American Idol finale rights, Matthew Gilbert in the Boston Globe.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.160]
This review should begin with a repetitive series of commercial breaks from that cola company, that car company and that clothing store.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.500]
Then it should delay gratification for a few more paragraphs with an A and top five lists clips from two months of auditions.

[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.040]
And of course, pseudo ironic wit from Brian Dunkelman, such as the intensity here is only getting intense.

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:30.000]
But instead, let's cut to the chase. Kelly Clarkson, the girl next door with the big city voice won the competition that is consumed TV viewers this summer, just as the first survivor did two summers ago.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.260]
Justice finally arrived at 9.51 pm after almost two hours of bluster and buildup when Dunkelman and co-host Ryan on pointless sequest finally proclaimed Clarkson, the first American Idol.

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.080]
A Texas native Clarkson, 20 took the majority of the 15 and a half million votes that were received to his unit along with the blessings of all three judges,

[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.860]
the prize will include an RCA recording contract as well as other career making benefits.

[00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.420]
Runner up just in Rarini, he of the Annie here and the come on eyes was exceedingly gracious about his lost, hugging Clarkson and saying, no one deserves it more than this woman.

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.600]
Projecting the slick happiness that is charmed his supporters, including a flirtatious Paula Abdul, Rarini was articulate and playful throughout the finale, even while his voice showed signs of wear.

[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.900]
Clarkson on the other hand was fine and fine singing form, but frequently it lost for engaging in small talk, answering sequest query about her expectation of the flustered.

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.360]
I didn't really think about it.

[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.020]
Aside from the crowning of Clarkson, the highlights of last night's episode were the two live medley's by the 10 finalists.

[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.480]
The songs first from the 1960s and then from Motown became a wait a minute.

[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.600]
Isn't that kind of redundant there? Are you in Motown? Not really in the 60s.

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.540]
Be it came the sort of vocal squirrel of Hans would come to respect from these young neo soul influence pop singers.

[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.680]
Their voices slide through notes as if they've been gargling with oil, but at least their medley's worn as tedious as the can filler that pated out most of the two hours.

[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.180]
The kids at least had some spark to them.

[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.920]
And filler was a generous word for much for much of last night's finale, which is more like a brightly lit advertising vehicle than a proper TV episode.

[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.740]
Along with the many commercials, including Fox's relentless promotion of its false schedule, there were ads featuring the idle finalists that were designed look like part of the show.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.900]
These ads were especially troubling as they further blurred the line between entertainment and commerce.

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.580]
Even survivor hasn't sold its contestants to its sponsors yet.

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.600]
Throughout the night, the co-host promised us that the winner would be revealed after the break, or unless then an hour.

[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.020]
If you were smart, you would ignore them and tune in sometime after 9.45.

[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.120]
So in other words, they melted till like nine minutes before 10 o'clock and then finally, which of course was there everybody knew anyway that you had won.

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.020]
Right? Indeed.

[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.640]
Now how did the look, maybe they had them in their summer, but how do I have to get this story out of yesterday's Boston Globe as opposed to the Sun Centaur of the Hero?

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.380]
This could be the most important story of the week.

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.800]
Florida City Commissioner has wallet and pants stolen at gunpoint. Are you familiar with this?

[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.780]
No. See? That's because you don't read the Boston Globe, Mr. Pompedo Beach.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.680]
City Commissioner Ed Phillips didn't lose his shirt playing cards this week. He lost his pants.

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.300]
All right.

[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.780]
Phillips had to head home in his underwear after being robbed at gunpoint in his own district Sunday night.

[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.800]
The stick up followed a card game with friends.

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.440]
Phillips set a car pulled up with two men wearing ski masks, one wave to gun and the other forced a man to head over their pants and their wallets.

[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.320]
The robbers got away with the clothing and all the money inside the pockets.

[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.060]
Phillips said his wallet contained about 50 bucks. Now he says his number one issue is fighting crime.

[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.640]
Good. I'd fell up stuff there in Pompedo Beach. Good going, baby.

[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.860]
Boston Globe, how do you like that?

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.860]
I didn't see it. Well, of course I don't read the top.

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.260]
Oh, and guess what? The Peter people, your favorites.

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.080]
Yes, indeed. The people for the ethical agreement of animals.

[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.660]
They just had a blurb on their eye. It's not on their website yet because they're very slow.

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.240]
And I guess they have to give you some reason to watch Paul Azon.

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.420]
But at any rate, they just had a blurb about the Peter people are now showing ads and they showed one of them.

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.020]
They showed the picture anyway, not the whole way.

[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.440]
And it's a guy with a huge puffy stick and out. You know, the shirt is like I'm above and the big puffy and the neighbor is sticking out.

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.220]
Which could be almost anybody in the Western hemisphere.

[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.960]
And the message is you'll have to pay for two seats on the plane if you're like this. So go vegetarian.

[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.460]
Oh, yeah, that works. Isn't that incredible? Is that amazing or what?

[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.700]
You know what? I don't know what thin vegetarian.

[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.260]
I don't know any vegetarians.

[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.820]
Well, back in the old days, like when I worked at K18, I used to do those horrible boring nutrition shows.

[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.020]
There was one guy who weighed about 80 pounds soaking wet.

[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.740]
Tossed real skinny. It looked like Icarbog crane on a bad day.

[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.220]
And this guy, he used to eat garlic by the pound and have garlic bread.

[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.040]
Oh, my God. You started getting it within 15 yards of this guy without like swooning.

[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.020]
And most of the real, you know, the fanatical nutritional people, that's what they're like.

[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.440]
You know, they stink. And the pita people stink too.

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.200]
As much as I love animals, especially dogs, the pita people should only rot.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.580]
There's a special place in hell for them, especially the ones that are like attacking the Oscar Meyer Wiener mobile.

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.220]
Right. Leave our Wieners alone. Okay. You idiots. You morons you and giving them that unhappy meals.

[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.760]
Oh, look at this. Israeli police discover carbon in northern Israel. It's not unusual.

[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.700]
Shopped. News alert. And what is this news alert business that all the new stations do?

[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.420]
If it's breaking news, then it's something new supposedly. But news alert just means

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.940]
it rehashing the same old crap we already know. Right. They are desperate.

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.060]
Anyway, here's our poll question today. And I got a lot of good stuff.

[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.340]
Let me first, should I give the website first? Oh, yeah. Oh, you got to.

[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.280]
The article I read yesterday by Tyrell Seal. And I have more of that.

[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.820]
It's a five-part series that think about the smoking gun, the 9-11 evidence that may hang towards the W. Bush.

[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.340]
It's a five-part series. And I'm going to read just a couple of short pages from that today.

[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.340]
Plus one other article about God is a is dig on commerce or something like that by some other authors.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.340]
But in any rate, the website is newsinsider.cjb.net.

[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.180]
And not only are her articles on there, but the news insider is great.

[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.400]
And there's some of the articles I'll tell you right now that are a little far out.

[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.380]
You'll say, oh, this is pretty far out, but nevertheless, you pick and choose and whatever you want to believe.

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.420]
That's fine. But at least it's a rather fresh air in terms of really.

[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.400]
And boy, you talk about well documented. She's got like a little bibliography at the bottom of her each article.

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.500]
You go, girl. Exactly. She knows her craft. Believe me.

[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.920]
Anyway, newsinsider.cjb.net. And you might want to check out that news insider website a lot,

[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.440]
because there are some really fascinating articles on it. Some interesting stuff. For people who are interested,

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.780]
I guess not the American Idol crowd, right? Well, no, I don't think that people who watch the American Idol

[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.860]
are going to be checking out the news insider website. But you never know.

[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.700]
There's Rome a little variety. And I'll mix it up a little bit.

[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.900]
Anyway, here's today's poll question, which has nothing to do with any of this stuff.

[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.320]
Which of these women do you most strongly think is a beard for gay celebrities?

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.580]
I don't know what prompted me to do this. I have no idea. Just, it just struck me.

[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.040]
Which of these women do you most strongly think is a beard, beard in quotes for gay celebrities?

[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.040]
J.Lo and a Cornett Kova, Brittany Spears. Now, the only reason I'm putting her on her is because of Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:03.520]
Lisa Marie Pressley, Brooke Shields, Janet Jackson, all of the above or none of the above.

[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.220]
Have we got all the bases covered there? I think so. I think we did.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.800]
And by the way, Gov. Jeterranger, they're going to make you pay for two seats on a plane.

[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.200]
Start eating like seaweed. 12 minutes after nine, the pita people are some of the worst.

[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.220]
They really are. Next to the God squad, the pita people are right in there.

[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.400]
In fact, you know something to them, it is a religion.

[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.200]
I know. That whole thing about don't eat no animals.

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.120]
I like a nice juicy steak.

[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.620]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.420]
And you know what I like even better than that? I give a feel.

[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.000]
Nice baby cow, feel. I love my feel. See we're back on that again.

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.940]
Remember the V lady?

[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.940]
The field chop. Oh yeah.

[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.640]
I might start taking calls again if she'd call.

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.460]
Not 12 minutes after nine at five, 50 WQYM.

[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.380]
And let me tell you again about how you get a high paid career going, being a computer professional.

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.140]
There's the jobs out there waiting for you.

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.180]
The question is, how do you find a good school and get you the skills to help you accomplish all of these things?

[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.660]
Well, there's only one school that's got four convenient locations all over Dayton, Broward, including their spiffy, new one in Kendall.

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.240]
There's one school that's got certified Microsoft instructors convenient day evening and weekend classes when it's convenient for you.

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.040]
There's one school that's got full-time job placement department over 30 years doing it.

[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:23.160]
And with this school, you can complete your program, get certified in four short months and start making serious cash instead of working in some dead end job like so many of you are doing right now.

[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.120]
That's school of course. You know, but let's say it all together, fast train.

[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.660]
We've been talking about fast train till it's coming out of my nose.

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.720]
So get off your butt, pick up the phone and call our friends at fast train today.

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.660]
Be sure and tell them that old Todd Dreck, Todd, I make it a lot of cash and I don't do a goddamn thing for it. Dreck.

[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.620]
1-866 fast train. That's 1-866 fast train or check them out on the web at fast train dot com.

[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.820]
My life and local 64205-60.

[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.620]
You way, you way.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.060]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.580]
At 560 WQAM, we just can't seem to get the morning show right.

[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:07.580]
So once again, we softly advise the power crackhead chicken hop consultant that we apologize for that too.

[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:15.120]
And now, 560 WQAM proudly presents the Mogen David show.

[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.720]
One and both.

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.660]
That's a good point.

[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.940]
You know who I am. Mogen David.

[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.220]
Yeah. That's good.

[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.940]
I forgot who I was.

[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.020]
Have you name again, Felgis?

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.840]
No, down the, the Duke and Colony, Kelby.

[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.200]
How did this year?

[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.540]
Locked.

[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.380]
Locked.

[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:35.900]
With a baker.

[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.260]
Two salty.

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.760]
Take it back.

[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.680]
I want fresh nova.

[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.360]
Get that out of here.

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.340]
And while you're out, get me coffee.

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.960]
I got the punch guard fold here for schoogeons.

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.320]
I get a freak cup.

[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.440]
Never. Wait a minute.

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.040]
I'm only supposed to talk about sports.

[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.980]
Have I ever tell you about the time I had lunch with Joe Peppaton?

[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.480]
No.

[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.460]
How about that hurricane shuffle board team?

[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.720]
They don't got that no more.

[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.380]
Since when?

[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.320]
Since they got rid of the rocket board shoes on Collins Avenue.

[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.140]
Well, it's a good thing I bought the Mogen rules.

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.980]
We'll see the cotton.

[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.220]
Yeah. Crackin' bands. Crackin' bands.

[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.400]
Yeah, now that I got ya crack-ready.

[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.140]
Bam!

[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.520]
What was that?

[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.120]
That I flipped my wigs.

[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.340]
It smells bad in here like toe-keys.

[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.920]
Now, somebody say we do a nice remote from the festival flea market.

[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.940]
Sounds good to me.

[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.320]
Yeah, they got a lot of nice benches, dude.

[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.920]
Okay, let's go.

[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.660]
Okay.

[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.240]
Very much in here.

[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.400]
I can use another vacation.

[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.180]
917-560 WQM.

[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.180]
Boy, Liz Taylor is going to run away with this and I was reluctant to put her on there, you know what?

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.340]
Huh?

[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.480]
I brought a release of a break.

[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.620]
I did too.

[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.240]
So we got two of those three votes.

[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.420]
He's got Liz Taylor's got seven.

[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.140]
The poll just went up there on eorodgers.com.

[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.300]
Liz Taylor's seven.

[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.140]
We're talking about Beards, Brooks Shields two.

[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.280]
In fact, I've woman and I saw her in Toronto that one day.

[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.040]
She had a nice beard.

[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]
I'm the one I'm talking about.

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.940]
So, Sam and Rusty, who also has a nice beard, I'm sure the people of Watch American Idol don't know who he is.

[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.960]
They probably think that's what you're having for us today.

[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.820]
Sam and Rusty.

[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.160]
Close.

[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.140]
But anyway, the Freedom from Religion Foundation quotes, has a quote from him on this blurb that you fact to me this morning.

[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:23.060]
Speaking of religion, speaking of the God Squad, he said, in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison and the blood.

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.040]
Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse.

[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.600]
It would go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion, the fashionable language of respect.

[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:37.160]
What is there to respect in any of this or in any of the crimes not being committed almost daily around the world in religion's dreaded name?

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.960]
Can't imagine why the Ayatollah was upset with him, can you?

[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:40.900]
No, why is it?

[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.020]
He put that fought law on him.

[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:42.460]
Right.

[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.980]
He's got to hit out on him.

[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.320]
See, he wouldn't have a fought wife. He'd just be vegetarian. That's what the Peter people would tell him.

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.480]
I had a fight one last night.

[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.360]
Did you really?

[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.480]
Druggy.

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.940]
Anyway, Saturday, October 6, 2001, in the Guardian.

[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.260]
Oh, a Brit paper in the Guardian.

[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.620]
Let's get back to life, Rusty.

[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.060]
I'm not going to read the whole thing. There's just one paragraph, one or two paragraphs.

[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.980]
I'm going to read.

[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.460]
Above the article, it's called, let's get back to life.

[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.200]
How do we defeat terrorism by embracing our everyday lives without fear, right, Sam and Rusty?

[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.360]
Rusty was had to balance his own security and feed him for more than a decade.

[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.820]
Since after the Ayatollah put that fought law on him since he didn't want to crazy about that book.

[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.840]
Anyway, in the midst of this, he says, terrorism is the murder of the innocent.

[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.000]
This time it was mass murder, meaning 9-11, to excuse such atrocity by blaming US government policies

[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.660]
to deny the basic idea of all morality that individuals are responsible for their actions.

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.780]
Furthermore, terrorism is not the pursuit of legitimate complaints by illegitimate means.

[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.200]
The terrorists ratchemself in the world's grievances to cloacist true motives.

[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.100]
Whatever the killers were trying to achieve, it seems improbable that building a better world was part of it.

[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.060]
The fundamentalist seeks to bring down a great deal more than buildings.

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.880]
Such people are against to offer just a brief list, freedom of speech, a multi-party political system, universal adult suffrage,

[00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:02.760]
accountable government, Jews, homosexuals, women's rights, pluralism, secularism, short skirts, dancing, beardlessness, evolution theory, and sex.

[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.240]
These are tyrants not Muslims.

[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.880]
Islam is tough on suicide. He says who are doomed to repeat their deaths through all eternity.

[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:15.520]
However, there needs to be a thorough examination by Muslims everywhere of why it is that the faith that they love

[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.260]
reads so many violent mutant strains.

[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.500]
If the West needs to understand its unibombers and McVeigh's, Islam needs to face up to which it's been loved.

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.420]
And it goes on at length in theoretical.

[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.700]
See, I was telling George before the show, instead of finding like specific websites for a lot of stuff,

[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.340]
if you just do a search, like do a search for Salman Rusty, which is what I did.

[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.980]
And you'll find all kinds of good crap.

[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.820]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.700]
I know what you're saying.

[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.140]
You want something good search for it. That's my motto.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.280]
And usually it pays off.

[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:47.000]
Anyway, so speaking of Cheryl Seal, like I said, the article that I read yesterday, which we had 80 million calls off the year and all around the place,

[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.880]
for people who don't know where they could find that.

[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.600]
Let me say it again, newsinsider.cjb.net, because that article first appeared in the news insider.

[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.700]
It's called Smoking Gun, the night 11 evidence that may hang George W. Bush.

[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.900]
And this is in the first part, just a couple more pages that I didn't get to yesterday.

[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.340]
I don't have time to read the whole thing, as I said, it's five parts.

[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.520]
Although, you know, something maybe I will.

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.940]
Maybe if the mood strikes.

[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.420]
Okay.

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.400]
And I'll tell you right now, I was wrong about our strike against Iraq.

[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.080]
9-11, that's pretty obvious, because Congress yet will get to that later.

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.500]
But they're going to vote on it in October, whether they're going to approve a resolution.

[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.740]
Although, you know, you still never know.

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.260]
And the other thing, too, is it's still down.

[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.260]
Even though it's September.

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.980]
It's early September, it's still like summertime, hotter in hell.

[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.580]
And one thing we don't want to do is fight a summertime more in the desert.

[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.120]
Anyway, she writes, Cheryl Seale, at the very least, Bush allowed 9-11 to happen.

[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.180]
But the evidence indicates his guild involves more than just a huge intentional sin of omission.

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.460]
And this now seems certain.

[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.160]
So it is ulcer form, ulcer form, meant to watch him, chaney, kind of leaves a rife in their PR army,

[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.600]
try to sell America yet another big lie, that they had no idea such a thing as 9-11 could happen.

[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.040]
They could never have imagined it in their wildest dreams.

[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.460]
They had no specific warnings.

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.620]
There was nothing unusual about the summer 2000-1 warnings, etc., etc., nauseam.

[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.220]
I've compiled some material that clearly shows that the above litany is blatantly, arrogantly false.

[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.380]
But first, let's hold a preliminary hearing in the court of common sense.

[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.420]
To see through a wall of propaganda, and determine what's really going on,

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.080]
one must tune out the spin completely and take a good objective, look at what has been done,

[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.960]
and what their parties involved have to gain by their actions.

[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.140]
Let's look at the well-documented facts.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.480]
First, when Bush writes in the other top rash mice, through his discarded the warning on August 2,

[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.740]
Bush has approval rating that sunk to just 49%, this is the red zone for a president.

[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.440]
Ask any political expert or a presidential historian, hit 45% and impeachment may soon loom on the horizon.

[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.700]
Second, Bush's actions throughout his entire life show a clear and consistent pattern.

[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.580]
Without exception, he's always chosen the path that will benefit himself and his corporate friends the most,

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.280]
and will do so in the face of even the most outraged criticism.

[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.920]
Third, the stolen election of 2000 proved that Bush was willing to participate in a very daring, very large-scale crime and pursuit of power.

[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.420]
Fourth, Bush's father approval ratings went from shaky to astronomical,

[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.100]
within a month of declaring war on an evil terrorist leader back in 1991.

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.640]
This lesson could hardly have been lost on Bush Jr.

[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.260]
Start a war on the emotions of the public can be whipped up to a point that will push presidential approval ratings way, way up.

[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.420]
So given the above fact as evidence, what do you imagine a self-serving man

[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.820]
who has faced no serious opposition from Congress, the press or the American public would be likely to do?

[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.820]
A book he would most certainly lay out that Bush would stand aside and allow an event like 9-11 to happen.

[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.660]
Another action that must be considered in the cold hard light of day is Bush's behavior after 9-11.

[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.780]
He seized upon national fears, worked at intensifying them, and immediately without waiting for Congress or serious discussions with other nations,

[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.860]
called for an attack on Afghanistan and a global war on terrorism.

[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.620]
At the same time, he worked through John Ascroft with stunning swiftness to dismantle civil liberties.

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:51.880]
These are not the actions of a leader who wants to keep his nation calm, reassured and standing tallens, principles and the weight of tragedy.

[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:58.700]
These are the actions of an opportunist who knows from watching his father's presidency that the window of opportunity for consolidating his power will be narrow.

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.940]
Bush Sr. approval rating high lasted only a few months.

[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.820]
Should I read that again? Bush Sr. approval rating high lasted only a few months.

[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.720]
Last, why would Bush admit to having been warned about 9-11 in the first place?

[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.580]
In the corporate and political world, this admission is a strategy that's been used over and over by creeps who are guilty of huge crimes and know the heat is on.

[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.840]
By confessing to a lesser charge, they try to draw the heat away from the main more dangerous issue.

[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.940]
Can lay the head of Anderson and every criminal who's ever copped or tried to cop a plea bargain have used this ploy?

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.780]
If Bush were innocent of any complicity in 9-11, why should he make any statement?

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:40.560]
It's always the guilty who feel the need to make statements that I am not a crook, I never had sex with that woman, or about how about that the role of tobacco industry CEOs who all swore that none of them knew that the product was harmful or addictive?

[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:47.740]
Therefore, based on the evidence, I would say we have a phony president who's guilty as hell who knows that someone has the goods on him and is breathing down his neck.

[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.340]
He's gambling that by making preemptive strikes while he still has control of the media, he can spend a protective wall against a round himself.

[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:02.300]
Thus, we have Dick Taney appearing on 5-19 on Meet the Press being interviewed about the 9-11 flat by his friend and neighbor Tim Russert.

[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:09.580]
Yep, that's right, both interviewer and interviewer we live in the futile exclusive Caroloma suburb of DC where houses started around $1 million.

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:17.320]
In fact, on the same program, Russert had the arrogance to even mention how he'd seen his buddy out taking the air in his new It Scooter, how cozy.

[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:26.260]
And this is what's being served American, the name of a free and honest press, you've got a problem, just pick a pal in the press corps and tell them what questions you want him or her to ask so he can spin them in just the way you want.

[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:33.620]
Russert asked Taney how he responded to charges that the information existed in several reports which showed that a World Trade Center type attack was a possibility.

[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:39.040]
Taney responded incredibly that reading all those reports weren't his concern, there were just too darn many of them.

[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.640]
Russert left his ridiculous response go totally unchallenged and unqualified.

[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.700]
Here are the questions that are missing, the questions a real journalist would have asked.

[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:54.700]
So then Mr. Taney, just what are your criteria for a report that's important enough for you to read, how do you prioritize what you read or what those undy were directed to call your attention,

[00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:00.640]
what reports on this matter did you read? It's insulting to America's intelligence that such questions are not being asked.

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.260]
It's like a grand jury that refuses to ask a murder suspect questions like wherever you on the night of such and such.

[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.600]
What was your relationship to the victim?

[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.760]
But instead says, well, here's what we heard from the police that someone thinks you may have killed someone. Go ahead and explain yourself. Don't worry.

[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:17.520]
We won't interrupt you or ask you any uncomfortable questions. And by the way, your good pal who lives down the block volunteered to serve as jury foreman.

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:27.480]
Here's one last fact to consider. The GOP spent $40 million to pursue an ultimately meritless case against Clinton that involved dealing an intern and some questionable real estate deals.

[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:44.600]
Since Bush took off, it's not one dime has been spent out by Congress to investigate chaining a secret energy dealings, bushes stolen election, Tom Delay's boiler room scams that have built doctors out of millions, the mysterious wild trading of American in the United Airlines stock the week before 9-11, or any of the other crimes that were far more serious than Clinton's offenses.

[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:57.920]
Meanwhile, the GOP, so we could have spent millions to investigate an office romance, has worked overtime to block the initiation of any serious investigation into the biggest crime to have ever been perpetrated on American soil that claimed nearly 3000 lives. Wake up America.

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.260]
So, you're all sealed.

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.180]

[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.080]
In CD stores now, Kiliots born sings Madonna.

[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.380]
Kiliots born.

[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:45.160]
I'm in love with a beautiful stranger.

[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.500]
Tell me love is in truth.

I'm a barf bag sold separately.

[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.540]
I'm living in a material world that I'm a material girl.

She do be the best of 10.

[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.600]
9.30 to 5.60 WQM.

[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.960]
Now this is from Roland Watson and Washington.

[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.680]
You just fags me?

[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.580]
Yes.

[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.460]
As the fact is, I can hear them purring in the background hot and heavy.

[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.180]
Bush has a word for it even if the dictionary doesn't.

[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.340]
He sure has a way with word, don't he?

[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:17.580]
No.

[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:26.460]
For a man untroubled by the need for linguistic purity, President Bush surpassed even himself yesterday as he sought to portray President Saddam Hussein as a scheme.

[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.480]
He was a very famous and evasive dictator.

[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.460]
Declarating that Saddam had crawfished out of previous agreements with the United Nations, Mr. Bush accused him of stiffing the world.

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:43.660]
In doing so, Mr. Bush appeared to have invented a word the verb to crawfish is unknown even to slang dictionaries, although it must derive from the crawfish or crayfish or freshwater crustacean.

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:51.220]
According to linguistic experts, such evocative use of the word is a verb has grown in recent years in the US to describe someone who backs out of a position.

[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.420]
Asked about the President's use of the word Erie Fleischer as spokesman, referred to broken Iraqi commitments to the Sarm adding,

[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.960]
this is what Saddam Hussein has tried his best to slither out of as President put it to crawfish out of.

[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:09.880]
Mr. Bush went on to say that he would use an address to the United Nations General Assembly next week to call upon the world to recognize that he is stiffing the world.

[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.320]
In this context, the President mentioned he or duping the world and America who has been short-change would complain that the vernacular of being stiffed.

[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:25.120]
But it may be wise for Mr. Bush to rethink his choice of words before he addresses the United Nations in New York on September 12th, apart from threatening to plunge the simultaneous translators into meltdown,

[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:34.240]
such language feeds the image overseas of Mr. Bush as a hopelessly inarticulate, trigger happy cowboy, one that Tony Blair was at pains to say this week he regards as a parody.

[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:41.420]
But it's not the first time that Mr. Bush is very divebrows with his home spun choice of words to articulate pivotal moments in his presidency.

[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:54.300]
In the days after 9.11 Mr. Bush referred to those 19 hijackers as those folks when talking of al Qaeda he promised to smoke him out and in his most famous laps into folks he read a record he demanded Osama bin Laden dead or alive,

[00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.200]
which we don't even know if he's dead or alive much less have him dead or alive but nevertheless he sure has a way with words don't he?

[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.620]
He's a real, he's a, he's a, let me just, let me just say this to you. You know I'm thinking during the break.

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:16.100]
So Congress is going to vote in October, pass a resolution to give him authority to go ahead and shoot up Iraq and go after Saddam and the evil adorage.

[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:27.020]
Now once you election, November, I'm my birthday, he's you remember November 5th, well if they pass a resolution saying early October, I'm just thinking out loud, you know what I'm saying?

[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:32.760]
I don't want to say that they would, you know, exploit that situation and invade just before the midterm elections.

[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.260]
I think it could backfire.

[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:43.760]
You think so? I think so. You think that the public is really all that bright? Not bright, it's just that nobody really understands why we need to go do that.

[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:51.980]
Oh by the way, Lynn Samuels, I forgot, you know, Boker came in last week and he said to me, Lynn Samuels is just obsessed with you, which we already know that.

[00:26:52.300 --> 00:27:00.000]
You know Lynn Samuels from WABC, the Fox your lady. Yes. And she just backs this and it says, it's, I don't know why she addresses it to Boker Brian,

[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.240]
but she's also obsessed with him. She thinks he's here and he hangs out here. You know how, you know how screw in is obsessed with Mozeback? Well, Lynn is obsessed with the Boker's ball spots.

[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.660]
So don't wear that bad hairpiece, Boker. If you want like anymore, we refer to that ball spot as his head.

[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.880]
He says does Neil know about WWW dot obscure store, dot common as a really good story. I know he would love my side is not fancy.

[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.540]
WWW Lynn Samuels dot com. Okay, thank you, Lynn. I got those right over here.

[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.040]
See, I think what I'm going to start doing because you know, a lot of the stuff you find in New York, well, New York Times got pretty good story.

[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:40.500]
That's not a good example. New York Post, Boston, Harold, Globe and got good stuff. But a lot of this stuff is kind of pedestrian. You know what I mean? I know you mean.

[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:46.700]
But stuff like the Cheryl, whatever her name is. What is her name? I had it here a second ago.

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.300]
It's the one with the seal. Cheryl sealed it with the just flap your arms and make like a seal. Boy.

[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.300]
Let's see. Here's the book on the article shockingly bush wanted to stop the publishing of the book.

[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.340]
Oh, look at that. Break down how America's intelligence failures like this September 11th by Bill Gerts.

[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.840]
They wanted to stop the publishing of it. Well, that's great. I'm going to go out and pick it up today at the world's largest bookstore right here downtown.

[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.140]
Oh, yeah. Got the Alonso story. Thank you very much. What do you know something we need about 10 hours today?

[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.460]
I know. We need about 10 hours. Here's the editorial today's Palm Beach Post. I've said you something.

[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:45.120]
I used to make fun of that paper public because it's a Cox paper. We used to work for Cox and the other by the assholes, but nevertheless Palm Beach Post has got some pretty interesting stuff, including stuff you won't find in the

[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:51.540]
book from Hugh Hefner. Governor Bush's mistake in choice to become secretary of the Department of Children and Families came under criticism for

[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:59.160]
among many other things, having his name on writings that chastised women who work outside the home. The 11 female GOP House members, none of whom works at

[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:06.280]
politics from home, signed a letter in which they called news reports of Mr. Regier's record debatable and said he should have the chance to run the agency that under

[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:16.160]
Governor Bush has gone from troubled to dysfunctional representative Sandra Merman, Republican of Tampa, chairs a committee created to investigate DCF, made it a point to say that the governor had not asked

[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:23.720]
them to send the letter, so did the governor. They said it makes you believe that he did either way representative Merman would have more credibility if for recent actions had

[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:31.420]
shown that like the governor, she puts politics first in may representative Merman, praise the panel of governor Bush, stack with political allies to give him cover after the

[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:38.280]
William Wilson story broke representative Merman made no serious public criticism of former DCF secretary Kathleen Kearney, even though Mrs.

[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:45.180]
Kearney's knee jerk policy of removing children from home is created a crunch in foster care representative Merman at first claimed the governor Bush had

[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:58.180]
provided all the new money to DCF. In fact, most of it came from the federal government unable to erase Mr. Regier's record Republicans are trying to spin it. This attempt failed. Editorial in the Palm Beach Post today, short sweet to the point.

[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:28.160]
I'm getting more excited about what's his name Bill. What's his name? Oh Riley. No, our candidate for governor Bill. What is it? Make bride. Say it again real something. I know what it was. I think he's, you know, what the best thing he's got going for him. He's not Janet. He's not yet Bush. Oh, well, that's it. Yeah. And he's not Janet. And I think we're both right. He's not Janet and he's not yet. Bush. Both of those things were heavily.

[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:03.040]
Have a yellow light, fly back high, something they can't survive

[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:13.180]
That's why, we have a yellow light, a big light, every time damn case of you are free

[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:19.540]
We have a yellow light, something they can't survive

[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:28.700]
That's why, we have a yellow light, a big light, every time damn case of you are free

[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.780]
I'm just making a wild guess, if I offered to give you a million dollars in cash and small bills

[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.760]
Could you tell me under what light we are today?

[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.540]
Especially since it's only like six days before the anniversary of 9-11

[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.420]
Does anybody out there know what light we're under?

[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.420]
No, Tom Reidge, he ain't doing too much today

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.580]
I thought that was going to be like on the crawl

[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.180]
Or you know how you have the station logo in the corner of every channel

[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.340]
That's right, and along with the temperature and the albacurky and the other stuff they put on the crawl on the bottom

[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.500]
And I want to say today is an amber light there, and then it can't put amber light because amber is with the missing key

[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.520]
I think it's got a little light in one of the corners, like the other one

[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.260]
That's right, just show us the color of it

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.140]
And for those of you who are colorblind, tough luck, just get out of the bed

[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.680]
So somebody at WL, one of our chronic factors, gives me answers to both questions

[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.240]
Sergeant Traver Rang with George Montgomery, and you are absolutely correct, boy, I'll tell you

[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.500]
It seems like just yesterday, it was 1972, it's 30 years ago this year

[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.980]
72, and Willie Horton with the baseball player, so you wouldn't know that because you're a hard-ass anti-sports player

[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.460]
Willie Horton of the Detroit Tigers, right fielder, ask her any hard-well health, I remember the Willie Horton days

[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.260]
Because I'm an old fart, and I'm proud of it

[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:33.640]
Yeah, Willie Horton was the guy that got out under jail, or on the early parole, ax murderer, and then butchered up a whole family or something

[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.460]
And the dookas, and then once that came out, the Republicans just hung their mind and said like a noose

[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:45.020]
I remember the debate with him in Bush 1, and he said, well, I'm against capital punishment, but I'm tough on crime, and they were all snickering and snickering

[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.620]
They were kind of niggeredly

[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.680]
Anyway, Rich Pacti, you know, you're a good guy, Rich, and I appreciate this article. Did you see how small the print is in this article?

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.660]
No, it looks just like lines

[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.780]
And he's also, tell Eric to put the link on Cheryl's seal on your site

[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.240]
There's no e on the end of seal, by the way, Rich, I don't want to correct you

[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.520]
You know, you're a great guy, Rich, and you send us a lot of good stuff, and the Vokabrine can't stay

[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.580]
Who is it? A Paul Harby Jr. can't stand you, whatever

[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.840]
And Vokabrine's a little pissed off too, with that restitution song, I'd like to keep giving him

[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.960]
But at any rate, he also says, and today's here old this article, which I'm going to tell you, I'm going to try to read this

[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.900]
You know how when you go to the eye doctor for your annual eye exam, or however often you go, when you get to be old like me, and you dive

[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:31.580]
Beto-Key, go over here, and I mean, if I can read this, I've got to be one amazing old fart, I'll say that right now

[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.900]
If the audience could see the print, how does this happen, by the way?

[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.900]
You know what I'm saying? Because I print stuff out from the hero all the time

[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.900]
Don't know

[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.800]
How does Rich Pacti's computer print something out that's so small?

[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.240]
You follow?

[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.820]
Maybe it's just the printing, maybe it's a little thrifty, you know what I'm saying? Or an aka Jewish

[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.280]
And he wants to save on paper, on fax paper, so he's got everything like scrunched way down on his printing setup

[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.680]
Anyway, I'll give him my best shot, and we already told Eric, by the way, to put the share I'll see your link on there

[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.240]
What's the name of that thing?

[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.060]
I have a mental block on that damn website, God damn it

[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.060]
NewsInthiter.cjb

[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:18.060]
NewsInside.cjb.net

[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.600]
Chany on Qualified to Champion War on Iraq

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.860]
I got to get to my thing about Canadian Senate panel urges the legalization of POT

[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:31.040]
Isn't it strange that it seems that where I have these studios in Amsterdam and now where Canada is on the Virgilegalizing pod

[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.780]
Isn't that a strange coincidence when I don't even smoke it? That is

[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.800]
Seems like kind of a waste, isn't it? I think that often

[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.760]
Maybe we ought to like just bring you up here and send me back down there and send you to Amsterdam

[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.000]
Okay, no, I just said maybe

[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.680]
Chany on Qualified to Champion War on Iraq

[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.720]
I'm just trying to brave up to see if I can read this

[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.600]
Austin, Texas, excuse me, I don't want to be tacky or anything

[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.360]
Now who wrote this? Oh Molly Ivens, great from Texas

[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.260]
One of the Bush nematies, excuse me, I don't want to be tacky or anything

[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:06.560]
But it hasn't had occurred to anyone in Washington that sending Vice President Dick Chany out to champion and invasion of Iraq on the grounds that said

[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.940]
I'm saying is a murderous dictator is somewhere between bad taste and flaming hypocrisy

[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.600]
I can't believe I'm reading this seriously I wish everybody in the audience could see the size of this print

[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.980]
And you don't even have your Magnivision reading lenses

[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.820]
Not yet

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:26.880]
When Chany was CEO of the old Fuddy Daddy firm Halib, see I can't read it

[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.640]
The oil field

[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.420]
What? Oil field supply firm

[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.080]
What page is this on?

[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.020]
Because I can during the next break I can download it myself and it's not going to be print like this

[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.620]
This is unacceptable

[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.160]
It's in today's Harold, it's the Molly Ivens guy

[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.020]
So must be on the op-ed page, right?

[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.180]
Yeah, yeah

[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.780]
Because this is just too much, I mean I got through the first sentence and I'm very pleased about that

[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.520]
But it's just too much of it, you know as bad as I bumble and fumble through much of this stuff

[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.620]
Because when you're reading stuff for four hours time, Jika, it's not easy to do it without bumbling and fumbling and stumbling

[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.220]
You know what I'm saying Tom? Little Tommy?

[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.940]
Now that I'm not carving on the South Florida scene and about how the driving sucks and the humidity is bad and it rains like crazy every day

[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.240]
You know what I'm talking about, little Tommy?

[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.300]
Who still hasn't discovered that there was a goddamn reading book in the spring

[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.840]
He's kind of like, he's kind of like Greg Reed with your broad bonus

[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.280]
He's like ten days late and fifty dollars short

[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.620]
That's a little Tommy Jika

[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.860]
So just ignore it, you know, the fact that there was a story there and probably current didn't send this stuff anyway

[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.860]
Because the sports shows are rating sucked anyway

[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.560]
Long me fifty dollars

[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:24.820]
Right

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.080]
And so they don't have it, him or Kevin Basterd

[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.820]
Because I'm sure Kevin Basterd had the information

[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:37.020]
And the only reason that Jika should feel compelled, the spirit of somebody should compel him to write it because he was the doubting Thomas

[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.260]
Oh well, Rogers is biggest challenge, yeah but

[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.340]
I still have that article over here as well

[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.560]
Yeah, he's going to write another column about how wrong he was

[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.000]
Yeah, well at least I can talk about how wrong he was, all the guy at damn time

[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.800]
I have the column in his hand right now with Tom's fat face in it

[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.240]
Probably too many free meals up there in a guy named press box at Calder

[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.140]
Let's see, WQM will be coming bro

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.920]
And Boba is talking about the moron show

[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.160]
Moving to 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. not only out of the market but out of the country

[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.700]
Rogers has successfully reinvented himself several times but his latest reincarnation might be his greatest challenge

[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.320]
He'll be getting Boba Boba Boba

[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.980]
By essentially acting as the voice of his audience

[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.520]
Completing about South Florida's weather and traffic, his neighbors, his merchants, his doctors and co-workers

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.060]
Most of that will be lost within thousands of miles away

[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.140]
Let me ask you this, I was there for a week last week doing the show every day

[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.760]
What was the difference other than my fat push was there?

[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.640]
What was the difference? The difference to what?

[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.980]
Yeah, I'll tell you what the difference was Thursday morning we didn't have the internet

[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.760]
There you go

[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.800]
Yeah, have I ever lost the internet here or an Amsterdam for one minute?

[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.280]
No

[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.860]
No, by the way it wasn't Thursday morning

[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.920]
When was it? It was Thursday

[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.600]
Day

[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.460]
Oh, that's right, Thursday the whole day

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.660]
I stand corrected

[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.840]
An entire day thanks to our good close personal friends at Bell South who suck the big one and I don't care if our buddy Jeff is listening or not

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.440]
You guys suck the big one Jeff, we like you about we think

[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.960]
But your company blows

[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.860]
I have Bell St. Patico here no problem at all, no sweat every day it's right there

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.860]
Want to click out of something and it's there immediately

[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.360]
It's there like lightning like grease-trick and lightning

[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.860]
The only thing that ever slows it down like everybody else is that guy named Span

[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.320]
Which I have an article on that later

[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.600]
Come to find out that the people are claiming to like eliminate Span

[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.100]
Yeah, they're spanning

[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.540]
Rogers argues you can keep up with South Florida via the internet and the fact that the local newspapers

[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.280]
But it's difficult to get an accurate fix on the mood of a community at second-hand

[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.640]
Broke Tommy Jicca

[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.320]
Right

[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.080]
In the two weeks he's been in Toronto this is way back when what was the day of this piece?

[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.060]
This piece of crap

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.700]
Do you have any idea?

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:41.380]
No

[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.480]
Well obviously it was back in the middle of March after I've been here doing two weeks

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.660]
Rogers program has changed in noticeable ways he spans in a northern amount of time

[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.600]
Which previously might have been devoted to carving about the local scene

[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.900]
Reading newspaper magazine articles like this one again Tom

[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.720]
Also is producer and Phil Ingewood Rodriguez has become almost an equal partner in the broadcast

[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.440]
Which is ludicrous

[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.500]
You don't speak one word more now than you ever did before not one

[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.120]
Not one word

[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.460]
Maybe Rogers is priming and this is got to be

[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.400]
I mean all the idiotic things I've read in this South Florida Sun Center

[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.620]
For the Florida day whatever the hell it is that that rag

[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.340]
Maybe Rogers is priming the pump ever on regas do the show

[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:28.280]
With him calling in is the whim takes him crazy that's the norm at WQA

[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.060]
And what you that last part is right it is crazy

[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.880]
It's beyond crazy the station

[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.020]
But I'm just gonna I'm gonna take that paycheck they're gonna keep sending me those paychecks

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.920]
And I'm just gonna call in every now and then when I feel like it let George do the show

[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.720]
Is that what you're talking about?

[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.900]
You idiot you cymbal and you bald headed geek

[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.620]
God is he and then then when he could be the first rating book the entire book

[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.420]
The entire spring book I was out of town except for like the two weeks that came back

[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.060]
One week in April one week in June and we still kicked out on this show

[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.440]
And it's about the fact the rest of the station was in the crapper that happens you know

[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.500]
We can understand parts of it

[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.980]
But this Tom right one single word to correct his error no because that would make him look back you know

[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.840]
So we just assume that the people who listen to this show they already know about it

[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.360]
Nobody else better find out that he made a glaring error

[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:18.240]
I mean wouldn't it be a lot more interesting for me to be sitting down there talking to a bunch of morons

[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.920]
They it is a douchebag and talking about how the drivers suck you know I mean

[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.220]
After 26 and a half years Tom what is there luck for me to say about the South Florida scene

[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.480]
And as far as missing the pulse of it I was there for a week I kept searching for a pulse I couldn't find one

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.500]
I couldn't find one

[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.320]
I can walk outside here I can go out on a young street

[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.500]
Which by the way is the longest street in the world you know that you told me that

[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.700]
And I can go out and win when 10 seconds no I take that back

[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.120]
I can walk I can get on the elevator and go down in lobby of my building

[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.200]
I take that back I can put on the monitor here

[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.520]
No this year I can sit right here

[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.920]
In fact let me turn it on right now

[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.940]
There's the door there's the door in my building

[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.420]
The inner door okay and there here's the security camera

[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.660]
Look at that there's a guy right there who's under the age of 100

[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.020]
Pretty ugly but nevertheless I have a few ugly people in the building that's why I'm here

[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.500]
In 10 seconds I'll find more living and breathing people than I will in that whole week that I was in South Florida

[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.080]
How many times have we done that test where I tell you you're in your car driving on 95 or on 75 or on a turn bike

[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.300]
And just look to your left and look to your right look around you

[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.080]
Does anybody under the age of 100 or anybody who doesn't look like they just crawled off a banana boat?

[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.680]
Very rarely very rarely and then of course you get in Vade County

[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.040]
Any white people around? No no

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.660]
I mean not that that's bad

[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.980]
You know I mean not everybody can live in places like

[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.400]
It might come to be have no knee growth

[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.580]
We got a lot of sparks right just one of those things

[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.640]
9 feet in Mimol I said otherwise you'd have no callers

[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.500]
9.50 well how come my clock over here on the web page says 9.27

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.820]
This is going to be a long show if Eric says 9.56 on 9.

[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.280]
On the web page?

[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:04.120]
Mine says 9.27.45 on the home page on your Niels page

[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.760]
Wow

[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.980]
9.56 at 5.60 WQM mattress shopping I've been telling you about this for a few years now

[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.760]
And I'm right this is one thing you can debate anything else I tell you

[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.360]
You got to be full of crap to go out there and shop for a mattress in your car why are you doing that?

[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.280]
Because first of all you're going to waste a lot of gas a lot of time

[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.660]
You're going to help to pay for some big fancy fancy stores overhead by help pay them for their rent

[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.980]
But if you call down a mattress who doesn't have that big overhead you're going to get yourself the best deal all the way around

[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.920]
Just call 1-800 mattress you'll be immediately if not sooner connected to an expert betting consultant

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.680]
Who's only job is tokyup with the best brand name mattress and unbeatable price they're not selling lamps one day

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.980]
And so for the next and then maybe mattress is once in a while and believe you me they know their stuff

[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.960]
They'll hook you up with exactly what you like to sleep on and the top brands in the world they got them all

[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.580]
They got Serta, Seely, Simmons, Kingcoyle they got kings they got queens they got twins they got whatever you want

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:59.360]
And when you call that number you pick the day into our window any day seven days wait for delivery when it's convenient for you when you're going to be there anyway

[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.220]

[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.300]
We are supporting you on 5-60-Q-A-M

[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.600]
W-Q-A-M

[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.980]
Hello this is Albert Gendelierro

[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.540]
For years I've been shopping in the Husky section if you know what I mean

[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.800]
I was born 14 pounds six ounces and I've been growing ever since

[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.800]
Okay?

[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.340]
I'm 5'8'' anyway you want to measure me

[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.360]
But I am not alone

[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.720]
And now me and my fellow horizontally challenged people are facing our biggest crisis to date

[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.660]
No Wendy's is not canceling a 99 cent menu

[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:11.540]
I'm talking about the airline and just be now at the charges for two seats

[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.340]
That's why I started practice

[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.940]
Forget about two seats

[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.780]
Here's a deal

[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.620]
If I'm gonna pay for two seats I want two of everything

[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:28.420]
Two movies, two meals, two of them sky more catalogs and especially two bags of peanuts

[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.920]
And this is not negotiable

[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.200]
If I'm the man cannot be met

[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.380]
Me and my fellow men of birth will start reserving all the IOC

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.100]
So you're regular people, not being able to get it in hell if you want

[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.520]
So if you are exceptionally large join me in my fight

[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.280]
Pick up four of our brochures with a picture of our celebrity spokesperson John Gellie's final cover

[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.860]
You can get him any of Mario's big and tall stories

[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.520]
Because don't forget all men will create equal

[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.100]
Even if the width of the bus worth, thank you for your support

[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:01.640]
You're welcome

[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.440]
Hey the Peter people are gonna be really pissed with you, better go vegetarian

[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.040]
It's 10.1.5.60.12

[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.560]
But that's what I just did

[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.260]
Fardy?

[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.620]
And beside that I printed out this story from the Harold Molly Ivens column today in the op-ed page and guess what?

[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.560]
It's nice, big, pretty, looks beautiful just like all the other stuff I print out

[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.940]
So now you can read Haliburton

[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.860]
Hey Rich, you better get with it baby

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.320]
Let's see, which of these women you most strongly think is a beard for gay celebrities?

[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.820]
I guess all of the above is gonna be the crank vote because that wasn't getting anything and all of a sudden it's got 23

[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.340]
Elizabeth Taylor 23

[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.960]
Lisa Marie Pressley 13

[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.420]
None of the above 10

[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.620]
Britney Spears 8

[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.200]
Anna Cornelhoia 8

[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.360]
Brooke Shield 6

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.340]
Janet Jackson 2

[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.420]
And JLo has got none which I find that highly amusing

[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.880]
I mean to me she, I didn't vote for her but she's certainly one of the most suspect

[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.960]
Since her first husband turned out to be a gay dancer or something like that

[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.960]
And then her second husband was a peed diddly

[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.340]
And then she, the third marriage lasted about about a week and a half

[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:56.580]
Right?

[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.060]
I just, you know, I could be wrong about that

[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.680]
Anyway, Cheney, see I'm still not gonna get to my pot story here but I'll get to it

[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.280]
And then we got the monk thing and Cheney won't release energy papers

[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.920]
We need a 20 hour show, okay?

[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.280]
But I'm sure that our entire audience who was busy watching American Idol last night

[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.500]
I'm sure they wrote all of this stuff

[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.320]
I'm sure they were well informed

[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.820]
They're probably being Tom Jikers column

[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.260]
You know what Tom's writing about today?

[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.040]
I give up

[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.600]
Well, it's not really an article, it's the cooking show schedule

[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.780]
I'm serious, I want you to go right now on a Sunsendle website, seriously

[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.240]
Okay, click it up, you on it?

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.220]
I'm getting there

[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.240]
Sunsendle

[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.480]
And then on the left hand side where you're like scrolling the menu

[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:38.980]
You got it?

[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:39.920]
I'm getting there

[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.720]
Jesus, is that thing slower?

[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.620]
What? I have to answer

[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:43.980]
You got it?

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.460]
All right, wait, something's sentinel, do you want me to spell it for you?

[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.360]
I'm the left hand side where it says loading

[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.860]
Where it says columns?

[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.560]
What do you mean it's loading?

[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.080]
I'm connecting the hose, looking up hose

[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.120]
Oh, come on

[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.840]
You see what I mean about Bell South?

[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.800]
A few people, if I click that out right here, it's on there within a half a second

[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.740]
Like it should be on a real computer, you know what I'm saying?

[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.600]
Okay, it's on the real high speed internet connection

[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.540]
On the left hand side where it says channels?

[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.460]
Columns, columns, not channels, columns, COL, UMNS, columns

[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.600]
Am I going too fast for you?

[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.580]
No, I just don't see that

[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.420]
Okay, I'll get on it with you, okay?

[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.500]
Okay, let's do it together

[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.900]
Let me swing the mic over here by my LSE

[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.400]
SunSentinel.com, I just clicked it on my LSE, and there it is!

[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.160]
How long does that take about a quarter of a second?

[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:31.640]
Yeah

[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.940]
On the left hand side it says news, okay?

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.460]
You got that?

[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:34.820]
Yeah

[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.620]
South Florida, nation, world, Cuba, columns, columns

[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:42.860]
Have you got it?

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:43.540]
Nope

[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.840]
It's in the channel's list, he says

[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.180]
Okay, there it is

[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.020]
You want to have a different menu than I got

[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:51.580]
How is that?

[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.840]
Well anyway, if you got some central columnist

[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.080]
I got news, columns, okay?

[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.000]
Features, columnist, Tom Jicca, TV and radio, click that on

[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:00.980]
Okay?

[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.440]
I'm finding it

[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.140]
Oh, this is just unbelievable!

[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.500]
I'm never coming back, I'm not coming back to a new neck I'm serious!

[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.220]
I'm not coming back to this new video

[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.340]
Okay, and what does the first one say today?

[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.480]
September 5th, 2002, what does it say?

[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.480]
What does it say?

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.840]
It says TV cooking shows schedule

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.440]
Absolutely correct sir!

[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.940]
And this is a guy who's writing about how I'm

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.680]
Lost touch with a South Florida scene?

[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.080]
I thought you were lying!

[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.380]
Now let me say this to you, Tom, because I don't have the physical paper myself

[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.720]
But it would seem to me that if this is the guy who's the TV radio writer for the Sun Sentinel

[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.280]
What should he be writing about today?

[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.280]
What every other TV person in North America, not just America, but including up here in Canada

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.200]
What they all wrote about today and what was that?

[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.840]
American freaking idol last night in the winner and the two-hour blowjob

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.860]
And that whole thing, you know?

[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.440]
By the way, since I also thought you were kidding about his new picture

[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.740]
Oh! He blew up like a bullfrog!

[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.360]
Twice the size of the old picture and he read it, read in the face

[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.100]
Exactly!

[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.120]
So, I mean, if you want to find out about the cooking shows, there's what Tom's got for you

[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.460]
What he should be writing about was that Fox show last night American Idol!

[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:13.780]
That was a two-hour blowjob

[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:14.760]
Well, beside that!

[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.440]
And he doesn't have it.

[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.200]
Now I could be wrong!

[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.960]
In fact, maybe you'll want to get the Sun Sentinel, maybe somebody there in the building will bring it to you

[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.000]
The lifestyle, entertain whatever they call it, lively parts

[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.120]
Because I could be wrong, maybe he did, right?

[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.520]
But if he did, it's not on a website, which anyway, what today's lifestyles?

[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.120]
I have that

[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:31.920]
You got it?

[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:32.460]
Yeah

[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.140]
Is there a column in there about American Idol?

[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.380]
How about Eric Idol?

[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.940]
How about idling the engine?

[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.400]
Which is what we're doing here now, and starting to piss everybody off and fling the audience up here

[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.020]
No, nothing!

[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.220]
Nice go on, little Tommy!

[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.360]
But I sure am very concerned about the TV cooking schedule

[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.940]
Cheney unqualified a champion war on Iraq rights Texas is Molly Iverns today

[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.980]
Austin, Texas, excuse me, I don't want to be tacky or anything

[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:02.660]
But hasn't it occurred to anyone in Washington that sending Vice President Dick Cheney out to champion an invasion of Iraq on the grounds

[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:07.200]
That Saddam Hussein is a murderous dictator, as somewhere between bad taste and flaming hypocrisy

[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.680]
When Cheney was CEO of the World Field Supply from Haliburton, the company did $23.8 million in business with Hussein

[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.060]
The evil duo are prepared to share his weapons of mass destruction with terrorists

[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.920]
So let's who's saying is the world's worst leader, how come Cheney sold him the equipment to get his dilapidated oil fields up and running

[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.980]
So we could afford to build weapons of mass destruction

[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.200]
In 1998, the United Nations passed a resolution allowing Iraq to buy spare parts for its oil fields

[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:36.300]
But other sanctions remained in place and the U.S. is consistently pressured the UN to stop exports of medicine

[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.200]
And other needed supplies in the grounds that they could have dual use

[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:46.720]
As the former secretary of defense under President Bush the Elder, Cheney was a particularly vulnerable position on the hypocrisy of doing business with Iraq

[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:53.040]
Although in 1991 after the Gulf War he told a group of oil industry executives that he was emphatically against trying to topple Hussein

[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:59.720]
Using two subsidiaries, Dresser Rand and Ingersoll Dresser, Haliburton helped rebuild Hussein's war-damaged oil fields

[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:05.560]
The combined value of these contracts for parts and equipment was greater than that of any other American company doing business with Iraq

[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.740]
Companies included Schlumberjø, Flosser, Fisher Rosemount, General Electric

[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:16.820]
They acted through foreign subsidiaries or associated companies in France, Belgium, Germany, India, Switzerland, Bahrain, Egypt and the Netherlands

[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:23.180]
In several cases it's clear that the European companies did no more than loan their names to American firms for the purpose of dealing with Hussein

[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.760]
Iraq then became America's second largest Middle Eastern oil supplier

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.020]
The story was initially reported by the financial times of London more than two years ago

[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.640]
And since it's been more extensively reported in the European press

[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.860]
But as we've seen in the case of Harkin Energy and many other stories

[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.920]
There's a difference between a story having been reported and having attention paid to it

[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.920]
A distinction many journalists have trouble with

[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:50.640]
Thus the administration was able to dismiss the new information on shady dealings at Harkin as old news because not much attention was ever paid when the old news was new

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.440]
When Cheney left Haliburton he received a $34 million severance package

[00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:02.260]
Despite the fact that the single biggest deal of his five-year career there, the acquisition of Dresser Industries, turned out to be a huge blunder

[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.740]
Because the company came settled with us bestest liability

[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.060]
On the campaign trail Cheney often claimed that he'd been out in the private sector creating jobs

[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.380]
The first thing he did after the Dresser merger was lay off 10,000 people

[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:18.640]
Haliburton America's number one oil services company is the nation's fifth largest military contractor

[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.060]
And the biggest non-union employer in the U.S.

[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.700]
It employs more than a hundred thousand workers worldwide and does more than $15 billion a year

[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:30.420]
Haliburton under Cheney dealt with several brutal dictatorships including the despicable government of Burma

[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.980]
The company also played questionable roles in Algeria and Gola, Bosnia, Croatia, Haiti, Somalia and Indonesia

[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.220]
Haliburton also had dealings with Iran and Libya both on the State Department's list of terrorist states

[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:51.840]
Haliburton subsidiary Brown & Ruth, the old Texas construction firm that does much business with U.S. military, was fined $3.8 million for re-exporting goods to Libya in violation of U.S. sanctions

[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:59.180]
If you want to know why the Democrats didn't jump all over this story and make a big deal out of it, it's because as usual, Democrats are involved in similar dealings

[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:07.180]
Former CIA director John Doitch is on the board of Schlumberjé, the second largest oil services firm after Haliburton, which is also doing business with Iraq through subsidiaries

[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.580]
Americans have long been aware that corporate money is consistently corrupted domestic policy in favor of corporate interest

[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.920]
And that both parties are enthralled a huge corporate campaign donors

[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.060]
We are less accustomed to connecting the dots when it comes to foreign policy

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:25.260]
But there is no more evidence that corporations pay attention waiting other than profits in their foreign dealings than they do in their domestic deals

[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:33.320]
And Ron, as usual, provides some textbook examples of just how in different human rights American companies can be, Haliburton's dealings in Nigeria, would I say that right?

[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:39.080]
In partnership with Shell and Chevron, provide another such example, including gross human rights violations and environmental abuses

[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.740]
No one is ever going to argue that Hussein is a good guy, but Cheney is not the right man to make the case against him

[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:48.560]
I've never understood why the Washington Press Corps can't remember anything for longer than 10 minutes

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.660]
But hearing Cheney denounce who's saying is truly, give us a break time

[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.640]
Right, Molly Ivans, thank you Rich Pacta, because otherwise I wouldn't have seen the article

[00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:00.000]
And didn't I do myself a big service by printing it out like in print that somebody could read with a human eye?

[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.160]
Yes, man

[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.400]
I'm serious, you saw the side of that print?

[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.940]
There are ants, or at least there used to be before Steve came

[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.500]
There used to be ants in my kitchen that were bigger than that print

[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.620]
Molly Ivans, no wonder she's the bane of the old bushmeister, you know?

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.260]
Anyway, Canadian Senate panel urges legalization of pot

[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:20.960]
All right

[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.500]
A Canadian Senate committee recommended yesterday that marijuana be legalized

[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.460]
How do you like that?

[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:32.840]
Cannabis should be from here on legal and restricted use so that Canadians can choose whether to consume or not in security

[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.780]
So that Senator Pierre Claude Nolan, a progressive conservative party member from Quebec Province

[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:43.440]
He spoke at a news conference announcing the final report of the special committee on illegal drugs which he cheered

[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.860]
The government should give amnesty, wait till you hear this line, okay?

[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:47.980]
Okay, I'm waiting

[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.280]
We're talking about the Canadian government

[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:57.260]
The government should give amnesty to anyone convicted of marijuana possession under current or past legislation and erased their records, Nolan said

[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:57.940]
All right

[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.940]
How do you like that?

[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.040]
I like it a lot

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.700]
What do you hear any politician in America talking stuff like that?

[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.520]
I don't think so

[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:03.720]
No

[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.960]
Let's clone him

[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.560]
Domestic and international experts and Canadians from every walk of life told us loud and clear

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:14.780]
That we should not be imposing criminal records on users or on duly provading use personal use of cannabis Nolan said

[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.860]
The committees report will be considered by lawmakers

[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:23.760]
Evidence indicates that cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and undermines the idea that smoking pot leads to harder drugs the committee said

[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:32.020]
The report recommends the legal age for possession and consumption as 16 said Dave Newman committee spokesman will be regulated similar to the way alcohol is

[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.020]
16

[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:34.560]
Oh my god

[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:43.640]
Nolan said make no mistake we're not endorsing cannabis use for recreational consumption whether or not an individual uses marijuana should be a personal choice that is not subject to criminal penalties

[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.240]
But we've come to a conclusion that as a drug it should be regulated by the state much as we do for wine and beer

[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.420]
Hence our preference for legalization over decriminalization

[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.520]
Which legalization of course is a much greater step

[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.440]
Yes, the report says the appropriate level of THC and marijuana for recreation will be 13%

[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.000]
THC is the main act of component of cannabis as some of you might know by accident of course by doing research

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.380]
Many of the products illegally on the market now have a much higher THC level he said the committee also recommended a revision of the regulations regarding medicinal use of marijuana

[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:19.700]
Legalization would ultimately result in less recreational use of marijuana the panel believes it would also take a load off the criminal justice system and hurt organized crime

[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.600]
The report said gosh all of this makes so much goddamn sense

[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:33.140]
The panel also recommended that laws on driving out of the influence of alcohol drugs should be amended to lower permitted alcohol levels to 40 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millimetres of blood in the presence of other drugs

[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:40.260]
Especially but not exclusively cannabis and to admit evidence from expert police officers trained in detecting persons operating vehicles under the influence of drugs

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:47.200]
Senator Colin Kinney a liberal party member from Ottawa who's the panel's deputy chair said no one on the committee wants to see an increase in drug use

[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:55.440]
New and sedenations minister of justice will take a look at the report and determine whether the government wants to put on so just like a agenda and I bet you died because they do crispy cream that is

[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.500]
I need that

[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:03.240]
10-13, oh we got the right time on it and I was going to I think that happens automatically on mine or something

[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.800]
10-13 at 5-60 WQ-Y-M

[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.560]
Let me tell you about pizza lofts I'm excited news coming from our good close personal ponytail friend Jeff Cohen was in the studio was it Tuesday?

[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:20.980]
Yes, he was in there Tuesday feeding the troops and telling us that the brand new pizza loft in plantation will be opening he said seven to 10 days so any day now keep your eye peeled

[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.780]
Okay, that's what Marcy says over there Walgreens keep your eye peeled she'll have a look out on it for you

[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:32.680]
Pizza loft are still going strong in their regular brow location where the how long have they been in there now a couple years for 4-3-4-5-6-100

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:38.600]
And getting bigger and better all the time they're on university drive and the pizza loft plans to right be on pier when imports kitty corn

[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.200]
The armadillo cafe and of course between the 5-95 and Griffin Road that's a tough stretch by the way, you know yes?

[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.040]
So you want to maybe cop through in but you will find once you get there tons and tons of free parking waiting for it to pizza lofts

[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.720]

[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.120]
That was funny

[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.800]
Cheers

[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.960]
She's telling lies

[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.740]
And keeping fail

[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.460]
A thing she hopes that we believe

[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.720]
I hope all the students 20 years in fairs of business

[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.100]
Like a

[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.560]
Loose the

[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.180]
I ride

[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:30.400]
I hope all the students 20 years in fairs of business

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:31.720]
Are you sure?

[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:38.740]
But I'm sure that she somehow and doubt it leave will come

[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:52.420]
So much is lost up for chance inside a training cost a million but I'm so how she thinks

[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.260]
It's a big mistake

[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.460]
Sinking the life and her attitude

[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.800]
She's a nonsense dance

[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:08.840]
But she's a prudent through it all she just keeps making food

[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:15.300]
I hope all the students 20 years in fairs of business

[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.420]
Like a rough end

[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.000]
Loose the

[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:29.780]
I hope all the students 20 years in fairs of business

[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:38.060]
But I'm sure that she somehow and doubt it leave will come

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:46.240]
Can I teen it five six you guess what I find out that I'm back here boy a little slow on the uptick you know I give up what what they did

[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.800]
Because you don't like her that much

[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.400]
But you don't like her way she sings in English

[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.600]
I like her

[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.320]
Great

A lot

[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.580]
I think she's

[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:05.640]
She's

[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]
She really

You don't have to think you got out of there

[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.120]
So

[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:26.520]
Where

[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:47.940]
Okay, that's an upshick here. But she is she's great. Let's see that poll which of these women are you most the most what is it well see it just click again

[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:52.440]
Which of these women you most strong strong we think is a beard for gay celebrities

[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:07.640]
Numbly above 11 Britney Spears 9. How do you like that? That's kind of interesting and you want to know why you want to know Britney got the nine votes

[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.880]
I don't want one clue one clue

[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:16.340]
Bye bye bye him and a corner hole you ate Brook Shield 6 J. I was up to five now you finally came to your senses and

[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.400]
Janet Jackson 3 out of 120 votes

[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000]
Who's Janet Jackson supposedly doing now some food cake which one is it?

[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.400]
I don't know wasn't she doing it on or somebody?

[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.940]
Obviously I don't know

[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.140]
Anyway, let's get back to business you know I get the feeling that it could be wrong

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.640]
But I have the feeling that is a yesterday. We kind of like turn the corner

[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.140]
At least on this show and of course the rest of the station like I said now that football's back no more excuses

[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.660]
Now let's start really getting to the high gear. We screwed around during the summer

[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.420]
I had my long busman's holiday my big you know do a Tuesday here a Thursday there

[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.440]
We sit half of the time which I didn't enjoy very much

[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.600]
But you know what I'm talking about now it's get down to brass tax

[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.900]
You know I'm saying I know you're saying I think when I read that article by Cheryl

[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:01.320]
Sirius today at least on this show that kind of like turn the corner and now we're getting down to brass tax and

[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.760]
Even I even thanked rich Pacto day which I thought was incredible seeing the size of the print that story I

[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:10.940]
Mean how do you do that? How do you um maybe it's a shrink to fit kind of thing

[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.460]
Shrink to fit one page if you're real cheap

[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.260]
I don't want to say rich Pacto's cheap

[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.760]
But I'm sure that Paul Harvey Jr. would agree with that. You know, we don't take his boring calls anymore

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.580]
Well, I tell you one thing. I think for no other reason that just than that

[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.100]
It's good. We stop taking calls on this show no comment Paul Harvey Jr. You're a good close personal friend

[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.420]
I mean he got so pondress now this story if this doesn't frost your ass

[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.260]
Which I told George before the show and he was almost speechless

[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.460]
In fact, I think that this story requires

[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:39.780]
sound effect

[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.240]
From

[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:44.440]
The

[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.960]
The city city can't it might be accurate

[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.920]
But justice department acknowledged yesterday

[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.980]
It's in an email to Louisiana State University's biomedical research and training center to immediately cease and assist from

[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:03.400]
Employing researcher Steve and Hatville on department-funded programs. You know that person of interest?

[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.120]
Yeah

[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.340]
Hatville is one of several people

[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:12.340]
Under scrutiny by the FBI and the investigation of last falls deadly. Oh, I see I wasn't prepared last falls deadly

[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.220]
Attacks

[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.360]
Five people including two postal employees died of

[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.020]
Hatville's not been charged with any crime though

[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:25.420]
The statement by assistant attorney general Deborah Daniels did not explain why the department sent a strongly worded message

[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:31.320]
August 1st LSU placed hand-pull on administrative leave the following day it fired him this week as we are told yesterday

[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.740]
The department has not been involved in any decisions made by LSU with respect to mr.

[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:43.420]
Hatville status as an employer of that university Daniel said much of the funding for LSU's National Center for Biomedical Research and Training where Hatville

[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:47.100]
Work comes from the Justice Department University officials said following that

[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:55.760]
I got it much of the funding for LSU's National Center for Biomedical Research and Training where Hatville work comes from the Justice Department University

[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:03.540]
Officials said the Center helps prepare emergency personnel for bio-terror attacks Hatville an expert on bioterrorism threats was hired around the first of July

[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:10.720]
LSU officials said the decision to fire Hatville was unrelated to the government email which they said did not reach top university officials until Wednesday

[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:18.380]
Earlier this week LSU Chancellor Mark Emmer told CNN the decision was based solely upon the university's long-term interests

[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.200]
citing the need to protect its academic academic integrity whatever the hell that means

[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.080]
Justice Department officials requesting anonymity

[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:34.080]
Decline to defend sending the email one official said the decision to send it was made by the office of domestic preparedness based on their own criteria

[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.540]
the Boon the

[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.140]
Rashstag

[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.460]
Which which Nazi Department of the government that they just invented here last month sent that out the office of domestic

[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.400]
Preparedness whatever the hell that is

[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.120]
But the officials had no information on what the criteria were or whether Daniels was even aware that the message had been set

[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.780]
Daniels overseas the office of justice programs

[01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:02.580]
Which includes the off the ODP the office of domestic preparedness not to be confused though confused with your orifice you following all of this

[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.220]
Never heard of that office

[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.960]
Pat Claus and the serving as Hatville spokesman told CNN the Hatville first heard the email yesterday

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.380]
He complained that the Justice Department had given LSU no reason why should terminate his employment

[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.120]
It would be nice that the Justice Department would give us a reason as to why didn't want Steve Hatville working on his process

[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.220]
Project Claus and said he's one of the countries top bio-defense experts. We need him protecting America

[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.920]
We don't need him on the sidelines right now

[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.880]
The message was written by Timothy Burriss who's acting director of the ODP and reports to Daniels

[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.600]
It was unclear whether Burriss cleared the email before sending it or whether it was prompted by Attorney General John

[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.420]
Ascroft's comment that Hatville was a person of interest to anthrax investigators

[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:48.560]
What was clear the official said was that Burriss did not consult with the Justice Department or FBI criminal investigators conducting the anthrax probe

[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.820]
The controversial email directs that Louisiana State University Academy of Counter Terrorist Education

[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:59.360]
Immediately cease and assist from utilizing the subject matter expert and course instructor duties of Stephen J.

[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.820]
Hatville on all Department of Justice funded programs

[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:06.340]
Boy, do you see a lawsuit coming here or what? Yeah, just I mean I mean just gigantic

[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.360]
Daniels appeared to offer a partial depends of the message in her statement last night

[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.020]
It is a specific condition of our grant to us you that we maintain management oversight and control

[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:22.120]
Stephen J. Hatville served as a subject matter expert on bio terrorism and was one of the primary instructors used an LSU's training program Daniel said

[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.280]
Kloss and told CNN the actions by LSU in the Justice Department

[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.980]
Should spur all Americans to ask some questions and he is

[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.760]
Where is it that the Attorney General gets authority to put an accusatory finger at a citizen without leveling any kind of formal charges

[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.060]
Where does the Justice Department get the power to get him answer out of his job?

[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:45.280]
Plus and be asking if the Justice Department has some evidence on Steve Hatville then by all means charge him

[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.800]
But quit destroying his life

[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.260]
Lawson said God damn it

[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:51.900]

[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.540]
Who do you believe Bob Johnson is that okay?

[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.860]

They got people to know your feet inside and out and people like that. They like good service

[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.880]
They like great selection, but most important in anything people want the best prices in town

Gotta keep your Johnson straight here. Hey man John Bon Jovi here for the John Bon Jovi School of music success

[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.440]
Today's lesson is on how to become filthy rich and famous in rock and roll

[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:37.480]
First thing to do is very important make sure no one in your band is better looking than the lead singer like me

[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:44.420]
If they are better looking or start to look cool kick them out of your band man like I did to our old bass player guy

[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.900]
If your lead singer isn't good looking or thin make him your drummer

[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:54.080]
And if he's still too fat get him life-os suction like we did to what's his name back there

[01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.400]
Which is our keyboard player whoever is old good friend of mine. Okay. Lastly songwriting is very important

[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.160]
Especially if you don't have my talent or the ability to screw young bands out of their publishing rights for a record deal

[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.980]
Sorry skid row

[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:15.620]
But then do what I do if a catchphrase or names work for the first few times then stay with it man

[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.940]
These people will buy any crap you put out there unless it's a solo project

[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:26.000]
So I heard for example names you all remember Tommy and Gina from living on a prayer

[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.520]
Well guess what they're back in it's my life and my brilliant or what hey and what about six string?

[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.480]
Yep, it's in one a dead or alive right loaded six string on my back and

[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.980]
Living on a prayer time is gotta six doing it hard get it man. This is so easy

[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:52.740]
So take the John Bon Jovi school of music success any resemblance between John Bon Jovi and intelligence was purely coincidental now

[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:59.500]
You wonder why I play that what you play that guess who opened the rank the opening belt of Wall Street today John Bon Jovi good guess

[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:06.960]
Governor of Kandahar survives assassination drown out these two separate stories because also president Karzai a survival

[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.280]
President of Afghanistan is still unclear

[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.220]
What is clear is that these two gentlemen work together outside of the governor's palace hearing Kandahar

[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:20.620]
They were just a boat in a car trying to get into a car together when according to an eyewitness that I just spoke with

[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.200]
He was standing about ten yards away

[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:29.480]
An AMF soldier that would be a soldier friendly to the US government that a soldier that belongs to the new Afghan

[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.840]
government open fire on the governor of

[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.760]
Kandahar he apparently has been wounded in his neck

[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.940]
Apparently it is thought to be a slight wound that he was braised in it

[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.380]
According to this eyewitness that John Gunman the the Afghan soldier was then gun down himself

[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:56.960]
Uh the president of Afghanistan how many cars I was surrounded by special forces security and west away

[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:04.840]
And the governor of Kandahar was brought here to the Kandahar air base where he is currently actually right near me here on the base

[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.420]
receiving medical attention back here. Okay, so there's good news tonight. Okay Kandahar governor is still he is gonna be okay

[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.960]
And cars are surviving they didn't get him yet

[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.140]
Okay, next time

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:20.900]
Well, I mean, you know, I hate to say it but it looks like it just a matter of time because you'll have all these loonies running around over there

[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.040]
They still have chaos and they we didn't have anything even resembling one stable government but nevertheless

[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.100]
You mean we're just gonna have a good time. We didn't round them up and get them all

[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.020]
Don't start being anti-government now mister. They're gonna come around your ass up. Okay?

The 18th from the QM skybox though you have a good time out there

[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.720]
Hang around with Ray Perry

[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.660]

Woman sue Syracuse diocese for 20 million dollars before I get to that story now. Did you notice the hemorrhid thing here?

[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.760]
Yes, I did

[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:37.560]
Well haven't I told you that I told you and you laugh to me hemorrhids are varicose veins of the rectum what is what it says here?

[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.620]
I told you that so probably I wouldn't surprise me. I mean if Moe has got varicose veins that big no wonder he's such a pain in the ass

[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.200]
Right, oh, that's right. You can't comment because you need the job

[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.100]
But that I'll say it myself. That's why maybe he's such a big pain in the ass because he's got big bulging

[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:01.760]
varicose veins that display prominently when he's out there playing golf in his checkered plaid the golf shorts

[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.860]
That's what the beast told me

In fact in crispy creams they got a special section in the back for people who are paying an ass like Moe

[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.300]
I was just going to back okay

[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:05.940]
Okay, I may get in the story or not as the case may be a woman who received counseling after having a sexual relationship about

[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.540]
Preest 30 years ago as soon the Roman Catholic diocese of Syracuse for 20 million bucks

[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.520]
You go girl

[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.020]
Oh, and look at this Victoria love 48 of Rochester

[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:24.560]
Will receive a 17,710 dollar settlement from the diocese in 1993 is the fifth person this year to suit the diocese that just in Syracuse over

[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.040]
Let's sexual abuse by priest

[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:33.020]
She was married five times said her lawyer Frank Polis-Cellie. She can't maintain relationships. She can't trust

[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.060]
She suffers throughout her life because of this abuse

[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.460]
Polis-Cellie filed a suit for love in states of preemcord and Anandaga County Wednesday

[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:44.320]
The suit also names the Reverend William Lawrence. I wonder if he's related to Jim Lawrence does the color on these neighbors games

[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.640]
I hope not he does a good job. By the way with Rick Jenner rent you know Jim Lawrence

[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:53.040]
The suit I bet you're fat boy does the suit also names Reverend William Lawrence and Bishop James Moynihan

[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.520]
Who's probably no relation to John Moynihan that used to work on QA and remember him sure?

[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.640]
Do you know? Yeah, you do we probably even have a jingle in here somewhere

[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.020]
I bet you let me let me look under the jingles. I bet you got a

[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.660]
Like I said you're quicker than I am

[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.900]
The assistant spokesman Daniel Cummings told the post standard of Syracuse and Thursday's editions today meaning that the diocese

[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.760]
Had not been served with the suit and was unable to comment nobody wants to comment at anything

[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:23.160]
The suit claims Lorenzo was a guidance counselor with the former Oswego Catholic high school 1970 when he began a decade-long

[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.200]
sexual relationship with love who was then Victoria Vinal Moore

[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.700]
Love a lady she was a minor when she went to Lorenzo talk about abuse by a foster parent

[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.720]
Instead of counseling her the suit ledges he got her drug and had sexual relations with her

[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.680]
They continue to have sexual relations in his car and a church rectumry until late seventies the suit said

[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:44.720]
The suit also will edge the defendant's conspired to conceal Lorenzo's criminal sexual conduct

[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.880]
And defrauded parishioners to protect predatory priests from prosecution. How unusual that is

[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:55.040]
Diosis in officials learned of Lorenzo's relationship when love contacted church officials in 1993

[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.960]
The diocese paid love that over 17 grand for counseling and sent Lorenzo to St. Luke Institute

[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:07.660]
A psychiatric hospital in Maryland one-hand permitted Lorenzo resume parish work in 1995 and on NIDA after experts at the hospital clear to oh

[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.540]
Yeah, he's okay now

[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:15.140]
The suit said that I see speech the 1993 settlement by lowering the rents to return to the ministry and by failing to keep the agreement confidential

[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:21.380]
The settlement in which love re-ealist the diocese in the rent from liability was void because it was obtained under false pre-penses

[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.360]
The suit said

[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.580]
How do you like that

[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.420]
Nice young lady from Rochester screwed up for the rest of her life because of this

[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.560]
Fondling priest

[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.840]
At least it was a woman this time. I was just gonna say at least now we're getting to run on women

[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.040]
Which probably really pisses them off. Oh there at the channel seven

[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.780]
Because you know one of the things that it's written in their contract at channel

[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:47.500]
We're not talking about women right see I got to that one first mind this time. Nice to know. Thank you

[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.780]

[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:56.180]
Anyway, how's that pull come and speak in a woman which of these women you most strongly believe is a beard for gay celebrities and boy

[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.760]
Sure Elizabeth Taylor 42. See I would not have voted for her because I consider her to be more like a fag

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.900]
Hag is opposed to being a beard

[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.480]
I think maybe our audience needs a little instructions to the difference between a fag

[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.140]
Hag and a beard a

[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:17.080]
Fag Hag is just somebody who constantly surrounds herself with gay people and gay causes like listaylor is always done in between fainting spells and the

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.160]
Fats of fit and popping pills right as opposed to like a

[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.280]
Beard who was somebody who dates and even marries gay people to make it look like maybe just maybe oh

[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:32.320]
You think we should have had Nicole Kim and I was just gonna say that god damn it too late. No, it's too late

[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.780]

[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:55.500]

[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.080]

He's also co-policed that went and Jibot sexually abused him and accusations school officials vigorously denied

[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.780]
They'd prosecute his own through investigation into co-fell's claims of abuse by the priest

[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.160]
No one's been charged other novice monk denied being molested by the holy cross administrators

If the state continues to believe that father rabbit and father Damien are under suspicion of wrong doing father Damien

[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:01.540]
Then it would be malpractice for an attorney to allow them to answer questions

They might be misused against them male black and Richard Hirsch attorneys for wet and Jibot said in the statement

[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.140]
The priest will only answer questions from the state of attorneys be saying father Damien

The two boys whom prosecutors say used a bat to kill their father initially confessed to the crime

[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.020]
It's not always easy to use a bat to kill somebody because they have a tendency to fly away

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:19.280]
They later recanted their story saying it was a friend Ricky Chavez-Porty who's through their father

[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.160]
Chavez and never would let us go

[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.740]
He said my dad would have killed us before he let us go

[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:59.340]
wearing a light blue dress shirt and tie with his hair neatly cropped ugly Alex showed little emotion as he spoke about his version of events

[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.780]
He is really extraordinarily ugly little kid and he

[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:06.280]
I well yeah the little one he extremely ugly not that that makes a difference

[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.100]
But since you're picking on Chuck for being ugly I would say that Alex by any stretch of the imagination is a hell of a lot

[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.040]
uglier than Chuck ever would hope to be

[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.080]
Ask how he felt when Chavez allegedly told the news Alex said I was kind of angry that he kept saying he had done it for me

[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.840]
At one point he said Chavez left to burn down their house where their father's remains inside

[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.680]
When he came back he said that there had been a fire and that the fire hadn't burned up everything

[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.280]
It was then that Chavez said he couldn't go to prison and then began pressing the two boys to confess to the killing Alex said

[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.260]
It was saying that if we took the blame we'd get off on self-defense because we're juveniles Alex said I believe the kids, you know

[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:38.580]
Sure, don't you absolutely?

[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:42.100]
And this reminds me of the new England what what that was her name?

[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:49.880]
Her name was smart pack smart Pam Pam smart. Yes, does that remind you of that sure exactly? She had the kids killer husband because

[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:50.600]
abusive

[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:51.500]
Right

[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.120]
Didn't she get married to some dyker something in jail?

[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:57.600]
Was that her?

[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:03.440]
She was having lesbian or antics while in prison. Oh no and you didn't get to see it. I tried video or six

[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.100]
Video at six and WSBK

[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.340]
Ask whether he and his brother immediately agreed to take the heady respotted no sir

[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.560]
We're sometime before we agreed to take the story to take the blame

[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.900]
Chavez then coached the boys over a period of about two days is to what to tell authorities

[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.140]
He said we were talking about it almost constantly

[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.120]
Alex said he kept going over it until we got it all right

[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.320]
But Alex announced he smoked marijuana that night his dead was killed that in the weeks before the killing

[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.360]
He and his brother ran away from home to live with chavez

[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.660]
He said he planned to stay with chavez until he was at least 16

[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.700]
He said his father did not know about the relationship with chavez

[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:36.240]
Which in this story for some reason what is this from from CNN they neglect all of the sexual details

[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.260]
I was uh on and on the pad pulling yeah a lot of tad pulling and a lot of just plain pulling going on

[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.380]
Alex also worked out telling other juveniles the detention center that he is brother killed their father

[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:50.500]
He also said he had not smoked marijuana on the day he confessed to polies like I said I believe chavez

[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.080]
I don't believe any of them

[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.560]
The prosecution also pressed I like them were the family members during jahaz visits had tried to convince the boy

[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.800]
He was not involved and then it was chavez was responsible Alex responded

[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.280]
They said something to that effect

[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.720]
Earlier yesterday the court heard the boys confession tapes so on one of them

[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.400]
Derek said he was the one who beat his father death and his recliner

[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.400]
I made sure he was asleep. I got the bad. I hit him over the head there

[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.280]
It said I hit him once and I heard his moan

[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.600]
I was afraid he might wake up and see us

[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.340]
So I just kept on hitting him somewhere around 10 times give or take

[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.140]
Give or take a couple of good laughs

[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.340]
So there you go on you court TV fans like George's wife

[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:26.760]
Now you got something to really chew on. I'm sure that's done again now right probably oh well

[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.820]
I know what it is it is on here

[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:30.580]
Uh on there

[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:34.420]
Yes court TV yeah try uh 44

[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:36.540]
No

[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.560]
Disney oh well close they got little kids on there too

[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.760]
Massachusetts uh letters test now do you hear the story they had the big breaking news yesterday and from

[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.900]
Massachusetts about the letters laced with supposed anthrax no I did not

[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.340]
Preliminary test of a white powder male the non-pollips to 11 police departments north of Boston were negative for anthrax

[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:58.000]
And the mailings appear to be a hoax a top state health official said late yesterday afternoon

[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.820]
This is on oh this is on CNN you're right at the end there right now

[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.920]
What is that trial? I told you we ain't got anybody would listen

[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.560]
Sir I don't do it on a full time base

[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:12.100]
The FBI has launched their criminal investigation in the matter to find out who's behind the mailings

[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.160]
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're going to do that real quick just like the mailings from my new jersey

[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:20.120]
Our observations of the powder indicate there is not any potential risk associated with this powder said

[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.860]
Ralph Timperi the director state public health department lab with the test of being performed

[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.500]
This appears to be one of many hoaxes that have been perpetrated

[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.680]
The letters were sent to 11 police departments all in Essex County

[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.900]
Each was postmarked in North Reading in the county and dressed various police chiefs. There was no return address

[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:39.900]
The envelopes contain a single sheet of paper with black September typed at the top and a few grams of unidentified powder said

[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:43.840]
Timperi and FBI experts also examined the letters to assess whether there's a credible threat

[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.180]
He said we have no reason to believe that this presents any risk whatsoever and should not cause concern

[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.320]
Among the people who've been exposed to it

[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.160]
He said health officials have conducted rapid test on three letters to reach their conclusion further test

[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:58.540]
They're being conducted today to determine exactly what it is like maybe

[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.600]
Armand Hammer baking soda

[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:07.660]
That's always good. I always remember all the assholes that we're doing the crank stuff after 11 after we started getting the answer

[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:12.200]
I really am worse because it's funny. Yeah, because it's really funny. Oh, yeah, it's a panic

[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:17.000]
And to have everybody call the hazmat people out there and a fire rescue and cross the taxpayers

[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:23.420]
Thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars and get everybody into a sheer panic and have everybody in your community

[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.840]
Where ever the hell happens to be crap it in their pants. Yeah, really funny

[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.460]
I think what we really found out at that point is if we ever doubted that there were zillions of assholes on loose in this country

[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.240]
Trust me when I tell you oh there are

[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.060]
Floridians done as dirt coming up tonight

[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:50.200]
Unidentified behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.900]
We take a good hard stiff look and start them

[01:35:53.900 --> 01:36:00.120]
They were abandoned from Boston a place where people talk funny they were till Tuesday

[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.020]
Yeah

[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:13.060]
It was our freaking manager the blue it for the band till Tuesday singer songwriter Amy man

[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:21.180]
That accent of his that damn Boston accent. I don't know what she's talking about the band's manager

[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.800]
Solly look all rightly spoke to inside the behind about

[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:32.140]
Uh, well see if you can figure it out. I met the freaking band in a bar like in my say what we can say

[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:36.560]
I figured it wouldn't be hard to make them stop so we drank about a quarter beer. I got freaking ham inside the paper

[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.560]
So he's accent was so impossible that soon it began to jeopardize any future record deals for the band

[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:49.060]
Tonight will play exclusive hidden camera video of so he's meeting with the Warner Brothers record executive

[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:54.180]
Yeah, I'm here about the band to till Tuesday and telling you they're gonna go wicked vibes not gonna be hard at all

[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:58.600]
I got him some conscious up not to don't okay caught and thrown a party later on sadly at the fire. We can have some beers

[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.860]
What the f*** did you just say? Huh?

[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:06.180]
Oh, hey listen you got some quarters for the pack and meet only my cash packed out there and I'm out of quarters what

[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:07.920]
Till Tuesday

[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.640]
Reamed by a regional accent

[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:16.560]
It's a big juicy stopping what look at your business tonight and inside of behind

[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.640]
And you're absolutely correct. That's the way they speak and watch them. Okay, you can't understand a god damn thing

[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.100]
You've been there for like a few months

[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:27.720]
11-1 at 560 wqm David Sanger writes in the New York Times today making case to hit first

[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.740]
President Bush's declaration yesterday that he would seek the approval of Congress to outside him

[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:38.600]
Who's saying amounted to an acknowledgement that he cannot proceed alone and that he needs to move quickly to try to resolve a rip within his

[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.880]
Administration with many of his father's cautious advisors and with his reluctant allies

[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.760]
But yesterday some more than just the joining of a great debate over how to deal with the man who has mr. Bush put it so bluntly is

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:56.340]
Stiffing the world implicitly mr. Bush has agreed to engage the country in the discussion over a fundamental change in America's national security strategy

[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:02.200]
His doctrine that perilous times the fourth the U.S. to assert a right to launch preemptive strikes against any state that could put weapons

[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.800]
The mass destruction of the hands of terrorists

[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.880]
After Pearl Harbor in the invasion of Kuwait president soft congressional approval to strike back

[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.980]
Mr. Bush thinks approval to strike first because 9-11 taught him that any other strategy may be too costly

[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:19.260]
We're in a new era. He said adding we spent a lot of time thinking about how best to secure our homeland even further

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:22.220]
And this is the debate of the American people must hear must understand

[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.920]
He said and the world must understand as well that its credibility is at stake

[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.100]
Any resolution of proving preemptive action could set a precedent that could be used in a variety of other conflicts

[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.200]
And it'll almost be certainly seized upon by the nations

[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.480]
Maybe China and its confrontation with Taiwan or Indian its conflict with Pakistan

[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.660]
Is they pursue their own agendas so winning his point will pose a huge test of mr. Bush's leadership first in Washington

[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:49.920]
Then around the world his age acknowledged that the first task is to answer those senators former generals and older generation of national security experts

[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.800]
Who ask why there's such urgency to confront Iraq now vice president Dick Cheney argue last week that he's now convinced

[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:03.240]
That the Iraqi leader will develop a nuclear weapon fairly soon words that seems to suggest new intelligence to back up the administrations and systems

[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.140]
That there's a little time to spare yet

[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:11.020]
So far the body language of administration officials who just the new evidence is scant and by all accounts

[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:16.500]
Defense secretary rumsfeld offered little new evidence that a closed door meeting on Capitol Hill yesterday afternoon

[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:22.180]
I'll read the last part of that again and by all accounts the defense secretary rumsfeld offered little new evidence that a closed door meeting

[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.400]
yesterday afternoon

[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.460]
There's clearly a case that satan as a threat senator Carl levin a michigan sent after the meeting yesterday

[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:33.020]
The question is whether he liked the North Korean leadership who have had weapons of mass destruction for years

[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.780]
But are so interested in their own survival. There's little reason to think they would ever initiate an attack

[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.460]
Mr. Bush's task we've been more complex over the summer when he remained largely silent on the Iraq issue

[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:47.400]
That meant that the debate was dominated by a parade of television skeptics led by generals who played key roles in the Gulf

[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:54.020]
Four 11 years ago and sober minded veterans of the first Bush administration led by Brent Scowcroft and James A. Baker the turd

[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.480]
Both men agree that mr

[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.000]
Hussein is a menace who wants to dominate the Persian Gulf and its oil

[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.980]
But they suggested that there was a right way in a wrong way to oust him

[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:07.040]
Mr. Scowcroft the former national security adviser who famously warned satan who saying during the Gulf War that the use of weapons of

[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.420]
Mass destruction would bring about the end of his country set the terms of the coming debate with this observation about his old foe

[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:22.020]
He is unlikely to risk his investment in weapons of mass destruction much less his country by handing such weapons to terrorists to would use them for their own purposes and leave bag that as the return address

[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.740]
Mr. Baker followed up with a warning that there was a right way to topple mr

[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.620]
Hussein as the steel edge of an international coalition

[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:30.760]
But that means taking a path mr

[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:37.660]
Cheney and other administration hawks consider a dangerous waste of time returning to the United Nations for approval of a quick highly invasive inspection

[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:43.600]
With the understanding that further resistance to inspection will provide the justification for an immediate overwhelming military response

[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.240]
hopefully before the November elections

[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.660]
The public airing of such arguments clearly stung Mr. Bush's team in an interview yesterday

[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:56.840]
Condoleezza rise the national I'm sorry Condoleezza rise the national security adviser declined to take the critics on by name

[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.320]
But she argued our critics seem to take the position that if we don't bother him

[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.540]
He won't bother the world that's not an approach we can take anybody who tried to predict what sottom was saying my duis treading in dangerous water

[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:09.600]
He invaded his neighbors twice. He gassed his own people

[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.960]
He tried to kill a former president is ambitions of class with our interest before and I'll class with them again

[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.820]
Mr. Baker's position which appears to be shared by secretary of state Powell may yet win the day

[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:24.760]
That seems to be the agenda when mr. Bush meets the British Prime Minister Tony Blair. I can't david on center day

[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.400]
I think it's dawned on everyone that he can't stand up in front of the United Nations September 12 and say it's our way or the highway

[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.540]
Said one senior administration official

[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:36.380]
Would not be great and you can you can see him doing that can't you it's our way

[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:40.740]
Or the highway, but that doesn't mean he's willing to pursue inspections. It's up in the air

[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.400]
Mr. Bush's aides are clearly aware of the risk ahead on the road he headed down yesterday

[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.120]
The first challenge is to resolve the differences in the administration

[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.760]
Something Ms. Rice argued would quickly happen once the president decides what course to take the second is to persuade congress for a

[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.880]
To vote for resolution that gives the president as free and hand as possible and not necessarily just with Iraq

[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.760]
administration officials seem confident that congress will find it difficult to resist especially if they can arrange a vote before the November election

[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:10.940]
The third challenge is to win over traditional allies of express grave reservations

[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:16.500]
That process begins this weekend with mr. Blair and in plan calls to leaders of Russia China and France

[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:20.400]
But other leaders of NATO are staunchly opposed Germany's Chancellor

[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.060]
Gerhard Schroeder said he would not support an attack even if it had the blessing of the UN

[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:32.060]
You know what else he said what it's a lie. I am not but not see this puts even more pressure on the president to go out and make the case with a kind of persuasive political speech

[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:38.060]
That Churchill and Lincoln were so adept at that said Elliott Cohen a professor at Johns Hopkins University

[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:43.420]
There we go again with the George W. Comparison with Weinstein Churchill and now with Abraham Lincoln

[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.020]
Who of our great Jewish or leaders of ancient history how do you like that

[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.220]
Don't you when you look at him don't you think of Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill right away right all the time

[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.980]
If we could just give him a good story you know like Weinstein used to do and of course you don't do the drink it anymore

[01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:59.700]
Like Churchill did right

[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.940]
Massachusetts man who played Santa Claus at Ramsey House

[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.120]
dies

[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.560]
You know this is first we had the Reese thing where that guy died right right and now this guy died

[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.660]
So this is just

[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.660]
More good more fodder for Robert's back the Santa Claus that mommy said was the one that didn't

[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:24.240]
Right this is more good fodder for Robert's deck more unsolved mystery sugar main unsolved forever

[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.160]
A man labeled by John and Patti Ramsey is a possible suspect and their daughter slang has died

[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.600]
P Massachusetts as wife said he was 72

[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:43.320]
Police sources said they never considered the former University of Colorado journalism professor is a serious suspect

[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:49.780]
McRennels was investigated because he played Santa Claus at the Ramsey home three years in a row his last appearance came two days before John

[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:51.120]
Bene was found dead in

[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.280]
1996 murdered butchered

[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.120]
John Bene's death also resemble the plot of a play

[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:02.000]
He and his wife had written before the slang authorities collected here in handwriting samples from the couple in the first two months following the killing

[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.880]
The Ramsey's called McRennels a suspect in their book death of innocence

[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.940]
Are we going to go out and get that let's get it right away. No

[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.900]

[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:21.340]
How America's intelligence failures led to November 11th and according to whoever was the facts me one of our regular facts is the bush

[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:21.980]
There it is

[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.900]
Bush wanted to stop the publishing of this book. How do you like that?

[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:26.920]
Hmm

[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:29.800]
Anyway, go back to this story about poor uh

[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.120]
McRennels who's dead

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:37.300]
Janemick Rennels said yesterday that her husband's involvement in the infamous case scarred him and forced the couple to move to the small town in Cape Cod

[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:40.600]
After over 30 years in Colorado. Mashpee. I never heard of it. Did you?

[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.780]
Nope. Oh you never been there you never been to Cape Cod

[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:43.200]
Nope

[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:43.980]
Boston

[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:44.560]
Nope

[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.560]
Framingham. Nope. Dorchester. No thank you. Salem. No

[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.100]
He was just so devastated by the mere idea anyone would suspect him of a crime

[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:56.940]
She said McRennels big hard made him a popular instructor at CU said fellow professor Doug Cosper. She time jick is right

[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.660]
You're talking a lot. I'm sorry. Some of his students kept relationships within their entire lives

[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:03.700]
He said McRennels fascination with Santa Claus began after his retirement

[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:07.680]
It wasn't that John Wayne Gacy also fascinated with playing Santa Claus clowns

[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:13.120]
No, but he also he did clowns. He also played Santa Claus. I didn't know about the Santa you better get with your John

[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.900]
He won Gacy trivia mister or we're gonna stick you right in the cross page

[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:19.680]
Well, I do have the trading cards and paintings. You know. No you and mr. Ego good

[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:25.800]
McRennels fascination with Santa Claus began at I'm amazed that you remember that began after his retirement from the university

[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.100]
1992 corny to his wife

[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:33.080]
He loved being Santa. He loved little children and the Ramsey case destroyed his career and just devastated him

[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.460]
Janet McRennels be saying he loved that little girl

[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.840]
There was a very sad thing in his life because he's genuinely loved children

[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:44.460]
It was the happiest part of his life when the couple moved to Massachusetts in 1998 the grandfather of six instead filed his time

[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.260]
A field is time that should say it does

[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:53.140]
Helping the elderly local senior center. How do you like that? Here was a good guy like can you like old people and how he's dead and patty killed him

[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:57.300]
And the Ramsey smeared his name in the sentiment to a deep funk from which he never recovered

[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.440]
In memorial service the schedule Friday, Massachusetts a service in Boulder will also take place later this month

[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.140]
His national be scattered in one of his favorite Colorado mountain getaways as vice-sales

[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.940]
And of course the Ramsey's would say that's what he wanted to do get away

[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:17.840]
Oh, well, what's his name Rudy Marzky who writes a very weak column on sports on TV in the USA today

[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.340]
There's no Rudy Marzky no thanks always quote Rudy Marzky. I think thanks to founder Rudy and it rightfully so

[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.260]

He's got three to six three five but be no cook from five to six

[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:51.300]

[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:57.880]
See that's our model me mad dog and the Humper that's our model work as little as possible and get paid as much as possible

[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.200]

How's that working for you? I love it

[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.100]
Marlon's on deck six thirty five right after Hank and be no

And then you got the marlon's at the mess. Boy they sure got crushed last night. Is anybody here? No 11 to four

Masters all you sexes pigs out there

[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:32.020]
You see the women's groups are obnoxious. They're disgusting. They're a bunch of bull dicks masquerading

[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:35.980]
It's like real women which you're I always resented. I mean if you're lesbian fine

[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:37.440]
Be a dike

[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.120]
Stand up and be a dike don't pretend to be like a woman's group if you're a real woman's group

[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.960]
That's fine, but if you're a dike group, you know, it's like gay men

[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.520]
Okay, we have groups. We have this organization in that one. We're fags. Okay, and we're proud of it

[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.800]
But this business of pretending to be like some kind of a feminist group when you're a hardly feminine

[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:58.980]
You know what I'm talking about do I know like what was your name Gloria Steinem when you called her feminine? No, no

[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.560]
Televised next year's masters won't be carried out easily

[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:26.300]
Not if the national council women's organizations keeps up its campaign to have at least one woman admitted to the storied Augusta

And Martha Burke who heads the six million member ncw always about to throw in the towel on this high stakes game

[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:44.600]
CBS will broadcast the Masters in April CBS vice president Leslie and Wade said

[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:49.140]
But Burke said that will not deter her including CBS among those she puts pressure on

[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:53.880]
I plan to appeal to CBS that they should not be underwriting an organization that discriminates Burke said Tuesday

[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:59.820]
It's my belief that the shareholders apparent via comm customers and even their employees will applaud a decision not to discriminate

[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:07.720]
Though 87% of respondents to a CNN s i comm dot com pull Tuesday said that see they had even a much more lopsided

87% of the CNN slash s i dot com pull to they said that CBS should continue to broadcast them

[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.280]
Burke isn't about to turn up the heat

[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:19.180]
See that's those sexist sports nerds because they're all men

[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.980]
She was told that CBS believes it has an obligation to the public to carry the masters

[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:27.260]
Plus of course a lot of Mark golf nerds too. They want to see they want to see tiger

[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:32.060]
Well, guess what 12 years ago you wouldn't have seen tiger with Augusta because there were no smarts is allowed okay?

[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.680]
You bigoted assholes you

[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:39.040]
ESPN's my greenberg said Tuesday other networks would leap at taking the masters of CBS dropped out

[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.100]
Burke said she doubted CBS could televised the tournament in the face of ncw old pressure

[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.060]
Look at what happened to the sponsors you said

[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:48.360]
I brought some reports that CBS doesn't make money on the masters without those sponsors

[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.660]
If they're hiding behind the responsibility of their shareholders

[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.680]
They need to make the public aware of what the arrangement is with Augusta national and how they're going to generate money for the network

[01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:00.260]
CBS said the arrangements with Augusta national puts it at break even but doesn't make them money

[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.340]
Production cost at about a million and a half are covered by the club

[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.020]
But Burke said there's more than money at stake

[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.400]
There's another cost here the public image and how these CBS folks run a network

[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.120]
Corporate responsibility goes beyond financial responsibility

[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:15.560]
We've heard a lot of talk about corporate responsibility lately. We sure have

[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.160]
It's including from some irresponsible assholes

[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.980]
Neither abc nor nbc would comment Tuesday on the masters

[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:26.940]
CBS makes it clear that although the masters is 90 non money making event the value and prestige is incalculable

[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:29.300]
Don't you love that? It's incalculable

[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:33.600]
But CBS and the tournament sponsors are the victims of Augusta national chairman hoody jonsense

[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.920]
Neuromited entrenched stance on a prickly situation that will only go away when the club follows the rest of the mercenaries

[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.360]
Golf World and admits a woman

[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.600]
Oh, and he's he's not quoting you. He's actually saying that I always liked that Rudy Marzki

[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:46.920]
You know what?

[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:51.280]
CBS and the tournament sponsors are victims of Augusta national chairman hoody jonsense

[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:57.200]
Neuromited entrenched stance on a prickly situation that will only go away when the club follows the rest of the mercenaries

[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.360]
Golf World and admits a woman if they admit a woman Burke sent all applaud them for saying that discrimination is not good for the sport

[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.620]
Pat them on the back and go back to our regular business

[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.280]
Burke triggered this battle with letter in June urging the club to admit women after the controversy at the 1990 pga

[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.700]
Championship at shul Creek and Birmingham, Alabama

[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:24.980]
The pga tour us open in pga for america which conducts the pga championship all instituted policies that forbid discrimination based on race, creed, gender, color or national origin

[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:30.980]
Augusta national a private club remains the only club that host major u.s. tournaments without an open membership policy

[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:40.940]
Unlike in 1990 when then Augusta national chairman hoard hard on a harden headed off a stormer protest by quietly admitting an african american member before the 1991 masters

[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.380]
Johnson drew a line at admitting the first woman

[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:49.100]
He often said the club might someday admit women, but that timetable will be ours and not at the point of a bayonet

[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:57.620]
Can you just see this Yahoo man? Can you just and picture him? Yeah, after he falls out of the tree and wraps his banjo seems they're awfully threatened by women

[01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:58.240]
Yeah

[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:03.340]
The good old boy structure up there man. They don't want no damn bitches in there

[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:11.700]
Johnson stands placed master's sponsors i.v.m. City Group and Coca-Cola as well as CBS and the awkward position of being associated with a group that refused to do the right thing in the 21st century

[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:14.320]
Regardless of the laws protecting private clubs

[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:20.520]
Burke firmly believes that Coca-Cola indicated it would pull out and city group was wavering so janssen was forced to make a preemptive movie drop TV

[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.860]
Sponsorship for 2003 meaning that Augusta national would have to eat the seven million dollar plus cost of running next year's

[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:31.180]
Masters including CBS production cost and he signaled to Burke that women's membership at our custom national would be a major cost

[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:36.320]
So, I didn't know golf was the other US religion she said how do you like that? Huh

[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.220]
hoodie Johnson man and Rudy Marzki rips him and asks nice going Rudy. I don't care what the hamper says Rudy's okay in my book at least on that calm

[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:48.640]
Wait to hear this while ready to give you a little little load on him is

[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:52.540]
An article in a British scientific journal suggests

[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.920]
The party drug ecstasy may not be dangerous and that reported ill effects could be imaginary

[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:04.840]
Writing in the British psychological society magazine the psychologist three researchers two from liver pooling

[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.920]
Then a one from California

[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.240]
Criticized studies into the drugs effects

[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.220]
But that's gonna make my friends in Amsterdam feel better

[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:14.760]
You know because they're always getting the blame for like spreading that crap around and kids dying in it in their evil over there

[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:16.060]
Those Dutch they are

[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.260]
No, they're not evil. They're just rude

[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:24.440]
Amsterdam is great. It's the only problem with Amsterdam is in fact. It's a lot like New York great cities

[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.280]
It's just that a lot of the people live there are assholes

[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.380]
Studies have reported that the tablets popular with them. We're talking about ecstasy popular with young people attending

[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:37.100]
Raves and i-clubs cause long-term brain damage and mental problems and in fact right here in Toronto a couple of months ago

[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.900]
It seemed to me there was a story about some cue to died after taking ecstasy

[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:43.300]
But maybe it was mixing it with booze and stuff. Well, we'll continue with the article

[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.400]
But the new article criticized the research and accused researchers of bias

[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:51.480]
We're talking about to saying that causes long-term damage in the mental problems

[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:57.360]
The article was written by John Cole and Harry Sumnell of University of Liverpool that the new article and Charles Grab of the Harbor

[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.040]
UCLA Medical Center in California

[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:04.180]
Cole is an expert in cognitive neuroscience and Sumnell is a postdoctoral psychopharma

[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:05.000]
Collegist

[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.440]
Both work in the University Psychology Department

[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:14.080]
Grove director of the Hospital Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is a leading US expert on child and adolescent to person and lesson drug use

[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.080]
Their criticisms focused on several areas of existing research

[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.800]
Ecstasy is said to affect brain cells that produce the mood-influencing chemical serotonin

[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:27.360]
But cool it as a matter of fact instead of eating chocolate and candy and stuff. How about just popping some ecstasy?

[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.420]
No, I'm sorry. Just a joke bad joke

[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.980]
Well, isn't that what the supposedly does serotonin in your brain?

[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:37.360]
That's what it does when you eat the sweets and stuff and it calms you and pacifies you indeed

[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.280]
And of course

[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:45.200]
Call Sumnell and Grove said any changes involved the the generation of nerve fibers which can be regrown and not the brain cell bodies themselves

[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:48.780]
Some research only reported positive results in ignored negative data

[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:55.620]
Thus minimizing data that suggests ecstasy has no long-term effects the author said this suggests that hypothesis concerning the long-term effective ecstasy

[01:58:55.620 --> 01:59:02.480]
Are not being uniformly substantiated lense to support to the idea that ecstasy is not causing long-term effects associated with loss of serotonin

[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:02.740]
They wrote

[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.880]
Because many people participating in the studies were self-selected from universities

[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.900]
The article question whether they truly represented the general population

[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.640]
Given the high media profile of long-term effective ecstasy

[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:17.240]
One must question whether the participants are coming forward to confirm their fears about any adverse reactions

[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.420]
They may have suffered the author's road

[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.080]
Studies on animals often involved in injecting them with large doses of the ecstasy chemical MDMA

[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.840]
But routinely fail to find changes in behavior of MDMD3 out of the animals

[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:31.480]
Even when we're signs of damage to the brain in court of the article. Are you following this? I'm following it. Okay

[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:38.640]
The authors noted that many psychological problems start in adolescents that ecstasy users often took other drugs

[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:43.000]
And that some of the reported symptoms mirrored those caused by staying awake all night in dancing

[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:47.860]
And he was like getting like getting dizzy and like woozy and stuff like that and passing out

[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:53.340]
Not stop not drinking enough water because they're charging you $10 for the bottle and passing out to pull of your own puke because you've been drinking all night

[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:59.680]
Most community-based studies have failed to find a definitive cross-in-effect relationship between ecstasy users and associated problems

[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:05.000]
They wrote perhaps most controversially they suggested that ecstasy's long-term effects might be i-etrogenic

[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.540]
I thought I was the only person in the world to ever use that term on a radio

[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:13.080]
I don't even know what it means. I have to be back when I used to do those shows those awful horrible shows with guests

[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:17.940]
Dr. Bob Mendelssohn Reston-Piece who is a great critic of the medical of his own medical profession

[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:26.900]
He used to in fact in his books chapters and chapters about i-etrogenic diseases which are ones caused by the medical profession in hospitals and by doctors. I say

[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:33.700]
It says perhaps most controversially this suggests that ecstasy's long-term effects might be i-etrogenic or caused by a physician's manner or treatment

[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:39.720]
Like I just said we're concerned that the long-term effect of ecstasy could be i-etrogenic because researchers in the media are discussing a

[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:48.340]
hypothesized cause-in-effect relationship as if it were a fact they wrote the article was counted by three other ecstasy experts writing in the psychologist who dismissed the idea that ecstasy's symptoms were made

[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:51.140]
So you know pick your own poison good luck to you

[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:59.240]
Now is it illegal in the states ecstasy? Yeah, oh yeah big time. I know I don't know

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:02.440]
I mean it's is available as aspirin so I'm just asking

[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.420]
I did of course if it were a stupid question if it weren't illegal

[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:09.940]
Why would they be smuggling it and then starting it from the Netherlands right right probably to make some cash

[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:12.620]
They need the money. Okay. They're much your slepherds over there. What do you want?

[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:16.920]
I got to deal with their drugs. That's what it's all about booze and drugs and women and guys

[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:24.120]
1127 at 560 WQM VIP sportswear a Gary Sarner man this guy speaking of Amsterdam

[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:26.660]
What a segue and I see how I always fall into a bucket of cramp

[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:28.920]
I

[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.960]
Fallen will bucket is something that looks like Gary Sarner smells well

[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:35.540]
He just ain't sending me any copy like everybody. Why should he be any different? You know and how's

[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:39.260]
Skippy doing with all those Brian accounts he inherited the uh Skippy no

[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.680]
Isn't that his name? Yeah

[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:47.280]
VIP sportsbook.com that's their name and it should sound familiar because I've been telling about him for a long time

[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.660]
With the same steel copy that Gary Sarner just won't change

[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:55.300]
VIP sportsbook.com is the only sportsbook to be endorsed by all the industry watchdog groups since 1996

[02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:58.780]
Actually, I should cut him a break because this copy says eight one and that's of this year

[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.940]
As opposed to all the other stuff I had for my doesn't mean it's new. Oh, no, it's not

[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:30.800]
Did you ever say that before?

[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:31.780]
I beg your pardon?

[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:32.980]
Have you ever played that before?

[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:33.500]
Sure.

[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.760]
How can I forget that?

[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:36.860]
It's me.

[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.640]
Maybe you weren't saying we were on vacation that way.

[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:38.900]
Maybe.

[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:42.840]
Here's the facts from one of our chronic factors, Todd and Hollywood, who's okay.

[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.800]
Was it Will Rogers or Lenny Bruce who said I never met a duck?

[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:46.420]
I didn't like it.

[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:47.980]
It must have been Lenny Bruce and look what they did to him.

[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.640]
Because there are plenty of dikes I don't like.

[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:53.240]
I'm not a big dike person, you know what I mean?

[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.280]
I'm not saying that all dikes are bad people, but a little dike.

[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.020]
A little dike is okay.

[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.680]
In fact, that's why I spend a lot of time in Amsterdam.

[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:02.180]
They need all the help they can.

[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.280]
They need all the fingers they can.

[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:04.100]
Not going to get mine, though.

[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.240]
He says his voters for the Wiggum Sisters.

[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.480]
All the way to the right, so we need a birthday party pony.

[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.960]
He says, but don't tell mad dogs.

[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:11.200]
Whatever that means.

[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.480]
Now, here comes the most important facts of the day.

[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:14.940]
Do you want to know why?

[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:16.400]
I think I might know.

[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:17.580]
Is it about that book?

[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:18.100]
Yeah.

[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:22.820]
Now, see, I appreciate this because our audience out there and believe you me since the format changed.

[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:25.480]
I mean, I got a lot of stuff here to fill up a whole show.

[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.660]
But much of the good stuff I get comes from you folks.

[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:30.040]
I mean, you know, how many hours are there in a goddamn day?

[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:34.840]
I just keep thinking of that asshole that facts me that one day about taking the easy way out

[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:38.540]
by changing the format of the show and not taking those great calls, taking the easy.

[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:41.660]
Do you have any idea how much work, how much part of a...

[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:42.100]
I mean, I'm just...

[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:42.220]
Yeah.

[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:42.600]
...kunk time.

[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.260]
I have an idea.

[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.560]
Yeah, you have an idea.

[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:48.260]
I mean, I used to just rule in and show up like, you know, half hour before the show.

[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.440]
And sit there and talk to a bunch of assholes for four hours.

[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:51.720]
And that's what the new Roger Show became.

[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:55.540]
Now, throughout the day, I'm going to go out to lunch.

[02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:56.340]
I come back in here.

[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:57.180]
I'm on the goddamn Internet.

[02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:58.020]
I'm checking this paper.

[02:05:58.180 --> 02:05:58.760]
I'm checking CNN.

[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:01.060]
I'm not crying about it because it makes...

[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.440]
In my opinion, for a much better show.

[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.260]
But the bottom line is the easy way out.

[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.180]
Give me a freaking break, you moron.

[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:11.820]
Hey, let's talk to Joe on a mobile.

[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:17.660]
I mean, that was okay in its time, but believe me, for this kid, forget about it.

[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.360]
No, no more.

[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:23.920]
And I hear those inarticulate scumbags who call, you know, the rest of the day the sports nerds.

[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.760]
And I say to myself, forget about it.

[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:27.840]
And now, of course, that football season is here.

[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.780]
The Humper, I'm not there to get them on a straight-neural path again.

[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.960]
I hope I can get back there in time to straighten his ass out.

[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:37.460]
Because he's letting the callers again every day.

[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:39.180]
Not just on Fridays like he was going to do.

[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.440]
Remember, we had a discussion about that.

[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.100]
And he said, you're right.

[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.720]
And his ratings went zooming back up again.

[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.920]
Now, the whole week long, hey, what do you like?

[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:47.980]
What's the... you know, forget about it.

[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:49.280]
Man, that is the most terminal.

[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.720]
As soon as I hear one of those, the pot here goes off.

[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:53.120]
And, you know, that's it.

[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:55.720]
I'm back on the passions again.

[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:58.260]
I mean, that is just garbage.

[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.280]
And it's selfish.

[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:00.900]
That's one thing about the callers.

[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:02.380]
I always said, they have their own agenda.

[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.100]
No matter what you're talking about, they have their own agenda.

[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:06.980]
So they don't give a crap.

[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.340]
They have a discussion with you.

[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:11.040]
Whatever their selfish thing they want, they want, they need...

[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:11.700]
You know, screw it.

[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.440]
The rest of the audience don't give a crap.

[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.720]
Anyway, so this book that this factor was recommending.

[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:19.860]
And he's practiced a lot and a good guy.

[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:24.260]
He makes the effort to refact and say, whoops could be wrong.

[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:26.220]
And then he's got some excerpts from the book.

[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.500]
And he also saved me 20 bucks.

[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:30.360]
Probably more than that Canadian, eh?

[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:33.340]
Canadian, the dollars were 64 cents.

[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:33.780]
Oh my god.

[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.060]
Breakdown by Bill Geritz, G-E-R-T-Z.

[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:36.820]
Forget about it.

[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:37.860]
I mean, unless you were right-winger,

[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.480]
that wants to go out and reinforce your own psychosis.

[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.960]
Now, I'm not defending, of course,

[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.000]
bubble or any of our card or any of those people.

[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.520]
Oh, you know, where is Carter going now?

[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:45.700]
Or he's going anywhere.

[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:47.500]
He just came out with some kind of a statement on the Iraq thing.

[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.080]
You know, somebody should put him back on the peanut farm

[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.160]
and say, Jimmy, you're a good guy.

[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.840]
You're never still afraid of training, but go away.

[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.840]
Just like you noticed how much is crypto-cuba gel?

[02:07:59.460 --> 02:07:59.860]
Revolutionized.

[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.620]
I would say even more than what the Pope did, right?

[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:05.160]
Of course, you know, nothing plus nothing is still nothing,

[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:05.660]
but nevertheless.

[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.920]
So anyway, here is the blurb.

[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:12.620]
Here's the breakdown on his book from Carter to Clinton,

[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:15.100]
how liberals gutted Hamstrung and bug-roll US intelligence

[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.680]
leaving the door wide open at terror.

[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.180]
And I'm reading the, you know,

[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:20.120]
and I'm not debating any of these points.

[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.380]
But it's obviously written from a real extreme right-wing position,

[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.380]
and then the endorsements on it at the end are from very moderate people

[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.080]
like Jean Kirkpatrick, Ed Meece,

[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:31.600]
and Richard Burrell.

[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:32.640]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:34.120]
So I think I'll pass.

[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.580]
I think I'll pass, okay?

[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:39.900]
And the book review says that the end-gurth investigates

[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:41.680]
inside sources in the Pentagon and the CIA

[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.340]
and is able to track the path of terrorism

[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.880]
in the West A sad commentary of Clinton's leadership shocking.

[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:47.400]
And of course, there's no question, like I said,

[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.180]
that a lot of that stuff is true,

[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.740]
but as we just said, it was all Clinton.

[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:52.220]
It's all those liberals, man.

[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:54.620]
I think I'll pass on that.

[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:56.720]
I think I have better things to waste my eyesight on.

[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.900]
Like Rich Packer's teeny tiny factors would be good.

[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:01.320]
Don't forget, Joanne Jocostello this Saturday,

[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:04.760]
11-1 of these singular wireless 2299 Pots daily on a cruel gables.

[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:07.000]
Stop by for our usual crappy QAM prizes

[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.100]
and register to win tickets to watch the Marlins play the expose

[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.520]
on the 18th from the QAM skybox,

[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:13.540]
which that game is meaningless,

[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:15.140]
but nevertheless you'll be in the QAM skybox

[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.880]
and get a chance to do stuff up there.

[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.220]
Just like Brian Schmoetz,

[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:20.580]
remember he did in the skybox in the Mac and the Macarena?

[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:21.940]
Of course, I'll always remember.

[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.280]
Right, and so will he.

[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:25.980]
Anyway, New York Daily News says,

[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.300]
New York's top officials

[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.360]
and nervous airline passengers blasted security breakdowns yesterday

[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:34.220]
that were uncovered by a Daily News probe of airports across the country.

[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:38.360]
New York Senators Tuck Schumer and Swelor Ray Clinton vowed to investigate the news findings,

[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.340]
charging that transportation authorities

[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.720]
have failed to make much needed improvements.

[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:44.320]
I'm extremely concerned by the lapses in airports

[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.480]
secured identified by the Daily News Clinton said yesterday,

[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.320]
things have to be tightened up Schumer.

[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.320]
So let's do the tightened up.

[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.660]
Remember that song by Archie Bell and Drill?

[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:50.780]
No.

[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:51.740]
Volka Brian does.

[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:54.340]
Hey, let's do some more one-hit wonders.

[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:54.880]
Not.

[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.140]
No, not right away.

[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.520]
Things have tightened up Schumer told the Daily News

[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:03.460]
after its reporters able to pass security checkpoints

[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.720]
for 14 flights over the Labor Day weekend, carrying contraband,

[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:09.060]
including box cutters, razor knives, and pepper spray

[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:10.680]
and carry on bags and check luggage.

[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:13.580]
Clinton demanded that transportation authorities provide answers

[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:14.780]
to all these weapons we're able to make

[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:17.860]
through security systems that were supposed to be significantly upgraded

[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:18.840]
since 9-11.

[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.360]
As Governor of Protec in Mayor Bloomberg also called for improved airport security,

[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:24.900]
passengers at Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark airports,

[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:27.160]
three of the 11 spots breached by the news,

[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.900]
responded to the paper's findings with fear and anger.

[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.200]
Fear and loathing.

[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.360]
Keep doing this until they wake up.

[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:38.660]
Kenny tights 58 of Queen's Urges in the news as he waited at a JFK for a flight to Florida.

[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:39.560]
I'll go back, Kenny.

[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:40.240]
You don't want to go there.

[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.360]
The most powerful country in the world is the most lax in security and Kenny you are.

[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:46.160]
Absolutely correct sir.

[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.480]
At Newark, Ron, in Tilia, 51 of San Diego, who was on route to Vermont,

[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:52.120]
grumbled the security guard should be on the unemployment line.

[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.600]
Joe Pacero is 63.

[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.560]
What was the thing about falling off the turn-up truck?

[02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:57.140]
Remember that line?

[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:57.640]
Yeah.

[02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:00.100]
And that's exactly where most of those people came from.

[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:00.920]
That they used for security.

[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.060]
They fell off the turn-up truck.

[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.340]
Joe Pacero is 63 of Tampa, said in LaGuardia.

[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:07.720]
Their lapses are blatant but argued there's only so much that can be done

[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:09.040]
without violating the Constitution.

[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:10.800]
Am I surprised I can get weapons through?

[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:11.320]
No, he said.

[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:12.980]
I'm sure if you intend to get weapons through, you can.

[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:13.740]
Well, great.

[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:14.740]
Go back to Tampa.

[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:15.400]
Puts.

[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:19.500]
At City Hall, Bloomberg said federal authorities are not doing as much as they need to do.

[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:22.260]
It's one thing to go to pass a law and allocate some funds to fix a problem.

[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:24.900]
He said it's quite different to go out there, do it and maintain it.

[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.840]
Potaki puts the state would go beyond what is required by federal authorities.

[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.800]
The governor added that the news pro should serve as a lesson of federal authorities.

[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:35.000]
We would just urge them to learn from this experience, do whatever they can.

[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:38.320]
LaGuardia X-rayed in hand, searched the news carry-on bags.

[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:40.660]
None of the counter-bank carried by reporters was found.

[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.300]
None of it.

[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.100]
None of it.

[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:42.600]
None of it.

[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.600]
Zero Zipity Due Da.

[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:50.040]
The four airports were the 9-11 terrorist-borted planes, Newark, Boston's Logan Airport, Washington's

[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.540]
Delas and Portland's International's Airport in Maine, all failed.

[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.900]
The other airports tested were LaGuardia.

[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:59.000]
Kennedy, Chicago's Oher, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, and Santa Barbara, California.

[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:01.320]
The nation's airports are trying to meet TSA.

[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.140]
Oh, I got a story on that.

[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.240]
November 19 deadline.

[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:06.900]
Guess what they're saying?

[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.560]
I'm going to do it.

[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:10.260]
I'm going to have.

[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.020]
I got a story on it.

[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:15.880]
The agency said yesterday the news findings underscore the failures of an aviation security system

[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:18.960]
inherited by the federal government last fall, in other words, that somebody else's fault.

[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.180]
Morphed, Ringing security measures, including requiring all carry-on and check in loads to be screen,

[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:24.800]
will be implemented in coming months.

[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:29.080]
The reality is Americans have never had a higher level of security in the history of aviation said,

[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:31.280]
Leonardo Alcivar, a spokesperson for the DSL.

[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:33.460]
That's that's Norman Edd is a henchman, okay?

[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:35.200]
And Norman Edd by the way is an asshole.

[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.700]
A major asshole.

[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:47.180]
In fact, you take him, there's a poster children for this administration, him, Tom Ridge, the old cheesehead, Tommy Thompson,

[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:51.200]
and then of course, Hermann Gehring Jr. John Ascroff.

[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:56.140]
There's a post in the post of children for you about in charge of the people who stole the election.

[02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.840]
Am I, do I sound like I'm getting a little more stringent about this?

[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:01.220]
Because I'm certainly getting more and more pissed off.

[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:01.920]
No, that's really.

[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.440]
Oh, then I better start.

[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.140]
It's 1040 at 560, it's 1040 in the central time zone.

[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:10.520]
Don't do that, don't do that.

[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:15.820]
It's 1140, time is a waste of maybe, we've got the mad dog coming up at one, and then we've got Hank coming on at three,

[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:18.440]
in the studio, and then of course we've got Beno, with Hank at five.

[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:22.780]
And let me tell you about how you become a high paid computer professional and get yourself educated.

[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:26.940]
Educated like me, you heard me talk about the large number of jobs that are waiting for you out there.

[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:29.760]
The question is, how do you find a good school that will help you accomplish this?

[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.460]
Educated like Todd Dreck, educated in how to do nothing.

[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:34.960]
Now, but at fast train, they teach you how to do something.

[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:38.220]
Fast train is the one school that's got four convenient locations all over Dayton,

[02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:39.620]
Broward, including the New Wind and Kindle.

[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:44.440]
Fast train is the school that's got certified Microsoft instructors, convenient day evening weekend classes for you.

[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:47.240]
That's convenient to your schedule, whatever the hell it is, and between your drug deals.

[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:50.420]
There's one school that's got full-time job placement department over 30 years experience.

[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:55.040]
And with this school, fast train, you can complete your program and get certified in just four short months.

[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.920]
We're talking hands-on training so you can get out of your data and job and start making some real bucks.

[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:01.560]
And then really, well, you know what kind of a business you want to be on.

[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.680]
Get off your butt, pick up the phone call, fast train today at 1-866 fast train.

[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:11.280]
That's 1-866 fast train or check them out of the web at fasttrain.com.

[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:16.120]
You can see my dad look at this 420-0-560.

[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:17.540]
You way out.

[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:21.160]
You way out.

[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.320]
Go f**k yourself.

[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:35.760]
Where was I?

[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:40.100]
Look at Jesus, won't stay on.

[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:41.800]
The hair is blonde.

[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:45.740]
Shake my furniture and guide dog.

[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.840]
But there's a plate.

[02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:53.320]
Rather got her hiding.

[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:56.340]
I can make guys roll.

[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:59.440]
Not behind their seatbelt.

[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.320]
I can make guys roll.

[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.800]
With my body and booty.

[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.080]
That's where they are.

[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:08.840]
That's where.

[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.040]
Cause such a beauty is one of those things I've waited for.

[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:16.700]
The exact same girl.

[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.640]
I can make guys roll.

[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:23.160]
With my body and booty.

[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.440]
That's where they are.

[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:31.420]
Cause such a beauty is one of those things I've waited for.

[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:34.260]
The beard's back to back her.

[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:37.400]
The beard's back to back her.

[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.220]
745-560.

[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:47.160]
You know, I thought I'm back here.

[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.640]
I can do that thing again where I start playing both at the same time.

[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.760]
Don't you think that would be like a little fun?

[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:54.400]
We don't want to have too much fun.

[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:56.660]
No, that's why we have more around.

[02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:57.800]
We don't have too much fun.

[02:15:58.360 --> 02:15:59.080]
Grumpy old man.

[02:15:59.240 --> 02:15:59.860]
Anyway, here we go.

[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:01.860]
Hang on tight.

[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.500]
What is that?

[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:06.020]
What is that?

[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:06.540]
That's right.

[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:19.760]
Let's go to the next track.

[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:26.920]
They're both playing.

[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:30.980]
And you hear like a little bit of phasing in their country.

[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.700]
Where we're from.

[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:36.900]
Loving the things they all.

[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:38.660]
And they're in town.

[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:39.740]
They're in the things they all.

[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:40.520]
They're in town.

[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.560]
They're in the things they all.

[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:45.960]
Where you're from, baby.

[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.400]
All I've got are high.

[02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:53.460]
Right on the ground floor.

[02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:55.780]
Where I'm from.

[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.840]
I'm the medium of the apple tree.

[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:06.120]
I'm the medium of the...

[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:06.540]
Excellent.

[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.160]
So anyway, this thing you just factored me I find this most astonishing.

[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:11.100]
Oh, right, not really.

[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:11.800]
It shouldn't be that funny.

[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:16.140]
Charles Elmore of the Palm Beach Post is writing an article about Howard, Mo Howard David,

[02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:19.280]
and wants to comment for me in response to the one he made about me.

[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:23.100]
He tells this guy, I told him something in confidence and he used it on the year.

[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.100]
Now, he can only be referring to the comment about you.

[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:29.120]
He did the right thing and he backed off in terms of getting you fired.

[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:34.520]
Okay, I don't know what kind of company he has never ever said anything to me since we've had so little conversation.

[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:39.460]
Anyways, he's never said anything in his life to me that he said, oh, strictly confidential and don't repeat this.

[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:44.220]
If you say something in confidence, that means you're telling somebody, don't repeat this, right?

[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:47.700]
And I will make it a point to say something like that.

[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:48.960]
Right.

[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:50.580]
There was nothing in confidence.

[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.080]
He told me that right to my face, which was an admission that he tried to get your ass canned.

[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:55.860]
That's all he did.

[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:57.000]
Everybody in the building knows that.

[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:03.500]
He tried desperately trying to walk out if they didn't fire your ass, which I had to work feverishly for weeks and weeks and weeks to keep them from firing your ass.

[02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:06.640]
I got that message on my answering machine or on my voice mill from Greg Reed.

[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:07.760]
All great book by the way.

[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:08.300]
Congratulations.

[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.580]
Oh, and by the way, I'm decided to terminate George Rodriguez.

[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:12.980]
So there's your answer, Charles Elmore.

[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:13.940]
There's the answer for you.

[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:17.940]
He never told me anything in confidence and the man is full of crap as usual.

[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:21.480]
Just like all his other outrage when he first came to town.

[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:22.960]
He didn't go after Bill's in for his job.

[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:24.460]
He takes it very pretty.

[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:27.080]
Yeah, this guy is just a tragic.

[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:29.560]
There are no words to describe him.

[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.560]
And I really mean this.

[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:33.220]
I have never encountered a person.

[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:35.940]
And I use that term loosely like Mohaward in my life.

[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:40.120]
I think after they made that mold, they burned it.

[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.100]
They did something with it.

[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:42.860]
There's nothing like him.

[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:44.520]
Thank the Lord.

[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:51.440]
So, you know, reading that thing, you did the question from that writer in Palm Beach.

[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:53.380]
It's enough to make me play one of those bits now, you know?

[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:54.420]
But I probably won't.

[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:56.520]
That's would be a nice to me today, Mohaward.

[02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:58.120]
Don't mention it, Goldie.

[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:00.420]
You're not going to get raped again today, are you, Mohaward?

[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:01.500]
Yeah, you know why?

[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:02.780]
Why is that, Mohaward?

[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.400]
Because rape is not funny.

[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.680]
But I ain't going to be a mean man no more.

[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.020]
If they think that's funny, that's fine by me.

[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:11.100]
Wow, you really changed your way.

[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.360]
Ah, if I get about it.

[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:15.000]
I'm putting over all no big nootin' leafs.

[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.460]
You have a nice day and power, nice my cutly friend.

[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.100]
Hey, Mohaward, look out for that truck!

[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:23.120]
Ah, look out, look out, look out, look out!

[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:27.560]
Moe looks like a shapeless pile of gold.

[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.320]
You, you, you.

[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.260]
You show my respect, I don't issue.

[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:39.060]
I wasn't even told before that bastard boosted my shoes.

[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:46.920]
I don't wanna say I'm glad outside of here the messy old shmucky wasn't bad.

[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:49.280]
It's a Mahaya.

[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.600]
Oh, how would they just say this?

[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:54.900]
Oh, how would they just say this?

[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:56.520]
But it's wigless, I.

[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.880]
Oh, how would they just say this?

[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.440]
But it's wigless, I.

[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:02.740]
Oh, how would they just say this?

[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.360]
But it's wigless, I.

[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:06.140]
Oh, how would they just say this?

[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:08.920]
And by the way, Charles, Moe, was another guy's name at the Palm Beach Post?

[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:10.240]
Yes.

[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:16.640]
Maybe you'd like to talk to some of the other people at QAIM and see if they can even get honest answer out of them in terms of what they think about Moe and how their relationship is.

[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:18.460]
But nevertheless, that's your business you're writing the article.

[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:22.320]
At least he's writing something as opposed to Tommy over there at the Sun Central,

[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:25.080]
who's too busy writing about the cooking show schedules for the day.

[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:26.240]
That's his idea of a radio and TV.

[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:27.980]
I thought you were kidding.

[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:34.300]
And if you go back to that site where his column is and they had the list of all of his past columns,

[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:35.760]
that's a regular feature of his.

[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:39.280]
So the two things that he's got on there this week has claimed a fame.

[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:42.280]
With last Sunday he had his usual TV book, His Questions and Answers,

[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:46.040]
which I still think he makes up the questions then puts in the answers and at least some of them.

[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.640]
And the other one is the schedule for the cooking shows today.

[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:49.740]
And that's it.

[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.100]
You had the guy named American Idol of Final Last night that was watched by 80 trillion people.

[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:57.580]
Even though I don't care about him, it was a big story.

[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:00.360]
You got the stuff that's going on at QAIM.

[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:02.980]
You got the thing that happened with a conflict between you know,

[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:04.440]
what Jim Sarny wrote about that.

[02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:06.040]
But here's the guy that's supposed to be right about the media.

[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:09.080]
You have the thing with the, I don't want to go into it.

[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.600]
Everybody knows what I'm talking about.

[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:12.260]
The thing with party radio and power.

[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:14.380]
There is so much going on in this market.

[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:16.160]
And this man just is totally oblivious.

[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.660]
If he would pay as much attention to what he's supposed to be writing about as he does the daily racing form,

[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:23.340]
maybe the people who read the Sunset will know a little inside stuff.

[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.140]
What's going on in the radio in the market.

[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.100]
But then again, they can listen to the show and find out.

[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:29.400]
Thanks Tom, never thought about that.

[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:33.140]
Speaking of airport security, I thought I had these two other things.

[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:33.760]
Yes.

[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.680]
From CBS News, Attractive Guns in the Compit.

[02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:43.400]
Sources say the Bush administration plans to not have a small scale test program of arming commercial pilots

[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:45.800]
and it turned about from its previous opposition to the idea.

[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:50.340]
We want to move forward in a limited way so that the senior government official speaking on the condition of that in the media, of course,

[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:53.520]
to see whether or not based on fact guns would further security.

[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:59.040]
The administration said to be modeling its trial plan along the lines of similar proposals that circulated in Congress this summer.

[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:02.840]
One such plan would have armed as many as 1400 pilots, about 2% of those flying.

[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.200]
A source says the administration is on the brink of announcing the decision.

[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:07.020]
They're getting close.

[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:07.920]
In fact, look at it.

[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:08.240]
There he is.

[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.020]
It helps a hard ass.

[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:10.740]
Not helps the plane as it turns.

[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:13.040]
I want people going back to work in America.

[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:14.240]
What do you say to that about hard ass?

[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:15.380]
Yeah, that's what I heard.

[02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:16.500]
Hard ass.

[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.560]
One of the tales of the plan is still being worked out by the TSA.

[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:20.560]
Oh, there's no more monetic.

[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.020]
And he's got his ugly finger in there.

[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:26.980]
And other officials, the basic framework for limited test programs have been essentially drawn up.

[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:30.660]
Details on how many pilots could participate in the length of the program, haven't been finalized yet.

[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:34.240]
The government source said adding that the cost liability and training issues are still being worked out.

[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:40.720]
Maybe we can make a schedule and show everybody in America and all over the world which pilots on which flights are going to have been.

[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.420]
Okay.

[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:42.960]
Just to make sure that it's meaningless.

[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:50.580]
Transportation Undersecretary John McGau who headed the new TSA on till July said it may not allow pilots to carry guns.

[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:55.480]
Reinforce cockpit and armed air marshals provide enough protection against terrorists who try to take over a plane he'd be saying.

[02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:58.820]
The responsibility of the pilots to control the aircraft McGau said.

[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:02.740]
The use of firearms aboard the U.S. aircraft must be limited to those thoroughly trained members of law enforcement.

[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:06.140]
Our position is made that the cockpit makes the cockpit as safe as we can.

[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:07.820]
Control that plane and get it on the ground.

[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:12.360]
Having thousands of armed pilots in airports would mean thousands of weapons that could fall the wrong hands.

[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:16.800]
McGau said at the time we just don't want to subject to transportation system to additional firearms he said.

[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:27.100]
But the House in July voted 310 to 113 to allow commercial pilots to carry guns giving the proposal momentum and TSA secretary Nourmannett said soon after when he was re-examining the issue.

[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:35.600]
The airlines have generally opposed plans to our pilots while the pilots union and the NRA of course have backstarts proposed it.

[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:37.040]
And I do two as a matter of fact.

[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:38.200]
Don't you?

[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:39.640]
Yeah.

[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.480]
Huh?

[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:43.020]
You don't want your pilot having a gun.

[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.060]
You don't fly anywhere anyway.

[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:44.360]
Right.

[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:46.060]
Once the last time you flew anywhere.

[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:50.000]
What decade was that last decade?

[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:51.320]
Airports.

[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:51.620]
Airports.

[02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:52.020]
I guess.

[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.020]
Oh, that's a long time ago.

[02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:56.400]
Airports won't be security mandate.

[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:57.720]
Don't forget that's your cargo trip.

[02:23:58.840 --> 02:23:59.040]
Oh yeah.

[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.040]
You had two very close together flights on there.

[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.440]
The trip up and then when they send you back fans right after the show.

[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:04.260]
Thanks a lot Disney.

[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:09.100]
Well, basically they didn't want to like spend money to keep the underlings in their Chicago.

[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:09.880]
That's my opinion.

[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:10.800]
I'm like Disney.

[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:12.680]
Airports won't meet security mandate.

[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:14.040]
This goes back to that story before.

[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:19.840]
If terrorists ever again target US aviation, the threat is likely to be centered right in the belly of an airplane.

[02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:22.680]
Security experts agree a suitcase bomb presents the greatest risk.

[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:30.160]
Yet as CBS News Correspondent Bob or reports, four months before a year-end deadline requiring that all check bags be scanned for explosives,

[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:32.520]
most luggage is not being screened.

[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:37.820]
Now the nation's biggest airports warn there is no way to meet the mandate without major disruptions.

[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:47.260]
Jeff Fiegan chief executive officer in Dallas, Fort Worth airports said they're not enough time money or space to install the 60 bomb scanners needed to scan the 55,000 bags take each day.

[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:55.060]
We have a very difficult time understanding how that's going to happen at this airport and at the same time not create very long lines and really adverse impact on our customers.

[02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:02.020]
Instead, screeners will use small explosive trace detectors and crowded ticket lobbies to conduct invasive searches for bombs.

[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:09.340]
The protocol calls for about 60% of the bags actually be opened in some patients as Fiegan, so that would actually take place right here in front of all other customers.

[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:16.380]
Most major US airports face a similar crunch because the TSA is nowhere close to having enough equipment or manpower, nowhere even close.

[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:23.780]
To meet the deadline, the TSA needs 1100 TTX bombs canters, 5600 handheld trace detectors, and 22,000 screeners,

[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:33.280]
so far only 240 scanners have been installed, pro-100 detectors in our airports and only 175 screeners have been hired of the 22,000 that they need.

[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.680]
Right now we're thinking there will probably be 20 to 30 airports where we won't be able to meet the December 31st deadline, says Nora Maneta.

[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:41.760]
Puts.

[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:47.660]
Maneta, who's promised to move passengers through security checkpoints in 10 minutes, can see its hand searches at those airports will cause big delays.

[02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:55.340]
It may take an hour and a half to two hours to do what he says. That's why airports and passenger advocates now are pushing Congress to delay the December 31st back screening deadline.

[02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:00.720]
And of course based on the New York Daily News and the experiment, what difference does it make if they go through and check this stuff anyway?

[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:03.980]
They opened up some of those bags and still didn't find a goddamn guns.

[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.400]
I just think it's an impossible dream, says Tom Parsons who runs bestfares.com.

[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:17.920]
Unless Congress backs off Parsons, says K-Ocel Rule the airports. It's going to be an aggravating, says you think we had long lines before? I think you're going to see an even longer lines.

[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:24.060]
Airlines say they simply can't afford that with flights and passengers off 10% as your losses could top 5 billion.

[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:31.000]
Until security holds like an adequate baggage screenings are closed, the US Aviation Industry runs the risk of losing even more, it says.

[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:32.860]

[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:59.040]
I just stayed cold steam, but you can call me Kelsey. Whenever I'm in town, I listen to, wait a minute, I am in town.

[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:00.820]
It's the 12-1 hour.

[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.320]
This is former vast president of the United States, Al Gore.

[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:12.600]
I have recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion to take pot shots at the president.

[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:24.740]
I have reappeared, much like Pux-Litani Phil, the groundhog creature that reappears each year to determine whether or not we'll have an early spring.

[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:34.680]
I wish it to be known that it was I who was responsible for saving the lives of those nine miners in Pennsylvania over the weekend.

[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:41.040]
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it as not to appear a spotlight hog.

[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:45.920]
However, I feel the American people have a right to know the truth.

[02:28:46.980 --> 02:28:54.200]
Here's what happened. Upon hearing of this unfortunate accident, I'll race to the scene.

[02:28:55.220 --> 02:29:01.220]
I lowered myself into the mine using an old Ron Popeel pocket fisherman and some bailing wire.

[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:11.780]
Down, down, down, into the depths of darkness I sank, never thinking of my own safety, but rather of the safety of those man on the ground.

[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:18.720]
When I reached the miners, they said to me, hey, you're the guy that invented the internet, right?

[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.400]
I said yes.

[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:29.720]
We all had a Mike's hard lemonade, which I brought with me down into the hole, and then we sat around and re-enacted the fart scene from blazing saddles.

[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:32.000]
I thought you should know the truth.

[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:41.160]
And now, much like the Groundhog creature pucks the tawny filth, I'll flink back into the darkness of oblivion until I am needed again.

[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:44.520]
This is Al Gore, super hero.

[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:48.760]
Yeah, well, let you know Al, don't worry. It's trouble one at five sixty WQM are bringing you into one hour.

[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:53.300]
246 votes on the poll. Which of these women do you most strongly think is a beard for gay celebrities?

[02:29:54.480 --> 02:30:05.120]
Elizabeth Taylor, 65, all of the above 55, Lisa Marie Pressley, 36, none of the above 22, Britney Spears, 17, Anna Cornel, 17, JLo, B, having ten now, she's in double digits,

[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.280]
Janet Jackson and Brooke Shields, each have nine, and Nicole Kibman, who just got on list here, moments ago, has already got six.

[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:14.360]
What a shame she was not there right from the beginning, you know, she might give them a run for their honey.

[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:25.340]
Man with 16 guns arrested in DC speaking of gun nuts, the man was arrested yesterday afternoon in downtown Washington after a cache of weapons including ten rifles and six handguns was found in his car law enforcement sources said.

[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:33.580]
The man whom sources identified as Jeffrey Klucce, no relation to NHL gold tender Dan Klucce, has not been charged yet and will probably face a court appearance today, probably.

[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:40.740]
In fact, he may be in there right now. Klucce is in secret service custody, has been questioned the sources said, a woman was in the car and she was detained as well.

[02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:50.660]
The car was a rented Chevrolet Cavalier sources said, uh oh, the alert to locate the vehicle man was thought to be driving first came from the Newport New Hampshire Police Department, Tuesday, Nettacorn, one law enforcement official.

[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:54.380]
It was usually after the man made comments about need to go to Washington to get things straightened out.

[02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:03.960]
Word of the search for the vehicle became public in Philadelphia after local media outlet reported police communications describing the vehicle, getting straightened out.

[02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:13.940]
That's what Michael wanted to do in Vegas too. Was that buy him out? You buy me out? I buy you out. I was making my bones while you were banging cheerleaders.

[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:24.140]
Plainist attorney, say victim still considering church's settlement offer. This in stark contrast to the story we had yesterday, which turns out to be as usual since it came from the church officials.

[02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:43.500]
Another lie liar liar your robes are on fire. This is from the Boston Globe. Of course the attorney for the alleged sex abuse victims of the frock priest John Gagan said yesterday that reports of a tentative $10 million settlement between the Boston Arts Dices and his clients are premature a premature evaluation.

[02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:53.720]
He had father to abuse ever problem with that. Squirt, squirt. In a late morning news conference yesterday attorney Mitchell Girabideon said there is an offer of $10 million. There's been no acceptance to call a tentative would be inaccurate.

[02:31:54.360 --> 02:32:00.280]
He said his 86 clients were considering the proposal but he declined to say how many agreed to it. Many have signed many have not signed he said.

[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:09.520]
The Reverend Christopher coin a spokesman for the Arts Dices refused yesterday to confirm the amount of the settlement offer but said the negotiations were moving swiftly on both sides and were pretty close to a deal.

[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:21.040]
Oh, don't you love. Just just the verbiage of that makes me want to barf. We're pretty close to a deal. How much does it going to cross the chart?

[02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:27.220]
Now if Moe would have said to me how much can I pay you? How much will I pay you to keep this quiet?

[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:34.540]
That would have done it. We're taking a lot more than that. Here's a guy I'm interrupting the store but I'll get back to it.

[02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:44.180]
Here's a guy who comes in and thinks he can go around and backstab and he's going to manipulate and he's going to wait around. He's a big shot and he's going to get you fired and nobody's going to know about it.

[02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:50.080]
The best part of the thing is one of the reasons that Muff was in a rubber room for so long is because they never even told him about it.

[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:59.680]
Moe had nothing to do with that. Right. So in a moment of weakness in a moment of where candor he leaned back in that chair and said to me and certainly not in confidence.

[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:04.180]
You know why George is still here because I did the right thing. I backed off.

[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:12.780]
Which is an admission that he was the one as if anybody didn't already know that but here is the smoking gun right there. He backed off.

[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:20.060]
So he actually thought he could do all this manipulation around there, get you fired and nobody would ever know how it really happened as if I'm going to shut up about it.

[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:26.020]
See when you start messing with my people Moe that's when it gets on the air along with all your other hanky panky.

[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:33.560]
What the hell was that saying? I don't know. I forgot. There's no settlement at this point but we're all working toward it. He said the Reverend Christopher coin.

[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:40.500]
This doesn't mean we're stepping back from it. It just means it was a little premature to be reported in the media as such. Right. It was a media's fall. Right.

[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:45.260]
The previous deal has to be worth as much as 30 million was announced in March but the art style.

[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:54.980]
So he's backed out in May when its finance council rejected that they backed out. Good Christians that they are. Good law abiding. Good the truth telling a catlicks that they are.

[02:33:55.180 --> 02:34:05.680]
They backed out. We changed their mind. The new offer which has been approved by the finance council has made late July before the sides went to court to determine whether the earlier settlement was biting said laws attorney J. Owen Todd.

[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:15.120]
Here a beating is as just constant. Swini to enforce the earlier agreement which called for the art's diocese to make payments to victims ranging from 10 grand to almost a million bucks a piece.

[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:23.460]
Swini had encouraged lawyers to settle before she ruled on the first offer here a beating said those amounts will be reduced proportionally or about two thirds under the new deal.

[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:29.660]
Some are the victims would still receive $10,000 while the victims themselves would receive approximately 25 to $320,000.

[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:35.420]
Very very small amounts for screwing up people's lives. It's not all about money contrary to what some people say.

[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:42.200]
Your median said my clients just want closure. They want to get out with their lives closure robes father people are starting to talk.

[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:49.600]
Here a median said one possible remaining obstacle is that some clients want to be allowed to make victim impact statements in court describing how the abuse is affected their lives.

[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:55.600]
The agreement involves some 86 plaintiffs 70 who allegedly abused by gig and 16 relatives of victims who have sued the art's diocese.

[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:06.080]
Todd said your median told me yesterday morning that all but one of the plaintiffs had agreed to the $10 million settlement but your median said yesterday that was not true not true all plaintiffs must agree for the deal to be finalized.

[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:09.420]
So who do you believe you believe the art's diocese? Oh you believe them.

[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:17.860]
Don't think so they have what you call just a slight credibility problem the art's diocese especially that one there in Boston and Cardinal a law.

[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:23.440]
Who still I mean the fact that he still there is just mind boggling it's just astonishing.

[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:33.460]
They don't take their marching orders from you the people the congregation or the law or the law because in that art's diocese he beat the law more ways than one.

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:42.800]
I've been holding this story off and I because it's been near the bottom of my pile and it I told you before the show this has got to get on before I forget about it.

[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:51.040]
UK and this is perfect for them too for the Brits UK marks public toilet anniversary this was the August 14 so I've been sitting on it for a couple of weeks.

[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:52.420]
That's all this for it.

[02:35:52.900 --> 02:36:03.360]
Proud of the past but embarrassed by the present Britain marked the 150th anniversary of its public toilets Wednesday which you're whatever Wednesday that was in August amid warnings the public convenience is disappearing from its streets.

[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:18.400]
Bearing the shield Hamlet and Trident of a national symbol Britannia model Michelle Libertro laid a giant penny against the ratings of a subterranean Lou in central London near the spot on fleets street where Britain's first public toilet opened in 1852.

[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:21.040]
I wonder if they also had available dispensing machines for fleet animals.

[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:22.900]
Wouldn't you think?

[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:23.980]
Why not?

[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:36.020]
In the Lou or in Lou of a finger they have coin up tampon machines public toilets. I know that public toilets traditionally cost depending to use and to spend a penny became a common expression for going to the Lou.

[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:46.860]
Well worth it twice the price I'd say the historic fleets free toilet is now closed many others are following in Amsterdam they don't have what they call a lot.

[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:53.040]
I don't know not that kind of it's not like a real toilet they just have those things where you stand in P like a surrounded by a green.

[02:36:53.860 --> 02:37:03.120]
Huh it's a stall a urinal stall yeah but I mean it's surrounded partially by a green I don't know some kind of a screen thing you know green screen a green screen.

[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:15.840]
And of course if you really want to get a good look there's no problem 47% of public convenience is in England cities of post since 1995 according to the audit commission last year there were 50 800 public toilets in England one for every 8000 inhabitants wow.

[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:43.000]
The number of public toilets in the UK is limited in declining especially for women who have about half as much provision as men to start with said clear agreed an academic from the University of the West of England with the studying public toilets well that's great and that's something what do you do when you're academic work I study public toilets somebody's got to yeah somebody's got to check out the crap yet it's men not women who provoked a debate about an adequate provision because of the growing incidence of street urination I see so they must be talking about the same things.

[02:37:43.640 --> 02:38:11.580]
Because obviously the women need like a full a full service job with the seat you know right but when you're talking about the one for the man they must be the same public toilets were introduced in the 19th century to stop the spread of disease through public following public following that a baseball term yes and many of London's Victorian lose our graceful structures tiled underground chambers encircled by iron fences and crowned with arches or pergolas what are pergolas don't remember that there was a restaurant called our pergola.

[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:41.420]
I have no idea what that is many are now padlocked and resting while others have found a new life as cafes flower shop theaters and I clubs public public toilets are an important element of creating accessible sustainable cities greed said but a lot of authorities take the view that they're too expensive and too much trouble to maintain greed said Britain's neglect of its toilet heritage contrasted with a restroom revolution in East Asia all with thank God I may have to be going there Singapore's governments declared clean public toilets a hallmark of a gracious society and last year hosted a world toilet summit.

[02:38:41.580 --> 02:39:11.480]
Oh you see if I would have missed this story you never would have known and nobody in this audience would have known unless they were there so how do you spell pergola P E R G O L A how else would you spell it come on P E R G O L A pergola you finding it I'm finding it and what does it say oh that's right I forgot you're on a I can't believe how slow that thing is that that was embarrassing that little thing before we both went to the Sun Sentinel and I was I was reading Tommy's schedule for the cooking

[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:23.440]
shows and you were still trying to find the columns so what does pergola mean if you found it an Arbor or passageway of columns supporting a roof of oh here's another words trellis work on which

[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:36.080]
climbing plants are trained to grow how lovely wouldn't you like to take a real heavy dump in the middle of a surrounded by that sounds sounds very inviting to me man I think I could just really let out some

[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:54.280]
anyway Singapore's governments declared public toilets a hummarker gracious society and last year hosted that world toilet summit the city of Siwan South Korea so proud of its futuristic lose it builds itself as a city with the most beautiful public toilet in the world this is not from a British paper by the way it's from news day and yet to keep using that term Lou

[02:39:55.740 --> 02:40:24.260]
the British toilet association lobbies for better bathrooms and its law of the year awards recognize excellence in public conveniences oh man authorities in West Men's through the central London borough of the country's busiest public toilets the little less how do you say that luster square or is that light sister see that's like Worcester but I don't know the Brits I don't know how they do the luster square losers more than a million customers here has devised ingenious ways to combat street urination the borough has set up open aerosol and busy tourist areas and plants to introduce color to the world

[02:40:24.260 --> 02:40:42.020]
and the lack of the urinals invented in the Netherlands that can rise out of the sidewalks on Friday and Saturday nights how do you like that leave it to those Dutch baby they know their crap and their cheap that's where the that term came from Dutch treated you know that we were talking about that oh yeah I think you are kind of out you were very astute about that

[02:40:42.020 --> 02:41:11.840]

Iraq would open the gates of hell in the Middle East Arabic Secretary General Amir Musa

[02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:16.060]
miki Musa said on Thursday today speaking at the end of an Arab League Foreign Minister's

[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:20.820]
meeting in Cairo Musa urged Iraq to allow UN weapons inspections to resume in a bid to head off

[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:25.660]
a US attack but he warned no Arab country looks after any threat on any other Arab country well

[02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:30.480]
wow the statement comes today after President George W. Metzini members of Congress to discuss a

[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:35.540]
possible US action against Iraq the US accused the Iraq of blah blah blah the claims are backed by

[02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:39.980]
British Prime Minister Tony Blair who is to fly the US for talks with Bush and Kant David about a

[02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:46.120]
possible military strike Musa said US threats risk in flaming a background of frustration and anger

[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:50.420]
over the ongoing Israeli palestitian conflict and action against Iraq with the general opposition

[02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:54.760]
to the world I believe would lead the serious repercussions in this region and perhaps beyond he said

[02:45:56.120 --> 02:46:05.320]
there you go Nick Bride gets backing on Reno turf lengthy article should I go with it well you

[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:31.120]
be mothers a few Jews and Netherlands my landlord ain't too happy about it Bill McBride burst

[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:34.820]
out of the final battleground of his campaign for governing yesterday achieving celebrity status in

[02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:40.860]
the South Florida home base of Democratic Party rival Janet Reno the one time small town high school

[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:46.340]
football jok learned a little Yiddish sip Cuban coffee in little Havana evaded talk of alien

[02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:51.900]
Gonzalez on Spanish radio and chatted across town with Haitian American leaders Reno also in Miami

[02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:56.320]
campaigned among her core supporters of blacks and seniors and appeared unfazed by her rivals in

[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:00.680]
Roads in her hometown where she was elected state attorney five count him five times

[02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:06.140]
McBride has got no intention of winning the majority votes in the region on Tuesday merely to

[02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:10.420]
avert a Reno blowout by convincing undecided voters they should consider him rather than the more

[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:15.380]
famous US attorney general they're talking about being a day in South Florida ultimately McBride

[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:19.980]
strategy is hoped to widdle Reno's percentage lead in South Florida just 60 to 40% and

[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:23.760]
advantage small enough that a presumed McBride landslide in several north Florida would have

[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:28.280]
known him the nominee Miami date is the battleground McBride a Tampa lawyer told a crowd of supporters

[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:32.520]
on his arrival at Opalak airport his best weapon in Miami is date county mayor Alex Penga

[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:37.520]
Pakenia a Cuban American Democrat who on Wednesday officially handed his political machine to McBride

[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:41.740]
for the primaries final six days he's the best chance that we Democrats have to recapture the

[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:45.540]
governor's mansion said Penga Pakenia who's on a short list of people McBride's considering for

[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:49.400]
running mate shooting win the primary all we can only pray take him with you please bill

[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:54.080]
we'll pack you up on media no Che Reno meanwhile defender Turfiest today with the

[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:58.140]
appearances that they mostly black Miami Jackson high school where the principal hailed her as a hero

[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:02.780]
in recent days the former dates that are turning a scene a 30 point lead over McBride dwindled

[02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:09.160]
away virtual tie amid a large TV ad campaign for McBride have you seen any Reno spots uh I saw a spot

[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:17.260]
rip in him I guess that was a Reno spot written in what no ripping him oh you have seen one yes

[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:22.600]
no that was a that was a boy spot okay then I haven't seen any Janet spots I haven't seen

[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:26.340]
any either of course I'm not there Reno's also watches their party establish and see Thomas

[02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:30.700]
right I can't keep track with it Reno's also watches their party establishments move more aggressively

[02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:35.000]
to push her down with US representatives Korean Brown Jacksonville and Alcy Hastings of Fort Lauderdale

[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.860]
backing McBride and new endorsements coming yesterday from Penga Pakenia and US representative Bob

[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:44.160]
Waxler of Wilka Ratton Reno said she wasn't surprised by panelists endorsement alluding to their

[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:48.300]
dispute over the alien custody case the mayor has had some issues with me over the past she said

[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:53.340]
I think that's fairly obvious Reno who drove through Miami on her final red truck tour across the

[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:58.460]
state before the primary maintains that McBride's endorsements below diddled do little to diddle

[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:02.960]
will do little to dim enthusiasm for her campaign this election has been about contact with the

[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:06.320]
people themselves that's what all counts you said this election's gonna be one with the voters

[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:11.300]
but as Reno courts blacks and seniors in an attempt to salvage her campaign McBride's

[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:15.620]
McBride's boulder moves on her turf since strong signals that she'll have to fight in South Florida

[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:20.780]
for the landslide she needs to make up for her rivalry rivals popularity farther north McBride

[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:24.780]
and wouldn't you think like a Cuban Democrats which there aren't you know there are some three if

[02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:31.620]
they're not gonna vote for her they're not gonna vote for a Democrat anyway I say Cuban Democrats

[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:36.060]
I don't think there are any six McBride or Reno have left the other rival states

[02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:39.760]
Senator Gerald Jones far behind in the polls Jones campaign to date brought upon each count

[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.680]
yesterday visiting newspaper editorial boards appearing on a radio station talking with two

[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:47.700]
Democratic groups and they'll say who the hell are you McBride's strategy to see a stop in South

[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:51.660]
Florida is a critical juncture once been a slowly developing but carefully constructed approach

[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:56.120]
to winning a Democratic primary rather than competing hit on the vote rich but expensive stronghold

[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:00.540]
of the party McBride first built his credibility elsewhere won the backing of organized labor and

[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:05.300]
used TV ads to catch Reno in the polls we could have spent hundreds of days and millions of dollars

[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:09.860]
and saw how many resources and tried to compete for South Florida said Robyn Rorapal McBride's

[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:13.420]
campaign manager but we've slowly built a foundation and we're reaping the rewards of that

[02:50:13.420 --> 02:50:18.500]
foundation the rewards were huge yesterday for man who was so obscure when he began his campaign

[02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:23.420]
he didn't even register in the polls nine TV cameras at the Pingham Picanian Doresment five TV

[02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:27.160]
treks per afternoon coffee at the little of Antelayne Mark Versailles restaurant and the world

[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:31.540]
treatment from a friendly Spanish radio talk show host McBride's campaign also showed the kind of

[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:35.700]
see the only reason they're friendly to him is because they hate Janet right McBride's campaign

[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:39.680]
also showed the kind of organization seen in the region lately only from governor Bush two private

[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:43.860]
plans carrying the candidate and press corps and a care of an of SUVs shepherding the entourage

[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:47.600]
through busy streets works for who's heavily Jewish district should be Reno's safest

[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:52.000]
to rain in Florida for a plan that he's backing McBride for one reason I want to beat Jeb Bush so

[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.140]
badly he says people know Janet Reno well respect her he said but I want to tell my constituents

[02:50:56.140 --> 02:51:00.460]
that I now know Bill McBride very well and he can beat Jeb Bush nice going there Bob

[02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:05.840]
amen works we're got a laugh among the overwhelming the Jewish crowd when he welcome McBride to the

[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:12.380]
Mishbaja Yiddish for family oh by the way you realized that this weekend is Russia Shana no I didn't

[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:15.580]
I can't we got no one here and we got you him Kipper coming yeah this weird head I believe is

[02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:20.060]
Russia Shana happy to I knew you're the most intriguing move with the day came from Penga

[02:51:20.060 --> 02:51:23.880]
Pakenya who's entry into the free offers a lesson subtle reminder to one decided Cuban American

[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:28.460]
Democrats of Reno's role in the alien affair the mayor who addressed the credit opalakia

[02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:32.600]
important English and Spanish spent the day with McBride translating for him on Spanish language

[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:38.180]
WQBA and it's according him to Versailles. Penelope's been a bit of a gamble from a bride who in the

[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:41.720]
past two weeks has pulled even with Reno and the polls along many Democrats do remember the mayor

[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:47.120]
for his absence during the 2000 presidential election nearly lost by Al Gore while outside of

[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:51.160]
Miami many remember his threats to the five federal authorities if Reno ordered alien return to

[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:56.060]
his father in Cuba. A new herald poll of likely primary voters shows that Penelope wins high

[02:51:56.060 --> 02:52:00.980]
marks from 54 percent of Democrats but among non white Hispanics McBride's base Penelope's not so

[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:06.180]
popular winning approval from just 45 percent the issue appeared to Vex McBride asked repeatedly

[02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:09.840]
whether Reno made the right call on alien he declined to answer in grasp for ways to evade the

[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:16.640]
question. Aaaaah who? That kind of thing as his standing rises in the polls McBride's come under

[02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:20.940]
increasing criticism from Republicans who produce TV ads questioning his record is managing partner

[02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:25.100]
Hollywood night law firm McBride countered with a new ad yesterday that extolls newspaper endorsements

[02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:29.200]
and asks why is Jeff Bush trying to smear him? McBride told supporters they should judge him not

[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:35.160]
in the GOP ads but other factors judge me by my friends he said and there you go I think he's got

[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:39.660]
a shot what do you think I think he's got a shot good let's vote for Bill McBride 40 or 50 times okay

Until you see the human chain

[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:39.140]
And giant water will rise

[03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:41.440]
Where you grab a drooper a raft

[03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:44.300]
I take your blood and up

[03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:46.200]
To a symbiotracy

[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:47.220]

Back stops the fuel down

[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:52.920]
Under water and drown the back around

[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:55.120]
To work a rough middle down

[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.560]
It's the biggest parking beverage scene

[03:04:57.560 --> 03:05:00.320]
Now people make your all the toilet for clean

[03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:01.720]
The tide is on a raft

[03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:04.120]
Like a big shock media star

[03:05:04.120 --> 03:05:06.360]
And they'll guard your car

[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:09.020]
It's all about how important you feel

[03:05:09.020 --> 03:05:11.700]
When the rest of the hundred-six is all they can

[03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:13.180]
For a thousand years' fun

[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:15.460]
Go down the alien part

[03:05:34.740 --> 03:05:36.980]
There's an ion zeer from the Rosecoach band

[03:05:36.980 --> 03:05:39.580]
And rockin' music by LaFan band

[03:05:40.120 --> 03:05:41.180]
While it gives you crampant

[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:43.480]
A teaser de la van

[03:05:43.480 --> 03:05:45.660]
Under a coffee glass

[03:05:45.660 --> 03:05:48.240]
I take the rod and swim in the car's late plays

[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:50.100]
That's you and play by Abby Blood

[03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:51.020]
And it's Tuesday

[03:05:51.020 --> 03:05:52.620]
That's for me boiling that stuff

[03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:54.800]
We'll create a new alcohol alien on part

[03:05:54.800 --> 03:05:57.620]
To the alien on part

[03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:00.580]
Oh, alien alien on part

[03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:07.500]
Okay, here I'm the part where he's about to like the hot people

[03:06:07.500 --> 03:06:09.040]
And that's about your left stuff

[03:06:09.560 --> 03:06:10.340]
Here rid of it

[03:06:10.340 --> 03:06:12.860]
No, I just, I don't know why he does that

[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:15.060]
You know what I'm talking about

[03:06:15.060 --> 03:06:16.100]
So you can talk over it

[03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:17.520]
I don't want to talk over it

[03:06:17.520 --> 03:06:19.620]
I don't want to be interrupted, okay?

[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:20.220]
Yeah, but

[03:06:22.380 --> 03:06:22.700]
1246

[03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:25.420]
At 560 WQIM

[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:27.740]
This is not in the local papers

[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:30.400]
What is your name?

[03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:32.140]
Dana Kennedy, C-A-N-E-D-1

[03:06:32.140 --> 03:06:34.440]
Never heard of her before, but anyway, she writes in today's New York Times

[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:36.560]
Miami facing new challenge on gay rights

[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.580]
More than two decades after the campaign by the entertainer

[03:06:39.580 --> 03:06:42.520]
Anita Bryant to overturn one of the country's first gay rights ordinances

[03:06:42.520 --> 03:06:44.740]
Divided Miami and cast the city as a symbol of intolerance

[03:06:45.480 --> 03:06:47.200]
Voters will face the issue again on Tuesday

[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.840]
Conservative Christian groups have placed a measure on a ballot to repeal a date

[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:52.220]
County ordinance approved four years ago

[03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:53.980]
Protecting gays from discrimination

[03:06:53.980 --> 03:06:55.420]
But this time to move forward

[03:06:55.420 --> 03:06:58.000]
Repail is the met with outrage by many residents and city leaders

[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:01.160]
Who are not just opposed to it but are actively campaigning against it

[03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:03.320]
The battle over the initiative is hardly charged

[03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:06.980]
And being closely watched by gay rights activists and civil civil rights organizations

[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:09.960]
Nationally, but the outcome may be more measure of just how much

[03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:12.980]
Miami has evolved in its acceptance of diverse lifestyles

[03:07:12.980 --> 03:07:14.700]
Since the first measure was repealed

[03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:17.300]
In the city often divided by race and ethnicity

[03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:20.240]
Applied release yesterday by the herald and local NBC television

[03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:21.160]
I love that

[03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:22.720]
And the local NBC television

[03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:25.000]
See, they don't say NBC too many times

[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.280]
They're not going to give them any publicity

[03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:27.120]
Why the hell should they?

[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:27.620]
They suck

[03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:30.880]
Found strong opposition to repeal measure in all racial left-wing groups

[03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:34.020]
They might not talk so bad if they didn't have old funny deadies like Ike Siemens working there

[03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:37.020]
We're trying to build an image of international metropolis

[03:07:37.020 --> 03:07:38.920]
A bridge among cultures but we would be saying

[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:41.580]
By the way, it's okay to discriminate based on sexual orientation

[03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:43.760]
Said Mayor Alex Pingafikini of Dave County

[03:07:43.760 --> 03:07:44.840]
That would just be wrong

[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:47.420]
We'd be turning the clock back several years that's clock with an L

[03:07:47.420 --> 03:07:51.020]
Mayor Pingafikini has become so involved in the issue that he's recorded a phone message

[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:54.540]
That's being played a residence in which he urges them to vote against the repeal

[03:07:54.540 --> 03:07:56.020]
Just say to repeal

[03:07:56.700 --> 03:07:59.440]
Hundreds of other prominent Miami business civic community and religious leaders

[03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:01.700]
Including the singer Gloria Estefan

[03:08:02.460 --> 03:08:03.560]
I always liked her didn't we?

[03:08:04.320 --> 03:08:06.120]
She sent us all those things every year

[03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:09.240]
Latin television person out of Christina Sarra

[03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:11.160]
What is it? Sarra like we?

[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:14.300]
They are Sarra like we

[03:08:15.060 --> 03:08:15.920]
Is that how you're right?

[03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:17.960]
Now how come you don't know this Mr. Speck?

[03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:19.780]
I thought we've been through this

[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:21.760]
The Latin TV personality Christina

[03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:25.400]
And the mayors of more than 30 County municipalities also support the notice discrimination

[03:08:25.400 --> 03:08:27.080]
Save Dave campaign opposing the repeal

[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:31.580]
Civic and community leaders say repeal with none of what's threatened the livelihood of local gay men and lesbians

[03:08:31.580 --> 03:08:33.540]
But also the county's all important to his ministry

[03:08:33.540 --> 03:08:36.520]
Miami's image as an international city that embraces diversity

[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:42.060]
Proponents of repeal led by a group called Take Back Miami Day in supported by the Christian Coalition of Dave County

[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:43.320]
Other conservative religious groups

[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:44.740]
A bunch of far-bic and agglom

[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:47.980]
Says the ordinance extends unnecessary protection to people with deviant lifestyles

[03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:52.640]
Since getting the measure on the ballot supporters become less vocal in face of widespread criticism

[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:57.740]
But Nathaniel Wilcox co-chairment of Take Back Day which was formed to support the repeal set of gays

[03:08:57.740 --> 03:09:02.140]
They're using a tactic of deception in order to get into government to force their lifestyle on people

[03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:03.920]
As a Christian as a man of God

[03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:07.460]
I can't stand up and justify backing a behavior that destroys families

[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:13.340]
The ordinance was passed in December 98 when Dave County commission voted 7-6 to amend the county's anti-discrimination ordinance

[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:17.340]
To prohibit unequal treatment of gays and housing employment, credit and finance and public accommodation

[03:09:17.340 --> 03:09:20.260]
The 98 ordinance is similar to the one that had been overturned

[03:09:20.260 --> 03:09:22.640]
At the time there were two catalysts for the change here

[03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:29.040]
One was the case of Matthew Shepherd, a gay callous student in Wyoming who died October 98 after it was kidnapped beaten and tied to a fence for 18 hours

[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:37.720]
The other factor was that Dave political and civil leaders rallied behind the measure arguing that intolerance was bad for an economy that depended on tourism and accounting with a sizable gay population

[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:43.740]
Today more than ever beaches, trendy South Beach section is heavily populated with gay residents that trash many gays tourist each year

[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:47.560]
Organizers of the repeal initiative and determined a challenge ordinance as it was passed

[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:51.400]
Take back Mommy Dave failed to obtain a signatures on a petition to get to each one about 1999

[03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:57.480]
The group reorganized and gained the signatures needed some of them even for real to get the measure before the voters next Tuesday

[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:06.520]
About 230 municipalities in 11 other states and DC have anti-discrimination ordinances that extend protection to gay men and lesbians according to the national gay and lesbian task force

[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:13.500]
Officials in Ipsilanti, Michigan to call the Washington and Westbrook main said yesterday that challenges to similar ordinances in their cities also were pending

[03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:18.300]
MyME, though seen as a key battleground on the issue because of the historical significance of local ordinance

[03:10:18.300 --> 03:10:21.180]
We've decided to draw a line in the sand and we will stop them

[03:10:21.180 --> 03:10:24.840]
Laurie Jean, executive director of the National Gay and lesbian task force set up the repeal organizers

[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:29.520]
People all over the country are watching this and we want to show the world that the people of Dave County aren't going to tolerate it

[03:10:31.380 --> 03:10:36.860]
The strategizing over the ordinance issue here is a time to resemble the guerrilla warfare in one development, the legitimacy of the petition

[03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:45.320]
Ravers called into question when two supporters of the repeal were arrested in August and charged with falsely claiming to witness petition signatures and to others charged with illegally notarizing their own signatures

[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:49.600]
That defendants have pleaded not guilty of the charges which their lawyer called politically motivated

[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:57.940]
In another controversy, the repeal organizers circulated a fire in August at black churches that included an image of the Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King and a picture of two men kissing

[03:10:57.940 --> 03:11:04.680]
It said Martin Luther King did not march or die for this and urged worshippers to vote in favor of the repeal immediately after the fly began circulating

[03:11:04.680 --> 03:11:11.480]
The King's Center in Atlanta issued a statement on behalf of Dr. King's widow, Corretta Scott King calling for equal treatment for gay men and lesbians

[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:20.360]
Take back MyME data is also claimed in broadcast and to its supporters that gaze are after our children an echo of Ms. Brian's grotesque ugly campaign which was called Save Our Children

[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:26.740]
Opponents of the group say take back MyME data is using sensational scared tactics to create support for an otherwise invincible issue

[03:11:27.580 --> 03:11:32.220]
Anonacos, good old Anita Bryant and Alvin Dark and Bob Break and all those other person to go in

[03:11:33.220 --> 03:11:35.020]
How's it needed to do in these days? Anybody seen it?

[03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:37.940]
No, no, no, she can't get two oranges to rub together these days

[03:12:56.140 --> 03:12:58.780]
We're supporting you 5-6-3-2-1

[03:12:58.780 --> 03:12:59.700]
You am

[03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:04.840]
Alonzo, you're so big

[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:10.660]
No, Americans are all unbarks

[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:17.140]
You should climb to your up next when I wake up in the morning my hair looks bad

[03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:20.040]
I look into mirror and I look like my dad

[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:24.660]
I realize my mom I was the best I ever had word bitch

[03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:27.480]
Randy

[03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:31.240]
Oh, reading

[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:34.100]
Paula

[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:37.620]
You know I I feel like throughout this whole competition

[03:13:37.620 --> 03:13:42.860]
I never really knew you knew who you were and now I do and

[03:13:43.940 --> 03:13:45.020]
Great job

[03:13:45.620 --> 03:13:46.760]
Great job

[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:48.740]
She clank where you were awful

[03:13:48.740 --> 03:13:50.220]
Oh, no you did

[03:13:50.220 --> 03:13:53.100]
You were absolutely terrible

[03:13:53.620 --> 03:13:56.700]
I feel like I want to actually physically hurt you

[03:13:56.700 --> 03:14:00.020]
I want to wrap my hands around your neck

[03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:05.080]
And whatever it is done with your hair which is just terrible

[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:10.040]
I want to squeeze your head until it comes off and robes away like a bowling ball

[03:14:10.660 --> 03:14:13.120]
That's what I feel like I want to do to you, you should crankle

[03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:19.180]
Now the viewers may disagree but I doubt it that was an awful performance good game

[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:20.280]
Next

[03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:22.880]
And an awful bit too you know

[03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:24.260]
Yeah

[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:26.060]
How could I play that again?

[03:14:26.260 --> 03:14:26.680]
I don't know

[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:30.660]
While I thought it was timely you know the thing was on last night in the broad one in the guy with the I will eat him here

[03:14:30.660 --> 03:14:32.240]
He got the Alice here whatever was

[03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:34.500]
He got set away with a big smile on his poise

[03:14:34.500 --> 03:14:37.480]
I guess anybody who was on that show you know make out okay right?

[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:38.200]
I guess

[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:41.620]
First of all with their marginal talent I didn't see it so I shouldn't say their marginal talent

[03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:44.380]
Maybe some of those people are tremendously talented I don't know

[03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:48.420]
Americans haven't been routinely vaccinated for smallpox since 1972

[03:14:48.420 --> 03:14:51.240]
But the federal government is debating whether a program should be restarted

[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:52.760]
Roll up your sleeve

[03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:55.100]
The White House is reviewing my recommendations

[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:57.300]
Hopefully we'll have a decision in the near future said

[03:14:57.300 --> 03:15:00.380]
H-H-A Secretary Tommy Cheesehead Thompson

[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:08.440]
The WHO declared smallpox eradicated worldwide in 1979 but experts said they're concerned the existing virus from labs could fall into the hands of terrorists

[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:11.580]
I would say that the risk of smallpox attack is very real

[03:15:11.580 --> 03:15:14.860]
So US Senator Bill Frisk Republican Tennessee was also a physician

[03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:18.700]
I would say the risk is increasing compared to five or ten years ago and I'd say as a nation

[03:15:18.700 --> 03:15:22.700]
We do remain highly vulnerable if smallpox is ever used as an instrument of war

[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:24.820]
Most Americans under 30 have been vaccinated

[03:15:24.820 --> 03:15:27.600]
It's quite a little how long the vaccine protects those who have been

[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:31.820]
I got my vaccine and my arm is still shows me to of course that was a hundred years ago

[03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:39.620]
For example, one study found that 621 microbiologists in Maryland who received smallpox vaccinations between 1994 and 2001 as they precautionary measure

[03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:41.960]
6% remained immune from their previous vaccinations

[03:15:42.900 --> 03:15:44.660]
Huh? Only 6?

[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:48.280]
Well, they of course we know how old they are

[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:52.700]
But if they were microbiologists they could have been like in their 40s and 50s

[03:15:52.700 --> 03:15:55.000]
6% that's not too good that's 1 out of 16

[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:58.100]
But who should be vaccinated with without a specific threat?

[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:04.100]
Those should be exposed first when infected patients such as emergency workers or should all Americans be allowed to decide if they want to be vaccinated

[03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:04.980]
This story acts

[03:16:04.980 --> 03:16:08.880]
Every American should have the opportunity to make an informed individual's choice to evaluate those risks

[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:12.420]
Plus those benefits to receive that smallpox vaccine for a set

[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:14.460]
But weighing the risk and benefits is complicated

[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:19.220]
A lot of people who should not be vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine to Dr. Robert Belchey

[03:16:19.220 --> 03:16:23.080]
of the St. Louis University School of Medicine who's worked on several smallpox vaccine trials

[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:27.420]
The logistics of conducting a large scale vaccination program for talking out of the order of millions

[03:16:27.420 --> 03:16:31.740]
would be enormously complex and difficult to conceive how we could successfully do it and

[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:37.740]
And the vaccine is riskier than most can cause serious side effects and even death in some people

[03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:39.700]
The people like greatest risk are

[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:42.260]
What way to near this? People who have eczema

[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:43.360]
Okay

[03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:44.920]
Now why would that be?

[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:46.940]
I thought eczema is like a skin thing

[03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:47.480]
That's what I thought

[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:48.180]
Don't know

[03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:49.040]
Huh?

[03:16:49.620 --> 03:16:50.820]
People who use nogzema?

[03:16:50.820 --> 03:16:51.900]
No people who have eczema

[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:52.880]
Nogzema

[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:57.920]
People who have immune deficiency disorders which of course is like me because I have diabetes

[03:16:57.920 --> 03:17:00.980]
Most people don't realize that diabetes is an immune deficiency disorder

[03:17:00.980 --> 03:17:01.420]
Do you know that?

[03:17:01.620 --> 03:17:03.520]
I knew that and I bet you're glad knows that too

[03:17:03.520 --> 03:17:05.440]
Yeah, glad knows that because he's got type 1

[03:17:07.700 --> 03:17:10.400]
People are receiving cancer treatment, shouldn't be a take in it

[03:17:10.400 --> 03:17:15.260]
People getting an organ transplant, people have severe complications from HIV, shouldn't be getting it

[03:17:15.260 --> 03:17:18.020]
People also are risk getting smallpox from someone who's recently been vaccinated

[03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:19.080]
Can you believe that?

[03:17:19.080 --> 03:17:23.520]
People are also at risk getting smallpox from someone who's recently been vaccinated

[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:24.660]
Have you been vaccinated recently?

[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:25.220]
No recently

[03:17:25.220 --> 03:17:27.180]
Well good because otherwise I'm not coming back

[03:17:27.180 --> 03:17:28.060]
How about Uncle Remus?

[03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:29.840]
How about that blue bird?

[03:17:29.940 --> 03:17:30.440]
What do you think?

[03:17:31.400 --> 03:17:32.560]
Or that target?

[03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:38.980]
In fact, maybe that's why the blue bird is graphing so many deposits on Uncle Remus' shoulder

[03:17:38.980 --> 03:17:43.080]
I don't know, maybe you don't like that bit as much as I do, it just it sends me an orbit

[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:46.980]
And of course if you're not an old fart like me if you don't know from like a song of the South

[03:17:46.980 --> 03:17:50.160]
You don't even know what that's all about, although I do like the Mickey Mouse voice

[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:50.960]
Remus!

[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:54.480]
Anyway, the poll today, we almost got it out, we got time

[03:17:55.540 --> 03:17:59.320]
Poll today on the, uh, uh, dyke, I mean on the, uh, beard

[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:04.940]
I'm all confused, dyke's beard, it's 340, 340 votes

[03:18:04.940 --> 03:18:07.920]
Which of these women do you think most strongly is a beard for Gacea Liberty?

[03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:13.380]
Let's take the 87, all of the above 69, oh oh, at least in Marie Presley 42, none of the above 26

[03:18:13.380 --> 03:18:20.620]
Anna Cornelhoi in 19, Little Brittany 17, JLo 12, Janet Jackson 11, Brook Shields 11, Nicole Kidmin 10

[03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:24.540]
Hey Mad Dog, get your Johnson straight by the way and speaking of, uh, Little Brittany

[03:18:24.540 --> 03:18:29.380]
Central Rogers Show on 5-6, the Indian QAM, Miami Fort Lauderdale
