[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.160]
Here's open part. Hello. Yes, Mr. Rogers speaking. Mr. Rogers Reverend Jones here and

[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.300]
I another another Fony Reverend. Yeah, I have a controversial show today on

[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.820]
a lot of from the past. What is it? You're having a controversial show on

[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.780]
colors from the past. No, we're not talking about colors from the past.

[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.500]
You're a bit. Bits that you're doing. Sir, what are you talking about?

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.720]
You're playing old bits. No, no, I'm not. We had a call a while back and I

[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.340]
guess you did a tape and you made some type of a card on it. I guess that's

[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.000]
what they're telling me and we discussed not playing it on the air. What are

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.220]
you talking about? The part that gave it, sir. That was one of my

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.640]
Thursdays. Yes, sir. Yeah. You'd appreciate to not play that. I thought you were

[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.680]
going to read the letter. Did you receive the letter? Your game. Your game. Did you

[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.920]
receive the letters? Your game. Your game. Sir, your game. Did you receive the

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.060]
letters? Your game. They'll be a lawsuit. Your game. Sir, your game. No, your

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.160]
game, sir. Your game. What was you trying to say? I think you're trying to say

[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.220]
gay. Something like that. How's that overhead doing, Carlos? It sounds, yeah,

[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.800]
somewhere. What louder? No, no, we could use a little more level would be good.

[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.660]
First it started out kind of like that in the beginning and then it's like, but

[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.240]
it's after the weekend. What do you expect? Because this is a playground in

[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.100]
there. There you go. That's fine. Whatever you're doing. Whatever. We don't care.

[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.500]
Anyway, what was he saying? Gay. Something like that. And that turns out to be the

[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.800]
man who has really planted the seed. Believe it or not. Reverend Jones. Anybody

[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.540]
remember him? Planned of the seed is strangers that may sound a whole change

[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.800]
on this radio show. Your game. That's right. I'm at the track Saturday night. My

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.180]
good close friend Dick Feinberg tells me that a real strange goofy guy with a

[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.980]
baseball cap turned around came in the night before. He says one of your former

[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.540]
listeners came in. I said former listener. Yeah, he said he's the Reverend Jones.

[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.340]
But he doesn't listen anymore since you stopped taking phone calls. Now we can't

[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.520]
afford to lose the Reverend Jones. And I said to myself, wow. And Dick Feinberg

[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180]
had a great comment because I said, you know something. There was the in

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.780]
Friday we actually took calls on the show. I think I'm going to go back to

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.520]
taking phone calls. I'm not going to change the world on some stupid as radio show

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.760]
in Miami on a station that you can't even hear inside of a building. That's

[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.760]
right. Like that. That's our signal. And anyway, so I said and Dick had a great

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.740]
line. He said, you know something. It's your show. You can do whatever the hell

[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.520]
you want. Very good, Dick. Man, if you are as good as handicapping as you are

[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.120]
making very profound observations, we'd all be millionaires. But no, it's a

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.440]
very good, very perspicacious observation by Dick Feinberg at Pompeville Park. And

[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.180]
I thought to myself, yeah, it's my show. I'll do whatever the hell I want. How do

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.380]
you like that? Oh, wait till I get to the poor result by the way, and you're 250

[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.080]
phone votes from Ryan's scary don't count. But we'll get to those in time. And then

[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.780]
yesterday morning, what put me right over the edge right off the edge of my life. I

[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.160]
pick up both newspapers out there. But you know, it's got to be about six pounds

[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.300]
all the way. I eat nice equally balance. You go out there and you pick one up

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.460]
in each arm and you're equally balanced. Six pounds of crap. Because there's

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.620]
nothing to read in either one of these newspapers, the local fish wrappers, just

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.200]
sections and sections and sections of ads and ads and ads and more God-day

[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.420]
ads and classified ads. Jesus Christ. So anyway, I go inside and I go to the

[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.020]
few sections that I want to read. And I get to the opinion sections. What

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.980]
have you to call them? And I'm going to tell you I just about I just about dropped

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.840]
a big loaf in my drawers. Okay. And that's it. There's no point. There's no

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.900]
hope for this state. This is this is the end of the world. The end of the

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.220]
universe. Like I've always told you, at least I was right about that. Both

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.100]
newspapers endorse absolutely correct. The Bushmeister, the Harold and the

[00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.020]
Sun Sentinel. These are the same two newspapers that expose released in part

[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.960]
this crap that went on in Pensacola with that secret hidden tape recorder. When

[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.500]
we're going to get a bigot again, the fanatical bigots with his homophobic

[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.200]
comments and then his comments about, well, he's got a special devious plan to

[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.920]
take care of it at the class size of my minute. In case it should pass. He'll show

[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.440]
it a public finger to I was going to deep six that they expose him as being a

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.060]
liar, a bigot of piece of crap. But even though we don't agree with him

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.560]
everything, we endorse Jeff Bush for real. And I said to myself, hey, screw it.

[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.080]
Forget about it. What are you going to do? That's right. Go back to having some fun.

[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.280]
Here we're not going to change the world on this stupid-ass show. Oh, politics

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.060]
in this. Well, nobody gives a crap. Nobody reads newspapers. Then there was

[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.200]
another thing I saw in a week and you realized that the average age you won't

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.400]
believe that's true. Because I double-checked it. I asked my dog. The average age

[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.900]
of somebody who reads the news, first of all, most of the newspapers are out of

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.380]
business anyway. Right. The average age is 64 of people who read newspapers.

[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.800]
Nobody reads books. Nobody reads newspapers. The only people who watch CNN are

[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.400]
it's only wonder some hysterical thing like the sniper business going on. And by

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.720]
the way, hey, moosey man, nice job. They only stopped this far to ten times. Ten

[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.640]
times. They stopped them in his caprice. But he wasn't a suspect because number

[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.920]
one, he wasn't white and number two, he wasn't in a white van. They were

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.180]
white under my like Tommy shirt. Oh, it's not a hurricane shirt. How about those

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.640]
coons, baby, behind them, her coons? Squeaking by another girls team. When are

[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.240]
they ever going to play another real team someday? Jesus Christ, what a joke.

[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.960]
Huh? I said never. Good. What a... See, that's the kind of stuff people in this

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.740]
time are concerned about. That's what they're worried about. Football games. Hey,

[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.480]
how about that World Series? See, and that's one other thing. I'm whipped up to a

[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.900]
frenzy this morning. I really am. I'm just full of it. I don't need no guidance.

[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.820]
Stupid periodicals on audio or bedtime stories. I'm whipped up into a

[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.200]
psychotic frenzy over many things, most of which you folks don't give a crap

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.160]
about. But I do. World Series was great. Well, the ratings were down. Who

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.180]
gives a crap what their ratings were on the World Series? We give a crap about

[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.520]
the ratings on the show, which is why we're not going to let them go in the

[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.400]
crapper. By the way, September, we got screwed on the station. I just thought I

[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.940]
passed that along you. Who had the diaries? Julios and Rednecks. I'll always see a

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.740]
great crossover there. Oh, sorry, Julio. Well, I said Julio and right away he looked

[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.880]
up like, you know, don't take it personal, guys. I'm surrounded by Julios. But

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.140]
we're not talking about friendly Julios. We're talking about the enemy. And

[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.780]
coming back to the real world, I'm finally getting a grasp on reality. How

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.740]
that pull come up before we get back to all of this crap, huh? In fact,

[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.340]
Lardass Limbo had a humongous, a big fat September there. Number one with an

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.420]
eight two-year in men. Does anybody believe that? All of Rednecks and Julios,

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.540]
all of Redwing maniacs had him in the September. They had all the diaries. Who is

[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.760]
the hottest of them all? We asked on Friday. We had the how many votes? A bunch. Almost

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.760]
1600. I bet 1591. Some of which were even real votes. Mariah Scary 407, I guess

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.560]
what she gets. She gets the buzzer which matches that one big, misshaped breast in

[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.000]
the middle of her chest. And by the way, honey, Luis says there ain't no

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.760]
chance he's even gonna let you take a look at it. Much let's touch it. How do you

[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.480]
like that? Mariah Scary. So that was the crank vote. Do you sure this time in a

[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.080]
poll? So she gets the old... DQ. So the winner is expected. No surprise. Britney

[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.140]
Spears 333 votes. Halle Berry, who was the late edition, did very well. She moved

[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.660]
right up there on top. 243. Shakira did well. 232. Nice going, sweetheart. Then it's

[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.180]
way, way down to JLo because there's more debuted than just a big disgusting

[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:53.460]
ass. Okay? JLo 80. Jerry Ryan 60. I don't think most people know who that is.

[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:01.400]
I don't. She's right on the wall back there holding her crotch. Oh okay, Jerry

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.960]
Ryan 60. Christine Aguilera 59, which really makes me wonder about the eyesight of

[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.800]
the public. Paulina Rubio 43, which again, I must not know who she is because she

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.920]
beats Chris anybody. I mean, even Carlos looks better in Christine Aguilera. And I've

[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.860]
stepped on things that look better than Carlos, especially in Amsterdam. It's

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.580]
all over the place, man. You've got to be careful there. Let's see. Paulina Rubio 43,

[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.460]
Tom Brady 38, who if he could play as good as he looks, they'd never lose a game.

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.980]
Pink 28 and Greek A. Glacier's 27, Madonna 23 and Port Tom Welling 18. And a good news for me

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.400]
is I didn't remember that yesterday the WB repeats a small veil on Sunday. That was a pretty

[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.700]
good show yesterday. You don't watch that show. Well, I haven't...

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.980]
Of course not because that show is none of those spikestations. So you're not going to

[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.880]
be watching it. Tell you're talking about they had me working here. And then I asked George,

[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.080]
well, what did I miss? Oh, just another former of the show. And by the way, I don't want to rip

[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.840]
George Wallis on vacation this week, but man, just wait. Just wait. I'm going to rip him and ask

[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.020]
like, well, him and Miguel. Good. Him and Miguel. Couple of the most couple underachievers,

[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.040]
I would say. You know, I'm talking about underachievers, especially the lovely Miguel.

[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.260]
It's going to show just because he looks good. I'm not going to sit here and look his ass.

[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.320]
Maybe later, but not during the show. 10 past nine. That's where we got a whole new attitude

[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.060]
about this show today. This business is sitting here reading and Tom Jek is going to say,

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.280]
see, I told you he's back in town. Being back in town has got nothing to do with it. You bald-headed

[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.460]
geek. You little simpleton. And we know you're going to be voting for the Bushmaster four or five times.

[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.800]
Mr. Progressive. Mr. Freedom. Mr. First Amendment champion.

[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.860]
It's a redneck place. Let's face it. Okay. It's a freaking redneck place. Go with a flow. I'm

[00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:01.400]
voting for Bush. How do you like that? Not. I'm voting for George P. What does it name George P?

[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.800]
At least he used to look at once upon a time. 11 after 9 at 5 60 WQM. Let's face it. Then

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.200]
I just get through same less face it. Well, let's face it again. Face the wall. Hey, we brought

[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.000]
something into whip a moa in a shape today. Tulio, you think this will get the job done?

[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.380]
Gonna whip that crazy old bastard in the shape. He thinks he's been raped at it before. Just wait.

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.660]
Put that damn shame. Huh? Bloody old fart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Moe. I'm see, I told you I was worked up.

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.560]
Didn't get the chance to bond with him today. They'd get a chance to do that. Anyway, you've been here

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.780]
to talk about fast train for a long time. I wonder if it makes any sense for you. The facts are simple.

Yes I am.

[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.740]
200 years ago when they were slaves.

[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.100]
Eight bucks.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:18.380]
When I only have a mobile home a pit full and a pinch of skull.

[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.600]
So if you want to ask me how here's what I got to say.

[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.780]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning. Another train monkey.

[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:42.700]
Hello Jordan.

[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.360]
Yeah and here today, my own. Just relax.

[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.000]
No.

[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.820]
You've got to kiss a nigger good morning.

[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.220]
When you put on how we fare a forging frame of two.

[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.840]
Yes a nigger good morning.

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.100]
And that's your restitution for a slave of you.

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.080]
Yes a nigger good morning.

[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.520]
You feel him that you're sorry for a slave of my mom.

[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.300]
I'm getting out.

[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.040]
Yes a nigger good morning.

[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.640]
And that's forever fun and who is dead and gone.

[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.760]
917 at 560.

[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.400]
I'll tell you these levels are just done and overheads don't get panicky now because I really don't care.

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.500]
Okay, but I might as well be able to hear what the hell is going on.

[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.180]
I don't care.

[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.760]
So don't get the feeling at any point that I'm like getting all whipped up to a frenzy.

[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.560]
Like some of the temperamental assholes that work in this radio station.

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.620]
They get all worked up.

[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.480]
Who gives a crap?

[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.620]
You know as long as we're on here as long as the spots are getting on here.

[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.160]
That's all we're here for as long as the parents keep coming in here with paychecks which

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.880]
you'll get paid eventually maybe or not as the case may be because we don't really care

[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.620]
about that either as long as you just keep showing up.

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.480]
So getting back to Miguel and I will get him in a minute.

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.620]
Now we just got a lot of people here the answer.

[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.040]
See I should be more like Moe.

[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.720]
I should be a prick.

[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.120]
I should be a nasty miserable old prick.

[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]
I got the old part down.

[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.340]
But I should be of course the prick part well that's another story.

[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.640]
But I just that's what I should be but I'm just too easy going.

[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.700]
That's why you know Neil so easy to work for.

[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.500]
That's the problem.

[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.600]
And old softie so to speak.

[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.460]
Put up with any kind of crap.

[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.640]
Well we don't really want to do a best of CD this year because

[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.920]
Miguel had to do all the work.

[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.120]
So what else is he going to do?

[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.320]
Huh besides run up and down the hall running away from fat to reen back there.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.240]
What else is he going to do?

[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.180]
Go out with those stupid goddamn with a van all every day to get down here for two hours

[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.820]
with those stupid plugs that we do because the sales department sells fandom promos.

[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.300]
Oh yeah we'll give you 20,000 mentions for a hundred dollars yet right.

[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.000]
Of course they don't get any spots they just get go out and see Miguel at the

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.160]
my chart lemonade stand whatever the hell he's got a lemonade like Larry Glick.

[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.780]
That's what we do on his station just make crap up.

[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.780]
But when it comes for this show no no don't want to run the board anymore because he wasn't

[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.400]
getting paid for it.

[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.740]
Of course he wasn't building anyway does it really make a difference?

[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.540]
See what I'm saying?

[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.820]
He's getting paid period unlike you which you weren't getting paid anything.

[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:27.980]
And I'm still coming.

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.080]
Still not getting paid anything and he's still showing up.

[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.040]
God damn it am I worked up.

[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.120]
I'm whipped up to a frenzy.

[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.300]
See those two endorsements of Bush and those two papers yesterday.

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.800]
They bring and I'm glad I'm glad because it brings me back to reality.

[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.720]
Like I'm going to change something sitting here pontificating reading all of these columns

[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.840]
by this one and that one.

[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.040]
What difference does it make?

[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:47.560]
It's entertainment.

[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.180]
Why I told you that 20 years ago.

[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.160]
Forget about all that bull crap with those boring gets in all this garbage.

[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.760]
That was Miguel by the way saying that I'll do this.

[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.440]
These all do this.

[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.760]
Yeah you're a lazy stick okay Miguel you're not for money but see he thinks because he

[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.320]
looks good and I'm at an old bag.

[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.180]
He thinks that's going to like don't make any points with me.

[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.340]
I'm not going to get any of that anyway.

[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.500]
So what difference does it make?

[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.040]
Huh?

[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.100]
I'm not even going to get a look at it.

[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.100]
So what difference does it make?

[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.400]
Right.

[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.360]
Plus I don't believe in crap and where he eat.

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.200]
Bob Ramuth told me you know crap or eat.

[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.860]
That's what he told me that night he was drunk on his ass and amused to him

[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.040]
at that Indonesian restaurant at that buffet that was the worst meal ever had in my life.

[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.400]
And man he can really put that booze away and the more he drinks the looser that tongue gets.

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.720]
And he starts in about screw in and on and on and on and you don't crap or you eat it all

[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.860]
so to say it was incredible.

[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.380]
I just mentioned that again in case you might be less than Ramuth you silly person.

[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.360]
And by the way since they left the stuff in Amsterdam see Julio wants to volunteer to go

[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.000]
over there and get the phones working in Amsterdam.

[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.180]
Hey he'll make the trip.

[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.540]
Now the phones are not working over there.

[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.560]
Oh yeah we'll leave the equipment there because we don't need changes this mind all the time.

[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.900]
I didn't change my mind.

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.240]
I was perfectly happy to let them send all the stuff back because I don't like the hours number

[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.060]
one three to seven in the afternoon and number two I really not that crazy about sitting in a room

[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.620]
with mildew and mold you know gagging for four hours every day.

[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.000]
But I'll put up with it.

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.820]
I'll tolerate it.

[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.920]
I'll humor them since they changed their mind but it would be nice if the phones would work since

[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.240]
we're going to go back to taking phone calls if we ever get any.

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:14.900]
Not yet folks.

[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.000]
Not yet.

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.660]
We'll let you know.

[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.560]
And that's another thing.

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.180]
Oh I'm a Toronto well I'm a girl that want to answer the phones.

[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.460]
You don't want to get the Raspberry guy.

[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.340]
He don't want to talk to us.

[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.760]
He don't want to answer the phones.

[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.580]
What's he getting paid for?

[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.940]
And the same little George there that little little spick who's a superstar now.

[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.340]
Well we ain't going to answer the phones.

[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.320]
Now he just takes that headset off and sits it down there while he's on his cell phone

[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.740]
making dates on the side.

[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.180]
Eating the free food, calling up what's his name when it was a fatty sandwiches.

[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.680]
Getting the free food in here.

[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.760]
Who are you kidding George?

[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.520]
And he's listening this morning.

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.140]
He's monitoring which should just amazes the hell out of me.

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.460]
Well how could you be on vacation and be listening to this place you know.

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.640]
You have to be a masochist.

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.940]
You have to be a lunatic.

[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.620]
He even be thinking about this place while you're on vacation.

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.440]
Anyway here's a couple of faxes.

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.740]
You're thinking the girl's getting the message.

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.040]
No.

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.420]
Too late for that CD now.

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.120]
You screwed it.

[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.880]
You screwed me right.

[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.320]
Stand me right in the back Miguel.

[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.900]
All the people that I go to back for in this place that's why I'm not going to back for anybody again.

[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.140]
Gildi went to back for him to save his squeaky god damn job.

[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:14.840]
What does he do?

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.840]
Does he mention me on Friday?

[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.340]
No.

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.520]
No because Mo's got him under his thumb.

[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.120]
He's so scared of moment.

[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.440]
He cowards in there.

[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.240]
Do you see him actually went and meant to get out of there.

[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.820]
He took like four of most two pays and took him to get dry cleaned.

[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.700]
Right there at nine o'clock when little hand hit the big hand.

[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.340]
Mo's flying out the door with Gildi right on his ass.

[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.980]
So to speak.

[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.420]
And the same with Miguel.

[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.580]
Went to bat for him and tried to get him that pay increase when he gave him a title or whatever.

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.980]
Didn't do any good but at least I went to bat for him.

[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.440]
You thought we don't want to do the best.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.060]
Are you pleased?

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.000]
So you're not going to do that.

[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.540]
I mean I could understand.

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.160]
Let me just say this two things.

[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.600]
If the show was syndicated which it's not because I got the worth agent in America who's

[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.300]
you know too busy being a professional faggot but if the show was syndicated then what I was

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.720]
doing before because I like the show see I enjoyed doing that.

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.400]
I thought I was doing something productive but I forgot where I was.

[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:05.980]
Yeah.

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.300]
I forgot what market I was working in and what station I'm on and what time.

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.400]
Then forget about it.

[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.400]
These people don't give a crap about that stuff.

[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.320]
And number two if I had like you know six months to go I would take religion.

[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.300]
If I had that could happen.

[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.280]
I really would.

[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.680]
I take up any religion you like.

[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.000]
But if I had like six months so fine we don't do another best.

[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.760]
I've seen a big deal but I've been doing that for like a hundred years.

[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.400]
Right.

[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.500]
And like in midstream we break the whole continuity what we do we can raise a lot of money for charity.

[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.760]
For that dog place again which believe me I'll tell you right now folks dogs most of my

[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.920]
level out better than you people.

[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.860]
A lot of you people out there believe me including Reverend Jones and somebody else I know.

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.400]
I'm getting pal I won't mention his name.

[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.660]
The worst the worst pit bull on the face of the earth in my view is like 75 steps above.

[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.780]
I'm getting pal of him.

[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.400]
And everywhere I go whether it's the track of the supermarket people stop me.

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.140]
Neil is what you're saying about Moe is he really an asshole like that and I always say he's an asshole.

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.960]
I always say that yeah it is it's true.

[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:14.320]
The most vicious the nastiest wild dog the ever stepped foot on the face of the globe is 400 steps

[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.500]
above I'm getting pal of him it whatever it is.

[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.520]
Now here's the facts from Laura and to bet if he wouldn't have had to run to the

[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.700]
adrack leader with his two pay and guilty maybe he could answer the question for his but I doubt it

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.520]
because it's not about the gents.

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.960]
It says I just came back last night from week in Las Vegas what a town it's the best city in the

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.460]
United States.

[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.480]
I think it says Laura but bad handwriting Laura anyway we're under playing coming back to Miami

[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.840]
and who sits in back of me but Jay Fiedler from the Miami Dolphins with his arm all bandage up

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.400]
and people are so stupid they were still asking for his autograph.

[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.020]
My question is why is Jay Fiedler flying coach with the rest of his deadbeats?

[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.240]
Doesn't he make enough money to fly first class that was room I would really like an answer to this.

[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.540]
Laura I love you but like I'm going to give you an answer to that how do we know?

[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.740]
Maybe he doesn't like sitting back up there in the front with all his goyem.

[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.960]
I don't know maybe it was the last seat of the play.

[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.840]
She said there was room in first class.

[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.540]
Are you paying attention Carlos?

[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.040]
I said when you better be paying attention to every word on his show okay?

[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.560]
She said there was room which maybe there was and maybe there was maybe she's just making a

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.520]
whole story up I don't know.

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.880]
I have no idea Laura I have no clue believe me.

[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.920]
Here's another great facts.

[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.840]
Bad timing on this one.

[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.920]
My first facts here goes he says.

[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.460]
Deer Neal and the reason I know it's he even though there's no name on it we don't have any

[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:30.660]
women.

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.320]
I looked at the results of that pool that we took over the weekend.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.360]
We had 1500 votes now a lot of them granted chronic almost 1600 so say 300 were fake that's

[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.620]
1300 votes we had like a smattering of votes for Tom Welling Tom Brady and Enrique which

[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.720]
means between the fags and the women out there we don't have any about 80 our think out of 1500.

[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.520]
80.

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.720]
Yeah we had we had nothing absolutely nothing women in the faggot's.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.880]
Maybe if we played more lies in an early records I might help.

[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.840]
Deer Neal number one said on the passing of the thanks for calling ladies she sounded like

[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.940]
my granny and Reeliny was a universal granny to all I will miss her voice did you ever get to

[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.320]
meet her any of her notes no number two you read an article keep reading the periodicals no

[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.960]
about the link between as see today I get to think keep reading the periodicals no and I read

[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.240]
it anymore bedtime stories okay and it's got nothing to do with Tom jica.

[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.220]
Tom you're still a little pots all right oh yeah but now that he's back in town and

[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.520]
it makes me weak to think about how stupid some of these people are especially a little Tommy

[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.680]
like it makes a difference where I'm physically sitting as to what to show it it's what I'm doing

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.960]
on the show that counts Tom not where I'm sitting doing it as far as losing contact with this place

[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.020]
believe me death has got to be more exciting than living in South Florida death has got to be more

[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.560]
innovating more energizing than living in this town you can't complain about the excitement level

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.660]
here because there isn't any except of course reading the great newspapers it says but the link

[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.340]
between the herbs and McVeigh and the Oklahoma bombing where was the article from I don't know sir

[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:07.200]
and third it was Friday but I like I remember and third please add to your website one of my favorite

[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.200]
obscure songs that you seem to be the only one who knows of it I believe it's called Yamama

[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.400]
is what he said are we gonna add that to the website so I thank you for your first

[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.900]
back it's a nice effort but you know over three you struck out how about those angels baby

[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.820]
what a great series hey wait I stayed up and watched the whole damn thing so that I stayed up

[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.940]
watch the whole see I'm not coming late to this I'm not saying I'm angels fan but you know the

[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:37.800]
year that they had the gigantic big run was at 96 I'm not a big basal fan oh well like I said

[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.020]
I wonder am I asking you and anyway if they had a phenomenon and they were scored like 10 15 runs

[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.760]
of game it was it was a very exciting year when the JT snow was playing for the angels and they

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.080]
had the salmon was just getting going and get rid Anderson was just coming up and Jim Edmunds

[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.780]
and that crew and they were very exciting so I kind of like the angels then and then the fact

[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.040]
that they made it this year was it was great so don't give me this crap about wow it's boring yeah

[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.000]
baseball generally is boring and nobody here cares about it except for the few putzes we got

[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.040]
on the station sucking up to it again because I got nothing else to talk about beside Jimmy and Danny

[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:14.040]
and Danny and Jimmy and Jay and the Chris and Aronde good golly miss Molly yeah I know the Patriots

[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.480]
stonk yesterday they got no defense port Tommy Brady how about that face mask penalty didn't

[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.820]
get called in the fourth quarter under last dry that could have made a difference I don't think

[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.080]
you would have but that was grotesque was flagrant he grabbed a hold of Tom Brady's head and spun

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.600]
it just around spun it around like god damn Linda Blair and who wouldn't like to do that

[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:46.120]
I'm to get it on the gut about it that's what I say as that for a funny show idea if I made borrow

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:52.360]
a phrase from the great Marty Allen hello there everybody in paradise land I'm Howard David

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.640]
it I hope you'll join me each and every Friday for my forget about it show that's what I

[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:03.140]
open the phone lines to all three of my regular low-income coales and let them vent on what the

[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.320]
bother and death I was up all night dreaming this one up at first I thought I'd go and would

[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.340]
handpuff it's like a sandy becker or maybe a pole to a vote for quisper quake but management

[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:19.200]
and I agree this will be a real show stopper now I run a family type show here so I don't want

[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.300]
no references to stick striker booze or faggages guzzlers other than that I promise you a hilarious

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:31.740]
company a high jinx and open conversation forget about it Friday that goes for listening to

[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:42.500]
560 wq am what do you say we just play this the one o'clock I like it good I did sure

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.380]
so beats a crap out of reading those stupid periodicals Tom and this asshole I keep spaxing

[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.500]
me this inside radio stuff I seriously would like to get a hold of this guy and just just

[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:58.060]
dismember him with a crowbar quit wasting our facts paper I'm not reading it nobody cares about

[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.560]
opi did this in Anthony to nobody cares okay but speaking of radio little time he took his

[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:11.640]
added again Q&A yesterday's uh Sun Sentinel in the same newspaper where they endorse Jeb Bush for

[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.360]
governor just like a freaking herald you know you people have they already think you're kidding

[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.060]
anybody pandering those sticks out there again in this town who are you kiddinets all you to

[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.620]
pander and pander they got a whole staff of carer practice over there just to try to so they can

[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.420]
walk at the end of it there's so been over like a god damn pretzel with other bending over

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.800]
back with the pander those right wing lunatics but anyway here's one of the questions in little

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.340]
time he's calling yesterday it says I'm a fan of Brooke Daniels I used to listen to her show on

[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.280]
w.w.w.w.d all the time oh you're the one huh I was just wondering whatever happened or is the

[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:51.800]
question from AE by email Tom's answer Daniels is one of many victims of clear channel dominating

[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.520]
the market and using primarily out of town tell and syndicated by one of clear channels some

[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.360]
city areas she finally came to where sense has got into a different line now why why doesn't Tom

[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.960]
just say she suck okay he didn't belong on here even to say hello she blew okay can't say that

[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.600]
she got into a different line she recently began a career in real estate with a south Florida firm

[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.820]
for battling Brooke why doesn't Tom admit that her numbers you couldn't find with a god damn magnifying

[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.180]
glass and the only reason she got reherited is because she ran into god damn PDD assassin bolger

[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:25.080]
right across the street here a jiffy Loub at jiffy Loub oh you want to come back Brooke sure

[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.660]
sure no problem come back I was wondering how the hell she got on the air in the first place

[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:37.060]
PD Bolster the assassin the same guy who brought you all those other great talents like Greg

[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:44.880]
him and then of course don't forget the really great the chic the best well I mean I wasn't really

[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.920]
all that gains on out yeah there you go another great great find by PDD assassin Bolger so time at

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.980]
least you're consistent okay you're not going to be at least you're consistent and I'm sure the

[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.680]
battling Brooke is thinking she's probably got a whole new career opening up now that you put

[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.480]
your name back in headlights again here's our poll question today before we start taking these

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.420]
tremendous number of calls that are just pouring in here now see they know what they want is for

[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.800]
me to beg for calls because it's Monday see I haven't forgotten even though it's been many months

[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.200]
I haven't forgotten Monday we got a beg for calls even more than the other days of the week

[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.580]
well we're busy we're getting after the weekend getting our life straight out again we're trying to

[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.340]
cover all the bets we lost on a weekend on a football games I'm going to tell you this right now

[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.140]
what makes me really sad is people had bet on professional sports which is most of the sports

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.780]
audience in this radio station what's your take on it you know as soon as you hear that immediately

[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.020]
lunging for the dial just like well what's his name is on vino mad dog had a good line the other day

[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.200]
he said he think vino thinks that Woody Hayes is still coaching Ohio State I think you're right mad

[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:49.940]
dog not that he's out of touch or anything like that he wouldn't know Woody Hayes from Woody

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.220]
Graber vino he's so far out of it but hey it kills a good hour and be a Friday for the Humper

[00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:00.180]
or what Thursday I'm sorry here's our poll today and the reason I'm taking a poll is because I got

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:05.080]
a good bedtime story about this cover a time magazine oh and not a bedtime well it's the only

[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.120]
one I got well I got two and they're both on the same subject it's about pot because all we're

[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.800]
going to be talking about any show from now on is drugs and sex and rock and roll that's it all

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.720]
right that's it that's all we're going to talk about sex and drugs and rock and roll and Brook to

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:26.000]
what is the disgusting bitch like her belong on a year for like two minutes man the babbling

[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.200]
Brookmeister come on time why don't you admit it why can't you just come out and rip somebody

[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.900]
yucky couldn't do it to this show well periodicals on audio why can you come out and say the show

[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.820]
Neel's doing right now is sucks I'd had more respect for if you would have said that you didn't like

[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.080]
it don't cause again you're gonna say well he's destroyed the show you know you can't please

[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.680]
this guy you want to know why because he's a little piece of crap he's everything that's wrong

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.960]
with New York is Tom jicke and not only that but I'm top of it here's our question of the day

[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.540]
I told that was worked up into a frenzy who needs a periodicals all right well I've been in

[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.060]
La La line probably because I've been out of this time for most of the last several months which

[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.460]
makes me in a really good mood makes me realize there are other people who are progressive in the

[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.680]
world they're not here they're not here oh you're right about that time maybe you do lose touch

[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:18.840]
maybe you forget how repressive and regressive and back acid this place is man talk about and I'm

[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.100]
just talking about Florida I'm talking about the USA that's what I'm talking about and you go

[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.780]
back on an electoral college map and you look around the edges and you see all of that blue the

[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.500]
Democratic States California Oregon Washington you look on the East Coast and then of course up

[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:38.740]
around the North Minnesota Michigan Wisconsin New York Pennsylvania East Coast Jersey all in the

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:45.280]
England and then the rest of it everything else is all red as in redneck that's why they color

[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.080]
the Republican States red because it stands for redneck and believe you me when you're in Florida

[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.500]
you're surrounded the only liberals we got here are a bunch of old Jews we don't want to do a show

[00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.600]
for old Jews for Christ's sake oh man that's the last thing I need to talk about going full cycle

[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.900]
be like going back to KAT 26 years ago hello neo you know back to that crap again I don't want to do

[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.920]
a show for a bunch of old Jews over the age of a hundred waiting for the early bird dinner squeezing

[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:20.640]
their goddamn deal pickles the hell with it here's our poll question today what's your take on the

[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.820]
week carolus it's just but don't you know don't worry about it it's just it's awful in fact they

[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.080]
take up they there's an office pool pool every day to see whether we're gonna get on the urinary at

[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.500]
nine o'clock I have an easier time when I'm in Amsterdam and Toronto getting on the urinary

[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.100]
clock that I do here they're dealing with stuff like the one day Zach in there well I don't know

[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.020]
how to get it out we're sitting here for two minutes so with that air because we can't do the big

[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:48.600]
crossover hey we can bring a carloson the other carloson here he's a big crossdresser what's your

[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.940]
take on marijuana laws legalize and tax it decriminalize it oh there's Zach right there have another

[00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:00.780]
sandwich Zach and put you right over the edge though and don't listen not a good idea for him to

[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.600]
keep sticking his head in the door mow finds out that he's concerning with us on this show and

[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.740]
lights what we're doing here he's gonna be he'll be out to be the next fat guy to wobble out of that show

[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.420]
and I heard that old john call mow on a way to work this morning the old sparser john talking

[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.540]
about the beast told him this and a beast oh where did you hear that what's your source for that

[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.800]
it's absolutely unthrew it's a freaking lie right right mow who the hell are you kidding huh

[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.300]
what's your take on a marijuana laws legalize and tax it decriminalize it traffic ticket only for

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:37.480]
possession which is what being proposed like they're doing in Britain right now they're

[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:43.820]
written traffic tickets only legalize medical marijuana or keep the laws the same in other words

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:50.540]
thrall mall in jail thrall man a huskow and let me say again nice going chief mosey most they're all

[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.360]
patting each other on a back over what a great job on catching the damn snipers up there and like

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:00.560]
I said 10 times they stopped this sparser okay this scumbag this Williams-Mahamad Schwartz whatever

[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.760]
his name is 10 times but because they were wasn't in a wide van and if they wouldn't have been

[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.980]
stupid enough to call that damn priest to be making it to basically turn themselves in they'd still

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.700]
be looking for me it's still being blown people away and then we got all these self-congratulatory

[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.940]
congratulatory people are on the media on CNN oh my god well maybe we did a little bit too much but

[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.980]
with people were hungry for information the only difference problem being you didn't have any

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:33.360]
information you just had wild speculation not information wild freaking speculation but a beep

[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.660]
but a boop but a boop and I think it's a two white teenagers and well I wasn't two white teenagers

[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.400]
and it wasn't a white van and it wasn't the it fact nothing about it was white how do you like that

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.600]

what it reminds me of we got a new Jimmy and Danny and Chris and Aron they we got crackers and honey

[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.300]
honey and crackers do you know how many times I've heard that over the last three days in the media

honey and crackers crack a very strange diet he was feeding that young man crackers and honey

[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.960]

[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.360]
I'm getting high on the back of the bus

[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.720]
Just in the most of getting storm

[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.240]
On a greyhound bus too long

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.540]
To get some badic in old Rome

[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.960]
A couple of time backs to take home

[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.420]
No fun in heaven this year

[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.300]
I'm 47 at 560 W3 on 43 votes on there. What's your take on a marijuana laws legalize in tax of 36?

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:50.940]
Traffic taken only for possession 3 decriminalize it to only legalize medical marijuana one keep the laws the same one

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:57.500]
One real goody two shoes a repressive asshole out there says keep the laws the same. Let's fill up the jails

[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.060]
But all those damn weeds the puffers out there, huh puff this pal

[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.400]
I hear some facts from Larry and Miami who says why does Mo leave out mad dog show when he reads the lineup you and Georgia

[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.200]
I understand but isn't he Jim's partner just curious because he's a prick. That's why Larry, okay?

[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.220]
Here to two guys are working together on a football games

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.560]
But I guess because mad dog is also part of the midday show here like 10 to 3 the old time slot

[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.560]
Therefore, we don't want to they'll want to plug him to my as if anybody's gonna listen to a show because somebody mentions it on the year

[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.080]
You just do it as like a professional courtesy. That's why you do it. It's just that it's done

[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.740]
You do it because it's done just like we give the time because it's done

[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.340]
Nobody gives a crap about the time if you're too stupid to have a guy then watch them

[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:43.520]
Well, why should you be listening to the show? How can you forward a radio? We just do these things because it's the way things are done

[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.840]
Except on this radio station where we got too many pussy's running to play soon

[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.380]
I have the balls to go in there to that silly old man with a bad hair piece and say listen

[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.060]
You promote the little guy damn station. You don't pick and choose who you're gonna promote on the show

[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.980]
That's just the way it's done here, okay? You silly old goose

[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.140]
What was that thing about the new surround the ducks to goose something like that?

[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.120]
Oh, and then here's a facts with his Andrew Sullivan first of all

[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.920]
I wouldn't wait I see the paragraph and they were mixed reference to our website

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.300]
This is what Eric was a squeal at about last week that you weren't here

[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.460]
With Boca Brian and about well some right winger it was Andrew Sullivan that self-hating

[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:22.020]
Faggot who writes the thing about the bigotry and this and that and about racism and

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.120]
Unfortunately the demonization of county rice is restricted to Harry Belafonte a liberal radio show in Florida

[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.140]
It's promoting a CD of humorous songs by one of its featured performers

[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.100]
The album which boasts a cover depicting bush kissing rice on the cheek features a song called kiss and egg or good morning

[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.520]
The star of the show by the way is white, but he's anti bush plugs books by Paul Magallan Molly

[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.100]
I've been so we can't be erases. Well, guess what Andy? I am erases. How do you like that and proud of it?

[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.980]
How do you like them apples?

[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:53.060]
I keep saying that over no oh no, no, you do not be erased. Yeah, I am I am and this idea of dark folks walking around with guns

[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.440]
Man, this is unacceptable. It's bad enough. We got red next running around with guns. They're dangerous

[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:04.860]
But not even the same category as these dark folks with guns first you learn to read and write then maybe then maybe maybe

[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.120]
Well, let's have a gun or two and here's some greaser that writes me this facts

[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.240]
Oh, he's the one that gave me the article over see I don't pay any attention to Andrew Seller and cuz like I said

[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.880]
He's a self-hating right-wing faggot. He's kind of like Alice Rantell only worse

[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.940]
So he sends me the article and then he goes on about he loves the bed lie bedtime stories

[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:29.400]
Well, I'm glad Fred because the bedtime stories are history. No moss. We're coming back to a real show on here

[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.160]
It's entertainment. We're not gonna change people

[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.480]
We're not gonna make people it was that in voting and in politics and in newspaper stories

[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.580]
Nobody gives a crap about those things

[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.440]
Nobody cares about that. This is an entertainment show. I lost contact with my senses

[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.080]
Also, we said what else to be saying here? Oh, yeah, and then it gives me instructions on how Dominic K&A

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.100]
See his pronounced an Italian CH equals K because his last name ends in O and E

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.480]
See this is some grease ball. So he's giving me Italian like I need Italian lessons

[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.400]
I asked George how you pronounce the name and he gave me to write give me to bum information as usual

[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.940]
Some little spick. What does he know?

[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:09.940]
Dominic can a say okay, you got it Fred and thanks for the facts for no more bedtime stories and no more Andy Sullivan at all

[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.160]
Got it

[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.760]
Should we take some calls?

[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.440]
No, not yet. Well, we don't have any yet. First of all

[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.780]
Oh, yeah, we want the calls back. We want and it'd be the same as it always was

[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.660]
I'll be sitting here begging for calls every day, but I don't care. See that's the difference. I don't care

[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.720]
That's what they want whoever heard of a radio talk show with no calls WQ I am

[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.200]
Do you hear anybody on there?

[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.420]
I'm nobody on there. I think that sounded like the phone system didn't it?

[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.240]
WQ I am

[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.400]
Yes, sir, I'm so glad to hear your voice. That's Woody

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.640]
Yeah, I wish I could say the same. I wish I could say the same Woody

[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.620]
See just because I said I'm taking calls again. I mean I'm talking to chronics. Does it? No?

[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.020]
First one round of the box

[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.220]
I'm so glad to hear your voice in my response. Perfect. I wish I could say the same

[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.240]
That's my response and I'll throw in a one of those for you too. What are you okay? Talk about the lifeless masses?

[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.580]
You can put them on hold don't don't talk to them. Just put them on hold

[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.300]
They don't don't even see if just put them on hold follow pay attention when I'm saying you'll be the next Miguel

[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.360]
Believe me you want to be no Miguel

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.320]
Amma Galia really but like like I would Bravo had Godfather to on again over the weekend sometime

[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.980]
And I I never even watched Bravo, but I was channel surfing and there was I can't turn it off. I can't turn it off

[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.700]
I've seen one two and three and even forward Sam have made yet

[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.820]
I've seen them all 4,000 times and if I come across one of those on a year, I can't turn it off and

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.480]
they're in Cuba

[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.960]
And he finally realizes the little light goes off and Michael's head and he realizes that Frado was the one who betrayed him

[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.640]
We set him up. I saw that exact same part. I turned it on with Johnny Ola. Yeah. Oh, yeah

[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.880]
Johnny used to take me here all the time. You won't believe it and all of a sudden Michael has that look on his face

[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:09.340]
And then is there kind of like Waltson off there? He goes up and grabs him and gives him the kiss the kiss of death on the lips

[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.720]
Kiss a Frado good morning

[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.700]
You broke my heart Frado just like I was taking Miguel broke my heart

[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.440]
Don't want to take it put any calls on of online. They're my doing

[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.380]
Don't want to do the CD. He just wants to get paid

[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.800]
Which is good because he's taking a page out of my book. Let's work more pay in

[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.720]
Carlos's case. It's more work. No pay, but you got to let compensate for the rest of us

[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:40.340]
89 votes on a pool 69. I love it 69 say legalize it and tax it and let's light one up right the drugs. I care about the sex

[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:47.740]
I care about both. Well, see he ain't getting any you know, he's maybe getting some of the drugs. He sure ain't getting any sex not at home

[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.480]
Anyway, cover a time magazine the new politics of pot

[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.960]
7 and 10 American 72% what's our percent?

[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.060]
Uh, well, it's hard to tell because we asked the question differently

[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:08.620]
7 and 10 favor fines rather than jail time from marijuana possession 8 intense support legalizing medical marijuana 80%

[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:17.180]
80% and the DEA is still sending assholes out there in the California where they have laws on the books laws that they passed the voters passed

[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.260]
County and statewide laws

[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.620]
legalizing medical marijuana and they send the DEA and they're to bust them and put them in jail and destroy their lives

[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.360]
Your tax dollars and we're worried about why we can't find terrorists

[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.820]
And this is what the right wingers embrace it the point is there's no point

[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.400]
There's no point in talking about the substance because they don't care about the substance

[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:45.160]
Like I said a few days ago if they cared about the substance nobody would vote for Jeff Bush for governor again

[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.380]
Impossible much less have our two major newspapers down here endorse him for re-election

[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:55.680]
Bigoted in the end of the all right wing born again phony line hypocritical goody tushus tub of crap

[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.220]
Not to mention the fixed 2000 presidential election forget about those things, okay

[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.620]
It's it's shocking to me

[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.380]
But then you know as many years as I've lived in the state I should realize it's it's a hopeless place

[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.740]
So a good about it right that's all you can do

[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.760]
Anyway, we'll get to the article by time. It's a little bit time story

[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.660]
Then I see in a front page of the hero navigated on ballot issue to legalize you some marijuana

[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.660]
Which I talked about that many many times and those days when I was doing my great bedtime stories

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:27.920]
WQ I am

[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.880]
Hey Neil yes, sir

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.460]
Hey, why do you say you want calls you're afraid to take a call from anybody to disagree with you? Yes, such as what

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:44.960]
On any issue. Well, let's hear what you want to disagree about anybody to disagree let's hear what you want to disagree about

[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.040]
All right, you got we'll see how long it takes to hang up on me, okay

[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.860]
You see how long that was were you timing it?

[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.660]
About a quarter of a second you know who that was that was that Dennis asshole again that was see two for two

[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.260]
I know both voices Jesus

[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.340]
No, it wasn't Jesus it was Dennis

[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:08.040]
No, he may have sounded a little bit like your buddy there one million times for Neil wrong not him

[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.400]
See it again, sir

[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.560]
I did that George's home listing monitoring he realizes the first old man mistake what I meant to say

[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:19.160]
He sounded like Jesus Christ, but it wasn't it was it was that Dennis again who wants to start in about the fags and the Catholics

[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.500]
Get yourself some help while it's before it's too late, okay

[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:29.280]
Come out of the closet before it's too goddamn late before your wife discovers you in the mad throws with your boyfriend in a goddamn closet

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.080]
Manage

[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:48.740]
What's going on tonight and crying minds want to know that's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero is Maurice for a really having sex with an alien from outer space

[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.800]
It's in the house is while the hawk is the true mother of the elephant man

[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:58.440]
It's in the house John Kennedy sleeping with Max Henry it's in the hero is Jim Baker about to get birth is Jerry fallwell's baby

[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.380]
It's in the house

[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:09.020]
Scary hearts amazing rice diet from Florida across word puzzle that has no answers our own Pulitzer prizes just for us

[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:14.080]
I'm not letting to Neil Roger and we're so sorry uncle Albert, but we haven't heard of bloody thing all day

[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.400]
Mindless family rhetoric

[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.180]
And the latest

[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.840]
See this Dennis he tried to different tactic today instead of starting like the last time he did by saying well

[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.680]
Can we talk about anything and then we're off about the gay scout troop leaders and gay this and gay that and a catholic jerk

[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.320]
This time he starts about well you won't listen anybody disagrees with it

[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.320]
Dennis we got Dennis and Woody so far see what I'm saying. This is great

[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.020]
This is where it's at just keep him coming maybe five six seven oh five sixty

[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:50.040]
Pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line and of course the fact that most of these people have been shut off

[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.620]
We take in their waterway last day months most of it now they just foaming it them out for the opportunity

[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.640]
Because you want to know why it's time to get it off there you go mo you got your thumb on it

[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.040]
I think George has got to point. I think he snaps those at two pays on snap-ons

[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.960]
Now this is one of the great factors. I've ever received from one of our regular factors

[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.600]
It says was this in the hero this morning

[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.240]
The giants didn't lose the world series the Cubans did the Cubans did it

[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:21.220]
Now you want to know why see now you remember the Dan LeBasterd column that I've talked about many times when in marlins

[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:28.380]
One of the series 97 one of the most embarrassing columns ever written in a history of mankind and only somebody like

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:33.240]
I was the only one I had to balls to stand up and say hey this is disgusting. This is grotesque

[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.340]
Talk about ethnic hatred

[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.500]
Talk about fanning the flames of

[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.900]
Professional spict them

[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.000]
All the marlins didn't win the world series the Cubans wanted because leave on was the winning pitcher as if nobody else was playing on that team

[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.880]
Now who is the kid the in fielder that they traded away to got the winning hit the little punky kid

[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:56.660]
The second basement you know what I'm talking about yeah, well whatever it didn't name's not important. He wasn't Cuban by the way

[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.840]
Like that's just my point, but leave on yesterday

[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.780]
He couldn't have thrown a strike of you of a stuck the big fat Cuban cigar in his

[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:05.480]
Yes

[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:12.240]
They got Craig council. Thank you one of our sports nerds came through with that little olympic Craig council

[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:20.360]
The marlins didn't win the series the Cubans wanted Dan LeBasterd who they because of the fact he's such a jackass

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.980]
They put him on here in this radio so they put that professional stick on here every Wednesday morning to go in there

[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.060]
Wow, yeah, he won't be talking about leave on this ones. They're guaranteed you that

[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.060]
When Garrett Anderson hit that bases loaded double and cleared the bases man

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.900]
I was squeezed myself. I was so excited

[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.760]
And then did you notice in the first inning because there was one marginal pitch there which was a ball was high on outside

[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:46.480]
And he didn't get the call and leave on and goes in the dugout and he's bitching at the plate on fire and bitching at cussing at the camera too

[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.040]
Yeah, excuse me at the camera. Well, guess what? Baffa and Gula baby. Oh, could that's for you leave on

[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:56.420]
Good riddance to bad Roberts. We're glad we got you out of here and anybody else that ever played here

[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.320]
We're gonna get rid of them too

[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.740]
Including the ones on the team now

[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.580]
But hey, they're gonna be given free weenies away

[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.740]
That's gonna bring those public people back if ever a town with belong where they ought to be given free weeners away

[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.320]
This is it

[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.920]
This is it

[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.280]
The Cubans won the world series. Oh, I don't realize it was

[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.480]
Like hubana nasiuna whatever the hell it is. Wasn't that what it was?

[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.040]
How do you say team and spick

[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.880]
A keeper

[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.540]
It'll a keeper nasiuna le kuba

[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.760]
Huh close

[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.620]
Perfect man up bad

[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.200]
Or there was the Cuban national team. It was the hubana sugar kings

[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.440]
It wasn't the guy damn Miami a marlin or for whatever the hell they are this week

[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.700]
The south floor to marlins

[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:44.900]
Here's the facts from jane and fort lauderdale said you know upwards of 50,000 people protested the war in Washington DC

[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.860]
Said yes, I did jane actually read newspapers and watch TV unlike this audience

[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.440]
Unlike this town

[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.700]
Unlike this country where they're too busy watching reruns of smallville pretty good show

[00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.380]
The corporate media made sure they didn't cover it 15 seconds on CNN. It was all snipers all the time

[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.000]
If it weren't for the internet and c-span and everyone heard of it

[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.380]
But my sister and I stood on a corner of sample and federal and hell up sign saying jobs not war on saturday in

[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:14.200]
Solidary to the folks in DC when I was going jane. I'm sure it was very productive not

[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.160]
And let me tell you the thumbs up way out number the morons who want war

[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.980]
I think people are so brainwashed by the media. They don't know they have a choice

[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.820]
Don't feel so alone

[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:27.280]
We love you on a sad no Paul wellstone where the conspiracy theorists. Yeah, they'll be coming out of the woodwork

[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.960]
Two years ago we had the what's his name? Elkarnahan and Missouri

[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.280]
Right before the election now we got Paul wellstone any conspiracy there

[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.360]
No, no to plan there. They were flying in horrendous weather reminds me that little girl what that was her name

[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.120]
That went up in that plane

[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.780]
The 11-year-old girl I was flying to plane and I had that premonition on w. I. Would do anybody remember that no

[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.960]
And I said she's gonna die up there and she did

[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.420]
Jessica that was her name was she like seven or eleven

[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.820]
I think she was the leaven but she might have been seven. I remember hearing that story. Was she working at seven eleven?

[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.460]
That's seriously just a little Jessica and they had her flying to plane a driving reinser

[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.900]
Well, we got in the mother of saying well, we got a busy schedule

[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.380]
We got to get on a Minnesota for some more you know TV exposure for some more free airtime

[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.780]
Didn't make it

[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.460]
Anyway, so Paul wellstone is dead. Who is a great guy very liberal, but you know

[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.220]
We're not supposed to be liberal anymore because it's just not the American way also Jane points out the Palm Beach post endorsement

[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.220]
Right, which I knew they would because the Palm Beach post like I said last week has been damn good on this stuff

[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:29.240]
P.S. Don't trust the corporate media meaning the hero in the freaking Suncental which of course we know the Suncental is owned by the Chicago Tribune Company

[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.100]
A bunch of right-wing assholes from Chicago

[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.580]
Who also own the cubs by the way and look at them

[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:40.700]
What does that tell you when you're getting news from a goddamn corporate entity that owns the Chicago Cubs

[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:46.200]
What does that tell you about the freaking news that you're getting it sucks just like the cubs

[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.700]
It's really it's really not worth you know

[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.300]
Going through this but I will anyway hey deal

[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.440]
Yeah, oh and speaking of baseball broadcasters

[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.120]
I gotta tell you I gotta admit when you're wrong you're wrong

[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.280]
Well the career is the only time ever saw John Miller or hurt him to a game was on a ESPN stuff

[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.540]
Where he does all of that phony stick and he's a save you know puts on that phony excitement and I don't like that

[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:19.140]
But coming home from the track Saturday was when the giants were had five nothing in the o7th inning and the angel star mounted that great comeback

[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.880]
He was sensational. He was great really John Miller. He's outstanding

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.380]
And by the way speaking of people doing great who get out of this town

[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.040]
Isn't it a bad break that poor Joe angel had to leave the marlins so we could go to the pen and winning giants

[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.400]
Yeah, what a tough break for good old Joe angel

[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.360]
And not only that but John Henry lets they stab you in the back and blow him out of here

[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.640]
So that the great Dave O'Brien the cookie cutter sound of Dave O'Brien

[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.600]
He can be the main man and he leaves here and flies off the ESPN

[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:53.980]
Yeah, sir's a bright leaves everybody hanging serves you right John Henry your little pucks up there with your Montreal Red Sox or the Boston Royal

[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.020]
Exposed whatever the hell they are this week

[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.480]
Would that phony deal they got going who are you people kidding

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:06.340]
But thank god we got the weenies coming back speaking of weenies. I was in a car yesterday. It was the crow was on before the world series

[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.820]
The crow does he belong on the year to say hello no

[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:15.160]
And just like always the ass suckers. Oh gee crow. This is your last show in the world sir. Oh gee

[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.440]
We hope you come back next year. I don't I don't because I'm embarrassed to be in the same building with him

[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.480]
And you discovered the other days smells like a French warehouse

[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.460]
Yes, I did

[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.880]
Let's get serious. What what is the message there and the owner the only reason he's sucking around with that Marlon

[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.460]
Crap is because he still wants to be the manager

[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.720]
The crow he he's got his finger in everything back down all over the place

[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.040]
He's a wannabe really. Oh, yeah, that's the only reason he's sucking on to that stuff

[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.820]
Nobody cares about baseball here just hey deal

[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:49.840]
Thank you

[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:54.380]
And as far as the morning show you know if you're gonna start sucking out of the David Samuels now whatever the guy

[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:59.480]
That is named Sam David Samu Samson and Delilah you're gonna start sucking out of the Samson and Delilah

[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.820]
Oh god about it. Yeah, because there's no credibility there

[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.040]
God it shows up late for your show and treats you with this respect

[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.120]
Moe just don't forget that okay. Just keep that in mind. He didn't respect you

[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.380]
He had a tirade about that. I don't even remember how many I know he's yet a tire

[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.300]
I know that for for days and days that he had such a lack of respect

[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.040]
He showed up seven minutes late for the interview

[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.160]
In fact, he spent about the first five minutes

[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.680]
Chastising in for showing up late as opposed to like chastising and for being a liar

[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.580]
And putting one over on the public here, but the public cares used to have one put over on him

[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:29.800]
You know

[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.220]
Just like with the panthers which nobody cares about so they can afford to do that. Oh, and by the way the panthers

[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.440]
Not only at home, but everywhere they go. They're the lowest draw on the league

[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.560]
The pathetic falling leaves who lost again the other night

[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.920]
Blue the lead three times to the Rangers, but we're used to it now

[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.080]
But last Wednesday night is the first time in a coon's age

[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.680]
They didn't fill up the air Canada center or maybe there were 38 unsolved tickets every other game

[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.640]
They got standing remotely like 1500 standing remotely and who was the opponent last Wednesday the panthers

[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.980]
Who did win the game though? I should point that out four to one

[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:08.020]
What are we going to do about goddamn Pat Quinn and Bill waters and what's his name old Ken Dryden? Huh?

[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.560]
What are we going to do about them? I?

[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.040]
Think we gave all the money to Ryan McLean

[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.300]
We could have got out and got some goddamn good hockey players instead

[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.380]
They give it to Ron McLean who's doing us cream puff interviews with the old the silly old man

[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.020]
Anybody want to talk some hockey? No, no god forbid

[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.540]
But like I said they put the you know pulled the world over the eyes of the public. Oh well

[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:30.220]
We don't want pop out because he's disruptive. He's bad in the room. Yeah

[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.360]
He scored two goals neck-earn Saturday again by the way. I should point out

[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:39.840]
But we're gonna take that money. We're gonna go out and get some free agents and really build this team. Did they do it? Are they no?

[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.300]
They full of crap. Yes, they are

[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.300]
Yes, they are

[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.380]
We love you Panther. It's the same old crap in a stomp. They're gonna change

[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.920]
Never gonna change your bunch of phony balonies a bunch of snake-wheels salesman

[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.820]
They come down to pike. They take advantage of the old people. They take advantage of the so-called sports fans

[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.980]
Which we don't have any sports fans here. Maybe about 50

[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:02.440]
We got about 50 people that have a clue what the game is even all about tops. Yeah

[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.040]
I prefer Bowman myself

[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.560]
Yeah, we're talking baseball cards now. Anybody want to talk about that?

[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.420]
He said tops. I like Bowman
