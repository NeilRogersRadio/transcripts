[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220]
I'm sorry.

[00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.500]
This is South Florida's only one.

[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.900]
Chris and I are on this.

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.620]
Chris and I are on this.

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.960]
Please leave on cast group station.

[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.040]
I'm on this group.

[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.080]
This is better in Jimmy and Danny.

[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.860]
Where's the baby gravy line?

[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.440]
He has him on queer street right now.

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.440]
Join the NRA to chart gun today.

[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.980]
Have yourself come down on Christian fun.

[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.140]
Blow your friend away.

[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.880]
We'll back you all away.

[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.860]
Chris, then make your right to run a gun.

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.360]
When you think of all the benefits you're getting.

[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.420]
Life will be sweeter when you pack your heater.

[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.280]
You carry a license to be deadly.

[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640]
Come on and join today.

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.280]
Any American way to be a member of the NRA.

[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.640]
Oh, hey for the me.

[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.140]
Hey for the chest and always hey for the head.

[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.160]
In case they're wearing a dress.

[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.640]
Sharp in your skin.

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.740]
Make it more hard for you.

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.860]
Be there to defend your right to all the jobs.

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.520]
Come on and join today.

[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.500]
And you'll be proud to say you're a member of the NRA.

[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.160]
Hey.

[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.740]
How's it going, eh?

[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.800]
902 at 560 is that overhead like turned completely down or something this morning.

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800]
Boy, we have some technical hijinks in this place every day.

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.300]
It's like a new experiment and the audience is used to that.

[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.160]
I kind of enjoy it.

[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.620]
Hi, Jinks.

[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.300]
You know what I was thinking?

[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.140]
He doesn't know Chris.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.160]
That's what I was thinking.

[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.800]
Maybe that's the problem here.

[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.420]
Another sniper shooter this morning.

[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.640]
Although, you know, they're not positive it was a sniper, but you can be pretty damn sure.

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.280]
Police in Montgomery County, Maryland were investigating the shooting of a 40-year-old man this morning.

[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.180]
But it was too early to say for sure whether it was connected to the sniper attacks that have left 9 dead and 3 wounded in the Washington area.

[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.900]
The victim was shot in the chest.

[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040]
He was standing on the top step of a bus at a bus stop, if already said.

[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.500]
The shooting was reported 556 this morning in the Aspen Hill neighborhood of Silver Spring.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.480]
In area close to the scenes of several of the previous sniper attacks.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.400]
It wasn't clear whether the man was getting honor off the bus when he was shot.

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.880]
He was on the top step as all they know.

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680]
A commuter bus had been pulled over and some roads were being blocked.

[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.960]
Police and cars and helicopters converged on the scene, which is close to a wooded area.

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640]
Authorities took the victim to a trauma center where he's been treated.

[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.140]
40-year-old man, it's all we know.

[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.120]
And of course, it's all sniper all day.

[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.840]
Do you understand that?

[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.960]
When I call CNN to let them know that.

[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]
It's all sniper all day.

[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.680]
But with Musi in charge of this, I think another two or three years we ought to get this all nailed down.

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.900]
I mean, that business yesterday with those two beeners, that was beyond embarrassing.

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.140]
Really beyond embarrassing.

[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780]
Like, we really believe that this guy is clever enough not to get caught all this time.

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.880]
And he's going to give them a phone number of a phone booth to go to and then meet them there at a given time.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.120]
And they're all waiting in the lurch, you know, they're all gathered around.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.380]
And they converge on a phone booth because there's a white vehicle there on Minivan.

[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.500]
And it's two beeners to undocumented aliens who are making calls answering white ads in the newspaper looking for day work.

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.340]
And now they're going to be deported.

[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540]
So it goes to show it wasn't a total loss.

[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.980]
Right.

[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.500]
That's what George said.

[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.360]
A little bit of overkill.

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.000]
I was in the hospital.

[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.420]
I was in the hospital.

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.940]
Yeah, just a little bit of overkill.

[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.340]
But hey, it was a white vehicle.

[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.080]
Had nothing to do.

[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.740]
Absolutely nothing to do with a sniper with the shootings with anything.

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.220]
He's not going to give them a phone booth that they can they can get the location of the phone booth in 30 seconds.

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.640]
He can't be that stupid.

[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.920]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.360]
Maybe his problem is good for Chris.

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.240]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.200]
Yeah, I'm going to tell you seriously, Mo and I got plenty to say about you.

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.680]
Plenty.

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.320]
I mean, lots.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.180]
But first of all, as far as this business about how the show sounds, I want to tell you this.

[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.380]
This man has taken that morning show to a new level.

[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.240]
I'm not just talking about numbers, which when we get the hour to hour, then we can really examine those numbers.

[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.620]
And somebody please explain him out at book works.

[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.200]
See, midday this summer over last summer, we went up three tenths of a point, little George, up three tenths.

[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.940]
Not a great number, but still number one as opposed to being number seven.

[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.880]
We were number one and men.

[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.160]
Hank was number two and a morning show was number seven.

[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.180]
But the Jimmy and Danny thing, which I mean talk about overkill, that was obnoxious on this station.

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.740]
And some of you I'm sure we call it Jimmy and Danny and Danny and Jimmy.

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.640]
It got to the point where we almost had to bring in the Jimmy and Danny police to prevent some of the people on this station from getting that one dementia.

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.560]
That's all we had was Jimmy and Danny.

[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.400]
Now we got a rendez and good job by Chris.

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.220]
Yeah, Chris, around the end Chris, three hours of a rendez in Chris.

[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860]
Panthers played a game last night. They won three to two.

[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.180]
They pulled it out in the last couple of minutes there.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.760]
And he talked about that.

[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.060]
No.

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.120]
World series going on.

[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.020]
Tied up a game of peace.

[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.880]
Any discussion of that?

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.100]
No.

[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.160]
All sorts of other things going on in the world of sports.

[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.260]
But you know something, the hurricanes don't even exist anymore.

[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.300]
Those college football ratings, they don't exist.

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.760]
There was nothing going on besides a rendez in Chris.

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.040]
No.

[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.440]
And Chris and Aronde and he doesn't know Chris.

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.380]
Well, that's why we're not talking about on the show.

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.760]
See?

[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.400]
We must be missing out.

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.060]
Narrow casting, Mo.

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.440]
Somebody better explain to you.

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.940]
Okay, that first of all, that even the sports nerds are going to put up with that.

[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.880]
You think that every sports nerd in this town is a dolphin fan, especially in this transient town.

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.180]
We got all these New Yorkers and New England people, Moldys people, Root Brother teams.

[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.100]
You think everybody in this town wants to hear all dolphins all morning?

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.140]
Well, if they don't, who needs them?

[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.800]
That's true.

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.180]
Scrum.

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.620]
When you got a big number like that, Scrum.

[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.380]
I'm driving to work this morning and they're talking about Aronde and Chris and Chris and Aronde and strictly the same one dimensional thing.

[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.880]
And out of nowhere comes this comment from Mo.

[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.360]
You know there's a guilty, there's 40% less trained monkeys than a year ago at this time.

[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.020]
See, he's got a sheet in front of me, which I have the same sheet of paper.

[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.520]
On the left hand column it says a 9.6 on the right hand says 5.9.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.900]
Both being number one, by the way, spring in the summer book.

[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.500]
Not last summer book, which was a 5.9.

[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.420]
See Mo, that's where you went wrong, Mo.

[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.680]
You don't understand what you're reading.

[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.500]
You're trying to manipulate, see, when I give the numbers out on this show, which I've been doing for like over 20 years now, people tune in the listen because they know I don't make them up.

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.240]
If they're good, we read them.

[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.200]
If they're bad, we read them.

[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.800]
If Mo would have had a 10-year-old, I just said, hey, he's helped us make some extra bonus money.

[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.460]
Did he do it?

[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.620]
No, he cost his money.

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.200]
But it was terrible numbers.

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.500]
So you can be in denial all you want and you can come on in and say, hey, the Howard David show never sounded better than does that.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.440]
That's pretty sad comment that it never sounded any better than does right now.

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.500]
Because here's a guy that's been on the year for eight months as he thrown.

[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.080]
I'm looking at the trans as he thrown one big, exciting number in here in eight months?

[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.860]
No!

[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.240]
No.

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.220]
And especially these numbers are deceptive because these are 6am to 10am numbers.

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.320]
Maybe Barry Jack asks if he lists them and Greg calls you and gives it a deceptive number for Mo's number this time.

[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.400]
Maybe you'll be smart enough to realize that he's trying to peddle you off like he did last time, the 6 to 10am number, which he's not on 9 to 10am.

[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.600]
And whatever number he gives you is inflated by at least a point because we goose him up over a point even though he don't appreciate it.

[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.900]
Are you trying monkeys out there because we don't talk about around the increase.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.460]
Good for crisp.

[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.040]
Yeah, screw him.

[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.740]
I mean, seriously, talk about one dimension.

[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.380]
It'll be like if I came on here and said, you know, the third race at Pompeydo Park the other night and I talked about it for the entire show.

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.320]
I'm not saying that as many people care about that as the dolphins, of course.

[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.020]
But even the most fur and the fans must be a little bit, you know.

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.180]
It's just like this thing with a media now.

[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.580]
This is a very big story and very disturbing and very disconcerting and it's said, so on and it goes on and on and on.

[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.620]
But all sniper all day that that's all we got all sniper all day is the story in the media.

[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.180]
Here's the full result from yesterday speaking of the smite the smiper coverage.

[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:35.760]
Was that something exciting or not because you had a look at one of those stupid ladies wanting information about the business about what business.

[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.900]
Like you know, when you get a call and they say, you know, what's your address and your phone number and all that stuff.

[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.900]
Good job.

[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.220]
I told her no.

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.240]
875 votes yesterday is pulled the media coverage of the sniper has been just another feeding frenzy like OJ, Sean, Rijon, but a et cetera.

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.880]
598 votes 68.3% of you said that and you are absolutely correct feeding frenzy a psychotic feeding frenzy.

[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.020]
Tonight we got another panel.

[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.360]
And the guests on the panels are interchangeable from Larry King over to MSNBC to Chris Matthews.

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.340]
We got we got Mark.

[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.220]
What's his name?

[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.920]
I can never think of that guy's name for them.

[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.220]
No, no, not Mark Grace.

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.140]
The guy with a mustache, Mark Garagos.

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.820]
He's now moved over to MSNBC and we've got the bowdeeal.

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.860]
Do you know that bowdeeal was the fifth beetle?

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.820]
598 people said the feeding frenzy by the media.

[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.180]
149 said it was it's been okay.

[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.160]
Outstanding 65 only 7% and too much 63 7.1%.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.260]
So if you add too much and feeding frenzy together got like 75.4% say, oh stop already.

[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.920]
You know, let us know what something is going on but bringing on all these experts who haven't got any idea what they're talking about.

[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.680]
Oh, well this man is obviously a loner and he's this and he's that and well this man is obviously part of conspiracy.

[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.820]
Yeah, right.

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.340]
They haven't got any idea who it is.

[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.920]
They got no more idea who it is and then moosey man's got an idea what day of the week it is.

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.160]
And with him and charge baby you just know that it won't be more than another what 510 years before they catch these bastards or whoever it is.

[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.460]
10 past 9 we got a new poll which we'll get to and of course today be in Tuesday.

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.040]
Tomorrow would be Wednesday when we do that noon to one thing but I will see if the audience likes that or not.

[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.560]
The noon to one of comedy bits we'll see.

[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.580]
You know we all have different lifestyles mo therefore we need different products to make us feel better and be healthier.

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.980]
Some of us need a bad hair piece and of us need a bag.

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.660]
Oliomad Mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations of pharmaceutical grade olive oil with vitamins minerals, herbals, other good stuff in there.

[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.720]
Scientifically designed to provide natural nutrition solutions to help support specific health needs.

[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:45.660]
Look for Oliomad's three new formulas which are sleep weight management and that great coq 10 all using the benefits of what is wrong with you.

[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.060]
I think you're having a real ass.

[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.060]
Jesus I can't wait to get out of here again and that's one of the reasons I've looked at this red face little spec all using the benefits of the finest olive oil you'll find anywhere.

There's a butt I smell it.

[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.020]
We put a retarded girl in our old and mischitzubi sheet to show you how well it drives.

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.420]
We were in the showroom.

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.560]
We were in the showroom.

[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.140]
Look at her go.

[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.380]
This is funnier than watching retards at the park.

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.300]
If someone had severely retarded can have that much fun and end of the day.

[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.100]
She's having a lot more things to do.

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.580]
Hey watch out for this.

[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.580]
I'm 15 at 560 WQAM.

[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.520]
I'm 10 to the facts.

[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.420]
I'm 10 to the facts.

[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.040]
Anyway we got six votes on the pool.

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.680]
I haven't even given the new pool out yet.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.080]
We got six trained monkeys on the pool.

[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.540]
I'll train the people on the pool before we even give the pool out.

[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.960]
They got it up there real quick because he's in between breakfast.

[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.620]
They called 830 this morning giving that pool so I give it on there.

[00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.920]
I don't interrupt my feedings.

[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.080]
I got that facts about what does it say?

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.380]
Chronic facts are by the way.

[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.580]
Phony Joy says please try to get a copy of the first five minutes of the show this morning.

[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.820]
He rips you in George says the numbers don't tell the truth.

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.980]
He says how are David's showers never sounded better.

[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.460]
Chris and I'm on day around in Chris.

[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.600]
Chris and I'm on day I can hear the book of Brian bid already.

[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.820]
Chris and I'm on day around in Chris three solid hours of that.

[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.740]
I don't think even at the lowest level of the Jimmy and Danny.

[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.220]
Crisis that we went through here.

[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.800]
I don't think even at the worst level of that we ever went through a three solid hours of it.

[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.300]
There's at least a little something.

[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.740]
But at any rate his show has never sounded better.

[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.300]
A man in total denial eight months and he's yet to throw a solid number in there.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.840]
You know what we have all these trained monkeys here, which is why I guess we're doing so well.

[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.000]
Although did you realize there's 40% less trained monkeys?

[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.300]
No, I didn't.

[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.660]
Here's the poll question today and the reason I'm doing it is because I don't know whether we should continue that new to one comedy bits are every Wednesday.

[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.820]
No, because our new to one hour is down.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.240]
But I think that's I think that's beat well we don't know that for sure yet.

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.840]
But do you watch?

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.640]
You'll see tomorrow when they are today when those numbers come in hour by hour.

[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.600]
But I think the reason for that being that since the show has become a little bit more political show.

[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.880]
I think that the right wingers at noon they abandoned us and they hit over to rush into a bill or rally and whatever else they can find.

[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.340]
I think that's the Republican rift.

[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.940]
I see. Well, put all to them. Okay, too bad.

[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.120]
But I'm also thinking that noon to one thing that may shut some people off of there.

[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.540]
I don't know. That's what we're asking.

[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.940]
What do you think of Niels Wednesday's noon to one comedy bits are?

[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.080]
And I'm asking this on a Tuesday.

[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.480]
So it gives us an opportunity to like plan for tomorrow.

[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.200]
I love it.

[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.720]
It's okay.

[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.900]
It's a waste of time or I hate it.

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.220]
By the way, thanks to Jeff Cohen and my good friend Marcy.

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.660]
We had a good time at Pizza Lock yesterday.

[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.460]
The new one in plantation.

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.020]
That's a really nice place right there behind Walgreens.

[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.440]
You can't see it from the street but the food is the same great fresh delicious food.

[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.360]
The portions though are just gigantic.

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.140]
I could have brought you and Carlos and fat rich in there and still had some leftover.

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.580]
Just gigantic portions.

[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.280]
Everything fresh.

[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.300]
The kitchen is beautiful.

[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.340]
Sparkling clean.

[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.540]
Even Jeff looked a little cleaned up like maybe he's showered some time in the last six months.

[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.880]
Probably a shower in there too.

[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.980]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.500]
He's got some magic rooms in the back.

[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.200]
I don't know what they're doing in there but I can only imagine.

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.940]
So thanks Marcy.

[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.580]
It was a great time and the food was excellent.

[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:17.900]
Etc.

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.540]
It's so on.

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.960]
It's really good.

[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.160]
Here's that poll again.

[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.840]
What do you think of Niels Wednesday's noon to one comedy bits are?

[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.560]
I love it.

[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.600]
It's okay.

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.340]
It's a waste of time or I hate it.

[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.160]
Tuesday at smallville night.

[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.860]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.780]
Nobody forgets you can't blame me if you forget about it.

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.580]
15 votes on it already.

[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.960]
We haven't even started the poll yet.

[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.080]
See I voted for it's okay because I don't want to like see what I'm saying.

[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.320]
I can take it or leave it.

[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:44.820]
I like it.

[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:45.720]
I like it.

[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.660]
Yeah, but that's selfish.

[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.120]
See we like it because it's an easy hour.

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.200]
What do you think of Niels Wednesday noon to one comedy bits are?

[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.000]
I love it nine.

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.920]
It's okay five.

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.840]
I hate it one.

[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.180]
Oh, it's changing again.

[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.000]
36 votes.

[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.220]
Now that I mentioned it, they're clamoring on here.

[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.780]
I love it 20.

[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.680]
It's okay eight.

[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.540]
I hate it five and it's a waste of time three.

[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.080]
So so far it's pretty well cited.

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.820]
Here is a great column by Frank Zakaria in this past week's Newsweek.

[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.740]
Not the brand new news week.

[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.880]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.380]
Time to take on America's haters by Frank Zakaria.

[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.080]
I wonder if his first name really used to be.

[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.600]
Good for Chris.

[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:20.940]
Chris.

[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.020]
Or maybe a rendez.

[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.400]
He says one of the most troubling realities of the Muslim world today is the cowardice of moderates.

[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:38.360]
Mainstream Muslim leaders, political and religious, do not condemn religious extremism often enough and vigorously enough as a result fundamentalist gain courage and their poisonous views go unchallenged.

[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.300]
Unfortunately, the same phenomenon appears to be working out with America's own homegrown fundamentalists.

[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.980]
Last week Jerry Fawba announced on CBS's 60 Minutes that Mohammed was a terrorist.

[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.780]
His comments are part of a trend.

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.800]
At various points, Pat Robertson is called Mohammed a robber and a brigand and described Islam as a monumental scam.

[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.240]
Billy Graham's son Franklin has chimed in as well frequently calling Islam a very evil and wicked religion.

[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.420]
While there have been scattered condemnations from editorials here and there, there has been silence from the White House in most mainstream political and religious leaders.

[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.300]
Commentators who fraud the mouth when they read of one of the crackpot mules in Egypt saying noxious things about Christians and Jews are now silent.

[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.820]
Forget about Islamic moderates for a moment where are America's moderates?

[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:27.040]
In this case, the extremists are not obscure characters but rather three of the best known religious leaders in America with tens of millions of followers and huge political influence.

[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.120]
Fronfin Graham was invited by President George W. to deliver the prayer and his inauguration last year.

[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.780]
Islamic fundamentalists are having a field day with these comments which have been played and replayed throughout the Muslim world.

[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.220]
Al-Jazeera's broadcast fire we call and shows on the controversy.

[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:48.360]
There have been protest in India, Malaysia, and Iran and fundamentalists from London to Indonesia are saying in effect we told you that America hates Islam.

[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.540]
Iran's theocrats have used full-wells comments to rally the country behind their otherwise unpopular regime.

[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.340]
Throughout the Muslim world, America's friends, the reformers, the moderates are embarrassed while its foes are celebrating.

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.340]
As it confronts the war with Iraq, the United States is trying to convince the Arab world that it's not a war with its people.

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.980]
The White House and the State Department have devised major new programs to tell Muslims that America is concerned about their welfare.

[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:18.700]
Yet our case becomes much harder to make and Gen. T. efforts at cultural exchange will count for nothing against the factor of a bigoted ranting by preachers.

[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:26.060]
For the next decade or so at least the single biggest issue for American foreign policy will be its relationship with a 1.2 billion Muslims around the world.

[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.060]
Getting that relationship right will have a greater effect on protecting American interest, including the lives of American citizens than any other.

[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.960]
And fall while Robertson and Graham's hate-filled campaign is lighting fires that could grow into a terrible conflagration.

[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.900]
For the fundamentalists of September 11 solved an urgent problem. Over the past decade they've been searching for enemies.

[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.440]
Their old ones, abortion rights advocates and homosexuals have not proved as useful as they had been because Americans have become more tolerant on social issues.

[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.980]
Immediately after 9-11, Falwell and Robertson decided to use the tragedy of fire up their flock.

[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:05.220]
In a joint appearance on National TV, Falwell blamed the attacks on the pagans and the abortionists and the feminist and the gays and lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle.

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:13.800]
The ACLU, people for the American way, all of them have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say, you help this happen, Robertson concurred.

[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:27.680]
Other fundamentalists joined in. Billy Graham's daughter and Graham Lott's told CBS's Jane Clayson September 13 last year that the tragedies were replaced because Americans have shaken their fist at God and said, God, we want you out of our government, our business, our marketplace.

[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:36.840]
All this backfired, in the next few weeks the preachers were roundly condemned by hundreds of organizations, newspapers, magazines and politicians, including President Bush.

[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:47.700]
Falwell and Robertson back down issuing apologies and claiming this ingenuously to have been quoted out of context since then they've stopped peddling that particular brand of intolerance in Muslims they found an easier target.

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:55.860]
As President Bush has repeatedly noted since 9-11, confronting extremism works, it'll work again on the home, at home if he would only try.

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:05.560]
Right for read Zacharia. Did I call him Fred? Well, at least I would call him Chris. Good job by Chris. Yeah. Good column.

[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.900]
And have you heard the President by the way, disavow those comments since a week ago Sunday when that crap was on 60 minutes, of course not.

[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:25.540]
Because he's scared crapless to alienate that constituency. This is this is one of the funniest things ever read my life. It's obviously, but somebody faxed it to me.

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:42.340]
Colorado judge imposes ban on same sex friendships. This is great. In a landmark decision being watched closely by both civil liberties advocates and people who have friends, Colorado 5th District Judge Stephen T. Rosema to they upheld a statewide ban on same sex friendships.

[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:54.220]
The decision which effectively outlaws casual, consensual, mutually friendly relationships between two individuals of the same gender is expected to have a major impact on the legality of same sex friendships across the US.

[00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:11.000]
The controversial decision is based on the case of Greeley Colorado residents John Rooney and Frank Custonata, two friends who were tining a weekend rock climbing trip to your Semite National Park this July. After their travel agent informed local authorities that she suspected they were friends, a local apelacor block the trip, deemed it wholly inappropriate.

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:26.680]
These two men were in great danger of enjoying each other's company. Rosema said they may have attempted to communicate meaningfully with each other share stories and anecdotes are possibly even engaged in physical contact such as high-fiving after a successful climb. Such behavior the judge added is an abomination.

[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:42.160]
Rosema clarified the lower court decision ruling that these sorts of close mutually agreeable relations between two men are not what God had in mind when he created Adam and Eve. This is why they weren't called Adam and Steve. While conservatives are applauding the Colorado decision many said it doesn't go far enough.

[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:52.540]
Senator Strom Thurman recently called for the ban to extend the same sex conversations calling them unnatural. Thurman is the author of the much discussed proposition D which would outlaw same sex locker rooms.

[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.760]
Men should be showering with women not other men though if they do shower together they should be legally married before God.

[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:08.720]
Two states Missouri and Louisiana have already made same sex locker rooms illegal instituting a mandatory co-ed policy that requires all showers to be paired with the partner of the opposite sex and legally married before entering the bathing area.

[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:16.860]
Before showering at her health club Friday Kansas City resident Jennifer Jacobs 34 was wedded Jean's skillings a 60-year-old executive from the suburb of Mitchell Park.

[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:23.400]
I wanted to work out and then take a shower Jacob said but in accordance with the law I married Mr. Scalings and will serve as my husband for the rest of my life.

[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:35.420]
Despite supporting same sex friendships in 1992 campaign calling them valuable and nurturing bonds that fit the definition of unacceptable behaviors prescribed by the Lord Christ in heaven president Clinton said he was pleased by the judge's decision.

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:48.060]
I very much support eight to ten persons same sex gatherings such as ladies bridge groups are meant poker's nights at Clinton who confessed and playing in a monthly high stakes poker game with top generals and heads of military industrial establishment two men alone no no way.

[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:56.740]
Despite Clinton's support rumors persist that the president himself is engaged in a friendship with former US energy secretary James McEwen with whom he periodically has been seen eating lunch.

[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:10.520]
Mr. McEwen is an associative mind and our lunches are strictly strategy sessions Clinton said he did not deny however that when playing golf with McEwen they sometimes walk ahead of secret service agents are briefly alone a practice that is prompted many to question Clinton suitability is a moral leader.

[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:25.120]
The Colorado worldings expected to pave the way for similar bands in other states many of which have legislation pending conservatives are working not only to ban same sex friendships on a national basis but also the outlaw any asexual reproduction in the single cell in vertebrate community.

[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.460]
These filthy and immoral invertebrates are not acting in accordance with the Bible and by his holy word must be put to death thermon said.

[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.700]
Obviously a little bit old but acute very cute.

[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:46.020]
So whatever you do and I'll talk to me talk to Chris he doesn't know Chris oh I'm sorry well you got to get to know him in a rendez in a rendez in Chris and Chris in a rendez be great.

[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:16.720]
I don't mind

[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.040]

don't miss the mohauer Joe each and every morning on 560 WQAM

[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.320]
but that's not that anybody cares anymore

[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.960]
we do most of the audience off already so why not

[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.560]
hello George

[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.120]
932 at 560 at least he's speaking to you now didn't I yesterday

[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.680]
toward the end of the show

[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.180]
even more these numbers came out and it's obvious that they really need some serious help there in the morning

[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.180]
and he's costing us money the rest of the day by costing us bonus money

[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.060]
by bringing a whole station down with the lowest number on the radio station

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.120]
even Robert knew that this morning that they got the lowest number on the whole station

[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.480]
but at any rate

[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.120]
uh... did not stand the hand of friendship and said that we wanted to

[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.500]
we want to embrace him i don't mean physically all

[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.860]
but i mean like you know

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.160]
just uh... generally speaking

[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.120]
that we want to be a team

[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.360]
all the rest of us are sending our hands of friendship and he's like rejecting us

[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.140]
I notice he don't even promote the mad dog anymore because i guess that's too close to that

[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.800]
a juke bag gizguzler so he don't even promote him he starts with a humper

[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.380]
and then moves through the rest of the day

[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.180]
in terms of his idea promoting the station

[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.780]
see your cost of us money otherwise we wouldn't care because the rest of us don't care if you get like a point one mo

[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.140]
uh... we couldn't care less but the fact is that when it cost everybody else money

[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.300]
then we do care

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.620]
to understand

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.220]
yeah

[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.300]
like if somebody should get struck by a bolder lightning out in the parking lot then we do care

[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:44.620]
see

[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.860]
if it comes in a very inopportune time

[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.760]
but the fact of the matter is that those are our numbers will be a what today or tomorrow do we know

[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.760]
no we don't want to be nice if somebody would tell us if they were working feverishly on that right now

[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.740]
i'm sure high boy is uh... something i hope i have a way down there banging on it and twisted it

[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.720]
and the i can get it and get it ready for treasure island and all these other things searching for it

[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.880]
because somebody in maybe little maddy bell maybe hill pop is a little ugly head in the door here before the show is over and say

[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.060]
here you go here you go

[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.700]
or maybe the door will open and there will be somebody uh... stop it on that walker

[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.380]
you know he's a lot more dangerous on the walker than he was in the chair

[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.300]
you know he couldn't fall over in the chair

[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:28.400]
right the chair at least was uh... fairly immobile move very slowly but the walker he's like

[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.440]
troplin or wrong and you just you don't want to be in front of that one

[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.520]
uh...

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.600]
the shmit hits the fan or there when you don't want to be in there when the shmit hits the can

[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.320]
believe me

[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.980]
he could fit all the way in there by the way

[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.940]
with the walker

[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.800]
yeah he can take the walker in with it

[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.280]
the only problem is he can't get out

[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.980]
because the walker blocks the doorway and he has no way to get it out of it

[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:46.440]
and anyway

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.920]
the highest ranking boss at our stasis official implicated in the clergy sex abuse

[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.120]

and maintained a sexual relationship with the unnamed man until three years ago

[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.260]
Nylon said when questioned under oath in lawsuit brought by carney against

I needed some answers from my own sanity said Nylon was married ceremony was

[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.120]
conducted by Ryan

[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.540]
having done confession with him before I had had a hold of him to supposedly

what is his morals and values of the church were Nylon testified that he

[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.880]
demanded know if the allegations were true

Francis J. Demento Jr. I wonder if he's keen to doctor Demento

[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.260]
said his client really didn't want to be involved in this but understood his legal

[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.020]
responsibility to testify Demento asked about Nylon's specific allegation

[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.880]
said he had nothing to add what was included in the deposition said it was

[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.780]
unlikely that Nylon would come at himself attorney Timothy P. O'Neill

and Karnie took down the position in June he has since parted with his clients

[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.180]
Garland was arrested March after driving past Ryan's home in revered and fleeing

[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.160]

the audience that he's shown never sounded better if that's the case boy he's got

[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.680]
real problems if it ever sounded better than this morning to say it was narrow

[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.100]
casting to say it was one dimensional to say it was just repetitive redundant

[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.020]
grotesque would be a compliment you know what so many bell come in yet with those

the investigation and he can't comment about but he said that together we will

[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.220]
get this uh... so together if we work together seriously stop and think about

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.640]
the resources they use I mean these are the people that were interesting to

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.600]
catch anybody and they think that this guy's actually going to give them the

[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.040]
number of a pay phone and he's going to show up there at an appointed time I

[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.320]
mean let's get serious but at least they caught those two beeners let's hear it

[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.640]

because we got two beeners out who are looking for day work

[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.640]
i don't want to say that confidence on my part is low but this uh... this could

[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.960]
go on for a very long time you do understand that

[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.800]
could go on for a very very long time

[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.540]
and these people know absolutely nothing it's it i will say this

[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.840]
i give a lot of credit to people on these talking head channels nsnbc cnn and

[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.780]
fox news to be able to fill up twenty four hours a day this is even better

[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.340]
than christina ronda and jimmy and danie

[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.260]
with a bunch of people who have not gotten any idea what they're talking about

[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.140]
they don't know who it is who they are where they live what they look like

[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.960]
their shoe size they know nothing

[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.880]
and then paul is breathlessly on her about that note you know that they found

[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.500]
on Saturday about the note well he did the the the rumor was that there was a

[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.060]
promise in there of more violence as if as if we expected him to stop

[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.740]
lucky i'd threaten the he had to give them like a man like a warning

[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.820]
just like sending a message to joe zaza you know what's the point don't send

[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.140]
all messages go out there and uh...

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.980]
unfortunately kill some more innocent people

[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.600]
you already know that victim is a male about forty years old and uh... he's

[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.300]
either was the bus driver that bus or was not though depending on which

[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.720]
report you believe this morning

[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.880]
here's something a little bit lighter okay can we lighten up just a little

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.300]
bit now uh... charm listing priest and people get in shock by some crazy

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.420]
as sniper and mow getting all better to shape because his numbers up

[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.380]
and all play must-mall were written for you were waiting for that month when

[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.500]
you throw in a really big number

[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.480]
and what he doesn't understand is because he's alienated virtually every

[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.420]
minute building he's also alienated great deal of the audience

[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.760]
so we've been a thing do listen to his show a lot of them are going to write it

[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.620]
down you follow what i'm saying they're not going to put it down in those

[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.900]
diaries and this is the same and by the way who came on here not too often

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.600]
long ago and encourage his audience don't listen to the show that follows him

[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:39.220]
you see what i'm saying so talk about teamwork talking about this is a man who's

[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.260]
working against us

[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.720]
you see what i'm talking about i cost us money is encouraging his audience if

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.540]
i ever said that i'd be the biggest on a beach and i do just the opposite

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.120]
i encourage everybody listen to the station twenty five hours a day because we

[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.880]
need the money

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.140]
george needs that extra bonus badly

[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.540]
not that he never get it but he needs it badly

[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.280]
and to think of the fact that we got some guy coming on here and tell people

[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.000]
don't listen to that show that follows me

[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.100]
talk about a hard-ass but let me ask you something

[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.460]
how's christina rande doing now you're like this story

[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.440]
although before i do this story i should mention something very bad the price of

[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.900]

[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.340]

[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.640]
people evacuated there and lots of crap going on there

[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.380]
which i know in africa's very unusual but at any rate so as a result there's a

[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.900]
shortage whatever takes price at chocolate but here's the good news peruja

[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.720]
from fox news today the colipso singer and dancer who emerged as a hot young star during the

[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.780]
era of backdoor entry for black entertainers i that's a bad line you know backdoor entry for black

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.920]
pal is being a house slave for adhering to the party line of administration belifonte clearly

[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:35.980]
opposes there's an old saying in the days of slavery there are those slaves on the plantation and

[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.280]

serve the master colon pal was permitted to come into the house of the master belifonte said on

[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.800]
a rice of turning her back on black people and while pal earlier shook off the statements with

[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.740]
the laughing dismissal book leaders responded this weekend of the charges they don't properly

[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.780]
represent i think it's unfortunate that heary found it necessary to use that kind of reference

[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.680]
pal said on fox news sunday i don't know what reference he would use to white cabinet officers

[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.720]
who were in the house of the master pal probably crackers pal said belifonte had the right to

[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.440]
attack his politics but i had it i'm serving my nation i'm serving this president my president

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.000]
our president and i'm very happy to be doing so he said rice speaking sunday on a news program

[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.400]
also retorted everybody should be able to debate views but i don't need heri belifonte to tell me

[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.560]
what it means to be black but belifonte 75 wasn't the last black american to harp on pal and rice

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.100]
for backing the bush administration civil rights activist and general schmittes derber jesse jackson

[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.980]
jumped into the phrase sunday when he told a black church that pal is not on our team it's kind

[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:42.300]
like here mow is not on our team he's on the chris and aronday team but he sure not on our team

[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.800]
when i say our team i mean the whole rest of the radio station the barrage has conservative

[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.900]
african americans up in arms both of them the democratic braisbating machine is now in full motion

[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.620]
said nigger in it i denied your ines of the congress of rational equality i always say that you know

[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:02.140]
what's the name of n i g e r maybe he's from nigger ria niger ines of the congress of racial equality

[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:07.020]
core ines said they politically correct crowd views black republicans as sellouts not successes

[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:12.100]
absolutely correct he sure got a good point they believe for you to be authentically black

[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.580]
you have to tow their line if you don't tow their line then you should be disciplined and the way

[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.020]
the discipline you is to call you names and by chastising you not by challenging you on your

[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.640]
policies and asking for a full debate and discussion on the issue but throwing stones at you

[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.560]
author and columnist url hutchinson added that the debate demonstrates how independent thinking

[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.940]
blacks are chastised for not doing a liberal line some blacks have said that velifatis made a

[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.800]
point since pal and rysar products of a bush political machine that chose them to be members of

[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:41.100]
the team james kohn author of martin and melcom and america dream or nightmares had melcom x

[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.040]
criticized main stream civil rights leaders and groups as the black leadership was chosen by the

[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.680]
dominant white society now did the bush administration choose pal so what's the difference

[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.540]
cone said it's not a nice thing to say but the truth is truth is often very provocative and hurtfully

[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.300]

Because I better keep a close eye on this

[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.220]
Because this is the prelude to tomorrow's show

[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.600]
Whether we do that noon to one comedy bits or every Wednesday

[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.460]
We've been doing that for what about a month now?

[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.060]
Just a month?

[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.300]
Longer than that?

[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:21.760]

How do I look today?

[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:56.940]
Okay

[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.760]
And not too good with that shirt

[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.140]
It's a wasted time 25

[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.020]
And I hate it!

[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:06.960]
HATE IT!

[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.300]
Good for crisp 20

[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.200]
So let's see positive 105 negative 45

[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.280]
So it seems almost overwhelming so far

[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.800]
That they like that noon to one

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.680]
It's a nice break especially with all these depressing things going on

[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.640]
Another guy getting shot this morning

[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.240]
The bus driver 40-year-old guy was in a hospital now in Maryland

[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.260]
As the beat goes on

[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:30.320]
And it's a moosey man between a moosey man and what's your name?

[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.520]
I think they'll solve the problem

[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.000]
What's your name?

[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:33.700]
I'm CNN

[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:34.700]
Judy Woodruff

[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.860]
No not Judy Woodruff

[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.080]
No Judy's praying to God

[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.480]
What was I?

[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.320]
Judy's praying to God Paula

[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.540]
Paula you gotta see her

[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:40.800]
Paula

[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.760]
We address that with that

[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.660]
Okay good I'm glad you will Paula

[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.840]
Maybe we can get Leon Harris there

[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.640]
In fact look at that! What a psychic moment Leon Harris!

[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.760]
We're right there, no it was foul

[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.620]
I hadn't you noticed I wasn't looking up

[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.960]
I was looking right straight down

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.900]
Who's on the screen?

[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.500]
Leon Harris for only a moment or two

[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.820]
He said something about Kirby Puckett

[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.820]
Lives in the end, tuck it

[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.580]
Give him a lollipop and he sure could suck it

[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.820]
And that what he said?

[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.880]
And then he said something about good job by Chris?

[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.200]
Yeah

[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.880]
Now this thing about what's the difference between a priest and a pimple lachle

[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.560]
And I'm not going to read that that's in very poor taste

[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.180]
Oi!

[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.220]
Anyway move it right along

[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.120]
Here's one for George

[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.940]
Blake Tess fired murder weapon in his own home so sister-in-law

[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.920]
See you and your buddy Robert Blake partners in crime

[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.880]
Who did it? Why?

[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.220]
He did it no question

[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.960]
Oh in other words you don't defend the notion that he's innocent

[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:30.840]
No he's not innocent

[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.480]
He did it but he let him off because he deserved it

[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.720]
No I didn't even say that either he deserves whatever's coming to him but the bitch had to come

[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.820]
Well what law covers that?

[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.260]
No law, vigilante is not good at it

[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.760]
I like that law about that thing about you know two men

[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.060]
That was great I still can't get over that

[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.660]
Somebody put a lot of work into creating that

[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.380]
Took it off somebody's website no doubt

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.180]
You know for what probably was it was probably on that what's that one yachts.com or that yachts?

[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.160]
Yucks.com

[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:01.220]
And so Muff comes in here and he brings me all of these numbers man he is working feverishly

[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:04.520]
It's a good thing now he's got his own new office in there and he's got a different time leave

[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.140]
Working feverishly on numbers

[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.740]
Big big office by the way

[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.140]
Yeah big office now deservedly so nice going Muff it's about time they took care of you okay

[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.360]
Christ says after they jammed you up in a little heich here like an infant

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.380]
You know who's sitting in the heights here now though don't you?

[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:19.880]
Yes I do.

[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.060]
Bang and that spoon

[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.860]
You know who's doing that that cranky old man grumpy old man grandpa grandpa mo

[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:38.580]
Anyway see this this is bad now why did he get started I thought that I thought that we would like you know now that I'm back in town like you know bond a little bit like I said like very bonds

[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.880]
Well that's right forget forget about very bonds because that's like World Series talk

[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:48.180]
Now you could have invited him to the pizza lot with you. No I don't want to lose my appetite in addition to which ponytail

[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:52.040]
I want to see that piece and ponytail told me about that dolphin banquet and what a horrendous job

[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.180]
Mo did that banquet and telling all these corny stale old New Yorkie jokes he said it was embarrassing

[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.860]
That's what I'm just quote what ponytail said you know what a good upstanding guy ponytail is he's not the kind of guy who

[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:07.000]
Would say that you know to like just to suck up you know he just told me that is being a matter of fact and I thought oh well

[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:16.580]
Anyway, so I'm in 25 to 54 look at this not that we want to start with these numbers again because this audience guy I apologize but people in the business like to know this stuff especially in our business

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:27.800]
Last summer and I thought 40% of the train monkeys were gone see if you read the numbers right mole come to fight out that we actually went up now he might say well last summer

[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:35.820]
The morning show was a 3.3 it was night and we were 3.6. Yeah, but last summer was 6 to 10 a.m. The more the worst team say 6 to 10

[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:43.160]
They they took care their own four or four hours didn't have to have some other old fart come in here and like value your ass out and lift you up a full point

[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.960]
So this summer was 3.6 but you take a point away from that it's like a 2.6

[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:56.880]
And believe me it's going to be at least a point trust me I got take that to the bank and my point being it you know I was thinking

[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:04.800]
And it's a good thing I didn't say yesterday because when it comes to the ratings I do like to be accurate I was thinking that ever since we've been on this radio station

[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:16.620]
We've been number one and men in every book and I forgot about your debacle last summer sorry. Oh you asshole man what a schmuck you you didn't even know I must have been such a good mood coming back from I'm

[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:25.120]
Stead on that I just overlooked this it was the tapes. Yeah, it was the tapes my fat old ass. Okay 5.355

[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:36.560]
I just that I just not number one but number five. Let's put tapes on during hang show watch what happens to his what kind of a yeah must have in the tapes man you are in such denial what happened to

[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.080]
I would see let's turn it around what was on this year instead of the tapes with you on see days and Thursdays

[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:46.420]
See while when he wasn't sick when he felt like it in the state of that those awful tapes a real live breathing

[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:52.480]
But you sound like fat boy now you sound like somebody needs a crutch. You got to learn to stand up on your own Mr. on your own

[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:59.680]
What about a church that is after the first summer was an eight to to have tapes again that the following year well didn't we have tapes the first summer yeah, you know so

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:05.920]
So how could the tapes have been the problem well then how did we get how did we get an eight to with three days of George and two days with tapes and then we went

[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:11.820]
Out of a five three too many goddamn Dwight Latter-day I'll eating ass stories is what you were doing. That's the problem that was it that was

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:17.920]
Disgusting talking about and bishops body being brought back to the building that was that was nasty well see even you can't handle it

[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.460]
Dwight getting down it. That's why I had to shave off his mustache

[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.200]
Starting to get on and snores a little bit. Yeah, there you go

[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.700]
Now I feel like I'm getting even a little bit anyway

[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.220]
Anyway a five three a number five last summer five nine a number one this summer

[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:39.560]
So more contrary to more recent formation you're giving out this morning about 40% of the train monkeys are gone

[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:45.380]
That was from the spring book, you know when it was here all spring. That's why they peen in the big buck schmuck

[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.780]
And let me put one other thing out to you too since the numbers are all or he's trying to say that they mean nothing

[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:52.200]
Let me point something else out

[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.680]
Your number in this book in men is gonna be more than double his number if he has a two six

[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.820]
I mean, there's no question about that because you already got a five that's gonna be a six something

[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:07.320]
It's gonna be at least double like two and a half times so that means you ought to be making two and a half times where he's making

[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.820]
How do you like that and because I did a couple of shows in there to boost you up a little bit

[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.160]
We'll take the half out you ought to be making double what he's making

[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.520]
You ought to be making a big one with six zeros after it if my arithmetic is correct

[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.960]
How do you like that huh?

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.060]
Hey, I'll take half of what he's making for getting twice the number right that that's a good deal

[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.000]
That sounds like a good deal to me. What do you say Greg? No?

[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:40.220]
Puts he doesn't know Chris. Oh, that's the problem see if you do Chris you probably get about two three million year out of this joint

[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.260]
If you talk more about important things besides eating ass if you talk about maybe Chris eating arondays ass

[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:52.580]
Then the sports nerds get really excited then they start squeezing themselves and squeezing the radio and squeezing those diaries and putting your name down

[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.780]
Just remember Jimmy and Danny and Chris and aronday

[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.260]
Next summer keep that in mind write it down

[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.620]

See you inspired me mentioned Josh Freeman. Hey Josh. Yeah, I just go away

[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.660]
Did you see the story about Jesus Christ to see that no? He's in the news again? Yes

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.560]
Very old box may be tied to Jesus family. I think actually the guy was named Jesus. He was a ball player

[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.360]
You haven't heard this story no well, we'll get to it eventually this is this is this family

[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.600]
See how short this faxes. Yeah, it could be one of the most amusing faxes I've ever received

[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.640]
I've actually time jickle would appreciate this. Thank you Lawrence and Miami

[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.000]
It says neo could you please give periodical updates on the sniper situation. Thank you

[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:38.780]
Yeah, periodicals on audio. That's what we're here for periodicals. Here's the update excellent over the show. That's it

[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:45.720]
The bus drivers in critical condition. He's in the hospital. They're fighting to save his life his family has been notified

[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.200]
They're there and and they know nothing and they got all the experts on there going

[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.740]
Like that they know absolutely nothing

[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.180]
And he might have been in the woods. It's near a wooded area and that seems to be his favorite thing like the woods

[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.880]
See what I'm saying right who doesn't like the woods

[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.000]
Tiger

[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:06.560]
Chris

[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.160]
Aron day

[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.060]
Jimmy maybe Danny I've asked Danny if he's coming back to the game and if he likes the woods or not

[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:18.040]
Anyway, thank you Lawrence and Miami will give you a period of updates. There's nothing to tell you

[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.340]
The bus driver was shot in the lower abdomen. He's in critical condition in the hospital and the sniper

[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:29.220]
It's obviously the sniper again. We don't have to wait for them to find a bullet see and there's another thing that nobody is saying

[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.400]
Why are these people so stupid in the media? Huh?

[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.000]
Not that I'm a genius. It doesn't take a genius to figure out if if the ballistics don't match

[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.480]
If he switches to another weapon

[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.660]
The I mean is it possible that somebody this maniacal this much of a lunatic could have other weapons?

[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.160]
Oh, so the idea that because the bullets match the previous ones

[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.740]
Therefore that's what we need to see to make sure it's the same person who did the shooting

[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.100]
The I don't think so

[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:01.820]
Especially in America where we have everybody's got at least 20 30 40 assault rifles of various sizes and etc

[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:07.480]
Right for different days of the week different holidays different animals that you're looking for right different kinds of

[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.060]
Animals that you're trying to remain and wound and kill etc

[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.860]
So the the notion that the media's got you all tied up in oh well

[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.700]
You know we got a way to see if the ballistics of matches that doesn't mean a goddamn thing

[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:25.220]
And you know what else the fact that it does match also doesn't mean anything because if there are copycats out there

[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.580]
Guess what they could be using the same goddamn ammo to oh no

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:37.000]
But we know this and we know that and you know something they know absolutely nothing except there's a bunch of dead people in people in the hospital and

[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.200]
Musi man is a pathetic. He's pathetic

[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.480]
And that's got it's not a racial thing

[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:50.080]
It's just because of the fact that he happens to be a bozo. He could be white and be a bozo too in fact that white sheriff from where the hell was he from

[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.340]
In Virginia when I had to share off out there the shooting of the day

[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.460]
You know the one I had the where the rain catcher hat on that day

[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.960]
I don't know. Yeah, he looked like the guy from Joji, you know roof is the sheriff roof is what about guys name is

[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:10.480]
He's no rocket scientist either, but chief moosey man this guy is an especially category, but if we just stick together

[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.920]
Oh, we can solve this damn thing

[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.100]
So please call us here. Here's a message

[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.920]
Oh, and the whole thing if it weren't for the fact that people are getting killed and almost blown away

[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.900]
There'd be some humor in this because it's it's being handled like a keystone cops thing, you know

[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.700]
Like kind of like a Larry Curly and Moe thing

[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:35.620]
Blake test fired murder weapon in his own home is speaking of crazy people with guns as sister-in-law

[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.520]
This is from the inquire when it's in the inquire on tabloid Tuesdays. We believe every god damn word

[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.780]
Don't wait you back because the inquire don't mess around

[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.080]
That's one of the tabloids now. We also have the weekly world news. Thanks to our friend Bill

[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.060]
Which I'll say for later on if things get a little bit slow, which I doubt if we run out of um

[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.220]
All these great

[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.920]
Nighttime bethams during I want to hear about aliens

[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.220]
I beg your pardon the warrants with antenna aliens see there you go again with that professional spick stuff again

[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.900]
He wants alien aliens doing just fine. He had his happy meal this morning and he's doing just great

[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:13.280]
And the best news is nobody with the gun is gonna shoot alien. He's a lot safer there than he would have been here

[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.980]
Is there any argument about that? No

[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.580]
And I guarantee it's a damn good thing. He's away from that fisherman

[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.760]
I think that fisherman spent a little bit too much time in a closet if he asked me

[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.960]
Blake test fired murder weapon in his own home so sister-in-law on the day she was shot

[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:36.820]
Dead Robert Blake's wife heard Blake test fire a gun at his house while she was talking on a phone with her sister on the day she was shot

[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.280]
Dade

[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.160]
This sensational new evidence uncovered by the inquire has been turned over to prosecutors

[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.940]
Determined a convict Blake for the murder of his wife Bonnie Lee Bakeley that bitch

[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.980]
Her sister margarie bail. That's with two hours. Oh

[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.400]
Marjorie Bakeley told the inquire she even cried out in terror. She told me

[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.700]
He's coming to kill me

[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.900]
The bang was so loud. It's it off the burglar alarm

[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.860]
As the alarm was loudly wailing

[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.180]
Bonnie was running around her guest house in the back of Blake's property

[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.260]
Frantically locking all the doors so he couldn't come in and shoot her

[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.700]
I believe it was testing his gun to make sure it was working properly

[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.280]
I think he didn't want it to misfire when he put it to Bonnie's haiding the car where she was killed. Yeah

[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.940]
I've told the police what happened and they've been out to Blake's property searching his house for the bullet holes in the walls

[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.100]
I'm sure it'll be part of the murder case against Blake. She said

[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:29.920]
The 69-year-old former bretistar has been denied bail on charges that he killed his wife

[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.700]
He's been behind bars for more than 25 weeks

[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.080]
Marjorie Bakeley also revealed exclusively to the inquire

[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.120]
How Blake sent Bonnie a chilling message on the day she was murdered made for 2001

[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.000]
When body went downstairs and when Bonnie went downstairs in her guest house

[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.320]
There was a sleeping bag neatly laid out at the bottom of the stairs

[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.900]
Robert had unrolled it. He knew she was familiar with all his films and new of a scene in a TV movie

[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:58.980]
He did judgment day the John List story and the movie Blake executed his mother his wife and his three children

[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.840]
Then placed them in sleeping bags

[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.260]
I believe Blake knew Bonnie would get the message back off on trying to take my daughter away from here

[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.920]
I'll kill you kind of like if he would have given her a fish wrapped up in a vest right

[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.120]
I think Blake had me targeted for death as well. She said Marjorie

[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.140]
He invited me to go on a trip with him and Bonnie after ordering his bodyguard or roll call about him dig two holes in the desert

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:23.720]
Blake knew that Bonnie and I talked constantly on the phone and Bonnie told me everything about his threats to killer

[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.300]
I believe the plan was to kill both of us in various in the desert so there be no witness to his plan

[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.720]
But I didn't go which is why I'm still alive

[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.740]
Bonnie didn't go on the trip either

[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.260]
I'm still terrified of Blake

[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.900]
She says but I'll face him in court and I'll testify against him

[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.860]
I can't let him go away with my sister's murder said Marjorie

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.500]
Speaking of people who just slay us

[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.840]
Jesse Jackson slays me

[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.160]
Boy, you know with somebody teaching him how to like

[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:55.580]
In fact, if Jeff Cohen wants to help people with their personal appearance help with that mustache a little bit. Okay

[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.620]
Is it off again? It's off on one side again. It keeps tilting off to the left

[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:08.340]
Jesse and comic nearly come to blows and foul mouth tirade this also when he inquired on a very nice page back to back with robber plate

[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.700]
Do you think there's something symbolic there?

[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.320]
You only first not mentioned and here was good for Chris Chris

[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.620]
And aronday he didn't get in here either

[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.660]
So what do you think of Chris and aronday?

[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:18.820]
Hope

[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.960]
A posh Beverly Hills fundraiser turned into the Saturday night fights when Jesse Jackson went toe-to-toe with comic Steve Harvey and

[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.940]
Exploited lace tirade all right. I love it

[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.740]
The two locked horns over the controversial hit movie barber shop which this is civil rights i-cunes

[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:39.320]
Icons Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther coon Jr. And even takes a poch out at Jackson

[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.780]
Jesse and Steve were ready to box and the language and I went and told the inquirer

[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:49.520]
Jesse the preacher called Steve a mother effort then Steve called Jesse a punk-ass preacher and an

[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.520]
Mother effort to I better be careful what I'm doing is a mother effort to

[01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:01.720]
A punk-ass preacher the ruckus unfolded at the ritsy Beverly Hilton hotel where Jackson's secret love child was exposed by the inquirer

[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.480]
Hosted his annual birthday party and rainbow push fundraiser his birthday party

[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.780]
It all started when Jesse overheard Steve say that some people

[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:15.920]
Where in here he used the n-word were blowing the barber shop jokes about some niggers were blowing the barber shop

[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.700]
Jokes about Rosa Parks and Martin Luther coon Jr. out of proportion said the eyewitness Jesse stopped in his tracks

[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.180]
Turned to Steve and said who were you calling a nigger?

[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.760]
Steve immediately became defensive who you calling a nigger

[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.560]
Cut it out

[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.220]
You tried to explain to Jesse that the dialogue in the movie was nothing you get upset about

[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:38.460]
Jesse pointed his finger and said it was something to get upset about because it was totally disrespectful

[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.140]
Then Steve accused Jesse of being a hypocrite

[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:45.740]
He said Jesse was publicly pretending to protect the honor of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther coon Jr

[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.740]
But in reality was really upset because in the character the movie said f Jesse and everybody laughed

[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.560]
In fact, everybody said yeah

[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:59.580]
Steve said let's just get let's just get down to a dog. It's not about nobody about you. You ain't Schmidt

[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.240]
Yeah, let's get down to a dog

[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.800]
That's when Jesse let it all hang out and they looked and said holy crap

[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.880]
He got louder and louder trying to put Steve in his place

[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.600]
Steve was ready to take off his coat and beat Jesse's ass right there

[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.620]
It says other guest dude between the two of them. So no one could throw a punch

[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.980]
Steve finally stormed out yelling. I'll never do nothing for that nigger again dumb mother ever

[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.460]
After huh? No, she'll love this. He's great. I can't wait for he comes in

[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.640]
I'm ready to go see that barber shop movie right now and very least go get a haircut

[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.640]
After Steve left Jesse said Steve looked like a pimping blue and green alligator shoes that match to suit

[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.640]
It's a good thing Steve didn't hear him where they may come to blow

[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.100]
There may have been some blowing going on you go Steve

[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.840]
You go dog and you know what they say if you blow too much you're in trouble

[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.080]
That is what they say how is that pull coming folks

[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.220]
That pull on our Wednesday noon to one extravaganza where we play comedy bits for an hour to lighten things up

[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.740]
Just a little bit. Oh, there's a bowdeadle

[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:03.560]
They could be used could be broken down to almost 28 inches. So let's all be aware that the person can kept that this has been

[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:10.580]
He's been doing this for two days now on every now every network about how they can you know full it down like like an umbrella and like an accordion

[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.280]
the piece

[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.000]
188 votes on a pool. What do you think in the osuens day noon to one comedy bits hour? I love it 76. It's okay

[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.000]
It's okay. Yeah, 57. It's a waste of time 31. I hate it 24

[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.160]
So let's see you got 133 to 55 so far

[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:35.420]
Pretty overwhelming for this crowd wouldn't you say? I'd say for this sour and negative nasty town that we got here

[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.360]
By the way last night I did not go because who wants to go see two girls teams

[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.040]
Panthers and trashers game nice going there Christian is elius by the way square the time the main goals late

[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:49.720]
They it's in the paper 12,000 they must have been counting everybody who lived within a 10 block radius

[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:56.200]
There was a handful there was a few thousand desperate souls there last night the panthers played in Chicago last week in

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.940]
The smallest crowd ever to see a black hawks game. It said 10,000 in the paper

[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:06.360]
I am told by people were there if there were five thousand they were counting the ushers and the concessions people and everybody else

[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.180]
How do you like that? So I guess you might say the panthers aren't a big draw

[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.040]
But you don't have to worry about that you won't hear about them on our morning show

[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.480]
You can be feel safe about that unless of course Chris Carter signs with the panthers

[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.880]
1027 at 560 WQM if your bald spot is getting bigger and bigger

[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.700]
You know who looked pretty good the other day in the elevator was the bob I'm sure you want to know why

[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.560]
He went to Charles off eerie

Which makes you look better when younger than you have in a coon's age and the deal is you mentioned the oranges when you call

[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.180]
But that big gross nasty looking bald spot because if you wear the system for up to 30 days

You know what happened you want people to do that people will say things like that

[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:34.320]
Because people think that the numbers are gonna go down say so he's trying to cover his ass

[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.760]

I was picking a monkey's wedding Joe's getting married

[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.220]
But anyway, he don't want to hear about the numbers because

[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.340]
Because he figures if they're crappy then I see it wasn't that important and if they're good

[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.140]

You're clothing designer Alex Fung 37 a huge sponge bob fan. There is innocence to sponge bob

[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.960]
Hey, Neil wants those hour by hour and so do I so I can get my overnight numbers. That's the only way you're gonna get him

[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.560]
You just don't care. He seems awfully indifferent

[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:43.620]
Which you know what that indicates to me. He's expecting a real being humble. Ain't no it says to me. He's expecting a real crappy book

[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:50.020]
A real crappy book now what you see that he can't keep a straight face. Why why is that

[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.140]
He's hedging his bets in fact, you know something if he does have a real crappy book that'd be a good excuse for the morning guy

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:01.340]
I think he's afraid the number won't be nearly as big because there's nothing worse as we know on this show

[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:03.940]
There's nothing worse than a week leading oh

[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.400]
man there is nothing worse than a week leading

[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:14.660]
But I think we got it down to a science now good job by Christian. Yeah, if we just talk about Chris and the runner see a Joe

[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.480]
See I say hi to Mo on a way. I'll give my pat on the piece

[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:24.400]
Can I get back to Robert De Niro now how do we get distracted so easily Joe walked in so says a new book

[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:32.020]
I'm gonna go back to this Oscar winning Robert De Niro turn himself into one of America's finest actors because his father was gay and a perfectionist who repeatedly rejected his own paintings

[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.980]
So says a new book that's been published in

[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:40.100]
Britain the Niro a biography by author John Baxter and published in Britain

[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:44.420]
The author claims that as young boy shuttling between his divorce parents Robert and Virginia

[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:49.940]
The Niro watches Moody father put himself down and that ignited the actors desire to be perfect

[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.600]
I don't think he's perfect

[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.300]
In fact, some of these is perfectly awful

[01:30:55.860 --> 01:31:00.720]
His father was important to him and his father wasn't recognized as French actor and director Robert could ye I think

[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:07.180]
Bob got to think I owe him one. I think I'd be I'm becoming famous was very important him to pay back his father for your father

[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.640]
I think that has a lot to do with Bob's will to succeed

[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:17.020]
complicating his relationship with his dead even more was the fact that De Niro's mother knew his father was a homosexual when they married and accepted it

[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:24.120]
As Baxter for De Niro acting may well have been a form of therapy as well as an attempt to come to terms with his ambivalent feeling toward his parents

[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.120]
De Niro's own marriages have been volatile and short-lived the 59-year-old actor is five children with three women

[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:36.360]
When De Niro's father died from cancer in 1993 his son preserved his studio as a shrine leaving an untouched attribute

[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:44.720]
The star who won Oscars for the godfather to in 1974 and raging bull in 1980 still visits the art of studio occasionally rights back

[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.820]
There when asked if he and his dad were close De Niro once said close and some ways

[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:53.580]
I was very close to him, but then he stopped and turned away as his eyes filled with tears

[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.980]
Not emotional don't you get like all choked up about that?

[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.760]
Huh? No

[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.380]
233 votes on air folks about that noon to one comedy bit-hour

[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.020]
What do you think?

[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.240]
I love it 96

[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:15.280]
It's okay 75 that's right there 171 if my math be correct

[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.080]
It's a waste of time 33 and I hate it 29 that's only 62

[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:26.120]
171 to 62 that's about the same ratio as your number compared to the morning one between six and nine in a summer book

[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.120]
Now what's you going to say about that when we get the art?

[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:34.060]
You know something when we get the hour by hour that's the first thing I'm going to do is we're going to find the ratio

[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:39.100]
Between the number that George got and the number between six and nine am then

[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:45.240]
We're going to compare the ratio to what George is getting paid around here and what that to pay a written old grumpy old man is getting paid

[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.420]
Yeah, that's right

[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.700]
And you know who we go to for justice because that's what we need man

[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.800]
We need justice around this place. We'll go to

[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:57.500]
Don't call on that's right and make him an offer he can't abuse

[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.480]
When that's silly as guy named powdered wig George Washington were a powdered wig

[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:09.620]
What's that guy and at the financial thing used to be on PBS uh the silly guy that got canned and now he's on CNBC

[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.900]
The war powdered wig. Yeah, well close to it

[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:21.520]
Louis Rookheiser, oh who is he never saw Louis Rookheiser. He wears what looks like a powdered wig George

[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.380]
Washington Thomas Jefferson the founding fathers Louis Rookheiser and Moldos and my people I know with a powdered wig

[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.960]
And then is it in britain or is it in france or both where the judges put on those uh slew

[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:38.440]
Britain's shoulder. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh, they're still being in a storage good god

[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:47.620]
Jim DeFeedy writes in a hero today. Can you believe I got a bedtime story from the hero? He's good that jib fat

[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.600]
Have you ever seen a picture? Yes, man. Oh man. He looks like he's bursting out of his uh clothing

[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.080]
But if he goes to see jeff Cohen at the pizza loft Jeff will become because Jeff is a fashion plate

[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.460]
He gave him some good tips and how to dress properly

[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.320]
Get a new look

[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.720]
I think that's what we all need around here. You know two weeks from today

[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:10.380]
I'll be 60 years old and jeff Cohen thinks I'm worried about a new look. Okay. This look is what I got

[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.020]
Okay, it ain't very good believe me, but it doesn't bother me

[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:16.520]
We've got a couple options with your body type guia bearers are Hawaiian shirts

[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:21.720]
In case you haven't noticed I don't wear guia bearers or wild jerts anymore

[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.200]
Once upon a time long before you knew me. I did wear those all the time

[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.240]
And also like some other fat people I know you never tuck in your shirt of course not

[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.780]
And you'll notice that I do tuck in my shirt. Okay. In fact, they call me the hallway father tuck or something like that

[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.960]
Even when I walked by when I came in this morning, I heard moey on hey tuck you something like that

[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:43.360]
Father tuck slay in the bathroom once you were tucking yeah

[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.000]
No, that was mo getting raped

[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:47.540]
Rape to do

[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.940]
Helping and guess who was in the toilet this morning when I was in there taking leak

[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:52.800]
Skippy

[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.180]
Skippy, but I don't like that. He was making sounds like that inside. How about a haircut?

[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.980]
How could you tell?

[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.500]
In fact jeff Cohen told me a pizza loft yesterday. He said that's skippy, but that guy's an idiot

[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.600]
That's exactly what he said

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:12.180]
He used to have Brian Schmutz's his account representative is this ae his sales guy and now he's got skippy

[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:17.300]
And he's not too happy about it skippy. You better go over there and make uh make apologies make amends to jeff Cohen

[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:21.160]
Because he's been on the iron issue for like 150 years at the pizza loft

[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:25.320]
He's gonna be pretty pissed off and fired up if you if you dick around with his account. Okay, Skippy

[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.720]
Anyway fact Jim DeFeedy writes in a hero today a good commentary

[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:34.500]
It says helping inner city children not a priority of Jeb Bush administration

[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.000]
What you looking for the teen calls outside the circling my car in his bicycle a few feet away near the corner 75th street north like 21st

[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.800]
Have no other group of young men walks with interest normally a white face on this liberty city block is looking for one thing

[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.420]
Crack

[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.360]
Driving past the boy on the bike Monday afternoon

[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.520]
I pull into a parking lot for the Scott Carver housing project on the second floor wallest

[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:58.800]
Chester is just opening the doors for one of the two places in this neighborhood for kids to go and feel safe

[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:04.880]
A computer lab operated by mad dad's a non-profit group that's been working in Miami since 1997

[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.600]
The local chapter of mad dad was formed following the murder of five-year-old

[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.060]
Rikia Isaac was struck down by a stray bullet while walking home from Martin Luther King day parade

[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:18.120]
Initially the group patrol the neighborhood on bicycles, but a few years ago expanded to provide after school activities for kids

[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.880]
Although the lab is open to all of the children in the hood

[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.540]
Chester and his staff were closely with 50 kids providing them with individual tutoring and math and reading

[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:29.560]
To make sure the kids in their program or attending classes even take them on field trips around the state

[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.400]
Just to show them that there's a world beyond the desolation of the inner city

[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.440]
The most dangerous hours for a kid are from 3 pm to 7 pm

[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.760]
That's when most juvenile crime takes places Chester

[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.400]
We're trying to give them something productive to do instead instead after school

[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.560]
He loved to expand his program and have another 50 or 100 kids

[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.360]
But he can't because of lack of funding in recent years the legislatures had enough faith in Chester's program to a lot of

[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.900]
$200,000 a year, but every time the budget item hits the governor's desk Jeb Bush vetoes it

[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.260]
In his opinion mad dad's isn't worthy of support

[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:05.880]
Chester's program isn't alone since becoming governor Bush is consistently vetoed projects that would help kids in the inner city

[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.400]
When we were vetoed

[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.660]
I just thought about the lights being turned off and not being able to keep the doors open Chester says

[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.780]
I thought about the impact it was going to have on these kids

[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.140]
In 2001 after the governor's first veto Chester had to lay off everyone on the staff including himself

[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:23.380]
Despite not being paid he continued to open doors to the computer labs so the kids in the hood could still combine use the equipment

[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:27.580]
Four months later the county eventually came through with emergency funding to keep the program alive

[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.540]
Chester doesn't understand the governor's priorities

[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.940]
We're not doing our job as a state says Chester our schools don't have the resources they need

[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.880]
It seems like we're more interested in building jails than we are building in schools

[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.740]
It seems like it's more important to put together tax cuts for people who don't need them than spend money to help our children

[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.740]
As Chester shakes his head three more young girls come in toting backpacks

[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:50.060]
These are smart kids he says, but they're facing a battle out there every week

[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:51.940]
There's another shooting every day. They're in new dangers

[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:55.540]
And what are we going to do to give these kids a safe environment every kid deserves a chance

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.960]
Latricia Adams walks through the front door the 16-year-old started with the program three years ago

[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.520]
And now volunteers is a tutor for some of the younger kids including 14-year-old Albert Anastor

[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.180]
Anastor is reasoning for being here as a sound as it is succinct. I'd rather be in here than get shot

[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.300]
He says good column by Jim DeFeedy crappy governor

[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:14.220]
I'm local

[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:16.120]
This is 4205

[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:28.380]
Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:31.720]
We take a good hard stiff look into startup

[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.480]
It only took one hit for them to burn their freaking song into our brains

[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.380]
But it only took one man to bring them to their freaking knees

[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.140]
They were after the fire

[01:38:49.480 --> 01:39:00.640]
So we're recording the song right and I know it's missing something but I don't know what lead singer jack wafert talks about his so-called creative process

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.320]
So I'm singing out loud you know

[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:08.060]
And just then the janitor is walking by and he goes uh-oh

[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:12.440]
And I go to commissar's in town and he goes uh-oh

[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:20.260]
And right then I knew we had a hit unfortunately for the band so did the janitor run bust him

[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:26.660]
Hey, it was my uh-ohs that made that song so popular. I was making sh** money as a janitor

[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.080]
I figured why not reemum good

[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:34.740]
Ron hired a sleazy lawyer who tricked the band into paying run $5,000 for every uh-oh

[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:44.160]
Every time the song was played anywhere in the world for his entire life that oily little bastard. I mean five thousand every time he goes uh-oh

[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.340]
We were broken about 20 minutes

[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:51.420]
I work at borders for crying out loud meanwhile. It is Hawaiian villa

[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:58.440]
Ron the janitor has attained rock star cult status which he openly uses to get laid a lot

[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:00.300]
Oh

[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:00.780]
Ron

[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.600]
Uh-oh

[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.420]
Uh-oh

[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:19.000]
After the fire they learned the hard way not to let a janitor go uh-oh in your song

[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.900]
It's a big juicy stopping wet look at show business tonight on inside the mind

[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.440]
Somebody wanted to hear inside the behind with a knack and I couldn't find it

[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.380]
So they'll have to do for right now. I couldn't find it. I mean there's one on every disc for like the last 400 them

[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:36.540]
So I looked for it for whoever asked for that. That'll have to think that's the thing. It's what?

[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.780]
No, it's not I already looked in there. It's not in the thing. Hello George. I'm trying to do the thing

[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.120]
Anyway, I'm thinking about maybe you ought to call our good buddies. How soon could they be here?

[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.300]
Which buddies? Ira

[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.680]
Because I didn't bring my sack today half hour to an hour. Didn't bring my sack. Is there a spot today for oh? Yeah, there it is

[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:59.100]

[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:03.760]
So don't find me over until I get home and I got all the stuff from the second my refrigerator

[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.960]
Just calm down Troy. Just calm down relax. You're not gonna be too happy about this article at all this bedtime story

[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.080]
From CNN.com you're gonna be pissed off and fired up

[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.660]
Has sopranos gone downhill the season. Yeah, that has oh

[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.880]
Ha ha everybody doesn't love artiates is here

The sopranos back lashes in full swing and not just among the Italian American any defamation activists who fourth near city mayor michael bloomberg to cancel his plans to march with co stars

[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:33.660]
Dominic chinesi and Lorraine Braco in the Columbus day parade

[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.840]
Internet message boards have become increasingly crowded with grumblings like we waited a year and a half for this

[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:46.640]
Even daily show wise guy John Stewart recently made a crack about how this season has been all that scintillating

[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.860]
See that's one thing about smallville you don't hear anybody saying that of course I'm issue you don't hear anybody saying anything

[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.360]
Because this audience don't watch smallville because their taste is in their totals, okay

[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:00.400]
Smallville just keeps getting better and better and better and the stories are good

[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.360]
You know, it's not just the fact that Clark Kent looks as good as he does Tom Molling is swelling it

[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.240]
It's because it's a damn good show

[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:11.620]
Got one jerk out there. It's always facts me. Yeah, you're only in a smallville because yeah, well that's true

[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.840]
But it's still a good show

[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:22.740]
It says of course the show meaning the sopranos still has its diehard fans who defend it against anyone who dares criticize such an important work of art

[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:27.800]
Me says Bruce Fett's entertainment weekly at the CNN Bruce frets. I fall somewhere in the middle

[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.160]
The season's been a bit of a letdown so far, but it's still better than almost anything else on TV

[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.700]
He says

[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.800]
Take the October 20th episode everybody hurts

[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.700]
It was penned by michael christopher multasanthi imperiali who was responsible for this season's nadir the Columbus

[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.940]
For this season the Columbus obsessed debacle christopher

[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:52.220]
But it was directed by boot a steve buchimi who shot one of my favorites of pranor standelones last season snow-bound dark comedy pine virans

[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:55.380]
Not surprisingly everybody hurts was a hit or miss a fear

[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:01.640]
Suicide was the episode's theme as is of the REM song that inspired the title that tune wasn't heard

[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.080]
But music editor Catherine de act to make effective use of tracks by Billy Joel and Nick Lowe

[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:09.020]
Tony was distressed to learn from Carmella of all people

[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.740]
That he's emotionally unstable ex-myster's glory at trillow

[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.620]
I had hang yourself

[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.580]
Tony confronted their joint therapist. I didn't know you had to have a joint therapist. That's what Steve M. said

[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:22.960]
You confronted their joint therapist about why she hadn't told him what had happened

[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.480]
Eventually 20 metadonation of these suicide hotline and glorious name, but he still seemed haunted by her memory

[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.940]
Moral of the story don't date people you meet in your shrinks waiting room

[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:37.940]
Meanwhile restaurateur ardy buco is where it goes down about each one of these episodes

[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.740]
You're gonna bore yourself silly reading those things and the audience

[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:47.480]
Yeah, anybody knows the show. He says maybe all of these dangling threads will be brilliantly tied up in the upcoming weeks

[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.520]
After all, we're not even halfway through the season yet in the meantime while it's still great these surprised

[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.400]
Ain't quite as great as it used to be then maybe painful to admit proactive songs says everybody hurts sometimes

[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:03.440]
They're wasting all our time with all these boring non-events instead of resolving unresolved issues

[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.200]
What does that mean?

[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.640]
It's like a soap opera when they start a storyline and then just uh, it never finish it

[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.360]
Like like passions like passions

[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.000]
There's never been a show on history that drags things out longer than they and they do it just to aggravate you

[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.460]
It's like it's like they should have like somebody come on one of the writers and say hey

[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:26.320]
Guess what this weekend and for six months and we're doing it just to piss you off and you know it and you still can't turn it off

[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.920]
Although I do miss Timmy very badly

[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:35.000]
That wooded area and the Northgate Park which is surrounding that wooded area that this

[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.120]
From Mendes search is still underway even at this moment. Yeah, it's still underway even at this moment

[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.400]
What a surprise huh they don't know nothing

[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:49.260]
Can you see the blood dripping from that thing? Yeah, you can't blood. It's red. Yeah, but I was just a little booboo

[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.160]
I have on my neck. I've had it for years and I want every six months about twice a year

[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.760]
I nick it while I'm shaving you know you rip it open you uh don't rip it open

[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.140]
I just think it deals and it bleeds you know

[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:02.820]
And just bleeds you have to get other I sure wish we had those steps to stick whatever they call it Michael's

[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:08.960]
Pacific. I have adhesive bandages. No, I don't need a bandages like dripping pouring blood out of there not yet

[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:12.840]
I'm talking about the stiptic pencil those those one those one I would

[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:19.040]
They still make those burn like a sun. Yeah, they work. They stop the bleeding and they stop all your circulation

[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.820]
Just like like that. Speaking of that. What a great segue although I have to do the break

[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.260]
Am I in the right hour even on this long? I don't know no

[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:28.300]
Oh

[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.280]
Man, where the hell is this show going

[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:40.020]
Yeah, into the tank according to one. Oh, that's right. We got 40% less uh train monkeys

[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.880]
What an asshole, you know, what a moron it and not only that not only doesn't understand how to read the goddamn numbers

[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.520]
But how the hell can you be talking about other people's numbers when you don't have any mo that's the question another train monkey. Yeah

[01:45:53.380 --> 01:46:00.180]
Cool, then how are you kidding mister and for him to come on here and say oh well the Howard David show sounds as better as great as it ever was

[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.880]
Well who the hell is he to be making that decision does he get any diary? I don't think so see that's the problem

[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.080]
That's the problem the audience isn't impressed by you telling everybody how great it is

[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:14.840]
They want to hear something beside Chris and Aron and Aron and Chris for three freaking hours every goddamn day, okay

[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.540]
See because of the fact that he's the voice of the dolphins now therefore it's strictly dolphin radio

[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:23.660]
Everything else is you'll notice it took it was took a little time

[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:27.860]
But everything else has been phased out every other sport

[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:31.120]
Not and that's just every other sport every other team

[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:37.680]
We have three hours of dolphins radio between six and nine if you don't care about the dolphins

[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.740]
If you don't want to hear or end day in crisp and even if you do care about the dolphins

[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:46.120]
But just want to hear the same crap every day forget about it go watch the old sopranos reruns do something

[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:53.840]
For watch CNN rehashing the same crap here telling you they don't know nothing basketball accord apparently connected to the apartment buildings across see that

[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.980]
sports basketball court you notice the tie-in again

[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:03.140]
That was almost but not not quite but I would say almost as impressive as amtrak that day

[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.600]

[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.980]
I don't remember even going into the break

[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.900]
It's like I'm in some kind of a time warp here. Jack O's nose explodes too

[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.980]
Says the inquirer

[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.640]
Just in time for Halloween. It's the jack O'lantern the grotto take a look at the picture

[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.480]
Look at that. Oh, it's collapsing

[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.180]
When you look at the time for Halloween. It's the jack O'lantern the grotesque singers mangled nose and nasal area shock

[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:18.440]
Passures by who recently spotted Lisa Marie's ex-Hubby in the parking lot of the Beverly Hills region hotel in Beverly Hills

[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:22.400]
As the inquirer has reported repeated plastic surgery as damage michaels

[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:25.560]
Sniffer and the tissue in its tip has died

[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.380]
The tissue in his tip has died gang green baby now the facial fee

[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:32.260]
And I go appears to be more frightening than ever

[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:36.440]
But the good news is that the public in no longer needs to make up to do his thriller number

[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:40.260]
How do you like that Vincent press and be proud

[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:45.780]
And now we got another one. See I always put these together like and wait till we get to Justin

[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.340]
Justin's instinct with a listen alone or you can be roasted about whatever

[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.420]
Yeah, by the way did not see man gonna be holding other press conference at noon today

[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:59.600]
He's gonna say like that all you media people you be standing on our hair and don't be doing this and don't be doing that and you shouldn't

[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.220]
Thrilled about that tarot card but

[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.340]
But whoever it is that we don't know who it is

[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:08.520]
But whoever it might be that we're communicating with I want you to repeat this often as you can't see when it's

[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.540]
Convenient for him he wants to use and manipulate the media

[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.680]
But when he wants to bitch him out wedding doubt he cusses him out

[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:20.780]
See he does have a good point, but it's too late now back when they just first decided that we're gonna use the military and use the

[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.540]
Applates for recount aerial reconnaissance

[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.360]
That's when a guy changed his locale

[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:30.840]
That's when there was a between a monday and saturday there was that long gap and he changed his whole plan

[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.760]
Why did anybody need to know that

[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.040]
We don't right

[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.640]
Anyway, ex brother-in-law shocking claims wacko jacko beat up bubbles and he bribe leesomery and debbie wrote him

[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:44.920]
This is in the globe

[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:55.460]
Michael Jackson cruelly beat and tortured pets engaged in bizarre voodoo rituals and injected himself with the chemical to turn his skin white claims his former brother-in-law

[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:59.220]
Those who just some of the shocking allegations that'll be made in the upcoming book

[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:04.140]
Tendatively called the Jackson family by Latoya Jackson's ex-husband Jack Gordon

[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:08.580]
Gordon claims he'll ripped a lid off Lacko jacko's closely guarded secrets

[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:11.360]
Including the allegation that the 44-year-old pop star

[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.620]
Rhybed ex-wives leesomery pressley and debbie wrote a merium he paid leesomery

[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:20.900]
$15 million to merium along with a promise of a record contract says Gordon he never delivered on that music career

[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.340]
Although Gordon has not found a publisher for his bizarre story

[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:30.240]
Michael is furious over his claims vigorously denying them and both debbie and leesomery also denies claims

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:36.160]
Michael says it's complete nonsense as a source close to the singer. He's telling his family. None of what Gordon is saying is accurate but

[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:43.260]
The 62-year-old talent-gain agent claims he got a glimpse into the hidden lives of the Jackson family during his many years

[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:47.460]
His Latoya's manager and husband that's husband and like the governor would do with the quote right right

[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:54.240]
There's six-year marriage ended in charges of spousal abuse and spousal arousal and a messy divorce in 1997

[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.700]
His most outrageous accusations of Michael's treatment of his famous pet chimp bubbles

[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.180]
I saw him punch and kick bubbles in the stomach claims Gordon

[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:07.320]
Add in them when he asked Michael about it to start replied he doesn't feel it. He's a chimpanzee. I have to discipline him

[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:13.760]
But Gordon who's battling lung cancer also claims he saw a monkey said on fire. I wonder if that was a trained monkey

[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.840]
You think I don't know

[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.540]
Another trained monkey

[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:26.980]
So uh, claims he saw a monkey said on fire during a weird voodoo ritual at the Jackson compound in Encino, California

[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:27.680]
1986

[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.420]
Gordon also says Michael's lighter skin color was due to weight liquid which the singer rejected

[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:36.520]
I saw him do it in 1985. He says the boxes were delivered to his house every day

[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:44.140]
The Las Vegas showbiz agent who managed Lorraine above it promises more explosive revelations about Michael and his plan and an upcoming tone

[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:48.960]
My book will uncover these seamy side of the Jackson's he tells globe. They're cruelty and obsessions

[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:54.360]
But Michael's attorney John Brankas says Gordon's claims are fabrications consider the source

[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.920]
He says I don't believe anyone will believe anything comes out of Jack word in his purse is what he said

[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:02.220]
You believe him? I believe him every word of it

[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.380]
And by the way speaking of our close personal friend

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:13.460]
And stink pop star just in timber like his talking mirage with an older he is gross man

[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.380]
There's a picture of him here. I wouldn't touch him with moe's hand

[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.300]
Good galley. I wouldn't touch it with moe's to pay

[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.580]
man as he grotesque

[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:28.740]
He's talking mirage with an older woman is 29 year old sweetie a list of malano which got George very upset this morning

[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.320]
That's all right. I love her. She's uh she's

[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.140]
She's not too much. She's skank is the word used to be really hot while she's sure and she lost it

[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:39.560]
She woke up one day and got a case of the Jason Gedricks you got the ugliest

[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:47.060]
Just in 21 and charmed starless have introduced their mothers to each other and friends say both moms have given their go ahead to the

[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:48.280]
Nupshul bye bye bye

[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:53.360]
It was real warm family event when Justin listen their moms had drinks together at the Hollywood restaurant club

[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.320]
Joseph's cafe recently revealed a source close to Justin

[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:02.720]
It was the first opportunity Justin's mom Lynn Harless or that hairless had to meet a listen. She brought along her mom Lynn

[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:03.980]
Isn't this great?

[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:08.880]
And this is in the inquire by the way put this in the category if we believe it

[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:15.600]
Lins opinion is incredibly important to Justin. He's looking long term would listen out of his mom has given him the thumbs up

[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.420]
Where do you think she stuck the thumbs up?

[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.320]
He's a young guy but Lissus really turned his head

[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.020]
She has a successful career of her own

[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:26.660]
But now one that puts her in competition with Justin like Brittany did that bitch

[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:31.840]
Just in the listen their moms were seated at the VIP tables of the hip restaurant club and I wouldn't disclose

[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.080]
Just that and Lissum made eyes at each other as they chatted with their moms

[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:41.160]
At one point Justin picked up two beers headed one to a listen and then the two blue and their bottles as if they were wind instruments

[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.120]
And they were duetting on a song they were nose to nose and this enough to make you puke

[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.240]
After the little performance they moved in for a kiss

[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:52.060]
Now what what is that? I don't I don't care

[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:56.440]
You already showed me that I'm not interested. I'm not impressed with naked sluts

[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.320]
While Alyssa and Justin hooked up just a few months ago Justin secretly had a crush on her for years a friend of the actors revealed

[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:07.960]
That was almost the first thing he told her when they met at the posh outdoor nightclub Falcon in midsummer

[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.040]
Josh told her sweetly you were my first love. I fell in love with you when you played Samantha on who's the boss

[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:16.720]
I used to fantasize about you all the time you were my dream girl

[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.660]
Alyssa gave Justin a sexy knowing smile and said bye bye bye

[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:26.160]
And said well this is no dream and you don't have to fantasize anymore

[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:27.200]
no

[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.380]
After that first romantic meeting and by the way you think that our Carlos is ugly

[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:39.120]
Which you're right. I mean Carlos is beautiful compared to this kid. Oh, yeah

[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:44.480]
Trust me he looks he's like Tom Brady compared to Justin Tinkerbell

[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:51.000]
After that first romantic meeting at Falcon they started hitting clubs like AD and the lounge and slipped into the premiere of the new video game

[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.080]
Dead to rights together

[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:56.540]
Alyssa also visited the set where Justin was making the video for his new single like I love you

[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.160]
The world when romance has quickly become something far more serious said the source three years ago

[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.520]
Alyssa was telling reporters that she planned to have children soon whether or not there's a man in my life

[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:09.100]
And now is their 30th birthday approaches inside or say britain's ex may be just in time

[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.300]
Isn't that cute little play on words there

[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:12.580]
Yeah

[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:17.580]
Alyssa's bringing your mother to be Justin and his mom is a momentous occasion to print a clear

[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:22.280]
I mean she's really sizing someone up and looking for mom's advice since a list and Justin been together

[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.680]
It's been one v-date after another now the vets are on for when Justin and listen will walk down the aisle together

[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:30.180]
Bye bye bye oh my god

[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.680]
He's grotesque

[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:36.060]
And

[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:42.000]
Now let's get to the most important story there. I know I held this back so far bedtime story about Jesus Christ

[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:46.200]
burial box may be tied to Jesus family was that hey Zeus

[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:52.520]
And unadorned limestone burial box apparently bought 15 years ago on the Jerusalem antiquities market

[01:57:52.520 --> 01:58:00.260]
Maybe the oldest archaeological evidence of Jesus and the first object ever found that relates to a member of his family and archaeological journal announced yesterday

[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.100]
The box or

[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.240]
Osu-Wary typical of those used in the first century a century to bury bones is inscribed

[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.760]
James son of Joseph's brother of Jesus and dates to around

[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:17.540]
62 AD when early texts say that James one of the first Christian leaders was stoned to that as punishment for preaching about Jesus

[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.660]
How do you like that Jesus Christ? Andre Lamar. I thought he was a hockey player

[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:24.640]
Nick Kintajak Lamar

[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.640]
Andre Lamar professor at the Sorbonne in Paris and especially in ancient inscriptions first saw the box last summer

[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:37.060]
After meeting the owner by chance in Jerusalem since then he and other scholars and scientists have checked the lettering style for historical consistency

[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:42.800]
And tested the surface of the carve letters to make sure they weren't forged in an article released yesterday by the non-sectarian

[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.540]
Biblical archaeological review. I bet you didn't know there was such a thing. No

[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:51.500]
The biblical archaeology review Lamar pronounces both box and inscription genuine

[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:56.860]
Though he concedes there's a small chance the Osu-Wary held not the James of the New Testament

[01:58:56.860 --> 01:59:02.220]
But the bones of a contemporary with the same name you don't think there was more than one James do you know never in history

[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:08.780]
It'll be extremely important if its authentic said Lawrence East Stager a professor of archaeology of Israel at Harvard University

[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.960]
Everything they put in this non-technical article seems to point in that direction

[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:18.540]
Stager said to discovery if it holds up would be important in a long-standing debate over how accurately Christian text depicts the life of Jesus

[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:22.300]
And would run scholars to take seriously the clues provided in the New Testament

[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:25.040]
Of course, you'll never prove or disprove the miracles

[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:30.120]
He said but to give him an actual authentic setting of place and persons is no small accomplishment Jesus Christ

[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:34.520]
Attitude to the historical Jesus range from extreme skepticism that says he never lived at all

[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:38.540]
A made-up story to those who accept practically everything that's written in the New Testament about him

[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:44.480]
Staggerated most archaeologists work in between and really don't have a great deal of existential interest and how it turns out

[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:46.940]
They're more interested in just understanding and recreating the past

[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:52.720]
In other words was there really ever a Jesus Christ and did he ever steal a freight train

[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:57.320]
And did they have to really live in that sleazy manger that awful cheap motel

[01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:59.560]
Don't you think Tom Mo that could help them out

[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.840]
If Tom would have known how important he was gonna be you know what the light on for us

[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.620]
He probably would have left a candle burn

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:11.400]
I tell you really let me down today is that Troy Stradford just when you think one of our salespeople is on top of stuff

[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:14.020]
They turn out to be a real a real butt plug. He's an asshole

[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:16.780]
You know first he did with the brandy's tag and then we got pompadopark

[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:20.080]
You think we have a new piece of copy for pompadopark? No, no, they've got nothing

[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.200]
Troy leaves me like naked here today, baby

[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:25.060]
And there are a few things in the world uglier than me naked maybe Justin

[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.960]
Even with clothes on he I'm serious. He is

[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.020]
nasty looking

[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.320]
God

[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.720]
Hey, anyway, if you're looking for a great time out

[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:39.500]
pompadoparks got live racing tomorrow night and three nights a week Wednesday Friday and Saturday lots of action at pompadopark

[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:43.520]
With free clubhouse admission free grandstand admission and free parking too

[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:48.500]
Another we're in this time of the year. We got to six floor dining room open of again the food there the other night was sensational

[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:52.960]
Even fat rich was like smiling and smircling. That's just before he turned all red in the face

[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.480]
The racetracks world read down top of the park restaurant is open for the racing season and you're anyone of chef Kirk

[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.060]
Lade's nightly specials or pick your choice of fresh seafood great delicious steaks or some shows desserts from the menu

[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:08.460]
And of course the dining room is way up there in the six floor so things get really rough

[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:10.860]
It's not far to the elevator to go up to the top and jump

[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:14.760]
Pompadopark is open for live racing like I said three nights a week Wednesday Friday and Saturday

[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.220]
Don't forget they knew early post-time 715 this season and of course

[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.200]
Simulcasting every day starting in noon seven days a week from tracks all over the country all over the continent

[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.600]
Every Wednesday still dollar night a pompadopark would draft beer hop dog soda popcorn even large

[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.420]
Pressels on your bucket piece and if you're really nice

[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:35.380]
Maybe Dick fineberg will give you a bettavy downs program from 1964 like he gave me the overnight you think you'll do that?

[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:36.480]
I doubt it

[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:39.400]
Bob Beaumont, Benny Webster, Eddie Cobb thanks Dick

[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:43.400]
Pompadopark in Pompadop each of blocks out of the line at Boulevard on Powerline Road

Don't forget live harness racing in its best three nights a week Wednesday Friday and Saturday

[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:49.400]
715 New Worldly Post-Time

[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.000]
We're supporting you 560

[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.300]
You a. M

[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:58.180]
Mandage I

[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:02.660]
Sorry

[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.020]
I'm not

[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.580]
Hello George

[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:38.960]
She'd have Tom Cruise as a lover

[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.820]
He's a man

[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:02.920]
Boy

[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:09.640]
1132 and 560 WQM guess what we got coming up in noon today man one of our great features every day

[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.540]
And I think we can live with this for a long time to come the moosey man stupid. Yeah

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:17.180]
That's why we enjoy him so much. We're gonna get together with a moosey man and

[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.480]
solve all these a sniper killings which if you've been sleeping all morning while we had another one this morning up there in Maryland

[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:25.040]
In the burbs silver springs

[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:27.100]
Buster Iber shot

[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.780]
He's dead silver spring Maryland

[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:34.800]
And by the way the inquirer said no, aren't we concerned since this thing is ongoing

[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.340]
And evidently not anywhere near conclusion in spite of what moosey man. You know what he's gonna say don't you noon nothing

[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.740]
He's gonna say absolutely nothing

[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:47.660]
Sniper it's not random. This is in the inquirer

[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.160]
It says investigators use satellites to track down serial killer

[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:58.240]
Investigators probing the Washington area sniper shootings believe the killer has a secret hit list of intended victims

[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:00.420]
And that list goes all the way to the White House

[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:06.640]
You buy see I'm skeptical right on the back you think that the bus now the FBI woman

[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.600]
See how come nobody is conjectured about that

[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.060]
You think that could have just been a coincidence it could have been but I don't know

[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:18.800]
The inquirer has learned that the secret service entered the investigation in its early stages and

[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.460]
sophisticated satellite technology has been employed in the search for the gunman or gun men who executed eight

[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.000]
Instant people are critically injured two others in the nine-day period

[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:31.520]
There was strong apprehension that the shooter may have been warming up to take out either the president another type of

[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:38.920]
Administration official or a congressional leader said retired circuit secret secret service agent who remains in frequent contact with the president's personal protectors

[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.340]
These attacks were well planned probably even rehearsed

[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:47.300]
Concern was so high that president Bush has been given daily briefings on the hunt for the sniper

[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.500]
And a top law enforcement inside a told the inquirer

[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:55.220]
We have the best investigative assets involved in this and our profilers have indicated from early on

[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:59.340]
They believe the ultimate plan is to take out the president or some other top political figure

[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.560]
We believe the shooter could go out in a blaze of guns or bombs and take many many more with him

[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:08.880]
Recently developed information indicates the possibility of two killers working in tandem

[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:13.540]
We also believe that the target sites were pre-arranged and the killers practice their getaways

[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:16.520]
And we've not been able to rule out a foreign terrorist connection

[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:21.240]
We think this may have been rehearsed and that's why we become worried about an attack on the president or other high-foil

[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.140]
Profiled individuals

[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:26.380]
We secretly began using a satellite to provide overhead pictures which are now being studied

[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:30.740]
We've used military choppers armed with special infrared scopes to check out wooded areas

[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.800]
There's been other evidence gathered at several crime scenes other than the shell casing and the Tiro card that were found

[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:38.000]
The police are being tonnid a

[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.720]
A message scrolled on the Tiro card found at the set of one shooting red deer policeman

[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:46.060]
I am god the other evidence recovered by investigate is including taunting and defined messages

[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:52.080]
Has not been made public due to the shooter's demands that messages he sends not be publicly this close according to veteran FBI agent

[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:57.560]
The shooting began on the afternoon of October. So where we know all of that and about the 13-year-old kid

[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.120]
psychiatrist Andrew Hodges told the inquirer

[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:05.020]
This is someone who's very angry. He wants others to feel his pain

[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:09.420]
He's not the typical serial killer. He's on a power trip at some point in his life

[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.800]
His masculinity was degraded by an authority figure now. He's out for revenge wait till you're this part

[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.640]
He may have been sexually abused or even raped by a male authority figure

[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:23.180]
That would piss me off you ready for that it says he may have been abused or even raped it

[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:25.440]
By some male authority will cable and rape me yeah

[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:33.080]
And the ultimate authority in this country's president Bush it says another possibility investigators looking into was the shooter or shooters a

[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:38.520]
Sleepers out of alcatas sympathizers terrorizing the citizens and giving up for something big set of sourcing investigation

[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:45.480]
The FBI rolled out all of its technological aids in a desperate attempt to bring the sniper down in addition to satellite photos taken from space

[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.560]
They might pinpoint the killer's vehicle at the time of the shooting

[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.720]
They've also used computer generated three-dimensional crime scene mockups and even brain fingerprinting

[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:59.220]
The 3d crime scene replications aid potential witnesses and recalling what they saw and the brain finger printing amounts today

[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:05.720]
They sophisticated light detector that reads electrical impulses in the brain the FBI source explained by showing a suspect a crime scene

[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:08.860]
Recreation will be able to tell if he recognizes it and whether he's been there

[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:14.000]
How do you like that? He says the case is the top priority right now

[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.720]
They're pulling out all the stuff to notice you see the beautiful job. They're doing right. I do a hell of a job man

[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:22.620]
And most man's gonna tell us that at noon 24 minutes from now. Moosey man's gonna be on there

[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:28.220]
And one thing I notice about him. He's kind of stupid. Yeah, I mean I could be wrong

[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.440]
He could be like a genius, but he don't impress me too much

[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:32.420]
And George is like yeah

[02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:34.380]
319

[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.140]
319 votes on that pole. What do you think in the old Wednesday noon to one comedy bits hour? Huh you like it? Yeah, I hate it

[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:42.760]
You don't give a crap

[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:48.920]
Part of the students who are there did they come after hearing the reports or were they already there and just decided not to go home

[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:54.860]
Now actually they they came here this morning and absolutely nothing

[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:58.220]
They'll talk to anybody they can find who's breathing

[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.660]
Or even close to it

[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:03.120]
They'll talk to plants shrubs

[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:12.060]
Fire hydrants anything they can put a microphone in front of to fill up the 24 hours and you do understand this shooting occurred at 556 this morning

[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.080]
There is nothing else going on

[02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:21.890]
This is even more all encompassing than Chris and Oranda or rendez or whatever's naming are you sure? Yeah, Oranda and Chris

[02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:26.350]
nonstop all sniper all day all day

[02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:30.750]
And Muff just came in and said uh like that just like that

[02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:34.250]
He said here are those numbers here's Maddie Bell with him numbers

[02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:39.070]
What's the question nothing

[02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:43.570]
What do you mean nothing? He wanted to see if the fact machine was working

[02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:50.330]
Somebody's calling him bugging him that the fax machine is working the fax machine is working great thanks again Jose

[02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:53.550]
From laser MD and hollywood

[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:57.930]
There's nothing infant. Yes laser MD ink. Yeah, thanks again. Who's it's working great?

[02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:01.950]
Working better than ever Muff so don't believe anything that those go I'm telling you on the phone

[02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:03.370]
Okay, don't believe him for a minute

[02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:09.310]
323 votes. What do you think of our noon to one comedy looks like we'll be doing it again tomorrow because so far looks pretty

[02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:11.990]
I love it 126. It's okay

[02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:15.670]
108 it's a waste of time 46. I hated 43

[02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:23.270]
Out of 300 see it's a waste of time those are the people that want to hear like bedtime stories four hours every day people take things a little bit too seriously

[02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:30.970]
See what I'm saying. I don't we don't want to take things too seriously because we're not gonna solve the problems in the world here on the show

[02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:34.550]
Although I'm Mike I'm very glad that that Jim DeFeedy story crossed by I have this morning

[02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:39.210]
About our uncaring obnoxious anti-human scumbag governor Jeb Bush

[02:09:39.210 --> 02:09:43.050]
How he can still be heading to polls justice is mind-boggling to me

[02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:45.870]
What kind of people would be voting for him for anything?

[02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:47.230]
anything

[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:55.370]
What kind of retardos would be voting for an anti-human sub sub scumbag whatever hell he is you didn't see deliverance

[02:09:55.370 --> 02:10:02.790]
Yeah, those guys know those kind well. This is Florida. Maybe we got a lot of them. Oh my god. They're up an air big guy damn tree

[02:10:03.590 --> 02:10:07.050]
And speaking of family tree take a look at that this functional family his

[02:10:07.050 --> 02:10:10.850]
Oh, what was that story about George P who did I say obsessed with him now? Oh

[02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:16.490]
brisney oh, yeah, Britney's got around George P. It's a dark day

[02:10:18.890 --> 02:10:22.390]
It wasn't bad enough just in tinkerbell got you really psychotic, but now

[02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:25.630]
Now she's in a George P Bush and by the way hello George

[02:10:26.410 --> 02:10:27.790]
Hey, Moe ever see George P

[02:10:29.250 --> 02:10:33.350]
21 till noon at five sixty WQA. I'm let me tell you about balance for life right now

[02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:38.150]
I was talking to pony tail at pizza loft yesterday he lost 40 pounds on balance for life. Did you know that I had no idea

[02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:42.090]
I think that's what he said I'm pretty sure and he's also got his and or somebody you know

[02:10:42.090 --> 02:10:43.630]
He's also lost a crap load of weight on it

[02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:49.730]
And last week we had that series of great puck pieces on channel four news about it without sunshine waving his ham hogs

[02:10:49.730 --> 02:10:51.110]
Hey out fatso

[02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:55.830]
If you want to lose weight there's 80 zillion ways to do it the very few of them that really work, okay

[02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:59.990]
The thing with a lot of these programs is you've got to figure out what you're going to buy when you go shopping

[02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:03.730]
Account calories and count carbohydrates and the zone diet is very complicated

[02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:07.070]
And it's almost impossible to figure out what you can eat in the amounts and the measurements

[02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:12.050]
But the zone diet is very effective for a lot of people which is why it's the centerpiece of the balance for life program

[02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:14.930]
But they figured out for you. That's why they bring you all the food

[02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:19.570]
That's it. You don't have to count anything other than just pick out the choices that you want under many every day

[02:11:19.570 --> 02:11:24.770]
You pick out between two choices for every meal and they bring a little black sack in that sack is all the food for the entire day

[02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:27.010]
Every day they deliver right to your work to your

[02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:32.650]
House wherever you want them to by six o'clock in the morning inside your little black sack is a little bottle of water

[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:40.130]
But most importantly three delicious gourmet meals fresh not frozen not prefabricated made with the best ingredients on earth and two delicious snacks too

[02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:43.230]
And like I tell you some days you'll say I can't eat all that food today

[02:11:43.230 --> 02:11:45.150]
Just do it because it helps lose that weight

[02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:49.670]
So pick up that phone and call balance for life and pretty soon you can be just as slim as Jeff Cohen

[02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:55.050]
Or you can look almost as lovely as the beast who's lost nearly 60 pounds already on balance for life called 954

[02:11:55.050 --> 02:12:04.050]
568 3229 and tell Troy nice earrings 954 568 3229 or visit their website at balanceforlife.com

[02:12:04.050 --> 02:12:10.330]
And this is sports 20 or 562 way yeah

[02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:19.410]
Underly the

[02:12:19.410 --> 02:12:20.730]
Consul is

[02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:23.530]
The

[02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:30.330]
問

[02:12:31.170 --> 02:12:31.170]

[02:12:31.170 --> 02:12:35.650]
The thunder leads up, the thunder leads up, what you be doing

[02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:42.770]
Get me a fascist black head, token schmutzeth off

[02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:49.410]
Is you take, cause you a hatton, boop, lipp, lipp, roo

[02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:55.230]
There's a huge black head and some mammary, who'll be smart

[02:12:55.230 --> 02:13:02.430]
Does they like, how you shot their shoes, thunder leads up

[02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:08.270]
All the way you watch and talk the white is cause

[02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:09.510]
Hello, George

[02:13:10.230 --> 02:13:15.610]
George is junior, say he trust you, thunder leads up

[02:13:15.610 --> 02:13:21.110]
Through stellar allies of the greedy oil mower

[02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:27.730]
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms

[02:13:27.730 --> 02:13:33.990]
The toplessies, the toilet, and then scrub the floor

[02:13:35.210 --> 02:13:41.270]
They gel you, don't wear sandals, god don't leave them

[02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:47.230]
Your coachy toe nails makes them wobble, wretching you

[02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:53.630]
Your mappillager makes you slide, it'll be velcro

[02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:59.710]
If you'll be what you can be, that token's new

[02:14:00.230 --> 02:14:01.410]
Another train monkey

[02:14:01.410 --> 02:14:06.710]
One day while you'll be flippin' back, hey, you may realize

[02:14:08.090 --> 02:14:13.550]
That's a tree that you just like your esterone

[02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:20.610]
That's when your head will move from side to side, thunder leads up

[02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:25.650]
It's a bush and from here, they be cracked from asshole

[02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:29.670]
So let me ask you, who'd you like better Chris or Orronday?

[02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:31.770]
14 till noon at 5.60 WDQ

[02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:34.610]
I'm the mad dog from Shulas at 1, hanged from Shulas at 3

[02:14:34.610 --> 02:14:39.270]
With Patrick Sir Tan, between 5 and 6, talking hardball with Crow to Shroo at 7

[02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:42.790]
And then we got to World Series game number 3 at 8.30, followed by Eddie Kay

[02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:45.970]
And the Joe Mark overnight show and those guys are, see Joe's just puttin' on it act

[02:14:45.970 --> 02:14:48.730]
You know, playin' very low key, low expectations

[02:14:48.730 --> 02:14:51.630]
And if they get a good number in there overnight, say, hey, look at that, Greedig

[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:53.850]
And if not, I say, we kinda knew it, you know

[02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:55.270]
He's a humble boy

[02:14:56.110 --> 02:14:57.730]
Is he eating humble pies at it?

[02:14:57.930 --> 02:14:58.810]
Not yet?

[02:15:01.210 --> 02:15:02.870]
Redheads harder to knock outs for you to that

[02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:06.410]
Oh, we will be carrying the press conference by the way with Moosey Man at noon

[02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.990]
We will?

[02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.670]
Why not?

[02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:11.190]
Well, what do you give me a look like that?

[02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:15.690]
Inquiry minds out there, people in their cars, people at work, they wanna hear what he be havin' to say

[02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:20.710]
We're all gonna get together around a radio and listen to what he be havin' to say at noon

[02:15:20.710 --> 02:15:25.150]
Because, you know, every time he holds another way he's press conferences, we get some real big information

[02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:26.810]
You know what I'm sayin'?

[02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:28.630]
Redheads harder to knock out, can you believe this?

[02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:29.510]
No

[02:15:29.890 --> 02:15:35.590]
The genetic work that makes red here red may also make caretops harder to knock out in the operating room

[02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:42.310]
A new study suggests that people with naturally red hair need about 20% more anesthesia than patients with other hair colors

[02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:49.330]
It's a small study that'll lead confirmation, but it marks the first time scientists have linked a visible genetic trait to anesthesia

[02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:56.550]
A doses said Dr. Daniel Cessler of the University of Louisville, who study will be presented today at a meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists

[02:15:57.650 --> 02:16:01.830]
Inadequate doses of general anesthesia, you can allow people to be called surgery or even wake up during it

[02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:04.930]
Problems that occur in one percent of cases, Cessler said

[02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:10.410]
You know what they have? They have like a little hammer that hits you with, if you wake up in the middle of the surgery they have like one of the little hammers

[02:16:15.130 --> 02:16:17.550]
If, well, see he and the redhead, that's why he walked in right there

[02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:19.150]
If he would have had red hair he would not have walked in

[02:16:19.150 --> 02:16:25.290]
If redheads require more anesthesia and are not given more the chances of having me call during surgery's increase he said

[02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:29.790]
Greg came in with some bonus check and you knew contract, it's nice to see

[02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:32.470]
I mean, you know, the congratulations on a tremendous book

[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:34.650]
Wasn't that bad?

[02:16:36.450 --> 02:16:37.510]
Look at this

[02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:38.150]
Hello, George

[02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.510]
Yeah

[02:16:39.710 --> 02:16:40.710]
Tremendous job, he said

[02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:42.690]
Hey listen, considering you know all things unequal

[02:16:43.290 --> 02:16:44.910]
It's your better than last summer than number five

[02:16:44.910 --> 02:16:49.310]
And see it's too bad that they're enough to pull those things out of there because I forgot that you were number five last summer

[02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:50.210]
Pretty weak

[02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:54.390]
Determining a patient is more anesthyzed as partly an art while it's a story

[02:16:54.390 --> 02:16:57.610]
It's okay, it's just a thing about redheads which I have an aversion to anyway

[02:16:58.290 --> 02:17:03.970]
And I know many people feel so many and it's not personal if you're a redhead don't say I G or just such a hard ass

[02:17:03.970 --> 02:17:06.990]
It's not personal, I mean you can't help it if you have red hair

[02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:10.750]
But I just had people with that red complexion and red pasty here

[02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:13.430]
There's just something about it like a like a caratop you know

[02:17:13.430 --> 02:17:17.410]
It just grosses me out then of course I look at a mirror and think well

[02:17:17.410 --> 02:17:22.930]
Anchorage, Alaska, a bird the size of a small airplane was recently spotted flying over southwest Alaska

[02:17:22.930 --> 02:17:25.910]
Puzzling scientists, the Anchorage Daily News reported this week

[02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:31.130]
The newspaper quoted residents in the villages of Toguyak and Menacotak as saying the creature

[02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:36.770]
Like something out of the movie Jurassic Park had a wingspan of 14 feet making it the size of a small airplane

[02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:42.470]
Anyway

[02:17:43.130 --> 02:17:44.830]
See what can you say to him?

[02:17:45.610 --> 02:17:46.110]
Huh?

[02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:50.230]
I'm trying to be a nice guy and it's just I know Greg was in the doorway and he said hello George

[02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:57.510]
At first I thought it was one of those old time auto planes the paper quoted Moses Kupchiak 43 a heavy equipment operator from Toguyak is saying

[02:17:57.930 --> 02:18:01.510]
Instead of continuing tour me advantage left and that's why I noticed it wasn't a plane

[02:18:01.510 --> 02:18:07.730]
The Daily News the largest daily in Alaska said scientists had no doubt that people in the region west of Dillingham had seen the wind creature

[02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:10.990]
But they were skeptical skeptical about its reported size

[02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:15.390]
I'm certainly not aware of anything with a 14 foot wind spin that's been life for at least a hundred thousand years

[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:18.570]
The paper quoted Raptor specialist Phil Schempfer saying

[02:18:19.450 --> 02:18:22.430]
Raptor specialist? Is he like an NBA fan?

[02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:28.770]
From Toronto? Kupchiak said the bird disappeared over the hill any radioed Toguyak residents to tell him to keep their chillin in

[02:18:28.770 --> 02:18:35.430]
Another local resident of pilot who initially dismissed the reports said he recently saw the bird from a distance of just a thousand feet while flying his airplane

[02:18:35.430 --> 02:18:41.190]
The people in the plane saw him John Bacca was quoted saying he's huge. He's huge. He's really really big

[02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:43.090]
You wouldn't want to have your children out

[02:18:43.090 --> 02:18:48.890]
Shampon Rob McDonnell of the west fishing wildlife service had there been several sightings over the past year and a half of a stellar eagle

[02:18:48.890 --> 02:18:52.750]
A fish eating bird that can weigh 20 pounds and have a wingspan of eight feet

[02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:54.110]
Wow like a dinosaur

[02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:57.210]
Man

[02:18:57.210 --> 02:19:02.270]
Oh you're gonna be upset about this well maybe not maybe not because she's really gross and she's got a nasty chin

[02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:10.010]
She's got a chin like Maria Shriver's a matter of fact Reese with his spoon. Oh I hate her. Oh good. I believe she's a beast. Yeah she's nasty

[02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:14.750]
Well I make it a big deal about her. I don't like to do that. Reese with his spoons nude shocker

[02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:18.530]
Oh my god. America's sweetheart bears her boobs for Paul Newman

[02:19:19.710 --> 02:19:23.610]
Reese with his spoon has been called America's sweetheart after goody goody rolls in recent hit movies

[02:19:23.610 --> 02:19:28.190]
But she took it off for all off for a sizzling topless scene with Ulster Paul Newman and a racie flick

[02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:39.070]
Boy she is nasty the film was 1998's Twilight which resplays a spoiled teen who runs off to Mexico for some wild living in a red hot sex thing with her boyfriend portrayed by leave Shriver

[02:19:39.930 --> 02:19:43.130]
Kind of a name is that her boyfriend is leave

[02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.630]
Sure

[02:19:45.630 --> 02:19:49.070]
L.I.E.V. is a guy's name?

[02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:53.050]
Not where I come from. Now starring in the box office smash sweet home Alabama

[02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:58.330]
Restried to pass off the nudity is inconsequential but that's not how a viewer the film describes it

[02:19:58.330 --> 02:20:05.170]
With a split in Shriver have a steamy love scene in the opening minutes as the viewer she's lying on a couch topless while he runs his lips down her bare breast to her stomach

[02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:14.010]
When Shriver goes to the bathroom Reese who was then 20 goes into the bedroom where 70 year old Newman playing a private eye cent by her parents to bring her home is waiting

[02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:21.050]
The camera frames her naked from the waist up as she walks into the bedroom says the viewer where she is shocked to find Newman would broken in earlier

[02:20:24.130 --> 02:20:28.830]
And of course I wonder do you think pause got any clothes on in this scene? We can only hope

[02:20:31.170 --> 02:20:35.370]
I'll find it I'll find it and she walks in and says to Paul

[02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:37.010]
You call that a penis?

[02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:40.410]
It's starting to see gorgeous Reese topless and uninhibited in front of the camera

[02:20:40.410 --> 02:20:43.330]
But it's also a little unsettling because Newman is old enough to be her grandfather

[02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:48.270]
The legally blonde beauty only shows her breast in the scene but the film director Robert Benton says

[02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:51.050]
The script originally called for full frontal nudity

[02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:53.530]
What a seconding thought with her

[02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:58.670]
She agreed to do that Benton says that day before we shot the scene I told her I thought it'd be more appropriate to do it just from the waist up

[02:20:58.670 --> 02:21:01.650]
I think she was probably deeply relieved I wonder how deep

[02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:04.750]
But she never said she was dreading it or anything she was terrific

[02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:06.050]
That deep

[02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:10.110]
The star Mary while she Paul Newman's old is probably really shriveled up by now

[02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:15.490]
The star Mary to actor Ryan Philippe and mom of three year old Ava confesses that it wasn't that difficult to prance around half naked

[02:21:15.490 --> 02:21:21.730]
Actually it was liberating Reese 26ers I was frightened to death at first and I got to the set and I thought I'm not embarrassed about my body

[02:21:21.730 --> 02:21:23.870]
Maybe my chin but not the rest of my body

[02:21:24.510 --> 02:21:31.030]
My ugly face yes but the rest of my body no and when she makes faces like when she grimaces it goes to a whole new level

[02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.410]
Oh!

[02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:33.910]
Speaking of ugly broads

[02:21:34.650 --> 02:21:35.590]
And now look at this

[02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:41.490]
See I don't want to criticize the media because I know they have a lot of hours to fill up but it's reached the new level of desperation

[02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:49.350]
They now have what's the guy's name John he's the CNN House doctor he does all the medical reports

[02:21:50.610 --> 02:21:53.330]
This is the second time I've seen him under this morning

[02:21:54.290 --> 02:22:01.030]
He has a thing the model he has a model the human innerids of the guts

[02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:05.710]
And he's showing us where this victim this morning the bus driver was shot

[02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:07.270]
Now the guy is dead

[02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:10.550]
Right does it really make a difference where he was shot?

[02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:12.390]
I mean we know he was shot on the bus

[02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:14.230]
Right

[02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:16.750]
But does it make a difference where in the abdomen he was shot?

[02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:19.870]
No not at this point or even before

[02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:21.390]
No because now he's dead

[02:22:21.390 --> 02:22:22.630]
Remember Reagan's colon

[02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:25.030]
Yeah but Reagan was the president

[02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:29.830]
I remember long before you were born Eisenhower had his good bomb movements after his heart attack

[02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:31.590]
On the front page of the newspaper

[02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:35.550]
President had two good bomb movements today and we all said holy crap that's good

[02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:36.010]
You know

[02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:42.190]
But this guy I mean he was a bus driver he's the latest victim it's a grotesque horrendous story

[02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:45.750]
But what does this add to our to our understanding to our knowledge?

[02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:47.130]
It fills the turret

[02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:48.730]
I see right on

[02:22:48.730 --> 02:22:51.510]
Reports Martha Mayfire a face charges

[02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:52.150]
Oh right

[02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:57.490]
Federal regulators reportedly are set to recommend filing fraud charges against Martha Stewart

[02:22:57.490 --> 02:23:01.550]
The home decorating entrepreneur who's been on the scrutiny for possible insider trading violations

[02:23:01.930 --> 02:23:07.590]
Related to her sale of income systems stock that's Martha no relation to the former me believe and New York Ranger runs Stewart

[02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:19.550]
The Wall Street Journal and financial time citing people familiar with the matter said staff at the SEC have told Stewart the agency plans to recommend filing civil securities fraud charges against during connection with their controversial stock sale last December

[02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:22.070]
So what a grace say to give you like a bass song give you a big hug

[02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:24.030]
Slap me on the back

[02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:26.990]
Slap you on the back give you a big hug what do you say?

[02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:37.690]
Oh

[02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:43.210]
Stewart sold nearly 4,000 m-clone shares in December day before the company's application for the cancer drug

[02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:48.510]
Urban talks ran into a regulatory herlots and m-clone shares diving tumbling puking their guts out

[02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:54.990]
Stewart does denied receiving any insider information out of the sale saying she had a long standing remove the broker to unload income when it fell below $60

[02:23:54.990 --> 02:24:00.890]
Oh George before passing the matter on the Justice Department congressional investigators said that the various accounts of what happened from Stewart

[02:24:00.890 --> 02:24:09.970]
Her brokers in Sam walks in the former in Clone CEO and friend of Stewart don't add up the sale is taking a big toll on the companies she had and the company she had shares of Martha Stewart

[02:24:09.970 --> 02:24:15.350]
Living her down 54% this year all right and for whatever reason we all we all despise Martha Stewart

[02:24:15.350 --> 02:24:24.210]
We I mean like Rosie we know why we can't stand Rosie she's a disgusting fat nauseating just with an accent though everything about her physically

chamblin rate me yeah six minutes after noon at five sixty wqa and victims of clerical abuse urge American

[02:32:05.010 --> 02:32:11.770]
vishops to stand up to Rome stung by the Vatican's criticism of a clergy sex abuse reform policy

[02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:17.470]
a leading victims advocacy group is urging American Roman Catholic prelates to stand up to Rome outside

[02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:22.310]
Catholic churches more than a dozen U.S. cities Sunday members of survivors network of those abuse by

[02:32:22.310 --> 02:32:27.590]
priest snap handed out leaflets calling on worship person to demand the removal of abusers regardless of

[02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:33.530]
what officials in Rome say and they are absolutely correct virtually every bishop has come under fire for

[02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:38.370]
protecting molesters said David cohe has seen national directors snap maybe it's time to come under fire

[02:32:38.370 --> 02:32:43.610]
for protecting kids the action coincided with bishop willton Gregory's reiteration of his belief that

[02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:47.690]
the Vatican is not rejected the hard line reforms developed the summer in Dallas by the U.S. Roman Catholic

[02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:52.110]
bishops Gregory present the U.S. conference of Catholic bishops and bishop of the billville in the

[02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:56.550]
Lloyd dice he's returned on the Sunday after a week of high level meetings in Rome after week of being a high in Rome

[02:32:57.790 --> 02:33:01.770]
Gregory downplayed the Vatican's criticism of the sex abuse policy saying there must be a series of

[02:33:01.770 --> 02:33:07.030]
conversations about three troubling aspects before it can be approved he said the holy sea will not make

[02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:11.770]
a final decision on the policy until after a joint see that comes in there again he was high in roman

[02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:16.730]
I was talking about joints a joint U.S. Vatican commission works out the differences and that's and you

[02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:20.370]
know something I always wondered what that smoke was they blow out of the Vatican there was never any doubt yeah

[02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:27.510]
when in doubt they're getting smoked out the Vatican said Friday was troubled by aspects of the

[02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:31.970]
U.S. time to permanently oust all known abusers other trouble spots include the policy's definition

[02:33:31.970 --> 02:33:36.570]
of sexual abuse and the role of local lay review boards that are supposed to advise bishops on abuse

cases Gregory said the names of the four U.S. bishops who will serve on the commission will be announced

[02:33:40.530 --> 02:33:45.310]
this week and we can't wait for that nevertheless snap remains unconvinced that Rome will be

[02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:48.850]
satisfied with minor changes critics say the before policy has been gutted

[02:33:48.850 --> 02:33:53.370]
Gregory will say the commission is tweaking the Dallas charter clohes he said but that's desperate

[02:33:53.370 --> 02:33:58.890]
spend-doctoring the Vatican objections are clearly at the very core of the Dallas charter that's

[02:33:58.890 --> 02:34:03.330]
right we did our dog and pony show we did the window dressing now cut the crap get serious

i'll be very happy when this year is finally over i'm facing 20 years in prison i'm coming to terms

[02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:45.550]
after reading the story and answering four to five hundred phone calls with people asking me to

[02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:54.250]
give sideclops a back rub i finally realized this might be my father uh her maybe it was me i

[02:36:54.250 --> 02:37:00.090]
sure so i couldn't do it now though i'm so freaking loaded with so much my compass is permanently

[02:37:00.090 --> 02:37:07.650]
pointing south i'm not ruling out the fact that i could be turned on by some man can like i'm not

[02:37:07.650 --> 02:37:12.850]
saying i wouldn't have checked this guy out in the shower but she got to remember us tall band

[02:37:12.850 --> 02:37:18.890]
we didn't take showers deep i didn't run from the stink and be fast enough so to surmise

[02:37:19.410 --> 02:37:27.410]
not quite sure the story's accurate not quite sure it's not yay 12 15 at five 60 wqm press conference

[02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:31.210]
momentarily now what were they finally revealing to us i guess they're letting out dribs and

[02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:36.850]
drabs of information the note that was found behind the ponderosa steakhouse the threat by the

[02:37:36.850 --> 02:37:40.110]
sniper was that if they don't meet his demands which they're not telling us what the demands were

[02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:47.190]
he's gonna start shooting children yeah that's the first time we're here in that lovely and uh

[02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:50.450]
how many of you're like living up anywhere in that area you think you're gonna be sending your kids

[02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:56.290]
to school anytime soon no no to school how about out of the house no exactly and they're never even

[02:37:56.290 --> 02:38:00.070]
crossed my mind like down the store to the 7 11 i don't think so

[02:38:02.390 --> 02:38:06.430]
pretty scary craft man but the most man will be out any second now probably make us feel a lot

[02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:09.910]
better about don't you think no about life in general and the great job that they're doing

[02:38:11.350 --> 02:38:15.470]
373 votes on a pool today what do you think the niels wednesday newton one comedy bits are

[02:38:15.470 --> 02:38:24.510]
141 say i love it 38% they love it and the hour two it's okay 128 34.3% right there 72%

[02:38:24.510 --> 02:38:31.270]
guy damn it it's a waste of time 52 i hated 52 which is 27 point like i said overwhelming

[02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:36.910]
overwhelming there's a bodhidle a fifth beetle you know you have a lot of copycats and you

[02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:42.250]
also have a lot of people who want to insert them into this investigation but they said the evidence

[02:38:42.250 --> 02:38:47.130]
does line up with that original tarot card and again i said remember the tarot cards said

[02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:54.030]
i am god that kind of takes you away from any kind of Muslim fundamentalist to say the word god

[02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:59.190]
if you're a Muslim fundamentalist they god is out and that's what you mean so ridiculous

[02:38:59.190 --> 02:39:04.390]
words god is the sacrilegious thing for a fundamentalist like that so it kind of takes it

[02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:07.850]
it's also a sacrilegious thing to be going to strip pubs like all those runs that were down here

[02:39:07.850 --> 02:39:11.730]
in florida were doing so what the hell is that have to do with anything both detailed here we take

[02:39:11.730 --> 02:39:17.890]
it away you're not the fifth beetle okay man oh only six but fuck up fuck up fuck up they don't

[02:39:17.890 --> 02:39:21.630]
know what the other talking about in this to which what else he's expert about because he used

[02:39:21.630 --> 02:39:30.690]
to be a cop he's an expert man oh man well let's just continue because you know the

[02:39:30.690 --> 02:39:38.050]
muslim man he could screw up the pope supreme court refuses to revisit execution of teen killers

[02:39:38.050 --> 02:39:43.750]
all right a bitterly divided supreme court refused yesterday to consider ending the execution

[02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:48.430]
of killers who are under 18 when they committed their crimes for justice has said the court should

[02:39:48.430 --> 02:39:52.430]
continue a re-examination of the death penalty begun in earnest last year the court recently

[02:39:52.430 --> 02:39:57.870]
abolished executions for the mentally retarded the court passed a perchance to reopen the question

[02:39:57.870 --> 02:40:02.710]
whether executing very young killers violates the constitutions ban on a cruel and unusual punishment

[02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:06.850]
so what did he say about speaking of people who aren't too sharp a gray he said he's going to be

[02:40:06.850 --> 02:40:11.370]
working on the thing with norm and said everything that's weak there you go see I told you if he

[02:40:11.370 --> 02:40:15.990]
just relax I'm relaxed the guy just had a death in the family he's under a lot of pressure he's

[02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:21.630]
under a lot of stress he needs a little extra time to make up some stories he has to take a look

[02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:27.070]
at those numbers and examine what the bad mistake he made there in the morning now did he have any

[02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:31.410]
comment to make about those morning numbers do you know not to me I know but I noticed when I

[02:40:31.410 --> 02:40:38.350]
made some comedy was trucking and chortling he was chortling and chuffing the guy huh he's so funny

[02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:44.150]
the practice of executing such offenders is a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving

[02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:48.490]
standards of decency in a civilized society roaches his john paul stevens joined by justice

[02:40:48.490 --> 02:40:52.770]
his david suitor Ruth Vader Ginsburg and Stephen bryer who we still have his ice cream we should put

[02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:59.430]
an end to the shameful practice but too bad they lost currently states that allow the death

[02:40:59.430 --> 02:41:03.850]
penalty may impose it on killers or 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes and they will continue

[02:41:03.850 --> 02:41:09.130]
doing that I don't see any problem back to you because one like I've told you before once you're

[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:14.690]
dead your dead for a long time and whether the person who pulled a trigger was 16 or 17 or 110 it

[02:41:14.690 --> 02:41:19.190]
doesn't make a god damn bit of difference or if they were crazy and if you can tell me that being

[02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:23.190]
16 or 17 you know the difference between kill on somebody you're not killing somebody then

[02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:26.530]
you're living in someplace that I don't want to be in you know I'm saying six you know the

[02:41:26.530 --> 02:41:31.090]
difference like you're living in a country with about a crazy people would gun you know there's

[02:41:31.090 --> 02:41:35.490]
wolf blitzkrieg who says federal law enforcement authorities are working under that assumption

[02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:40.450]
they're clearly going through all of the motions that they've gone through so many times over

[02:41:40.450 --> 02:41:46.050]
I seriously in a history of the human race I mean at least during OJ there was ongoing stuff going

[02:41:46.050 --> 02:41:50.390]
you know what I'm saying there was the DNA evidence and there were like different angles here

[02:41:50.390 --> 02:41:55.070]
there is nothing happening you've got somebody gets shot and killed or goes to the hospital and

[02:41:55.070 --> 02:42:00.550]
is in critical condition and and then they tell you about well that somebody heard a loud sound

[02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:05.190]
or somebody heard what they thought was backfire so and that's not a bulletin when a gun is shot

[02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:10.590]
you know that's not like a major bulletin and that's it that's basically it which they could say

[02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:17.090]
that in about 30 seconds and yet they're managing round the clock what is Bodhidle again you made

[02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:22.510]
with that letter with the evidence showing that it has some similarities and some identifiable

[02:42:23.350 --> 02:42:30.230]
markings on it remarking on we have to take it I don't think he's going to choose the sniper

[02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:35.330]
attacks and murder attacks have to do with money I just can't believe that this person is going

[02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:40.030]
along killing ten shooting thirteen now all of a sudden it's coming out that he wants money

[02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:47.350]
we have to cooperate any way we can to get some kind of communication with this psychopath if it

[02:42:47.350 --> 02:42:52.550]
has to be communicated with cryptic signals then chief moose has to do that and I agree

[02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:56.950]
he comes chief mumu because we don't have anything else so you've got to follow up on it and we're

[02:42:57.150 --> 02:43:03.130]
hoping we're hoping and praying that this psychopath makes a mistake this coward makes a mistake

[02:43:03.130 --> 02:43:08.610]
and then we're able to capture but we have to go along with any avenue that we have and that's

[02:43:08.610 --> 02:43:13.750]
part of the investigation now I want you to interpret for me because he's not very articulate to

[02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:21.090]
say the best what what did he just say I have no idea I'm just I'm speechless yeah we've

[02:43:21.090 --> 02:43:24.870]
pretty just said right we got to get this coward and we got to go along with the investigation

[02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:28.530]
and where the hell's chief moosey that's what I like and I'll see they're just vamping now

[02:43:28.530 --> 02:43:33.550]
just stalling for time very depressing when we expect the moose man to be out there north

[02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:38.590]
Korea issue urx congress oh is that that's something it doesn't have to do with a sniper I'm sorry

[02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:44.350]
this is from Washington Post the White House with held North Korea's admission about a nuclear

[02:43:44.350 --> 02:43:48.630]
weapons program from key democrats until after congress had passed its resolution authorizing

[02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:52.270]
over the rack prompting complaints on Capitol Hill that the administration has left politics

[02:43:52.270 --> 02:43:57.930]
influence its conduct of foreign affairs absolutely correct to ease from today's election by the way

[02:43:57.930 --> 02:44:04.590]
all you dark folks out there vote 20 30 times against the Jeb Bush several senators said

[02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:08.410]
through their aids of defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld did not mention North Korea's covert

[02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:12.330]
nuclear weapons program during a classified briefing held on a secured chamber less than three

[02:44:12.330 --> 02:44:15.870]
hours before two senior administration officials revealed the news in the conference called with

[02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:21.770]
four reporters sent a majority leader prompt vassals such as he is city learned about the weapons

[02:44:21.770 --> 02:44:25.450]
program from newspaper articles the next morning and set in form relations committee chairman

[02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:30.850]
jule biden jr said he was told about two hours ahead of the press at least two republican

[02:44:30.850 --> 02:44:34.870]
senators said they earlier received individual briefings from assistant secretary of state James

[02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:39.530]
Kelly democrats on Capitol Hill were critical of the twelve day gap between the admission by

[02:44:39.530 --> 02:44:44.290]
North Korea and the administration's disclosure during that time congress passed the rack resolution

[02:44:44.290 --> 02:44:48.450]
and president bush sounded hours before the seven p.m. disclosure about North Korea administration

[02:44:48.450 --> 02:44:52.470]
officials said they revealed the information because former Clinton administration officials had

[02:44:52.470 --> 02:44:56.810]
leaked the news after learning from about it from state department contacts democrats said the

[02:44:56.810 --> 02:45:01.570]
episode could further impair the administration's already fragile relations with congress how do you

[02:45:01.570 --> 02:45:06.510]
like that keep him in the dark give him to vote you know do step in line and then oh well guess what

[02:45:06.510 --> 02:45:12.070]
we forgot to tell you but of course we're not going after them because they do have the

[02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:17.770]
weapons see right we're not going after anybody who does have anybody that might someday have well

[02:45:17.770 --> 02:45:24.010]

mourn the loss of this gentleman and I was at the hospital meeting with his family extended my

[02:51:29.010 --> 02:51:38.210]
sympathies to them and it's very close to home but with any of these murders that we have seen

[02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:45.630]
any loss of life is a real tragedy for this entire community I would ask that the community

[02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:51.330]
keep this victims families in their thoughts and prayers as they have for all of the victims and

[02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:56.910]
their families of the last few weeks and would ask that people respect the privacy of this family

[02:51:57.470 --> 02:52:00.510]
as they go about their grieving process thank you

[02:52:04.290 --> 02:52:10.310]
the law enforcement community is looking at this situation certainly very similar to other

[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:16.990]
situations that we've been dealing with as a region evidence the listics will be gathered

[02:52:18.170 --> 02:52:23.850]
so what determine if this situation is linked yeah we will have that work done and when it is

[02:52:23.850 --> 02:52:34.250]
complete then that will be shared we remain concerned about the safety of all the people in our

[02:52:34.250 --> 02:52:43.790]
region we realize that the person or the people involved in this have shown a clear willingness

[02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:54.190]
and ability to kill people of all ages all races all genders all professions different times different

[02:52:54.190 --> 02:53:04.150]
days and different locations certainly encourage everyone to remain cautious vigilant about their

[02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:14.270]
activities to remain observant anything out of place anyone driving away from an area erratically

[02:53:14.810 --> 02:53:23.910]
anyone behaving strangely or in a way that maybe it's not themselves but we also want us to remain

[02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:34.110]
resolved to remain focused and very resilient as Americans we're proving to be resilient time and

[02:53:34.110 --> 02:53:41.930]
time again as people try to threaten our way of life try to threaten our freedom as individuals

[02:53:41.930 --> 02:53:51.310]
and our freedom as a nation so certainly very difficult plea with all of the violence among us

[02:53:52.270 --> 02:54:00.310]
but again we must practice our individual freedoms remain resilient as a nation

[02:54:05.890 --> 02:54:13.710]
yeah i like to join mr. Duncan in asking everyone in our community to to put the

[02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:19.710]
thoughts of mr. johnston his family all of our victims in their minds

[02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:26.250]
and that we do everything in our power to give them their privacy in their moment of loss

[02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:39.090]
we will try to take a few questions but again i would hope that we do it in a orally and respectful

[02:54:39.090 --> 02:54:40.370]
our fashion

[02:54:42.050 --> 02:54:44.270]
we will be coming with

[02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:50.130]
whoever it was that's a bit another message you have another message now

[02:54:50.690 --> 02:54:51.530]

[02:55:05.010 --> 02:55:07.150]
do not have any requests

[02:55:07.150 --> 02:55:10.910]
uh for you as the media to take four of any message

[02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:12.350]
chief move

[02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:18.310]
was there some confusion this morning about the location of the shooting that this complicate and

[02:55:18.310 --> 02:55:21.790]
slow the police and medical response to the scene

[02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:24.910]
i am not aware of anything that

[02:55:26.010 --> 02:55:32.010]
prohibited the response of police and medical to the scene uh i was very proud of the

[02:55:32.010 --> 02:55:37.130]
response everyone did the kind of things that we talked about that we breathed them on

[02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:40.270]
with regards to our response

[02:55:40.270 --> 02:55:43.970]
do you see any relevant information from witnesses this morning that you might be able to share

[02:55:43.970 --> 02:55:50.290]
with us uh sir has been out practice to not disclose anything from uh any uh witnesses

[02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:57.170]
we certainly continue to our work with uh those individuals and i was trying to be clear and

[02:55:57.170 --> 02:56:03.010]
saying that we have no person look out to share and no vehicle look out to share uh from

[02:56:03.010 --> 02:56:08.410]
regards to get it out in the community without more some of published reports or to nigh on

[02:56:08.410 --> 02:56:13.390]
i just held a sad note can you confirm some published reports would say that you have a uh in

[02:56:13.390 --> 02:56:19.210]
one of your notes uh that was picked up at Conrosses State House that this gentleman or whoever is

[02:56:19.210 --> 02:56:21.530]
specifically targeting schoolchildren

[02:56:23.170 --> 02:56:27.650]
or threatening to target schoolchildren. Remaining a lot of money to stop the feeling work for

[02:56:27.650 --> 02:56:34.050]
threat threatening i realize you have a lot of experience but could you confirm it or in lightness

[02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:41.930]
well sir i tried to be real clear that uh we feel like all of the people in the Washington

[02:56:41.930 --> 02:56:49.290]
metropolitan region are advised to be on the heightened alert uh that these

[02:56:49.290 --> 02:56:55.410]
and the question people have on this have shown ability and a willingness to kill people of all ages

[02:56:56.090 --> 02:57:00.950]
all races all genders uh different times a day different days of the week

[02:57:02.610 --> 02:57:07.690]
and uh different professions so i think that that has been real clear.

[02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:12.610]
There were schoolchildren specifically mentioned in the letter that's what the question is

[02:57:12.610 --> 02:57:14.610]
sir respectfully that's what we want to know.

[02:57:14.610 --> 02:57:17.730]
To those you believe that you're dealing with a

[02:57:18.410 --> 02:57:24.290]
traditional support like called serial killer or do you think this is some kind of

[02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:30.630]
bruised or sport and we do this a different type of serial killer and we've seen it before.

[02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:39.750]

thinks you missed something no not a thing i would i would try to be delicate he's he's kind of

[03:02:31.470 --> 03:02:36.070]
frighteningly inarticulant for a police chief of like any a place with more than 10 people you know

[03:02:36.750 --> 03:02:41.210]
well his work isn't based on his ability to speak he doesn't convey the greatest amount of

[03:02:41.210 --> 03:02:45.810]
confidence is what i'm i'd be trying to say you know what i'm saying what do you say it i'm saying

[03:02:45.810 --> 03:02:51.350]
i don't know what i'm saying if there's a but i smell it that's what i'm trying to say 410 votes on a

[03:02:51.350 --> 03:02:55.050]
poll what do you think the news Wednesday noon to one comedy which it looks like we're going to

[03:03:03.430 --> 03:03:11.870]
i hated 57 and so waste of time 56 so that's 101 13 what is it 296 to 113 i'd say that's just about

[03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:15.390]
the same ratio of your numbers compared to most in this book and if we don't get those hour by

[03:03:15.390 --> 03:03:19.930]
hour tomorrow i think we're gonna have Maddie Bell's head on a plate come on Maddie you've always

[03:03:19.930 --> 03:03:25.670]

[03:03:25.670 --> 03:03:30.930]
us yet he's never let us down confidence is high when it comes to little Maddie Bell and like i

[03:03:30.930 --> 03:03:34.850]
said if you don't have them now i've got a column here that was written a 10 days ago by Steve

[03:03:34.850 --> 03:03:39.230]
Dunlavy in the New York Post and i've been holding off on reading it because of the fact that it's

[03:03:39.230 --> 03:03:44.170]
just i don't know because it's another piece of wild speculation but the fact is now here it's 10

[03:03:44.170 --> 03:03:49.790]
days later this was written October 12th and outsock October 22th and i think i'm gonna read it's

[03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:55.510]
very short Steve Dunlavy wrote this 10 days ago in the New York Post it says these are terrorists

[03:03:56.610 --> 03:04:01.590]
lary johnson former CIA agent former state department agent said loudly and clearly at the end of the

[03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:06.230]
day we have to give some credence that there is a terrorist threat johnson was responding to the

[03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:10.610]
fact that the Montgomery monsters latest hit was gris grimly performed by two human beings in that

[03:04:10.610 --> 03:04:15.950]
now well known white panel van facts that might well suggest a terrorist attack i personally think

[03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:20.290]
it is a g-hud rather than a crazy nuke johnson a veteran counter intelligence expert said

[03:04:20.290 --> 03:04:24.310]
Jim cost well if that's the case how come they request for the money and so on you know what i'm saying

[03:04:24.310 --> 03:04:29.330]
right and anyway Jim calstrom the former boss of the FBI near who invested in the downing of the

[03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:34.270]
t-w-880 doesn't dismiss the theory either this is a different situation and if there are two people

[03:04:34.270 --> 03:04:38.790]
involved in the shootings you said if there are two it is unusual two people do not have parallel

[03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:44.030]
psychoses if there are two involved that have to lean toward conspiracy calstrom said it's strange

[03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:49.130]
that two people could work together bonded by the idea of committing faceless assassinations i'm not

[03:04:49.130 --> 03:04:52.810]
on the ground there so i don't want a second guess cops were doing a great job he said the two

[03:04:52.810 --> 03:04:57.770]
assassins means to some degree a conspiracy and conspiracy leads to something else what's on

[03:04:57.770 --> 03:05:01.610]
candy about the past and this is that a gunman and perhaps co-conspirator held the capital of

[03:05:01.610 --> 03:05:06.310]
this country prisoner the past 20 days now we should say the Washington areas completely paralyzed

[03:05:06.310 --> 03:05:10.730]
schools have canceled out their activities some have even papered over their windows and the

[03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:15.850]
experts who fear that geniuses at work evil as it is also fear that this may well very be the

[03:05:15.850 --> 03:05:20.170]
work of more than one low nutcase they're not left to ponder the viciously indelible images from

[03:05:20.170 --> 03:05:24.710]
today's pitiful murder scene first of all there's the tragic picture of the gas nozzle and the

[03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:30.330]
gas tank of the silver blue buick owned by the man who was mindlessly slaughtered second are the

[03:05:30.330 --> 03:05:35.630]
seconds of guys wearing jackets that dramatically impossibly sadly said FBI anti-terrorist squad

[03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:39.330]
and then there's this image of law enforcement FBI or local police i don't know

[03:05:39.330 --> 03:05:43.930]
wearing a ski mask that's something i've only seen previously in Ireland on the british anti-terrorist

[03:05:43.930 --> 03:05:49.070]
special forces making anonymous patrols this city this country has not come to grips with the fact

[03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:53.850]
that one lone gunman two-long gunman or jihad can close down the capital of this country in a

[03:05:53.850 --> 03:05:57.610]
terrible way we have to recognize as a colleague of mine said ten gunmen doing the same thing

[03:05:57.610 --> 03:06:01.670]
could close down the country what we're seeing is ordinary people having the lives terminated

[03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:06.610]
in grimly extraordinary ways if this murderers stop shooting i would gladly be his final victim

[03:06:07.210 --> 03:06:09.130]
said steve don't leave you how do you like that uh

[03:06:09.930 --> 03:06:15.150]
nice off but we really don't know you know and of course we don't know the contents of that letter

[03:06:15.150 --> 03:06:19.550]
because they don't want to tell us and he's wrong about the uh serial killer buddies were

[03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:23.550]
Henry Lee Lucas and Otis tool serial killer buddies that went around together killing people for

[03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:28.730]

I have recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion to take pot shots at the president

[03:09:54.330 --> 03:10:01.910]
I have reappeared much like pucks the tawny fill the groundhog creature that reappears each year

[03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:09.930]
to determine whether or not we'll have an early spring I wish it to be known but it was I who

[03:10:09.930 --> 03:10:15.510]
was responsible for saving the lives of those nine minors in Pennsylvania over the weekend

[03:10:16.410 --> 03:10:23.050]
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it as not to appear of spotlight hog however

[03:10:23.450 --> 03:10:29.170]
I feel the American people have a right to know the truth here's what happened

[03:10:29.170 --> 03:10:37.470]
upon hearing of this unfortunate accident I will race to the scene I lowered myself into the

[03:10:37.470 --> 03:10:45.350]
mind using an old Ron Popeo pocket fisherman and some bailing wire down down down into the depths

[03:10:45.350 --> 03:10:52.270]
of darkness I think never thinking of my own safety but rather of the safety of those man on the

[03:10:52.270 --> 03:10:59.070]
ground when I reached the miners they said to me hey you're the guy that invented the internet

[03:10:59.070 --> 03:11:06.490]
right I said yes we all had a Mike's hard lemonade which I brought with me down into the hole

[03:11:06.490 --> 03:11:11.970]
and then we sat around and reenacted the fart scene from blazing saddles I thought you should

[03:11:11.970 --> 03:11:19.050]
know the truth and now much like the groundhog creature pucks the tawny fill I'll flink back into

[03:11:19.050 --> 03:11:28.190]
