[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.940]
Now the Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM.

[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.760]
Gee, Dan, it was a world of turn.

[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.540]
Here we are, Astro.

[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.300]
Hello, Mr. Getson. Welcome to Radio Show.

[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.800]
Hi, the Jains sent me out to pick up a couple of battles.

[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.120]
Which he used them for.

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.000]
That's what he wouldn't say. Just give me a couple of seashells.

[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.960]
Sure, that'll be one bar lad now.

[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.780]
Here you go.

[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.660]
And just a minute, Mr. Getson, I gotta ask you a few questions.

[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.640]
I'm in kind of a hurry. It won't take long. What's your address?

[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.400]
Skypad apartment. And when were your boys?

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.480]
2062.

[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.100]
Now do you follow or obey religious organizations that might pose a threat to the Galactic Federation?

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.580]
Hey, what kind of...

[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.640]
I'm sorry, Mr. Getson, but I can't tell you these batteries until you answer my question.

[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.000]
Okay, no.

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.920]
You're very good, Mr. Getson, and now what's your penis size?

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020]
What? What the heck got to do with that?

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.760]
Sorry, Mr. Getson, maybe a cartoon, dammit.

[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.120]
I don't share how about just your social galaxy now.

[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.940]
Well, be here all day.

[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.240]
So the question, Mr. Getson, one trillion four billion...

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.440]
At radio's lock, we have questions.

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.080]
And you damn well better have the answers.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.060]
And is this for that free catalog?

[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.940]
Oh, no, you've got to pay for that.

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.100]
902 at 560 WQ, I'm happy Wednesday to you. Here we are again.

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.800]
I do want to announce at the beginning of the show today that we have a ceasefire

[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.700]
has been broken between yours truly and Moe.

[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.500]
But we have a little ceasefire for the time being.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.200]
Although I didn't hear that one call this morning, but nevertheless we'll let that happen.

[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.000]
This one time, we'll let that pass.

[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.320]
See, this show, I hate to break the news to anybody.

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.300]
I better give the result of the poll right away.

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.660]
Okay, because otherwise it'll appear that I'm breaking the ceasefire and then I'll give my little spiel.

[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.400]
And then we'll go on and do a doing our show.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.500]
Yesterday we asked you, have any problems with Neel's comedy bits or comments about race?

[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.520]
Since there are those people attempting to make it appear that this is a racist program

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.340]
and that the comedy bits that we play in the language we use is done from a malice, etc. and so on.

[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.000]
I guess they didn't hear me talking about that the problem situation in a little time in Georgia last week, remember that?

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.720]
I remember.

[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.180]
Were they still have segregation?

[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.500]
I read it twice because I couldn't believe that that kind of crap still goes on in the US.

[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.040]
Nevertheless, anyway, we asked yesterday, do you have any problems with Neel's comedy bits or comments about race?

[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.720]
No one, Howard David, as an asshole was the runaway winner, 489, 43.8%.

[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.880]
No, they're funny as hell, 135.

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.840]
Yes, he's erased his 105, 9.4%.

[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.220]
And no, I agree with him, 85, 7.6%.

[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.540]
Out of well over 1100 votes, 1115 to be exact.

[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.640]
That was the poor result.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.940]
And now the ceasefire begins at this point. I assume.

[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.000]
Can I assume that?

[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.840]
I'm assuming it.

[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560]
But I do want to say this.

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.240]
Anybody who pretends that they don't understand that the stick on this program is stick,

[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.580]
who are too stupid to understand the difference between the reality of any comments I make and the stick.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.680]
Well, I feel sorry for them. That's all I can say.

[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.620]
Whether it's anybody also works in a radio station, whether it's anybody in the audience, whether it's people are too illiterate to sign their name,

[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.000]
other than with an X. That's not my problem.

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.460]
In addition to which this show didn't just all of a sudden one day become whatever the hell it is now.

[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.680]
This show has evolved over 26 years in this market plus over a long time.

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.420]
And especially over the last several years.

[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.040]
It's evolved to what it is now.

[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.100]
Just like supposedly we're supposed to be evolving and maturing and getting a little more adult and being less thin skined and offtight about words and language and things like that.

[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.940]
Supposedly.

[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.560]
So if there's anybody who doesn't like this show, my best advice to you is if you want to call Greg Reed, be my guest, go right ahead.

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.760]
He's got better things to do. I'm sure especially these days.

[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.580]
But if you want to do that fine, if you want to complain, best idea is turn it off.

[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.860]
If there's anybody out there don't like what they are on the show.

[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.940]
So if they accidentally fell into it like that one guy heard this morning at one sharts or hey, turn it off to free country or get pissed off.

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.940]
Whatever it makes you happy.

[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.260]
End of commentary.

[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.120]
Here's a little piece to get us started.

[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.680]
Today Florida Killer post personal ad for cyberfriend.

[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.540]
Thank you, Beast.

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.120]
Am I supposed to say the Beast brought this in or not?

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.820]
Is that not an idea?

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.280]
I don't know. I'm just, hey, listen.

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.720]
Want to make sure I get the lay of the land, you know?

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.540]
Fort Lauderdale, the online personal ads reads nicely describing a world traveler and scholar who loves cooking, water sports, yoga and hiking.

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.420]
High on bill, I'm compassionate six foot two two hundred pounds athletic guy who enjoys Mediterranean food.

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.940]
The poetry of Keats and Baroque music says the ad accompanied by a photo of a smiling benign looking fella.

[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.760]
Kind like that pipe bomb kid, benign looking, goofy, anywhere will get him.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.220]
What William Coday's ad doesn't say is that he used hammers to kill two extra fans.

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.800]
I just find it very interesting that he chose to leave out some important details.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.860]
I wonder what the already Johnson would think about that.

[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.320]
Very important details about his criminal history, Brian County prosecutor Chuck Morton who helped him to the Coday of murder in April told us unsentinel.

[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.180]
The website where the ad is posted offers potential pen pals or clue www.sciberspace.inmates.com.

[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.840]
Coday also offers up his inmate number along with the post office box.

[00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.880]
A jury convicted Coday a former librarian in Fort Lauderdale a first degree murder for beating and stabbing his girlfriend Gloria Gomez after she broke up with him in 1997.

[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.920]
According to trial evidence, Gomez had 57 wounds from the hammer and 87 stab wounds and gashes.

[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.840]
The jury was not told that Coday was previously convicted of manslaughter for killing another ex-girlfriend in Germany in 1978.

[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.020]
He admitted using a shoemaker's hammer to beat her to death and served 18 months in a German prison.

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.380]
So you served 18 months in a German prison. 18 years would have been good. Don't you think that would have been improvement? Much better.

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.960]
So maybe you could do the same thing in 1978 and then again 1990. So I was almost 20 years anyway.

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.340]
The personal ad also didn't say that Coday is waiting sensing hearing a June in which a judge will decide whether he gets life in prison or the death penalty.

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.180]
All right. But he'd like to meet you. He'd like to meet in greed. Maybe he can meet you at the behindstake in shake.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.840]
Like that pedophile or rabbi. Wasn't that the deal? He was wanting to meet that kid at stake in shake.

[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.860]
I forgot where. I think somewhere like that. He wanted to meet the he wanted to shake it.

[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.320]
At any rate. Here's our poll call against before we do the poll. Let's talk about this other scumbag.

[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.940]
Who just you know you look at him and you wonder what kind of a moron you know what kind of a silly ass goofball and another computer nerd with his own website.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.360]
What am I always told you about computer nerds beware some of the most dangerous people in the world are these punks who are computer nerds.

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.140]
Several different categories. The ones who play dungeons and dragons beware of them too.

[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.080]
You know that's kind of out now. Isn't it? Is that still in? It's out. It's out.

[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.000]
Now the better thing is to be having your own website like this ax murder. We just had the hammer murderer.

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.020]
The hammer's a murderer. He kills me some days. But anyway.

[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.300]
Student caught a Reno charged in mailbox bombings a 21 year old college student who looks about 16 by the way.

[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.800]
Was charged in the string of pipe bombs left in mailboxes in five states after it was arrested on a windswept highway outside Reno.

[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.860]
Ending a man hunt that stretched across half the country.

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.980]
Luke J. Heldor of Pine Island Minnesota was captured after dropping at least one gun out his car window said Alan Davidson.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.840]
Spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol a bomb squad was called to check the vehicle for explosives.

[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.700]
It's him said Gail Jacobs an FBI spokeswoman in Las Vegas.

[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.400]
And let me say it again if you've missed I can't imagine how you could have missed it.

[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.960]
But they showed the clips of him being escorted away by the cops and he's just a goofy looking punk.

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.120]
Yes, I'm a person. Huh? Yucking it out. Yeah, he's yucking up.

[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.120]
Huh? Hey, and that great fun. Yeah, he really had something to say.

[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.360]
You know, we had to say I'm an asshole. That was his state set.

[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.960]
And we who are we to disagree. Heldor was stopped more than 15 hundred miles from Western Illinois where some of the first bombs were found Friday.

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:45.220]
A motorist on interstate 80 spotted Heldor's Westbound vehicle and tipped off authorities who pulled him over after a 40 mile chase that reached 100 miles an hour.

[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:54.960]
Heldor was taken to jail in Reno Federal prosecutors now were charged with using an explosive to maliciously destroy property affecting interstate commerce and with using a destructive device to commit a crime of violence.

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.940]
US attorney Charles Lawson said Heldor was responsible for the injured suffered Friday by a woman in tipton Iowa.

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.460]
He was captured after a no, why do they repeat this? And we already just say that he dropped at least one gun out the window. Yeah, already.

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:16.180]
The capture came just eight hours after the FBI issued an all points bulletin for Heldor and said one to question him about the 18 pipe bombs found since Friday.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.560]
His father with a family's home in the Minnesota also pleaded with Heldor. Please don't hurt anyone else. You have the attention you wanted.

[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.940]
Now it's easy to criticize the father and I thought that his comments were like a little bit bizarre but nevertheless put yourself in his shoes.

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.620]
How do you like it if one of your kids all of a sudden turns out just for a kicks to decide to start putting pipe bombs in mailboxes?

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:44.520]
What do you say then? What's the reasonable response? Oh, not my kid. Right exactly.

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.920]
Tid bits about how to begin coming in on Tuesday yesterday.

[00:08:48.120 --> 00:09:00.360]
A 30 city apparently made a cellular phone call that was related to a southern Utah station on Monday afternoon and a college newspaper in Wisconsin said it gave the FBI a seven-page letter yesterday that was received over a weekend inside with Heldor's name.

[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.360]
The letter was postmarked on Omaha on Friday. The day the first eight bombs were found in Iowa and Illinois. They before eight more bombs turned up in Nebraska.

[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.480]
He was on a joyride. He was like heading around the Midwest and down to Texas and then back up to Reno. Maybe the plunges brains out.

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.820]
At Heldor's family home in ours drives southeast of Minneapolis. His father Cameron read a statement urging a Sunday call home.

[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.260]
I really want you to know that Luke is not a dangerous person. Cameron Heldor said just because he's blown up people's hands and stuff like that.

[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:34.940]
I think he's just trying to make a statement about the way our government is run. I think Luke wants people to listen to his ideas and not enough people are hearing him and he thinks this may help.

[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.260]
He added Luke you need to talk to someone. Please don't hurt anyone else. It's time to talk. You have the attention you wanted. Luke we love you very much. We want you home safe.

[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:55.760]
Right. Oh, like I said, what's he going to say? And he wasn't doing this to make any statement. No. He's doing it because he's a smart ask because he's a little wise ass punk with a website.

[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.240]
That guy's on there with a bunch of his goofball buddies. That rambling thing you read.

[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.040]
Evan, I always said that going to college you specialize in asshole 101. That's what you go to college for. See how much of an asshole you can be.

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:13.220]
And you know, it used to be silly things like jamming people into a phone booth and swallowing goldfish. Now it's putting pipe bombs in mailboxes and stuff like that.

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.640]
Not to mention all the hazing crap that we get into. A lot of interesting stuff about hazing on the internet, by the way, for all you internet computer geeks.

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.060]
Here's our poll question today inspired by the popularity of Spider-Man no doubt.

[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.680]
And what a shame that you're using.

[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.540]
Spider-Man does whatever spider-Man. See why wouldn't they use that theme in the movie old dated.

[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:49.400]
Yeah, it's old and dated, but who I see I don't understand that. If you aren't one of the people who followed Spider-Man in the comics, then why in the world would you go see the movie?

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:58.620]
That cartoon was off the air and over with a long time ago. A lot of cool Spider-Man fans don't remember that.

[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:08.180]
I see. Well, I do. But I'm an old man. Yeah, you're an old fart. And I'm like ancient. I'm like a fossil. I'm like a walking fossil. And very proud of it, by the way.

[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.240]
What was your favorite all time? And I don't know if I worded this right. Maybe when you use some help, and maybe not. See what you think.

[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:25.080]
Which was your favorite all time cartoon or comic book action figure? Did I leave something out? No, that covers it.

[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:34.340]
Okay. And here's my short list so far. This may be this may be it. I could be wrong. Superman of course. Captain Marvel, I think really is taking short trip.

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:42.360]
And see, I don't pay attention to this to say to comic books anymore, but is Captain Marvel still around? I don't even know.

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.140]
And what the hell was his name? We know about Clark Kent. Oh, let's speak of the Clark Kent. I'll get to that in a minute about last night. Smallville.

[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:58.860]

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.620]
917 at 560 WQM. So anyway speaking of that you miss smallville last night.

[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.900]
Yeah, which I think was a bad mistake of bad move on your part. Although I must confess I was sitting here doing a little bit of work

[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.060]
and I forgot all about it and I looked at my watching it was 10 after 9. I said to myself.

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.140]
Not two weeks in a row. I can't do that. So I rushed back into living room and turned on whatever the hell was on.

[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.140]
I'm warning brothers. Yes, the double. I don't think I missed anything all of exciting except the part where I'm.

[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.240]
Clark Kent was running around naked. Did we find out that anybody give us the name of a Captain Marvel's real name? No.

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.740]
Well, what the hell is that all about? What's wrong with you people man?

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:56.500]
Billy Batson. I think you I think that sounds like it. Yeah. That's what there's two facts is saying the same thing.

[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:06.120]
And that's it. I just got I just got you asking. Did anybody give us the name? Well, I had to be sure that the mouse machine, especially when I got the mouse machine.

[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.620]
I got this short ass cord hooked in my head. Oh, it was nothing worse than having a short ass cord.

[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.640]
Billy Batson. That's it. See, I would remember that because it's too long ago.

[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.460]
And I don't think they even make Captain Marvel anymore. I could be wrong about that. He like I told you yesterday he got short shrift. Yes.

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.020]
So anyway, if I can get back to smallville and if you'd stop interrupting me with the cock a rye like Billy Batson,

[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.280]
Norma can't call it here last night after being at the evolved game the son photo baseball team,

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.280]
which the paper said there was little over 6000 people there in Norma claim there were if there were 3000, it was a lot.

[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.720]
He said it was like the most sparse gathering he's ever seen in his life, even though they had that smashing victory.

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.200]
So he calls me at about nine thirty and I'm in a middle watch and smallville and I thought to myself,

[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.080]
what a major asshole I call somebody. Somebody calls me in a middle watch and passions. You just don't do that.

[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.080]
You don't do it. There's certain times when you don't call somebody unless it's a major emergency, which it was not.

[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.840]
But at any rate, he did have something very interesting to point out that when he was up in Vancouver a year ago,

[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.940]
smoking a lot of bad weed, I'm sure Norma. He was somehow stumbled on the taping of smallville, which they do taping Vancouver.

[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:17.320]
And stumbled upon Tom Welling and met him and actually sat down and talked him for ten minutes. So he tells me.

[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.080]
And he says, oh, you watch that show too. And he said, isn't he? And he used the word that I would never use.

[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.460]
But that's normal. He's a little more flampoint, I guess, than I am. Or a queen. He said, isn't he gorgeous?

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.140]
See, I don't, I don't use that word talking about guys gorgeous. I would say pretty, you know, pretty. I mean, although I, which is worse, gorgeous or pretty?

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.960]
I don't know. Either one would make me uncomfortable. He's got a real pretty man.

[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.220]
I don't care whether it's going to make you uncomfortable because believe me, nobody's going to say it about you. So what are you worrying about?

[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.660]
That's good. You got gorgeous or pretty. You're pretty like, you know, boring. But at any rate, I'll take it.

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:57.000]
See, one thing about George, if it sounds like he mumbles when he's on here, it fits right in because he looks like he sounds kind of like, you know, hornet tone.

[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:05.600]
Right. But I don't know. I just would never call it got gorgeous. To me, that's like, I don't know. I feel squeamish. I feel like Norma can't say something like that.

[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.560]
But he's pretty. In fact, the one word we could all agree on, I think, is hot. But at any rate.

[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:17.880]
So it was a good show in last night. And then of course, there always, I've noticed the, the, there's a recurring thing that happens in that show every week.

[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.480]
The last two minutes after they come back from that long, ponderous last commercial break that seems to go on for a lifetime.

[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.660]
The last segment always has to be like a tear jerker. There were a lot of people jerking it during those last few minutes on that show.

[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:38.240]
And last night we were squirting tears because, is it Tanya? Is that her name? The one that's got the hot for Clark? And he has for her, but he's, he's too much of a pussy to like, say, hey, you know, let's do it.

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:48.400]
I mean, here's a guy that looks just like God who can fly. He's a, he can't fly yet. Well, he can, he can dart around pretty damn good so far.

[00:17:48.860 --> 00:18:04.260]
And he's got X-ray vision too to see right through your clothes. And he still can't get laid. And he's down to between Chloe, whose life he saved last night. I think that's her name. And Tanya. Well, anyway, Tanya is, in a run boy friend, you know, the goofy guy that's always wearing a high school jacket. Yes, the jock type. Well, anyway, his father died.

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:17.960]
And so at the end of the show, we have to see the funeral and there's all standing out there in the rain and there's John Schneider and Mrs Kent and this one and that one and that, etc. And then at the end, there's pork clarks that how he winds up all alone, I don't know, because I wouldn't leave him alone very long.

[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.900]
But he's standing out there all alone in the rain, you know, just kind of very a turd jerking there at the end of a small village every week.

[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.940]
Anybody doesn't want smallville is a piece of turd in our book. Okay, just mention that in passing.

[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:35.780]
Anyway, here's our poll, which Eric's probably getting a little bit perturbed. I bet your Eric doesn't want smallville. Probably too busy.

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:53.740]
No, he's not too busy to watch smallville, but probably his lovely wife doesn't know. And come to think of it, he probably does watch it. I bet you she watches it because from when I'm heard, a lot of guys who are like whipped, the women control the remote control in their home.

[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:59.860]
Anyway, which was your favorite all time and he ought to be whipped. Okay, if she's as nice as you said she is.

[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.900]
Yeah, I haven't met her. Bokeh Brian did. He said she was a sweetheart. See, that's what I'm saying. So he ought to let her watch whatever else he wants to watch.

[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:23.440]
Which was your favorite all time cartoon or comic production figure? So in connection with this last that I'm sitting here for getting about watching smallville. And I'm listening to these old TV things, things, things.

[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:31.060]
And you know that show or a couple of shows that we did on these this to me that was some of my favorite stuff ever in recent years. I love those shows.

[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:38.780]
And I think the audience did too. And if not that's too bad anyway, because now that I have these all out, I'm going to play some of these themes today, interspersed with a regular crap.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.480]
Which I think that's a good idea. Yes. Well, yeah.

[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.060]
No, I haven't talked about it. I love those. Oh, this is, it's just great. It makes me goosebumps.

[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:55.280]
Of course, Pat psycho Pat's on a board today. He won't probably enjoy most of it because he's not old enough to remember most of these things. He'll pretend to like him.

[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.140]
Oh, like the original Spider-Man theme. Did you remember that? Yes, I do.

[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:11.380]
He said Scott Melon, he's a hell of a player, not good enough for the Panthers, but nice going to his Scott for San Lewis as they kicked the shorts ass last night.

[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:17.820]
And how about that Josie theater? Well, I thought he can play good and he looks damn good. Josie, I always had my finger on him a long time ago.

[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.240]
Those kind of the ends, which I used to hate Montreal, but now you feel sorry for him after all these terrible years. And if the Leafs can't do it, which I'm sure they can't.

[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.140]
Canadians, go go frogs go.

[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.520]
And Eric is saying, are you ever going to read the goddamn list or are you just going to keep rambling and ramping? Well, I'm all worked up today.

[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:44.300]
You know, we got that ceasefire range now. All or you see what happened with that middle East ceasefire again with your favorite terrorists with those suicide bombers again yesterday, those homicide bombers.

[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:53.060]
My favorite. They picked up. Isn't that a show like my, I'm Mary Joan, my favorite, the Martian, something like that. It's kind of across at any rate.

[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.440]
Last time they picked a billiard hall where there's a lot of young people and of course pizza parlors, there's a lot of young people.

[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.080]
Let's blow up as many young people as we can. It's their motto. I think she wrote that doing that.

[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.540]
And you think that he learned not to come here every time he comes here to have another suicide bombing us, going, uh,

[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.660]
herring back and he was just getting all bulked up on a good deli here in, uh, in DC.

[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.900]
Man, he is just enormous. He's, he's getting bigger by the minute. Yes. Can you imagine how much food they have to feed him on that LL flight?

[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:26.180]
God, because it takes, I wonder how long it takes to fly there because it takes, uh, I don't know, like so.

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:34.480]
And I probably about 11, 12 hours I would think from DC when you maybe he takes his own suitcase full of food full of deli. I'm sure he does.

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:43.980]
Anyway, what was your favorite all time cartoon or comic book action figure? Here's the list, Eric. I'm very sorry that I'm rambling. I'm just all worked up today. I'm pissed off and fired up.

[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.160]
Superman Captain Marvel AKA Billy Batson. I'm very proud of everybody for coming up with that. That was, that was a toughie.

[00:21:51.860 --> 00:22:02.060]
Billy Batson. Batman speaking of bats in the Belfri Batman Spider-Man. See, Spider-Man is going to get an ordinary number of votes now because of the fact the movies out and everybody's going to see it.

[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.820]
Right, but understand they made the movie because it's a very popular comic book to begin with.

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.280]
Dick Tracy Prince Vagant. And I don't know why I put that on her other than I remember Prince Vagant. I never read it. Did you read Prince Vagant? Yeah, and it was boring as dog crap. I don't know why I read it.

[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:26.020]
You read Prince Vagant. I thought that was like for a sissy's Prince Vagant. I think like my job. Manly sword fighting. What are you talking about? Like I said. And then of course.

[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:41.100]
Oh, I love it. Wonder Woman. I hear the whole thing. I can't wait to start playing these things. Wonder Woman. And then one that probably not too many are going to hope for, but it was one of my very favorites.

[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:56.060]
It's plastic man. You remember plastic man? I love plastic man. What do you talk about? That was funny. That was a funny stuff. I need to wrap himself around the buildings and all this other crap. He was great. That was a movie too. Wasn't it not too long ago? Plastic man? Not that I know of. Yeah.

[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:26.040]
I think while I'm not saying it was very popular, I think maybe six or seven people saw it. I'm pretty sure they made a movie out of plastic man. And green hornet. Is the other one I can think of. Am I leaving anything off right off the bat? Well, yeah. Speaking of ways. Well, let me do it. Let me do the break and then we'll get to it. Okay. Just relax. Just take your time. We've got plenty of time here to hear all these things and let's calm down. Little change of pace here today. Then we got father Shanley. Please not guilty. We know about that already. For a priest who arrested and mauled another one in an unwinged way.

[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:44.000]
Scout leader pleads guilty to saw to me in New York. There's a good one for you. Sloss. Oh, my favorite one. Don't let me forget about these slow back who dies after he depapitated himself because of his taxes. He, you know, he had a good party. He owed too much tax. He couldn't pay. Yeah, why is that funny? We're trying to chop his own head off.

[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:59.920]
Now, everybody likes a little head, but 927 at 560 WQ a.m. Hey, the beast probably likes a little head. He might actually get some now. He's losing all that weight on balance for life. The beast is in the building. Is he still waddling around or somewhere? Not right now. He was just in here. Yes, he is. See.

[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:12.220]
Thank you, man. I don't want to force him to get on the scale right now because he does away in once a week, which is the smart way to do it. Bog guarantee next time he gets on the scale. He's probably going to be approaching 30 pounds somewhere between 25 and 30 on balance for life.

[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:21.960]
This is a man, a young man whose life we're saving with balance for life. We can do the same for you too. This is the unbelievably effective gourmet meal delivery service that we've been talking about for a few months now.

[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:30.360]
If you're too busy, you need to write foods. If you're tired of shopping and trying to figure out what to buy and what not to buy. If you're tired of counting calories or carbs, no problem anymore. Balance for life is the answer.

[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.020]
If you've tried all the other quack diets and been frustrated because you can't lose any weight and keep it off. Balance for life again is the answer.

[00:24:40.120 --> 00:25:06.000]
If you're tired of shopping, you need to get on the scale right now. If you're tired of shopping, no problem anymore.

[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:35.980]
If you're tired of shopping, no problem anymore.

[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.800]
If you're tired of shopping, no problem anymore.

[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:53.440]
