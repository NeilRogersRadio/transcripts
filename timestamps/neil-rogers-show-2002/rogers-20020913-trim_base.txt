[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.320]
mine

[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.780]
do you

[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.280]
have

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.460]

[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.840]
your

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.160]
running

[00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.470]
Appleton was constant one night before the off-game and I was standing between you and Joe Robbie at the bar and

[00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.330]
You guys were talking through me since you weren't speaking to each other

[00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.210]
And it was you know tell him this and tell him that and

[00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.210]
And I was like the messenger between you two guys, but

[00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.790]
They're genuinely was not a lot right?

[00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.390]
Yeah, you first the echoes gone thank the miss for that. Okay. It's not a four. We're a little bit late

[00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.630]
But then again, hey mode take all the time you want baby. No problem. Lashana tovon get out of here

[00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.810]
And by the way there's something under your wake

[00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.050]
So terrorist threat shuts down a 20-mile stretch of I-75

[00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.090]
Which you heard a little while ago. This sister has been going on all morning long a possible terrorist threat in South Florida

[00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.670]
Pears have been thwarted says NBC six, but I mean you know, we we really don't know that much

[00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.850]
Three men and two vehicles have been detained and they're still being held this morning near Naples

[00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.790]
Police say the stops are based on possible terrorist threat information from Georgia

[00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.210]
Live TV shots show that explosive charges being used to blast open would appear to be a backpack taken from one of the vehicles

[00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.610]
They said there were no explosives in the backpack about one o'clock this morning the Florida Department of Law enforcement

[00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.990]
Issue what it calls a Bolo or a B on the look-out message

[00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.030]
Kalaunforcement agencies across the entire state of Florida a message coming from the Georgia Bureau of investigation as law enforcement to be on the lookout for

[00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.790]
Three possible terrorist suspects making threats about potential terrorism activities in the Miami area

[00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.990]
Authorities say they had what they believed to be credible information regarding three men possibly of Middle Eastern descent

[00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.990]
Who were headed to South Florida and made threats about potential terrorism activities in the Miami area

[00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.890]
Law enforcement officials set a waitress over her these men hanging a conversation at a

[00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.550]
Shownies restaurant account who in Georgia yesterday Miguel says he ate it shown these once and the drops and bombs of his own

[00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.570]
The men reportedly were overheard saying they meaning Americans mourned on on 11 and they're gonna mourn again on 913 meaning today

[00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.690]
Local police were asked for to look for a new black condom with Illinois licensed plates

[00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.010]
NBC five in Chicago reports that authorities have traced one of the cars been addressed in suburban Bartlett, Illinois

[00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.510]
And so they go they got a 20-mile stretch and they also have a no fly zone over the alligator rally at the moment and

[00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.890]
It's and they're still in turkey and they really don't know that much another reason that it's very time consuming that

[00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.570]
They were particularly searching this they as they go through each piece of the vehicle as you could imagine

[00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.010]
You just think of your own you could hide it as close as anywhere in a car

[00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.530]
So it's not just the common areas of a vehicle that need to be searched in prior vehicles there are two of them

[00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.930]
I don't know if anything

[00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.670]
Has been found it raises more concerns

[00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.650]
But you need to do this slow and methodical because if a mistake is made and someone has injured

[00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.370]
You know there's no coming back from that and that's why it's so it's scary

[00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:40.610]
We kind of ignore the we haven't been able to confirm whether these two vehicles and the men and the two vehicles are related can you?

[00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:49.530]
The the only information I have to that is these are both of the two vehicles that were put on bulletins to be on the lookout for

[00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:56.070]
Associated with the information out of Georgia and then the other point that has been raised here is when you look at the map

[00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:02.750]
Which we're gonna do now is the geography of the state someone pointed out that the turkey point nuclear power plants

[00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.690]
Maybe a

[00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.650]
More than a couple dozen miles of Ray what is the level of concern there about the vulnerability of power plants in your state?

[00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.850]
I'm not saying the two of these are connected at all

[00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.450]
But no person of the geography you can't ignore the fact that that power plant exists

[00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.890]
He's speechless

[00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.330]
Nutanity is still with us

[00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.810]
Now he probably just dropped the phone nice go on fall on I think she chased him away with him

[00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.790]
Itty out of question like that and because they don't know a damn thing in a way

[00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.790]
She's talking nuclear power plants, but of course that's the news media for you because they're lim lim lim lim lim

[00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.170]
They're crazy so before anybody gets all panicky and the vent out of shape and psychotic

[00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:47.810]
They don't know that man and they got everything laid out there on the road on the alley and they're looking and investigating and of course

[00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.590]
We don't know if there were bombs or who knows if they were really terrorists at all and of course it might have been other things than bombs could have been

[00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.990]
Chemical agents or what but again what's the point?

[00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.210]
Especially like they get everybody whipped up to a frenzy like Paula's trying to do there with her nuclear

[00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:07.590]
Power plant with turkey point speaking of turkey Paula. Okay, let's get back and just calm down or relax when we find anything

[00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.030]
We'll you know keep monitoring the situation as they say we're monitoring the situation

[00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.690]
Happy Friday the 13th to you

[00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:21.090]
We asked yesterday. What do you call soft drinks on our pool? We had 780 people who said soda 452

[00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.050]
And but no contest that soda versus pop thing not in South Florida

[00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:32.290]
So to 452 coke 162. I'd never drink that Schmidt 90 pop 63 and tonic

[00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.250]
13 said tonic which I find most amusing you want to should I do our poll questions?

[00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.670]
They right now or should we do the fight? Let's see Janet Reno by the way. She's not going down without a fight, baby

[00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.610]
We got that story coming up. Don't look right says last night that he's the Democratic nominee for governor

[00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.590]
Janet says not so fast there cowboy not so fast

[00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.490]
So we still can't get it done every newscast last night every show every newscast making fun of us in Florida

[00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.230]
And of course we're used to what so we say all right, we can use the publicity, you know

[00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.830]
I guess that's our new motto now know what publicity is bad publicity. We'll take it

[00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:11.090]
Got a shocking editorial sensational and shocking editorial from the national post this morning here in Toronto couldn't believe it

[00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:16.590]
I've looked at the headline. I thought it had to be like sarcastic or a joke and I read the whole which I'll get to it

[00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.270]
Why stop it pot legalize all drugs? Oh what it says

[00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:27.330]
It takes some real shots at the so-called US war on drugs in here great editorial and I don't think we'd be reading that in the

[00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330]
Hero to the Sun sent me I don't think so

[00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:36.770]
So Janet's ready for a fight. I got a book and under the London Times says US attempts to Russia with profits of

[00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.690]
Costings and arm and

[00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.390]
Basically what it says is that we made them an offer they couldn't refuse Putin so that the Russians would go along with us

[00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.690]
And they bush-mice it was under this morning mumbling a little bit they had that on CNN saying he doesn't really expect that

[00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.270]
Sodom is gonna like go along with it

[00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.270]
So whatever whatever sanctions the the whatever rep proposal

[00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.610]
Resolution the UN drafts of course does anybody ever go along with resolutions of the UN?

[00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.290]
No not really but nevertheless so of course the the game plan has already been drawn up

[00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.670]
I've got a book that I bought yesterday which will just make the hair stand on your head

[00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:20.530]
It's called forbidden truth US Taliban secret oil diplomacy in the failed hunt for bin Laden by John Charles Bursard and Guillaume this gay that's gay two frogs

[00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.690]
And this is it says international bestseller banned by the bin Laden family by the way

[00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:34.030]
And I'm gonna read that today a little bit later on just the introduction and prologue which is quite lengthy

[00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.530]
But at any rate it's it's unbelievable

[00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.650]
So those of you people who want to continue living and sit like ostriches with your head buried in the sand and believe everything the government tells you

[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.950]
Hey, it's a great country or least it still is at this moment and we might even have another election

[00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.930]
We got to relate to our kind of like true me off a little bit you know what I mean?

[00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.190]
Okay, I'm fine and of course is George okay? That's the question you notice Miguel is there again today

[00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.210]
I and the reason Miguel is there is because George is sick as a dog

[00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:06.410]
But being the trooper that he is and being as horny as he is even when he sick as a dog he was there at Treasure Island last night wrapped in a schmata

[00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.190]
It looked like grandma he looked like grandma Moses on a bad day with a schmata around him

[00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.010]
I might why did he bother showing up? I don't get it money I

[00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.130]
See

[00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.250]
Excellent nice calling George. Oh, he's going to the doctor today to get checked out and see if he's still alive or whatever

[00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.430]
But he'll be okay. He'll be back on Monday

[00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.490]
In fact, there's we approach payday course he gets paid the automatic deposit anyway

So we don't have to worry about picking up checks things like that. It's 11 past nine at 560 QM

[00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.870]
Genie, Missouri what they're all she's saying here anything important on CNN concern

[00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:46.170]
Everything is being investigated and investigated thoroughly as this incident is they may turn up some bad people along the way

[00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.910]
But it does not necessarily mean that any of these incidents is going to have anything to do with terrorism

[00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.350]
Now did she say bad people? I think she meant evil doors you see I think she meant evil doors

[00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:02.230]
But it's look at the tongue some bad people in other words these folks who do these things is what gene meant to say on CNN

[00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.650]
Where they seem to become just a little bit unglued this morning?

[00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.970]

[00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.230]
Yeah, you said you the worst competition you had was with Garrow but there

[00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:33.950]
But there were guys who could be if not belligerent at least would turn their backs on you. Well, I

[00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.830]
The toughest guy to talk to after the often game if they lost as many Fernandez because

[00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.010]
Many took losing so hard and I always admired him for this

[00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.210]
Although I really never thought many would turn out to be the great solid citizen that he's become

[00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.070]
You didn't dare go up to many because he might go for a circus

[00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.670]
He took losing so hard

[00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.350]
A lot of others Nick Nick want a Connie boy

[00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:14.590]
You didn't want to be around him after they lost they were other guys who stayed on an even keel like sure of most of the time Bob Greasy

[00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.490]
You couldn't even tell from talking Bob Greasy whether they want to lost

[00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.430]
Edwin one more thing and that is

[00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:28.610]
Among other things that you've done all these years you've been the the South Florida voter in the Hall of Fame

[00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.690]
Election every year

[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.470]
That's not an easy job. I think people kind of look at that and

[00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.550]
Maybe they don't really understand all that goes into it. They're always people who are

[00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:50.490]
Quick I was listening to a national talk show this weekend where they were ripping the voters for not putting Bob Hayes in

[00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.990]
There's always

[00:14:53.090 --> 00:15:01.470]
Some constituency out there that's unhappy that is very true. Yeah, it's I think it's a it's an arduous process

[00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.830]
Isn't it it is

[00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.890]
Arduous and has been arduous

[00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.250]
Arduous for the nearly 30 years. I've been on there and

[00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:17.730]
Worst than that is getting more and more arduous every year because every year the NFL keeps burping out more and more

[00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.790]
Players who are eligible who finish their careers five years ago and it's like

[00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.990]
Every year you have the same five pound sack

[00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.210]
But now this year you're trying to put 12 pounds into the five pound sack next year

[00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.250]
You got about 15 pounds in there and it gets just gets tougher and tougher and people don't

[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:44.170]
Don't realize how tough it is to make the Hall of Fame every coach thinks all of his players should be in there

[00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:51.450]
I can tell you this that a lot of the voters selectors sort of resent the fact that

[00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.950]
There's so many dolphins in there

[00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.890]
Some of them don't think some of them

[00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:03.530]
resent Bob Greasy being in there. I obviously do not resent since I presented him and

[00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.450]
Certainly endorsed him some of the mercenate Jim Langer being in there

[00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.250]
It's very odd though of the dog all the dolphins in there

[00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:23.470]
They have six offensive players only one defensive player Nick Bonacani in the coach Don Shua and on the Super Bowl teams

[00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.170]
The defense was better than the offense

[00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.330]
There should be no doubt anybody's mind

[00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.830]
this man

[00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.010]
And

[00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.530]
You're thumbing his nose at the world

[00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:40.090]
American need to know how to make it up my mind and how that's a different country because our friends and allies

[00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.270]
Hey George what's your talent war that were about to go to war?

[00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.390]
Yes, you

[00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.150]
George you see yours little son boy that was dumb

[00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:58.310]
Hey George now you're looking for that guy who threatened us before

[00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.410]
Yes, what you made one big

[00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:10.330]
Boo Boo see believe me that was just well that you had to tell the plan to attack and he'll get wax

[00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.710]
That'll just guarantee the leader will be absentee

[00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.530]
Tell me why you have to go and tell a racker gonna be invaded

[00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.870]
If he says don't know

[00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.110]
knows you're coming form so we'll find a way to escape it

[00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.170]
He's the guy that

[00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:35.150]
That's it. Hey now we're making his way underground so I doubt that we're ever gonna find him

[00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.890]
Honestly, I can't believe you told a rack to be invaded

[00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.030]
No, no, no, no

[00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:49.390]
No, no, I'm 18 at five sixty WQM happy Friday to the sun and shining its beautiful here. Is it still crappy weather there till?

[00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.950]
Yep, is it really I

[00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.530]
Got here was still dark I see because it's at least not raining on the alley and the

[00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.090]
eight-zivian

[00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.290]
Porkers out there on the alley and they got what is that thing?

[00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.630]
Did you see that kind of like silver looking thing look like some kind of a tent? Did you see that?

[00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:12.470]
They've got every kind of device and gizmo out there on a highway and they're checking all of the contents of both the cars that they pulled over and

[00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.730]
The three individuals that they said that they weren't arrested, but they're being detained

[00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.870]
Hopefully they're like pulling out their fingernails to get the real answers out of not that we want to go too far, but

[00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.270]
Here's our poll question today Eric

[00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.770]
I'm gonna give the poll question early so Eric can go off and enjoy a lovely brunch at a great weekend

[00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.310]
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today? That's our poll question

[00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.310]
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today? I've got six choices for you

[00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.850]
Sodom Hussein

[00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.830]
Osama bin Laden

[00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.970]
Yasser Arafat

[00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:45.970]
Ariel Sharon

[00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.930]
George W. Bush or the Pope I don't you think that's a good bunch of choices there?

[00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.790]
How is the Pope dangerous dangerous dangerous?

[00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.310]
You're starting to shine like a W and how how is the Pope dangerous?

[00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.550]
It's only a four-hour show and we got a late start because Moe had a lot of a heavy football stuff under this morning

[00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.170]
Plus we had to find out that Don Bailey Jr

[00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.630]
He's got a urinal in his house

[00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.010]
It would be it would be one thing if it was in the bathroom, but it's like in a living room

[00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.350]
But that DBJ he's got a great sense of humor

[00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.690]
How is the Pope dangerous come on you don't ask that question, please?

[00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.250]
So who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today?

[00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:28.330]
Sodom Hussein Osama bin Laden Yasser Arafat George W. Bush

[00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.510]
Ariel Sharon and the Pope and see when Miguel asked that I forgot that he was a brainwashed Catholic

[00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.090]
Okay, Reno says he's ready for a fight

[00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.670]
Even as evidence mounted that perhaps thousands of votes in dead County had not been counted

[00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.090]
It just gets crazier and crazier man. There's no end to it like all the other elections now

[00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.190]
We're gonna have in South Florida if they just never and they go on forever

[00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.670]
Until we then everybody gets worn out from accounting fatigue

[00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.690]
And spread that film required declared victory last night is the Democratic nominee for governor

[00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.150]
But Janet Reno who appeared to lose by just 8100 votes girded for a fight to preserve her candidacy

[00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.410]
And she said the rights of voters who have their voices heard

[00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.310]
The standoff created a harsh new reality for Democratic Party leaders just two months ago before they hope to once each governor

[00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:16.510]
George a Jeb Bush pitting the party's hierarchies favored son against a populist icon revered by

[00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:22.130]
Chor Democratic voters who feel disenfranchised and those people are too stupid to understand that she can't win the general election

[00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:28.510]
We won as you all know McBride told supporters in Tampa just before Reno told the TV audience that she would not concede

[00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:36.830]
McBride said we won 59 out of 67 counties. That's amazing the only problem for him those he got walloped in deadbroward in Palm Beach in the North County

[00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.210]
I mean walloped

[00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:44.930]
And perhaps the most critical county of all choosing the nominee and date the elections officials realized to their horror yesterday

[00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.390]
That on told hundreds or thousands of votes may not have been counted

[00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.710]
Doesn't that surprise you?

[00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.750]
A review of just four of 81 disputed precincts turned up

[00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:02.210]
1818 on counted votes prompting Reno advisors to put the brakes on any kind of concession not so fast cowboy

[00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.730]
If the county decides to examine all 7200 voting machines a distinct possibility official said

[00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:14.410]
Reno could pick up and our votes to narrow the gaps. She won about 70% of votes cast indeed on Tuesday in remarks delivered

[00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.590]
Just moments after McBride's victory speech Reno congratulated her rival on a great campaign

[00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.790]
But put her position in stark terms. I think it's very important to get the votes counted and the people's voices heard through their votes

[00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:30.250]
She said she blamed the voting problems on the governor who spent most of the day yesterday deflecting the blame back on

[00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.510]
Under the Democrats who oversee elections in the counties with the biggest problems

[00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:42.110]
Dade and Broward and of course a ping-a-pong in date and supervisor elections Miriam Olofant and Broward who needs to be fired right away by the way

[00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.870]
Boy said it's not his problem, but he's chief executive of the state

[00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.930]
There are no laws more important in the state than election laws. She said she said Reno

[00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.170]
I'm going to do everything I can as governor as a private citizen to see that the electoral system works in the state

[00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:58.810]
So people will have confidence in it said Janet in stark contrast to Reno's focus on voters rights

[00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:04.650]
McBride barely alluded to the election chaos voter regularities and his opponents refusal to concede what we need to do now

[00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.190]
He said his unite get together with the real business at hand

[00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.790]
So this is not what the Democrats wanted at all. They wanted a united front

[00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.810]
They don't want divisiveness and so on but it no matter what happens it seems that there's this democratic death wish

[00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:25.430]
In the state of Florida especially in South Florida. So he's gonna fight it out and of course the votes have to be certified and

[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.010]
On this coming Tuesday

[00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:32.650]
So if they redo the date votes and it comes to find out that I can't conceive of how she can make up that many votes

[00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.890]
The only thing is if she makes up about 1500 votes to get the margin under 16700

[00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.390]
Then it's an automatic statewide recount and then of course it's up for grabs then God only knows

[00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.790]
Oh God what kind of chaos we're gonna have

[00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:52.070]
Here's this editorial of today's Canadian national post it just amazing that there are people who can actually tell it like it is

[00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:58.810]
It's Andy Laney writes why stop it pot legalize all drugs. Oh, this isn't an editorial. It's a column

[00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.350]
but nevertheless

[00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.070]
Three tiers for unelected senators last week

[00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:09.510]
They released a report stating that Canada's marijuana laws waste enormous resources destroy the lives of drug users in

[00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:14.210]
Fringe on civil liberties foster organized crime and do absolutely nothing to stop people from getting high

[00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:20.230]
Inevitably critics were quick to offer the usual objections in response to the senators call for legalization as a parent

[00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:25.190]
Canadian line-fleaders Stephen Harbour observed I simply don't share the view that alcohol is more harmful in marijuana

[00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:31.410]
For their part the Globe and Mayo and National Post published cringing wishy-washy editorial's calling for decriminalization

[00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.710]
Rather than outright legalizations. He does not mentor. It's a column by Andy Laney

[00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:42.070]
The sole problem with the Committees recommendations is that they apply only to cannabis when it comes to drugs the only

[00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.230]
Humane policies to legalize them all

[00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.570]
Ex-tasy cocaine heroin PCB Prohibition is failed in equal measure for all of their substances

[00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.410]
Prohibition as a normal social cost does more harm than good. It's time to junk the entire approach

[00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.050]
Prohibition is a legalization would trigger massive increases in drug consumption and addiction

[00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:06.310]
This reflect an extremely simplistic understanding of the relationship between legalization and usage as the Senate committee notes and

[00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:11.170]
We've got the cannabis use among the young we have not legalized cannabis and we have one of the highest rates in the world

[00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:17.590]
Countries adopting more liberal policy after the most part rates of usage lower than ours which stabilize after a short period of growth

[00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:23.550]
Similarly heroin uses almost three times higher in the ultra-prohibitionist United States than it is in freewheeling

[00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:30.190]
Holland the idea that legalization means epidemic consumption is mostly hysteria of those who do try drugs

[00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:37.070]
Many perhaps most experiment in their youth and then stop of those who do keep using the majority do so without becoming addicted to years ago

[00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:43.670]
Ottawa citizen journalist Dan Gardner obtained a 1995 World Health Organization study on cocaine the most extensive ever conducted

[00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:51.090]
quoted one of its key findings occasional cocaine use not intensive or compulsive consumption is the most typical pattern of cocaine use

[00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:57.130]
Such finding so discredited America's drug policy that it threatened to withhold WHO funding and the report was never released

[00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:58.650]
as for

[00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:04.010]
Actual addicts prohibition only compounds their misery someone with a drug problem doesn't need a jail sentence

[00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:13.190]
He needs help the Senate report notes that 90% of governments spending related drugs is devoted to enforcement that leaves only 10% for things like addiction treatment and harm reduction programs

[00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:18.890]
Where anti drug dollars would be better spent several studies they've documented that when addicts overdose other users are

[00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.690]
Who are present frequently don't call 911 out of fear they'll be arrested

[00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.570]
Prohibition is a direct factor in such preventable deaths

[00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:30.030]
That's not the only area where prohibition kills is Gardner wrote in 2000 from

[00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:36.010]
1920 to 33 years of alcohol prohibition in the US about 800 gangsters died fighting each other in the streets of Chicago

[00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.590]
In just the last two years in Tijuana a thousand people have been killed fighting over the drug trade

[00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.730]
Tijuana is only an extreme example of a phenomenon that takes place around the world

[00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:52.190]
Prohibition creates a black market that gives rise to organized crime and violence from Quebec's vicar wars to inner-city shootings in the US to the

[00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:57.950]
Distabilization of entire Latin American countries only removing the control of drugs from criminals will address the root problem

[00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:05.510]
This is one reason why decriminalization doesn't go far enough the criminalization means getting caught with drugs results in the equivalent of a traffic ticket rather than a rest

[00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.830]
But selling drugs is still illegal so criminal distribution chains remain completely untouched

[00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.710]
The criminalization also does nothing to address the massive resources that would still be wasted

[00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:20.070]
targeting traffickers and ticketing users or the violations of civil liberties prohibition entails endless numbers of innocent people are

[00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:24.350]
Subjected to the indignity of airport strip searches or worse thanks to the current drug hysteria

[00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:31.130]
For many of these problems, especially the carnage afflicting Latin America we can thank the United States and its tragically misguided war on drugs

[00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.870]
The US is consistently bullied other countries whenever they've considered liberalizing domestic drug laws

[00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:42.270]
Aid packages have been withheld official passports denied threats of trade sanctions issued in Canada the US Drug Enforcement Agency

[00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:48.190]
Recently conducted a covert sting operation that involved blatant acts in this regard of Canadian sovereign values and law as a

[00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:52.930]
V.C. Judge ruled in August all this in the name of a policy that's consistently failed to eliminate drugs

[00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:58.350]
Wars have victims and the war on drugs is no exception in recognizing this simple crushing the obvious truth

[00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.950]
The Senate has produced a rare government document that speaks in a voice of moral sanity

[00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:07.910]
Prohibition will always fail. Why are we so afraid to try something else? Right Andy lay me today's national post?

[00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:08.090]
Oh

[00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.410]
927 at 560 WDQA M

Which lets you sleep on that mattress up to 30 days to make sure it's good for you in your back

[00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.990]

Friday

[00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.590]
Good morning. We have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted

[00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.870]
It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible

[00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.110]
We hope we reach that goal or at least major lab

[00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.530]
friends and distinguish guests

[00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.070]
Simply put

[00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.370]
President Bush can read only at the most basic level

[00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:56.670]
I'm working with a variety of organizations to achieve President Bush's great goal

[00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.450]
Learn basic vocabulary words

[00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:06.430]
Education is a top priority for President Bush and I presented him with the children's dictionary

[00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.970]
I'm proud that my husband just yesterday. He said

[00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.970]
kindergarten because

[00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:20.410]
Education brings opportunity our public schools are open to every child in America and

[00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.630]
President Bush

[00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.590]
Thank you for your help and you're so welcome. Okay, so they've

[00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:32.750]
The police have got a suspicious package that they took out of one of those two cars and it contained medical equipment

[00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.250]
Does that tell you anything? No medical equipment?

[00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:43.410]
I'm just passing along there was no bomb nothing you know, oh, and that can't be who is that?

[00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:50.930]
Who would they got on CNN and our office of stay wide and tell just like great Andrews in about 30 years was passed on it

[00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.050]
Involved domestic security concern

[00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.990]
The information was specific to vehicles and tag numbers that were seen in a location in Georgia

[00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:07.010]
That information was subsequently bowed out to fought a law enforcement about midnight this morning

[00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.290]
The vehicles passed through the toll booth at the west end of alligator alley one of the vehicles

[00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.270]
Through the car booth without paying the toll

[00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.910]
We have a lot of units on scene from higher county

[00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:24.450]
Looking for the vehicles anyway, and they were subsequently stopped. We've been out here ever since I

[00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.790]
Ended attempt to clear those vehicles and identify the I fully identify the occupants

[00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:37.150]
Determined what if any thread exists from the vehicles at this point in time and and we've bought a lot of resources in from our domestic

[00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.990]
Security Task Force to make that happen

[00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.730]
With that I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have

[00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.550]
We are detaining the suspects they have not been charged at this time

[00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.750]
Suspended into investigation

[00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.850]
Some what they're offering

[00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.690]
We have identified the three suspects we have identified the three suspects

[00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.010]
Legal immigrants

[00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:09.230]
We as far as we know they're all three legal. Yes

[00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:15.470]
No, man, we're not going to release any specific information at this point. It's an ongoing investigation. We need to be

[00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.190]
There's still a higher count of yes

[00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.210]
I'm not gonna confirm that at this point

[00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:32.630]
We're the those vehicles have not been completely searched at this point in time so the bottom line is we don't know the answer to that

[00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.870]
We're still determining that it's supposed to be true. You'll be excited at this point

[00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.550]
When the vehicles were initially stopped

[00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:50.750]
Bob sniffing dogs were called to the scene the dogs did alert on both vehicles and from that we called the bomb team in from our task force

[00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.270]
We have asked for reinforcement resources for Miami day

[00:31:54.270 --> 00:32:00.030]
They have some specialized equipment that will help us complete the searches those resources just got here

[00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.910]
They'll put it in Miami the region the message security task force and they'll help us out there

[00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:13.030]
We don't know are these American I'm not gonna answer any questions right through their identity

[00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.950]
Do we know if the dogs were wrong?

[00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:20.950]
FBI's watch list is not gonna answer anything specific to the suspect that this one was that indicated

[00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:30.930]
Well, it's there's a possibility that some accelerant or some explosive type material could be in the vehicles

[00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.550]
That's all it that maybe a candidate. That's why you do a search afterwards

[00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:35.850]
The verify that

[00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:47.030]
We're holding them such a front to the investigation once we clear the vehicles will make a determination

[00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.690]
Of what if any charges will be filed and and proceed from there

[00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:04.050]
E.J. Pickle from the Fee only I'll only pass on the information saying from Georgia and it was very specific. Yes

[00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.630]
I don't know what the conversation not gonna be specific about that

[00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:15.170]
But I will tell you it was the information we had was specific the vehicles were identified by color by tag number

[00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:19.530]
So we have very specific information. Okay, good for you. Okay, so they don't really know that much

[00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.670]
They got the three news and want to tell us that they're from the Middle East even though before the story the initial story

[00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.690]
Said that they appeared to be Middle Eastern, but then a lot of people appear to be Middle Eastern right?

[00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.690]
They're probably people could confuse Miguel for being Middle Eastern. I would think

[00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.650]
somewhat especially when you had that growth, you know

[00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.930]
That grew some growth. So anyway, we'll you know keep keep on top of it and

[00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.070]
South Florida's always you'll remember remember back in the beginning when we had the

[00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:50.910]
That's not it. That's not what I wanted. You know what I wanted. You love that song. I do love that but the problem is we can't play that

[00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.350]
You think that maybe that that's probably part of the conspiracy to the fact that that came up

[00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:02.370]
Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that everything between the election on Tuesday and between when they found the original

[00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.910]
in Boca and

[00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:12.230]
Every goddamn thing it comes down to Pike and the fact that almost all of the terrorists lived in around the South Florida one at one point for some period of time

[00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.670]
And now we have this now we have this threat on the alley

[00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.130]
Anyway, like I said, we'll keep our eye on it

[00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.330]
I'm gonna do the break a little bit early

[00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.410]
Okay, because we got we got behind in the beginning and unfortunately when you get behind it

[00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:29.210]
I mean, you know, it's one thing to go a minute over what do they go over like 15 minutes something like that on the most show this morning because they had that guy who's

[00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:34.910]
Got the same agent as Jay Feeder and they were trying to do him a favor even though nobody knows who he is something like that

[00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:37.910]
I don't know. I'm all ahead a little of a problem getting getting the show off this morning

[00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.770]
And what he gets to be that age a lot of guys have trouble getting off nine thirty eight and then you know

[00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.930]
Once we get a little ahead of ourselves, then we'll have time for fun and games

[00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:49.370]
We got 19 votes on the pool to pull us up on neo-rangers.com

[00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.910]
21 course guy when he gets now. What do you think I voted for?

[00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.330]
Anyway, here's this article from London Times today

[00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.530]
Written by Robin Shepherd in Moscow US Times Russia with profits of outing Sodom as

[00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.410]
President Bush demanded action from the United Nations against Iraq

[00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:42.730]
US emissary was lobbying for support in Russia the one member of the UN Security Council that might block approval for the use of force

[00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.670]
John both in the undersecretary of state was officially in Moscow to discuss nonproliferation

[00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:54.430]
But officials had privately that Iraq was at the top of his agenda a Russian veto would force the US and Britain to be considered their plans to

[00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.190]
Osprey and Sodom was saying or to wage a low military campaign against Iraq

[00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:04.430]
Diplomance and analysts are far from certain that Russia will agree to the use of force despite President Putin's rap for with Mr. Bush

[00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:12.650]
They said that economic factors will be a key argument with a promise that Russia will be offered big contracts in the rebuilding of a post-war Iraq at the top of the list of incentives

[00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:19.110]
The Soviet Union was largely responsible for the development of a rights military and industrial infrastructure and Russian firms would be well

[00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.490]
Placed to help modernize it once that arm is gone

[00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:27.910]
some experts argue that Russians recent announcement of a 26 billion pound investment program

[00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:32.710]
That's like about 40 billion dollars in Iraq should have been seen as nothing more than brinksmanship

[00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:38.070]
Russia's way of naming the price for its support we view the program as Russia's taking out its claimed any post-war deal

[00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:44.030]
Paul Lewis a Russian Eastern European specialist at the economic at the economist intelligence unit in London said

[00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:49.870]
They also say that Russian rail companies are likely to benefit from investment opportunities if Sodom is removed and Iraq's

[00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:55.850]
Five billion pound at Damascus much more likely to be paid his Alexander Vershbow the US ambassador suggested this week

[00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:02.590]
Washington could throw in some incentives of its own such as easier access to American markets and help in entering the World Trade Organization

[00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:10.930]
One problem is that Russia has heard it all before a senior Russian politicians have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the post- Cold War relationship between Russia and America

[00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:17.430]
Has been nothing but one way traffic Russia has pulled out of Vietnam and Cuba back down over NATO's plans to emit the Baltic states of

[00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.870]
These former Soviet Union and kept quiet when US

[00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.290]
Unilaterally pulled out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty

[00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:28.690]
US Congress has failed to reciprocate by for example lifting Cold War era trade restrictions such as the Jackson vannich amendment

[00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:34.650]
A double humiliation since its terms no longer apply even to China in addition Russia still has no firm timetable for

[00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:40.110]
Membership another problem is that Russia already does well out of its relationship with Sodom

[00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:46.590]
Russian industry is a prime beneficiary of the UN oil for food program and is able to capitalize on a variety of industrial projects in Iraq

[00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:53.670]
That will be opened up to fierce foreign competition should Sodom be ousted more over for newer Iraqi regime decided to turn on its oil taps

[00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:59.030]
The price of oil could plummet which would hurt the Russian economy considerably with elections in 2004

[00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.370]
This is a factor that Mr. Putin can't afford to ignore

[00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:06.710]
It's likely therefore that the price of Moscow support will be higher than the mere encouragement it's received so far

[00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:12.690]
President Putin warned the UN Security Council yesterday that Russia may soon launch its own war against terrorism in Georgia

[00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.590]
With the aim of hunting down Chechen guerrillas. That's not Georgia is in the West by the way folks

[00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.970]
That's Georgia like in the Soviet former Soviet Union

[00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:24.490]
Mr. Putin sent a message to the Council's four the permanent members as well as the Kofi and in the one security general

[00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:28.410]
Saying that Russia would take adequate measures if Georgia failed to reestablish control of its

[00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.530]
Ponkisi George Gorge region near the border with Chechnya

[00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.290]
Chechen rebels have used the areas of base throughout their three-year war with Russia

[00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.730]
Moscow's uneasy relations with Georgia have threatened to break down over the issue

[00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:46.710]
If Georgia fails to take concrete steps to destroy the terrorists and they continue to attack us from its territory then Russia in strict compliance with international law

[00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.690]
We'll take adequate measures for averting the terrorist threat Mr. Putin said in this message

[00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:55.510]
However, he added that Russia had no intention of bringing about a change of government in the Lisi

[00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.510]
How do you say that Miguel TBI LIS AI

[00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:05.890]
How is it again exactly the Russian media speculated that Moscow and Washington have reached an agreement in which Mr

[00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:11.690]
Putin would turn to blind eye to one US operation to write provided Mr. Bush does the same over Georgia

[00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.890]
How do you like that?

[00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.990]
You think it's a coincidence that these scumbags over there in

[00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:23.050]
On the alley that they came from Georgia at least that's where they started their journey anyway mighty coincidence

[00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.310]
Yeah, car inch by inch, you know, I would love to know Paula

[00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.510]
What is on the ground on the shoulder of that highway because that

[00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.930]
That robot is moving in

[00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.590]
The arm on the top is moving toward it. What is on the ground? Are you watching that robot?

[00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.270]
Yeah, that's pretty neat a lot of equipment essentially set up on the side of the grill

[00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.410]
But definitely looks like a robot's got a tail right here

[00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:49.890]
Um, and when would assume that these are articles and items that have been taken out into the trunk of the car or from inside the car

[00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:56.050]
One would certainly assume that when you can use nothing untoward is what Mark Potter reported nothing untoward

[00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:00.110]
Okay, you got that here's something untoward gay dolls band in the US

[00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.470]
Oh

[00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:06.690]
The first talking gay dolls in American history have just been banned in San Francisco the group responsible

[00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:12.510]
GLM George little management is also squashed release of these dolls in Atlanta Dallas, Seattle, Boston and New York

[00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.570]
GLM claims gay dolls are offensive to these straight conservative business community

[00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.750]
When JDK products released their first two talking gay dolls Elton and Marshall

[00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:25.610]
They never dreamed that the business leaders in five major cities in the US will be so intolerant to gay lifestyle

[00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.770]
So this Frank Macon spakes a spokesman for JDK products

[00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.450]
This was a classic case of two gay men not being allowed to come out of the closet

[00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.970]
George little management the organizer for most of the gift trade shows in America

[00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:42.530]
Band the dolls from being exhibited any of its shows this decision effectively denied the retail establishment prefer ever seeing them

[00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:47.350]
Mike Dean president of Western exhibitors was jointly runs the San Francisco gift show with GLM

[00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.310]
Claim these dolls would offend too many people

[00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.450]
Says making these are funny dolls would say funny things with all the problems the gay community is having with its acceptance

[00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:58.430]
It's a shame that George little management has decided to contribute to that discrimination

[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.730]
The dolls are hugely popular popular in Europe and have sold over

[00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.610]
70 for the 5,000 pieces in less than three months

[00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.950]
They're even given away as prices on game shows

[00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:11.750]
But certain organizations in the USA seem determined to block their release in this country

[00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.970]
There's nothing worse than a god damn gay doll. You know what I'm saying? What does one look like as a matter of fact

[00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.110]
Probably Carlos not are not you Carlos and probably Fiki Carlos

[00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.430]
Let's call him ugly Chuck, okay

[00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:29.190]
I don't just Chuck the ugly part with George is doing okay because George George is hoping to try to like make everybody else ugly than he is

[00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.510]
We'll call him Chuck is we call him Carlos

[00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:36.690]
They're gonna think that freaky Carlos has got something to do with the show and that would be the last thing we'd want you know what I'm saying

[00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:42.710]
The last thing we want so the package the first package that they found in the two cars contained medical equipment

[00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:48.550]
They're not telling us exactly what kind of medical equipment what it was like syringes or whether something we might be suspicious about you know what I'm saying

[00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:50.530]
They're not telling us that

[00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.950]
Before we do anything else because I'm gonna forget about it yesterday

[00:43:54.950 --> 00:44:00.470]
Bill Schneider on CNN had a pretty interesting piece when we were talking about the motivation for YGW seems to be so

[00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.850]
Helvet on invading a rack right now

[00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:10.690]
Some people are asking is president bushes iraq offensive being driven by the fall election and idea the vice president calls

[00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.130]
Reprehensible the suggestion that I find

[00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:20.330]
Reprehensible is the notion that somehow you know we saved this and now we just sprung it on them

[00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:26.250]
But people in very high places are warning that a life and death policy like iraq

[00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:32.550]
Must not be a simple match up of political convenience. What's the political convenience?

[00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.530]
Strategist dick Morris spelled it out in a recent column

[00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.230]
Polls show that only one issue works in bushes favor

[00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.410]
Terrorism does Morris think the president is as they say

[00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:48.070]
Wagon the dog to divert attention from other issues

[00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.190]
He doesn't need to wag the dog Morris writes

[00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:57.470]
He just needs to talk about wagging it to make the impact to keep control of congress

[00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:03.390]
Even the White House has hinted at a political strategy as long ago as last January

[00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:09.390]
We can also go to the country on this issue because they trust the Republican party to do a better job of

[00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:19.330]
Protecting and strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting America. Why did the administration wait until September to make its case against iraq

[00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:25.170]
White House chief of staff Andrew card told the New York Times from a marketing point of view

[00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:30.650]
You don't introduce new products in august in his speech to the United Nations

[00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.610]
President bush tried to shut down the political speculation

[00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.030]
This is a life and death matter the president insisted

[00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.910]
Should iraq acquire fissile material

[00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.950]
It would be able to build a nuclear weapon

[00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:52.050]
Within a year to those who say we want more evidence that there's a real threat the administration says

[00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.970]
We can't wait for a smoking gun to turn up

[00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.550]
We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud

[00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:07.090]
To those who smell politics the administration's answer is sure or crisis made benefit the president politically

[00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:12.910]
So what an issue of this magnitude should be the focus of a political campaign

[00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.370]
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that?

[00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.770]
That was Bill Schneider on CNN yesterday the political analyst of CNN

[00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:25.410]
Meanwhile the men were planning to attack mindy today says they wouldn't know and the other two words he used were Islamic writing

[00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:32.450]
And then he went on to explain that he just had no idea for sure what that was and then the other items

[00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.610]
He said that they sell were books and laptop computers now. I don't know that they've gone through those

[00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.310]
As part of the 25% that's been sourced they've seen those

[00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.850]
You hear that some of the material that's been taken in the two cars that they pulled over once again

[00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.650]
Islamic writing for folks just joining us

[00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:53.210]
Mark how no one should jump to the conclusion about these dogs alerting to these vehicles that mean simply

[00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.550]
And we know that no explosive material has been found at this point. That means simply

[00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:02.750]
It's not point in time that an accelerant may have been one of these city huckles. It does not necessarily mean these

[00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.830]
She say vehicles she said it again

[00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:13.470]
Anyway, Dana priest and joby warwick in today's Washington post right observer say evidence for war lacking report against the raccoals little

[00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:17.550]
That's new the White House document released yesterday is evidence that it's time to overthrow

[00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:23.250]
Sodom Hussein is a concise summary of his regime's abuses of Iraqis and its past use or possession of chemical and biological

[00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.910]
Agents but it contains little new information and no bombshells

[00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:32.350]
Showing that Hussein is producing new weapons of mass destruction or is joined with terrorists to threaten the U.S. or its interest abroad

[00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:39.530]
administration officials seeking to persuade the public Congress and foreign allies that it's time to go to war had indicated recently that their strongest case

[00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:45.530]
Rested on evidence of a rags weapons of mass destruction program and its efforts to develop ballistic missiles to launch them beyond its borders

[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:49.410]
But experts on a rags weapon resaid that on this subject to report with fewer exceptions

[00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:56.650]
Recycles a mix of dated and largely circumstantial evidence that Hussein may be hiding the ingredients for these weapons and a seeking develop a nuclear capability

[00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:02.150]
And weaponized chemical and biological agents the 20 page paper a decade of deception and defiance concludes

[00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:08.750]
Iraq harbors stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. It created before the 1991 Persian Gulf War as well as a limited number of missiles

[00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:13.390]
Another systems for delivering them the stockpile includes highly lethal VX a nerve agent

[00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:18.150]
So potent that a few drops on the skin can kill as well as anthrax and other staples of germ warfare

[00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:25.210]
The report concludes that Iraq retains the expertise and infrastructure to build new weapons and is seeking to acquire critical parts and supplies

[00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:31.210]
On a rags nuclear program it repeats a British think tanks finding last week that Iraq could likely build a nuclear weapon within a few months

[00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.570]
But only if it manages the difficult feet of acquiring a enriched uranium from an outside source

[00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:41.090]
The bulk of the reports assertions were attributed to reports by UN weapons inspectors who scoured Iraq throughout law

[00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:46.290]
The weapons programs from 1991 to 1998 although the inspectors destroyed large amounts of weaponry and equipment

[00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:50.570]
They were unable to account for all the chemical and biological warheads and bombs or rags emitted making

[00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.730]
They disputed the rags claims that had destroyed the weapons died evidence

[00:48:53.730 --> 00:49:00.930]
Other claims in the report were attributed to Iraqi defectors that were surveillance imagery that showed new construction in places where Iraq once manufactured weapons

[00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:08.430]
Weapons experts who reviewed the document noted a few previously undisclosed details such as a new test platform repeatedly built for longer range missiles

[00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.790]
But several several expressed surprise at the lack of fresh revelations

[00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.390]
Given the high priority for knowing what's going on in Iraq

[00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.130]
I'm stunned by the lack of evidence or fresh intelligence

[00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:24.550]
So Gary Milhol, executive director of Iraq watch or Washington based non-profit institution at track developments in Iraq's weapons program

[00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.630]
You'd expect that for the many billions we're spending on intelligence

[00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.870]
They'd be able to make factual assertions that would not have to be footnoted to an open source

[00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:33.390]
So in other words

[00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:34.850]
Not much

[00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.590]
What we got is not much

[00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:41.650]
And that's just like we got what we got this morning on this business on the alligator rally not much

[00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:47.390]
They're they've detained the three men. They're holding them. They found the Islamic writing on papers inside. They found the

[00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:50.530]
Briefcase with medical supplies or at least the backpack

[00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:56.990]
And a bunch of other stuff and they've got the bomb a rope the bomb squad robot is out there dittling around

[00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:01.190]
And they've got all kinds of tents set up there. They've got a 20 mile stretch of alligator alley shutdown

[00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:02.690]
When did that shut it out?

[00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:08.510]

But we only did it once

[00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.950]
That's only

[00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:09.470]
It's a big step now you have to go to the doctor for some medicine. Wow looks like I learned a valuable lesson today

[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.130]
When you

That's even better he gave him away, but he gave him away to somebody else nice going Joe always liked him

[00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:41.230]
Uh Nicholas Christoff writes in the New York Times today and I'm keeping my eye and as a matter of fact

[00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:46.150]
You better keep your eye on it too. Okay, okay, and feel free like to jump right in interrupt me in mid sentence

[00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.410]
If you see something because I it's hard to keep an eye you know

[00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:51.750]
When I on the page when I off to the right of my little TV

[00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.070]
You got it

[00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:58.250]
You got it see there's another one of those comments. We understand where you're coming from the guns in September right Nicholas

[00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.790]
Christoff in the New York Times today president boy and by the way speaking of that I'm working on Monday and so is the hump

Yeah, we're both working on Monday. We're actually putting on a professional jr routine

There'll be no mo no guilty no edd. I'm sure but some of us fat

[00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:15.770]
I guess the fat old Jews we work on the Jew holidays including me and a hump around Monday. I'll take a day for the both of you

[00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:16.390]
Okay

[00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:23.710]
Hey, listen you getting paid today. What do you think for this president Bush yesterday offered an eloquent forceful and overdue call for the

[00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:27.870]
Wendell Hold Sodom who say an accountable right Nicholas Christoff in the Times today just one problem

[00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.070]
He cited no evidence of any immediate threat

[00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.090]
No reason that invading Iraq is any more urgent today than it wasn't say

[00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:38.190]
2000 when mr. Bush is a candidate Huck and puffed about Sodom but never shared with voters any plans for an invasion

[00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:44.230]
For months there've been hints about intelligence that the administration supposedly is gathered about an imminent Iraqi threat and links to terrorism

[00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:51.250]
So it was deflating the hero again that Saddam is a monster who's regime tortures children in front of parents all true as it was a decade ago

[00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:56.830]
Contrast Mr. Bush mr. Bush's appearance would legendary moment at the United Nations on October 25th

[00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:02.310]
1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis ambassador L.A. Stevenson announced the new Russian missile sites in Cuba

[00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.150]
The Russians in Cuban scoffed that it was all lies

[00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.750]
So Stevenson brought in an easel and blown up photos of the Cuban sites

[00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:12.530]
Where is the comparable evidence of urgency today is the Bush administration?

[00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.510]
It's the Bush administration that raised the parallel level of the missile crisis

[00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.310]
noting that Kennedy had considered preemptive strikes fair enough

[00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:23.790]
Yet it's the differences that are the most telling to begin with Kennedy used the UN Spotlight to offer specific

[00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.090]
impoperatorial evidence of an urgent new threat

[00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:30.350]
And then he opted not for an invasion of Cuba but for an internationally supported naval quarantine

[00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:33.950]
Yes, Kennedy did consider a lot of alternatives including military strikes

[00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:36.510]
We call theater assurance in a key aid to Kennedy during the crisis

[00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.230]
But after considering the innocence of idiots who would be killed

[00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:43.270]
Considering the international law that would be broken Kennedy rejected that possibility

[00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:48.130]
President Kennedy was deeply conscious that wars can slip out of control and during the crisis

[00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:53.210]
He read Barbara Tuckerman guns of August Mr. Sorenson recalls Kennedy telling aids that he didn't want future their

[00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:57.870]
Generations asking how the missile crisis had spiraled into war and nobody having a good answer

[00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:02.350]
In his speech yesterday President Bush displayed Kennedy's toughness resolve and even eloquence

[00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.950]
But he did not display the other qualities of statesmanship

[00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:08.850]
Humility about the risks of miscalculation a passion to avoid war

[00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:14.250]
Graham Allison a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government has written a book about the missile crisis

[00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.330]
Note that Kennedy had stipulated that the missiles absolutely had to be removed from Cuba

[00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.990]
The Kennedy turned first the diplomacy in a blockade

[00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:25.970]
He offered the Russians a graceful exit and thus saved lives and avoided a dangerous spin into the unknown

[00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:32.170]
Today as well why shouldn't war be a last resort instead of the first tool that President Bush grabs off the shelf

[00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:37.350]
The fundamental question is left unanswered why initiating war against Sodom is better than the next option

[00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:41.910]
Which is deterring and containing him professor Rallison said you could agree that this is an evil guy

[00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:43.950]
He is evil who defied you on resolutions

[00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:50.250]
He did and still ask why he's not susceptible to the same treatment that was used against Stalin who was also evil and dangerous and cheated

[00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:55.410]
A succession of presidents chose to deter and contain Stalin rather than invade and occupy Russia

[00:55:55.410 --> 00:56:01.710]
Just as every president until now is chosen to deter and contain Sodom before launching a war mr. Bush needs to show two things first

[00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.690]
That the threat is so urgent that letting Iraq

[00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:07.750]
Festive is even riskier than invading it and occupying it for many years to come second

[00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:13.550]
That deterrence will no longer be successful in containing Sodom how would JFK have handled Iraq as a believer in the UN

[00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:18.530]
He would have done everything he could with US muscle to get you end inspectors and their most deterrence and believes such a Kennedy

[00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:23.110]
Esca approach built around robust international inspections backed by the threat of forces a last resort

[00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.510]
Would also reduce the political fall out of war as eventually erupted

[00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:32.470]
Unfortunately, we still have not heard from mr. Bush is a compelling case for the one course of act on which he seems fixated

[00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:36.730]
Immediate war right Nicholas Christoff and plays New York Times

[00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:38.510]
other dead football player

[00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.790]
High school player dies after game

[00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:46.050]
Corpus Christy Texas a high school football player died after collapsing following a freshman game

[00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:50.850]
Stephen Pente of King high school was shaking hands with opponents from Ray high school after the Wednesday night game

[00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:58.470]
When he fell to the ground unconscious in Waises County Medical Examiner was to conduct an op-satz op-sale later today several Ray football players at the 15-year-old point

[00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:02.970]
They were played running back and linebacker for nearly an entire game scene short of breath in the second half

[00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:06.750]
When I would tackle him I could hear him breathing really hard and kind of funny

[00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:09.250]
Ray player John justice told the Christy call her times

[00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:14.550]
I tackle him then get up and he just be lying on the ground breathing really really hard like it was gasping for air

[00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:18.630]
It just seemed like something was really wrong from I guess it's a good thing they haven't finished the game, huh?

[00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.250]
Boy it seems like we got one every day

[00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.190]
Hey, you know, I beg your pardon 15 years old you have to be playing so hard

[00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:33.390]
There's no audio on the tape so other than the websites. It's kind of hard to tell

[00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:38.030]
Maybe our mark potter knows more about that in second with mark marks and file to this for quite a bit this morning

[00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:40.850]
He's checking in like that to give us the very latest marker you there

[00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.250]
Yeah, Leon and I can answer your question

[00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:48.410]
About the very thing you're talking about what they did with that package and this information comes from Mike

[00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:55.350]
Uh, who's with the Southwest Port original bomb squad. It's an umbrella group that represents a number of different agencies

[00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:01.770]
Um, Mike said that that they had a package in one of these cars that they were

[00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:03.630]
Suspicious of it

[00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.610]
They took an x-ray device and looked at and they couldn't quite

[00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:08.490]
Uh

[00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:14.650]
Except what they were seeing they they had thought that a number of the devices were benign

[00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.170]
But this one had some wires and then they were worried about that

[00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:24.250]
So the use of a device that they described as a water cannon and use the technique that they call water stress

[00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:26.650]
Uh to blow apart the package

[00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.910]
Uh with water they didn't fire into it. They didn't blow it up

[00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:36.670]
Uh, and when they were done with the procedure they came to learn that it was a it was some medical equipment

[00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.930]
It was not any sort of safety threat. It was not a device a bomb device

[00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:46.370]
It was medical equipment and the advantage of using this water system is that

[00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.290]
You only use water you don't you don't destroy

[00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:55.750]
Uh, the device to the degree that you would if you fired into it or or blew it up. Okay Mark. Thank you so much

[00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:59.910]
Nothing really. No, they're just they're just filling time and it keeps showing us the picture of that one

[00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:05.970]
That one of the two cars they're on the alley and the uh bomb squad robot, which is pretty neat to watch that little thing

[00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:09.270]
You know it wouldn't you like to have one of those at home pretty cool. Sure

[00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:10.850]
Uh, don't forget in a few minutes

[00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:13.730]
I'm gonna read just a little bit from the introduction and um

[00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:18.550]
Forward to this book for bitten truth by Jean Charles Bressard and Guillaume Dusquet

[00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:22.930]
US Taliban secretorod diplomacy and a failed hunt for Bidlant just a uh, you know

[00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:27.790]
They always use this word chilling everything on the news. Oh a chilling moment. Yeah, this is pretty chilling

[00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.650]
In fact, you ought to tell all your children's about it

[00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.730]
Maratham and Dosa this is one of the best stories of the day

[00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:36.950]
City plans protest with pot giveaway all right

[00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.310]
Santa Cruz, California

[00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:42.770]
And we had the original story on this a week or two ago about the fact that the federal government went in there

[00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:48.910]
In a town where they've legalized the medical marijuana and the federal government says oh you can't do that and they busted this joint and closed it down and

[00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:53.070]
Anyway, city leaders plan to join medical marijuana users at a pot giveaway at city hall next week

[00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:57.930]
Hoping to send a message to federal authorities that in this town medical marijuana is welcome

[00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:03.450]
Joey Saza gonna send me a message. That's right. You didn't you see got five of the three? Of course

[01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:07.210]
Oh, remember that Joey Saza's gonna send me a message. I'll send him a message

[01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:12.630]
Anyway, the invitation comes a week after agents from the DEA arrested the high profile owners of a pot farm

[01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.630]
And confiscated 130 plants have been grown to be used as medicine

[01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:22.710]
It's just absolutely loads them to me that federal money energy and staff time would be used to harass people like this advice mayor Emily Riley

[01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:29.570]
Who along with several city council colleagues plants to pass out medical marijuana to sick people from the garden like courtyard at city hall this coming Tuesday

[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:36.470]
Though the council passed a resolution denouncing the raid there was no official city sponsorship of the event council members in medical marijuana advocates

[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:40.730]
Are simply acting on their own in a public space said city attorney John Verison

[01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:45.150]
The EAS spokesman Richard Meyer was surprised at the plan. Are you serious? That's illegal

[01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:49.670]
It's like they're flouting federal law. He said I'm shocked that city leaders would promote the use of marijuana that way

[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.470]
What is that saying to our youth it's saying that you're a bunch of assholes is what they're saying okay?

[01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:58.970]
State law in California as well as Alaska Colorado who I mean the vandal organ of Washington

[01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:04.450]
Lozmer wanted to be grown distributed to people with a doctors prescription federal law prohibits marijuana use under any

[01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:09.950]
Circumcises and of course we know that we don't the federal government doesn't have more fish to fry that at this particular time

[01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:10.970]
Better things to be doing

[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:17.330]
In recent month federal agents working with local supportive and busting pot clubs and farms in northern California

[01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:21.170]
Including a small pot farm last week about 55 miles south of San Francisco

[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:26.290]
Arresting owners Valerie and Michael Corral no indictment was filed against the couple leading activists for medical

[01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:31.390]
Ameriwana their attorney said federal authorities don't plan to prosecute a spokeswoman if the West Attorney's Office

[01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:36.250]
If she couldn't comment California medical marijuana growers and distributors work closely with local law enforcement

[01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:41.710]
And are quite open about their programs in fact the farm rated by DE agents had been featured in national media

[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:44.190]
And the program is listed in the local telephone book

[01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:49.170]
The courage of the Santa Cruz City Council and the growing anger and Congress are assigned to a genuine

[01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.390]
grassroots invited all across this country

[01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:55.690]
That'll put an end of these attacks on the sick and vulnerable said Robert Campi

[01:01:55.690 --> 01:02:00.370]
Executive director of the Washington DC based marijuana policy project in 1992

[01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:04.690]
77% of Santa Cruz voters approved a measure ending the prohibition of medical marijuana

[01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:11.730]
Four years later state voters approved proposition 215 allowing marijuana for medicinal purposes and in 2000 the city council approved

[01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:14.710]
Norinance allowing medical marijuana to be grown and used without a prescription

[01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:17.010]
So there you go. They state the local government

[01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:22.230]
Passing all kinds of resolutions over a well-missed part from the public and the federal government the freaking DEA

[01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:27.810]
Because they have to justify their continuing existence. They're going in there and busting the pot farms and arresting people

[01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:31.110]
And then I even bothering to charge them. It just you know just something to do

[01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:34.470]
Just putting on a good dog and pony show looking out

[01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:38.030]
We're protecting the youth of our country right then our guard right from the national post

[01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:40.410]
That's one of the best and things I've ever seen in my life

[01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:48.210]
Of course it makes a little bit too much sense. Don't confuse America's drug policy in the so-called war on drugs with common sense or with what really works

[01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:53.010]
I'm a correspondent joining us now from our DC bureau to tell us more about the FBI

[01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:57.510]
Involvement and perhaps more information on the three suspects who are in custody Kelly good morning

[01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:01.470]
Good morning, Darren why don't we start with what with what we have at least confirmed

[01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:03.690]
A variety of law enforcement sources

[01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:10.430]
Let's start off with the fact that we have confirmed that there was a conversation that was overheard in a restaurant in Calhoun

[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:13.390]
Georgia by a patron who was there with her son

[01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:20.830]
She called that information into the Georgia bureau of investigation. That is the state version of the FBI

[01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:26.870]
There was a below put out which is a beyond the lookout for these two vehicles

[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:32.010]
There was a very good description of the vehicles and license plate tags that was given to law enforcement

[01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:39.930]
After one of the cars we are told confirmed by law enforcement blew through a toll booth a sheriff

[01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:48.730]
pulled over one of the vehicles the other vehicle voluntarily pulled in behind that first vehicle

[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:55.470]
And the law enforcement officer began some questioning there were three individuals who have been taken into custody

[01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:59.450]
Are being questioned by members of the joint terrorism task force

[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.150]
As we all see there are two vehicles also in custody

[01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.250]
When as we have heard Mark Potter report

[01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.950]
The bomb squad dogs were brought they did react to

[01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:18.330]
Something in the vehicles now. I am I have been cautioned by the FBI that those dogs are primarily trained to react

[01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:23.750]
To black powder black powder can be found as Mark has also said in fireworks

[01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:26.150]
It can be found in in shelf for hunting

[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.890]
So there could have been at some point

[01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:36.130]
It's something as innocuous as a as a hunting rifle in that vehicle that the dogs did

[01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:39.130]
On the dogs now the bomb squad

[01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:46.830]
Is being very cautious has closed off part of that highway to ensure the safety of all involved

[01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:51.670]
Civilians as well as law enforcement personnel and that is going to take some time

[01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:58.210]
I am told that this process that we are watching right now on the screen can take several hours as for the men and

[01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:02.670]
Right now what is trying to what what investigators are trying to do is one

[01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:09.370]
Determine whether or not the identification that has been presented by the individuals is in fact

[01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.350]
real

[01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:16.730]
That they are taking the names that they have at least been presented so far and running them through

[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:23.570]
A variety of intelligence systems to see if there has been any prior intelligence on any of these individuals

[01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:28.930]
You have eight you have the i and s you involved you have customs involved you have fb i involved

[01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:33.970]
And of course if they do strike a hit on any of these names there may be

[01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:38.190]
An opportunity to involve and overseas agency as well, but right now

[01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:46.390]
They have no information that indicates that any of these individuals has any connection at all to any terrorist

[01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.290]
Organization right now it is an ongoing

[01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.250]
Conversation interrogation they are trying to find out what they can at this point

[01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.910]
But I am told by by a variety of sources that right now

[01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:04.010]
They've come up empty so far in terms of having this name hit on any intelligence

[01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:08.430]
Database that they have run those names through so far assuming those are the real names

[01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:11.250]

Five votes for Yes or I'm a fart, eight for Ariel Sharon, eleven for the Pope,

[01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:29.650]
which I'm sure that Miguel is scratching his head wondering how can that be.

[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:32.750]
Osama Yamama bin Laden, aren't you scratching it?

[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:33.470]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.650]
And your head too.

[01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:40.310]
Osama 20, Saddam Hussein 43, and George W. Bush 56, seems to be pulling away.

[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:44.470]
Anyway, here's the introduction from, in fact this book is so important that there's two introductions.

[01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.850]
There's a forward, there's a prologue, and they're all worth a reading.

[01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:51.830]
You're right, I might have to read the whole book on here, you know, starting like on Monday?

[01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:53.030]
Go for it.

[01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.550]
But then they won't go out there and buy it.

[01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.490]
Well, you know something, nobody's gonna go, maybe ten people out there would go out and buy it anyways,

[01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:01.170]
called Forbidden Truth by Jean Charles Brissard and Guillaume Descay.

[01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:05.670]
Introduction, the introduction is written by, at least the first introduction, written by Joseph Trento,

[01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:09.570]
author of the Secret History of the CIA, managing director of the National Security News Service.

[01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.550]
He says, Forbidden Truth is the story of the greatest foreign policy blunder of the past thirty years.

[01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:20.630]
This important book tells him the aftermath, the blowback of the United States and Saudi Arabian policy of creating an

[01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.670]
Arabic Islamic force to bring down the Soviet Union by marrying it in a war in Afghanistan.

[01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:29.570]
Forbidden Truth is the story of how that force turned against its creators with effectiveness and vengeance.

[01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:35.610]
In the pages of Forbidden Truth, or all the leftovers from this ill-conceived US policy, Saudi frontmen,

[01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:45.230]
the runes of BCCI, Saudi and Pakistani intelligence, they all came together to assist Osama bin Laden in retooling the Arab fighters of the Afghan war into an Islamic Frankenstein.

[01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:50.590]
All of this happening under the nose of a CIA unwilling to revisit and array of forces that once had been allies.

[01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:58.330]
On September 11, 2001, the world saw 3,000 lives destroyed, President George Bush reacted with confusion, anger and resoluteness,

[01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:01.490]
and began to lead the country in a handful of allies into the war on terrorism.

[01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:06.810]
The US went into war mode as a result everything in government has deferred of the war, especially the truth.

[01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:14.130]
Young George Bush did not have the luxury of time to consider if the chickens from his father's foreign policy misadventures had come home to roost.

[01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:18.950]
Fortunately for all of us others, John Charles, Bricard and Guillaume Discai did take the time.

[01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:24.090]
The result is the most important explanation of the secret history of how the US came to be attacked and who was responsible.

[01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:28.270]
The answer to the answers the authors uncovered will and should make you very angry.

[01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:33.370]
Many of the same men around young George Bush now played a major role in the original failed scheme.

[01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:45.970]
Forbidden truth is the first comprehensive revelation of how the foreign policy of the president's father and the cozy relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia exploited and created an extremist Islamic mercenary army that eventually turned on its creators.

[01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:55.210]
In the pages of Forbidden Truth are the awful details that our government understood that the Saudi government was financing Bin Laden's Zalqada through Islamic charities years before the attacks.

[01:11:55.910 --> 01:12:02.850]
Like Shakespearean characters, the evil doers in young American president had a dark thread connecting them, a common benefactor, the Saudi royal family.

[01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:06.470]
Their wealth had helped press god Bush and his sons grow rich and powerful over the years.

[01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:12.770]
It also had kept opposition to the royal family at bay at home by funding for decades the most extreme forms of Islam.

[01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:21.430]
Few would imagine that these sophisticated partners, the Bushes and the royal family, would together create the conditions and opportunity for terrorism to grow in a worldwide network.

[01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:30.530]
As CIA director of the president's father George Herbert Walker, Bush joined with the Saudi prince to create a bank for covert operations to fight the Soviets through the Islamic cause of Afghanistan.

[01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:39.370]
The Bank of Commerce and Credit International, BCCI, collapsed in scandal, but its personalities and pieces became the vessels and conduits of the terrorist network.

[01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:44.010]
These same personalities were George's partners in policy and in some cases private business.

[01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:51.250]
But then Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush introduced the Bin Laden family to William Casey to help the US win its proxy war in Afghanistan.

[01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:58.490]
When the Saudi sided with Kuwait and long festering dispute about stealing oil, President Bush turned Saddam Hussein from a friend to a foe.

[01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:03.230]
He put the full force of the US with his old friends. The United States fought a war to save two kingdoms.

[01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:08.290]
Our reward was that our soldiers and state department employees were not allowed to publicly worship in Saudi Arabia.

[01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:16.530]
Bush lost the presidency, but the Saudis took care of his family when the Sion who would be the next Bush in the White House need to help with harkan energy, old friends again came to the rescue.

[01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:22.990]
As Bill Clinton dealt with the indifference of the Saudis to their support for Islamist extremists, Bin Laden blew up our barracks at Kobar.

[01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:30.650]
The Saudis hinder our investigation and denied the truth that Bin Laden and his forces had begun to move against the royal family inside Saudi Arabia. Their motivation was money.

[01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:41.730]
Their methods came straight from organized crime, extortion. PS protection or more threatening factors will come on the King's private facts line, then worse, PS are tribute or the revolution will be at home not in Afghanistan or at Yemen.

[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:59.330]
The era of princes and their hangars on made the decision to pay. Now nearly a year after the horrors of September 11th and the consulate with bombing of Afghanistan would need have been lawdnourmolo Omar captured with more and more Saudi showing up in the terrorist ranks, more bad news, missed signals, missed warnings, the FBI and CIA try to blame each other.

[01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:07.270]
The day after the 9-11 attacks by President Cheney called the Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschel tried to talk him out of any major probe into the intelligence failure.

[01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:16.010]
There could be no serious investigation because a serious investigation in the end would reveal that money and oil were more important than protecting Saudi Arabia or the United States.

[01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:21.450]
A serious investigation would reveal that bankers, politicians and family friends and business suits support Al Qaeda.

[01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:31.310]
A serious investigation would demonstrate that George Bush's father was the midwife to the birth of this monster. A serious investigation would demonstrate that Middle East oil money still helps support members of the Bush family.

[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:43.690]
The real terror for George Bush will come when he reads for Bidden Truth. For Bidden Truth is the only serious investigation available as up to now only then will he finally connect the dots. Perhaps Al-Askis father would come in for that long overdue talk.

[01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:49.910]
To be President you need to know how to handle the guilty knowledge that comes with power sadly Bush has more than his fair share.

[01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:56.790]
That's the first introduction by Joseph Trento who's author of the Secret History of the CIA and managing director of the National Security News Service.

[01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:07.610]
Did I miss anything here on CNN? No. Oh. 20 miles of alligator alley still closed down terrorist threat. They're still checking out the two cars. They've got the three guys and custody.

[01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:21.830]
They don't want to say they were of Middle Eastern descent but the fact is they found Islamic writing and maybe they were just trying to learn Islam. You think so Islamic writing? Just Arabic? Learn Islamic writing. Learn Arabic. See I got sucked into that by CNN and Molli say a lot of stuff.

[01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:32.530]

who's now so chummy with me that it calls me Nelson.

[01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:00.470]
How do you like that?

[01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.370]
You know the sound of the facts?

[01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:02.210]
Yeah, I did.

[01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:03.090]
Unimpressed.

[01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:05.030]
It says you mentioned celebrities dying threes.

[01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:08.270]
You may have to wait two weeks, but yesterday a singer war in Zeevan, if we were all,

[01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:10.290]
is if I don't know this, I'm on top of it, baby.

[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.690]
Okay?

[01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:12.950]
No matter what name you call me, got it right here.

[01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:16.850]
Singer songwriter war in Zeevan, best known for quirky hits like We're Wolves in London,

[01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:20.030]
as they diagnosed with an operable lung cancer, a spokeswoman said yesterday.

[01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:21.950]
I'm on top of it, man.

[01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:23.470]
Schmendrick.

[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.270]
I'm okay with it, Zeevan 55, said in a statement, but it'll be a drag if I don't make it till

[01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.590]
the next James Bond movie come up.

[01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:33.970]
Zeevan's more than three decades long career began with one of dead or alive in 1969.

[01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:38.670]
His 1976 album, More in Zeevan, produced by Jackson Brown, won critical praise and his

[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:43.210]
career sword with 1978's Excitable Boy, featuring a single We're Wolves of London, which became

[01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:43.990]
his signature song.

[01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.430]
He ended a five year recording absence in 2000 with life of Killia.

[01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:49.910]
And I guess he was prescient.

[01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:53.870]
spokeswoman Diana Barron said Zeevan was told of the diagnosis by doctors last month,

[01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:56.490]
is spending time with his grown children as well as writing and recording.

[01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.990]
He'll be in the recording studio next week, she said.

[01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:03.310]
Rhino Records release, will release genius, the best of war in Zeevan, October 15th.

[01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:07.270]
His most recent album, My Rides, He Released This Your Features, Contributions from Irish

[01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:11.490]
Poet Paul Maldon, journalist, Hunter Rast Thompson, Harold Columnist and author, Carl

[01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:14.590]
Hayeson, as well as a cameo from Talks Your Host, David Letterman.

[01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:15.510]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:16.670]
You like it?

[01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:17.290]
Interesting.

[01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:19.110]
So anyway.

[01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.810]
See, there's going to be somebody die before he does.

[01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:23.510]
Don't you think?

[01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:24.510]
Too much of a long time.

[01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:30.970]
Yeah, we'll have the third member of the trifecta way at Kim Hunter and who else?

[01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.310]
Oh, and the Johnny and the D.

[01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.470]
Excuse me.

[01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:34.950]
I'm sorry.

[01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.730]
I'm just not in football mode right now.

[01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:40.910]
You know, I mean, call me silly, but I'm just not in football mode today.

[01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:43.430]
I realize that's very uncuey image, but tough crap.

[01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:44.070]
Tough there.

[01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.090]
183 votes on the pool.

[01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:50.170]
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today we ask today on theorodges.com?

[01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:53.750]
George W. Bush, he's, I think, got a pretty safe lead.

[01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:54.350]
73.

[01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:55.830]
Saddam Hussein 49.

[01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.570]
Osama, your mom, and Vidalodon 27.

[01:19:57.570 --> 01:20:00.630]
Of course, I know Osama's case, there should be an actress because we don't know if he

[01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:01.210]
did or alive.

[01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:02.190]
So, people I'm saying.

[01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:06.110]
The Pope 16 and I think also the same might apply there.

[01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:09.710]
Ariel Sherrone 13 and the Astor Amapharts in last place with only five.

[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.710]
Introduction.

[01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.270]
I did promise I'd read the introductions and the preface and the forward.

[01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:16.450]
Not too many books.

[01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.230]
You'll read that have two introductions and preface and a forward, but in this case, well

[01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.130]
worth it for Bidden Truth.

[01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:24.690]
This introduction written by Wayne Mads, the Washington correspondent for Intelligence

[01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:25.150]
Online.

[01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:30.050]
He says, long before the world first heard of the FBI's Minneapolis Phoenix and Oklahoma

[01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:34.090]
City, Memoranda, what was known to U.S. law enforcement prior to 9-11, John Charles

[01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:37.650]
Bressard and Gayoam Dascay presented the first print tradition of forbidden truth.

[01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:41.430]
A unique insight into what the U.S. and other governments knew and when they knew it concerning

[01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:43.810]
the future plans of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.

[01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:48.290]
After three years of painstaking research, the office succeeded in connecting the dots

[01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.970]
and repeating the behind the scenes maneuvering preceding the December 11 terrorist attacks

[01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:56.750]
on New York City and Washington, DC, especially gripping as the tale of John O'Neill, the former

[01:20:56.750 --> 01:21:00.550]
deputy director of the FBI's New York office, who spent years tracking Bin Laden and his

[01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:01.150]
Confederates.

[01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:04.810]
As the chief counter-terrorist agent within the bureau, O'Neill focused on the al-Qaeda

[01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:08.730]
network following a series of terrorist attacks aimed at Americans, especially in Saudi

[01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:09.870]
or maybe in East Africa.

[01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:14.230]
In October 2000, al-Qaeda set off a bomb amid ships the U.S. as cool and aid in a harbor.

[01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:18.090]
O'Neill describes his frustrations in dealing with non-cooperative U.S. ambassador to Yemen,

[01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:22.730]
who along with her CIA and State Department interlocutors were more interested in placating

[01:21:22.730 --> 01:21:26.310]
Saudi and American oil interest than bringing the al-Qaeda perpetrators to justice.

[01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:31.390]
It's not often that a book provides an unintentional last testament, but in forbidden truth, O'Neill

[01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:35.190]
provided the office with his virtual last words on the subject of his investigation of

[01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.590]
Bin Laden's network and his thoughts on cover-ups reaching high into the echelons of political

[01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:41.910]
power in Washington, Saudi Arabia and the oil company headquarters in Texas.

[01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:47.190]
On 9-11-2001, after an illustrious career with the FBI, O'Neill died while carrying out

[01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:50.030]
his new duties as director of security for the World Trade Center.

[01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:54.490]
Fortunately, Bersard and Deskay have provided for the historical record the words that O'Neill

[01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:57.010]
may have himself panned had he survived in the 9-11 attack.

[01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:01.910]
There's been a general tendency in the meeting among America's political and military leaders

[01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:04.910]
to begin the al-Qaeda and Taliban timeline on September 11.

[01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:09.270]
Bersard and Deskay have explored this myth by describing the close economic ties between

[01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:13.210]
the Bush and Clinton administrations, U.S. big oil and the Taliban and their Saudi patrons.

[01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:17.650]
In connecting the dots between Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and the U.S., Bersard and Deskay

[01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:21.670]
reveal the main principles involved in negotiating a lucrative but controversial oil and gas

[01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:24.010]
pipeline deal with the mullahs of Kandahar.

[01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:27.870]
The readers introduced to Laili Helms and Afghan American with ties to the former Afghan

[01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:32.430]
world house, Imuja Hadin, the Taliban, and most interestingly, the CIA, her uncle by

[01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:34.550]
marriages former CIA director Richard Helms.

[01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:38.550]
In the weeks prior to the 9-11 attack, Laili Helms was orchestrating high-level meetings

[01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:42.730]
between senior members of the Bush administration and emissaries of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the

[01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.910]
main benefactor of Osama Yomama Bin Laden.

[01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.670]
Bersard and Deskay successfully connected dots to an even degree they explained the actual

[01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:54.110]
motivation behind the United States' 6-plus-2 group, pipeline politics, not the Bally

[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:56.870]
who would aim of bringing about a ceasefire between the Taliban and their Northern Lions

[01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:57.270]
rivals.

[01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:01.870]
The authors revealed that it was at a May 15, 2000 meeting in Berlin that a U.S. official

[01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:05.610]
ominously presented the following ultimatum to the Pakistani delegation who were the

[01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:07.190]
Taliban's interlocutors at the meeting.

[01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:11.350]
Either you accept their offer of a carpet of gold or we bear you under a carpet of

[01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.830]
bombs.

[01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:15.330]
It was a statement that would take on even greater meaning after the 9-11 event.

[01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:20.270]
When forbidden truth was first published in France in November 2001, skeptics inside

[01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:23.730]
and outside the U.S. government scoffed at the obvious contention that French intelligence

[01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:27.830]
had warned the FBI about the terrorist connections and ongoing flight training in the U.S. of Zachary

[01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:32.530]
A. Rias Moussawi, the so-called 20th hijacker, who was arrested on a visa violation in Minnesota

[01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.210]
August 17, 2001.

[01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:38.990]
These skeptics were later confronted with incovertible validation of this information when FBI

[01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:43.190]
had many employees chief division counsel Colleen Rowley, a 21-year veteran agent wrote

[01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:46.810]
in a blistering letter of the FBI director Robert Mueller, a French intelligence service

[01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:50.910]
confirmed Moussawi's affiliations with radical Islamic fundamentalist groups and activities

[01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:52.210]
connected to Osama bin Laden.

[01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:53.730]
She was the whistleblower.

[01:23:54.330 --> 01:23:58.590]
Rowley's concerns along with Ospo down in July 10, 2001, morning from the Phoenix FBI

[01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:02.810]
agent Kenneth Williams concerning the activities of Arab flight students in the May 1998 report

[01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:06.410]
from the Oklahoma City FBI, concerning similar flight training by Middle Eastern man and

[01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:10.870]
that city fell into the lapse of what Rowley described as flippant FBI bureaucrats in Washington.

[01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:16.350]
The FBI headquarters, including two special units, tasked to investigate religious extremists

[01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:19.290]
in bin Laden, the radical fundamentalist unit and the UBI.

[01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:23.710]
Respectively, they refused to authorize a full investigation including critical electronic

[01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.370]
surveillance of these suspected terrorists.

[01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:29.530]
The world of intelligence in which the truth is not always the truth and lies are not always

[01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.550]
lies has been characterized by some observers as a hall of mirrors.

[01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:37.390]
But the failure to connect the dots and fuse and analyze critical intelligence before 9-11

[01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:41.870]
cannot merely be blamed on the staggering nature of analyzing disparate pieces of information

[01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:44.090]
from a multitude of oftentimes questionable sources.

[01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:47.670]
In addition to the French intelligence that came to senior U.S. law enforcement and intelligence

[01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:51.350]
officials, we now know that similar hardened intelligence came from the intelligence and

[01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:56.730]
police agencies of Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, India, Israel, Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Canada,

[01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:57.850]
the Cayman Islands, and Italy.

[01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.010]
The Italian counter-terrorism police had recorded a conversation in the summer of 2000

[01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:06.210]
in which a Yemeni sheet described what sounded like the plans for 9-11, saying an attack

[01:25:06.210 --> 01:25:08.270]
was planned that would be one of those strikes you'd never forget.

[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:12.450]
A terrifying thing it'll move from South to North from east to west, he who made this plan

[01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:14.610]
as a madman but a genius it will turn you to ice.

[01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:19.790]
Skeptics continued to derive any notion that the Bush administration had advanced warning of 9-11,

[01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:23.870]
but resarded in Deskale out one of the most important clues in tracking any criminal enterprise,

[01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:24.770]
the money trail.

[01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:28.450]
It's a trail that connects Osama bin Laden to other members of his family involved with

[01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:32.610]
construction and financial projects throughout the world. They're so-called good bin Laden's.

[01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:36.550]
Yet the links don't merely end with the greater bin Laden family they involved the house of

[01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:41.010]
Assad, the Pakistani Inter Service Intelligence Agency, and other wealthy Saudi bankers and

[01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:46.170]
merchants. Islamic churches and addresses, U.S. oil tycoons, the U.S. defense contractors

[01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:49.910]
like the Carlisle group. The links even extended to the very heart of the administration

[01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:54.590]
include President George W. A prior recipient of bin Laden family investment money, his father

[01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:58.270]
and advisor to Carlisle and its major client have been Laden group, and vice president Dick

[01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:02.710]
Cheney, a beneficiary of Saudi money, largest as the head of the oil services company Haliburton.

[01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:07.990]
While President Bush portrays himself as a leader with myopic world view from referring to

[01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:13.630]
Pakistan, a president pervezmo sharp during the 2000 campaign as general general, and believing

[01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:17.070]
he was elected to being under the impression that the Taliban was a very engrossed band,

[01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:20.930]
his coterie of friends and business partners certainly see them at least in South Asia with

[01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:25.930]
perfect 2020 vision. And it's this view that should have all alerted them to the dangers of

[01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:30.630]
dancing with the likes of the Taliban, corrupt Pakistani generals, and Saudi sheiks. While brave

[01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:35.070]
and selfless FBI agents like John O'Neill saw the dangers posed by Al Qaeda and their Saudi and

[01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:39.350]
Pakistani friends, the U.S. oil intelligence complex was contended with treating with the enemy.

[01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:43.750]
For a hidden truth answers a number of questions concerning the failure by the world's only remaining

[01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:47.550]
superpower to prevent one of the most tragic days in American history. During the cold war when

[01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:51.410]
my colleagues and I stood watching Navy facilities monitoring the movements of Soviet submarines,

[01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:55.850]
such lapses and vigilance would have had dire consequences and we knew it. In those days there

[01:26:55.850 --> 01:27:00.590]
were no tolerance for such mistakes. This tenant has been largely lost on today's bloated intelligence

[01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:04.770]
and law enforcement infrastructure which has more money and resources available to it now than

[01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:08.910]
at any time in our nation's history. Restart in Deskay have laid the groundwork for future

[01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:13.430]
investigations and tear results that shook the world. As the history books are written about 9-11

[01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:17.610]
as reports of government committees and possible commissions are issued for Biden truth will

[01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:22.090]
remain a seminal reference point for all those who are compelled to look beyond the veil of secrecy

[01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:26.310]
thrown around the events leading up to America's worst and most costly terrorist attack.

[01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:29.770]
10-41 at 5-60 QAM.

[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:49.970]
All vision changes forever. His talent like it is style has already impacted millions of Americans.

[01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:56.930]
His appearances on Oprah have propelled him into the national limelight. Get ready for a

[01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:04.270]
doctor fill. Well, Phil, please admire 20 years. Don't cry. I'm not crying. Look at me when you talk.

[01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:11.030]
I'm looking right at you. Your problem is you're stupid. No, he's me and my husband got up with big

[01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:17.530]
butt too and you're stupid. Why are you crying? You see I don't have any sympathy for you.

[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:21.410]
I'm facing me my husband here in the 80s. We haven't had sex in like 10.

[01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:24.450]
I wouldn't have sex with you either. Look at the can on you.

[01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:30.870]
Dr. Phil, you know the problem seems to be I come home. I want to watch TV. I want to tell me about you.

[01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:34.830]
Tell me about her. Well, I'm not trying to tell you. She comes into the room.

[01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:40.210]
No, tell me what she does. Tell me what you do. I sit in the chair and I have the TV on.

[01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:45.650]
She comes too busy watching TV is your deal. That's what men want to do. We just want to watch TV.

[01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:50.570]
You can't do it. Why I want to do it? And you can't do it. See your problem is your dumb.

[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:57.810]
You're a dumb watching TV idiot. Excuse me? I said you're a dumb. Don't I ball me like that.

[01:28:58.110 --> 01:29:02.690]
I'm trying to help you. You're on my show. You don't have your own show. Do you? You know, you need

[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:11.030]
some of this. Oh, I'm out there. Don't get it. Oh, Dr. Phil. He's Dr. Phil. He just doesn't. Now, why are you

[01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:17.210]
talking so quiet? You see, already I can tell that you're a pushover. But, but he just doesn't don't

[01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:23.310]
tell me what he does. I just don't understand. I've got some of this for you too. Some of this.

[01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.330]
Dr. Phil, this is for you. He go, Mr. Nonson. Boy or some love for you too.

[01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:32.990]
1047 at 560 W. Cure Me. You remember you were asking me whether it's the East Bond or the West

[01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:36.870]
Bond lanes, etc. Right. Doesn't really make any difference. It was the East Bond lanes. But

[01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:40.470]
nevertheless, they've got both East and West Bond lanes shut down alligator rally. Just mention

[01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.430]
that for anybody who's planning trip to Naples, maybe to go see the beesleaf this weekend.

[01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:48.090]
Anybody wants to negotiate the sale of the beesleaf properties, etc.

[01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:52.610]
Chaining enters hospital for checkup. Yeah, we know about that. Vice President Dick Chaining

[01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:56.250]
who's got a history of heart trouble entered a hospital this morning for what AIDS described as a

[01:29:56.250 --> 01:30:00.750]
periodic and routine heart checkup. Well, not the good news is I guess he's out of hiding now,

[01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:06.010]
right? Now you can find them. Well, no, not necessarily. He's in some hospital somewhere.

[01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:09.950]
The routine does it say which hand? No, it doesn't say which hospital. The routine exams include

[01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:13.910]
EKG to measure his heart rhythm and a scan of the pacemaker plus and planted in Chaining's

[01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:19.790]
chest last year, which monitors any regular heartbeat. Yeah, he's he's just fine. How you doing, Dick?

[01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:25.210]
Oh, we're fine. That's what we thought. Close shape for special ops forces in Afghanistan.

[01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:29.490]
U.S. Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan have been ordered to shave and wear regular

[01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.890]
uniforms to look more like U.S. soldiers rather than locals according to an official U.S. Special

[01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:37.970]
Operations Command in Tampa. You ordered to shave facial hair and re-adapt uniform and grooming

[01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:42.490]
standards came after a special ops commander general major general Jeff Lambert saw numerous

[01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:46.110]
photographs of troops operating on the ground in Afghanistan with full beards and partial

[01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:50.470]
uniforms. The official said Lambert, a career special operations soldier-based at Fort

[01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:53.830]
Pragg, North Carolina, confirmed with a joint commander on the ground in Afghanistan with 10

[01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:57.670]
and general Dan McNeill and senior special operations forces leadership officials said.

[01:30:57.950 --> 01:31:00.450]
And a agreement between the two commanders when the last week was made that the special

[01:31:00.450 --> 01:31:04.190]
ops forces would return to the standard uniform and a shave and a haircut in a partridge in a

[01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:09.690]
period three. Anything new going on on Eali? Which car? The very first one which would have been a

[01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:14.630]
light color. Most people are calling it a Nissan Maximal, which it isn't. The car we have is not

[01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:19.410]
a Nissan, but the tag does match and the vehicle description is a light colored border sedan.

[01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:22.870]
So as the car says we, I don't know if you can see our air right now, but as a car,

[01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:27.230]
so that our parts on the side the highway is the car in front. Right. The car in front was the

[01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:33.270]
first vehicle that we pulled over. After we pulled that vehicle over, another vehicle pulled over

[01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:38.930]
with it. So we ended up having two vehicles. At that point our backup units responded and

[01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:44.150]
part of that. We know. Get back to us when you know something new. Anyway, two of these three stories,

[01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.590]
you just facts me already have, but the third one I did not have. Let's see, we'll use this

[01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:52.110]
other one first. And by the way, I'll get back to the book, the preface and the a prologue and the

[01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:57.370]
forward. I mean, it's all more three than even Miguel finds it fascinating. Not.

[01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:04.850]
Now what is that? What is that little nervous lamp? It was completely fascinating. I thought it

[01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:08.450]
was. And like I said, the preface to the American edition I'm going to read it. And when I get

[01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:12.370]
around to it, we've got a lot of stuff today, lots of stuff. Plus we're keeping our IP on the LAC.

[01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:17.730]
What's going on with that alleged terrorist plot to do something in Miami. They're not cooperating

[01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:21.670]
apparently. As if we don't have enough problems already. And again, I don't know if you are

[01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:25.950]
able to see our air, but on the on the left side of our screen, we have a map showing that as far

[01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:29.570]
as we're concerned, the story begins in Calvin, Georgia in North. Yeah, we know that. They're not

[01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:33.890]
cooperating based on what? Where'd you get that? It's set on the screen. Sources said that they are not

[01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:39.010]
cooperating. Now, I didn't that FDLE guy that they had on earlier, then he said that they were

[01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:42.710]
cooperating kind of sort of somewhat. That's what he said. And now they're not cooperating. Well,

[01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:46.570]
it's time to like, you know, get the gloves off. Time to start beating the snout out of them and like,

[01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:52.290]
you know, hang them up by their toes. X Illinois Priests collected child porn, a former Roman Catholic

[01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:56.330]
Priests Played Agility yesterday to possession of three computer discs and hundreds of pages of

[01:32:56.330 --> 01:33:02.650]
images showing naked boys engaged in sex act and sadomasochistic activity. Vincent McCaffrey,

[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:07.630]
50, resigned from the Priests in 1992. He later worked at home furnishing store, managed a service

[01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:11.970]
station and sold insurance. Authorities said some of the pornography, which includes images of

[01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:18.730]
boys as young as six being beaten, found and gagged and locked in cages were found in under McCaffrey's

[01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:25.930]
mattress. Assisted, US attorney Marcus T. Funk, that's with an N. Marcus T. Funk,

[01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:30.130]
told US District Judge John Dera that McCaffrey had molested someone while he was a priest,

[01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:34.710]
but Dera cut him off and kept the hearing focused on the child pornography charges. Don't bother

[01:33:34.710 --> 01:33:38.950]
with that. Okay. Don't the confuses with the facts. Information concerning McCaffrey when his

[01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:42.670]
priest is under court seal, but much of it could come out during the sentencing hearing schedule

[01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:47.070]
to begin December 9th. McCaffrey could be sentenced to as much as 20 years in federal prison and find

[01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.590]
a half million dollars if the judge agreed with federal prosecutors on all the points they

[01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:58.170]
say make the former priest crimes unusually serious. Images of boys as young as six being beaten,

[01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:04.770]
bound and gagged and locked in cages. Ice gone pops, Plymouth Priest arrested for rape of child.

[01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:08.570]
This is in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Police arrested a Roman Catholic priest at this home,

[01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:12.550]
we are studying charging with raping and abusing a child. I'm church property in the town of Rochester.

[01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:17.630]
It's not Rochester, New York, it's Rochester, Mass. Out Rochester, Minnesota, it's Rochester, Mass.

[01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:22.990]
We're fed and we're heard of. Reverend John Lyon, 73, pleaded innocent to five counts of rape and

[01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:26.390]
abuse of a child during his rape and abusing in where I'm district court. He had been placed on

[01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:30.350]
administrative leave in May after the Boston Archdiocese learned of the allegation. Lyons'

[01:34:30.450 --> 01:34:34.430]
executes were committing the abuse between 1987 and 1989 on the property of St. Rose of Lima.

[01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:39.370]
He had been sued by two former author boys at a Boston Church who claim they were abused by him

[01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:45.970]
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. So, Colfee, for people in the area? Yes, it is. And of course,

[01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:48.930]
the state of the... Georgia Department of Public Safety news conference in a few minutes.

[01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:52.910]
Now, what are they going to give to us? I mean, they'll kill some time for CNN. What's the

[01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:57.970]
Georgia Department of Public Safety going to tell us? Since these guys were already well on the road,

[01:34:58.030 --> 01:35:03.070]
they were on a Hershey Highway coming down I-75 from Calhoun County. Where was it again? What was the

[01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:08.850]
restaurant? Shoney. A Shoney's Big Boy. And you told me before the show I asked you if you're

[01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:13.870]
reading the Shoney's and you said, you had a wild experience, a wild and testinal experience,

[01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.970]
but they sure do have that good strawberry pie. See, I say that, but I don't know that because I

[01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:21.530]
haven't eaten in a big boy in about a hundred years. There's a live brother's big boy, which is

[01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:25.270]
very big and Detroit, and Shoney's. Don't we have a Shoney's right out there on D.B. Road Extension?

[01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:29.670]
Is that still there? Somewhere around there, yeah. Yeah, right by 595. There's a Shoney's.

[01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:36.950]
Showing off. I think I have time to do the preface here. Well, like I said, preface to the American

[01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:40.490]
edition, the book again for Bidden Truth. It's a paperback. You don't have to spend an armor like the

[01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:45.730]
Vibe. It's on Nation Books by John Charles Bersart and Guillaume Descay. And my friends

[01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:49.910]
are very good. So if I'm just pronouncing their names, tough crap. Preface to the American

[01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:54.910]
edition, it is May 2002 and Osama Bin Laden and his lieutenants are as well known as Bill Gates

[01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:58.890]
and his software. The irony of infamy. I remember walking in London most of them about a year ago

[01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:02.890]
in the company of a banker, a specialist and fund management who services were greatly appreciated

[01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:07.270]
by his wealthy clientele from the Persian Gulf. On that day, we were having our fourth interview,

[01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:10.950]
I think, by this time we'd reached an understanding and we were no longer just discussing the secrets

[01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:15.090]
and sins of a Middle East and businessman. As we strolled towards St. James Park, he told me about

[01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:18.370]
the everyday life of his parents. Somewhere in the village overlooking them at a train into the

[01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:22.630]
north of Beirut. Voicerslam with great animosity complained about his father's inability to

[01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:26.110]
converse normally with his daughter and English schoolgirl who was a passionate militant

[01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:30.650]
and environmentalist group. Further on in Paul Maul after having walked past the walls of the

[01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:34.550]
shelter of the legendary Travelers Club, which he sometimes frequented, the place in London where

[01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:38.730]
mercenary aristocrats and adventurers diplomats can be found suddenly he began to speak in harsh

[01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:43.470]
tones occasionally turning around. He began to recount family stories of how the financing of

[01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:48.270]
Islamic terrorism had succeeded. We talked about the accounting operations of accredited establishment

[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:52.490]
in the United Arab Emirates and his trips to Islamabad in particular to the bank used by

[01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:57.430]
Pakistani Secret Service to support the Taliban and al-Qaeda. As always it was the concern of

[01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:01.110]
a Saudi religious chief allied with one of the four thousand princes who make up the royal family

[01:37:01.110 --> 01:37:05.670]
and whose right-hand man had organized a financial circuit from Dubai to the British Virgin Islands

[01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:11.150]
for the profit of Osama bin Laden. Officially bin Laden was then an ordinary terrorist, albeit one

[01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:15.790]
who had blown up two US embassies and attacked the USS Kool, sought naturally by the FBI but in

[01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:19.990]
whom most diplomats beyond the frontiers of the West were not interested. The multiple oil contracts

[01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:24.250]
with Saudi Arabia then necessitated a certain understanding of these specificities of the religious

[01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:29.530]
dictatorship operated by King Fad and Prince Abdullah clearly one did not crush such an invaluable ally

[01:37:29.530 --> 01:37:33.230]
in the name of seizing a bandit. Therefore at that time these enterprises were mentioned only

[01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:38.130]
Sotovoce very quietly even by the two peaceful pedestrians walking under the London drizzle,

[01:37:38.490 --> 01:37:42.270]
especially under the London drizzle. The city is home to dozens of fortunes built around the

[01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:45.950]
oil wells of the Gulf. I think we better do the break and I'll come back and finish this you know

[01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:50.850]
from sir because time is of the essence baby and God only knows what heavy duty craft may be

[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:51.490]
coming down to that.

[01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:57.550]
My life and love this is 4.256 UAH2A.

[01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:02.210]
Friday you bastards.

[01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:29.570]
You're in drinking chubby and blow up the whole goddamn place.

[01:38:58.130 --> 01:38:59.550]
You're in drinking chubby and blow up the whole goddamn place.

[01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:03.570]
One of the cars one of these two cars on the alias traced back to a family to an address in

[01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:07.890]
Hannover Park a suburb of Chicago and that they're just a bunch you know they're talking to

[01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:11.770]
neighbors and they're just a bunch of like ordinary people kind of like Mohammed Abtan all of those

[01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:19.590]
guys which we all remember very well. It is again this is Hannover Park Illinois it is quite a

[01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:26.970]
way outside Chicago to the north and west it is a suburb it is that very quiet suburban community.

[01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:30.150]
All right Jeff we're going to let you go and find more information we've just passed the

[01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:33.290]
top of the hour imagining we have a lot of new viewers joining us. No we don't.

[01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:37.390]
Let me just read the background again on the steering case anybody is rolling out of the

[01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:42.350]
sack right now or isn't aware what's been going on all morning. Alligator Alley remains closed

[01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:46.610]
right now as I speak after police detained three men in two cars because of a possible terrorist

[01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:50.870]
threat. Bomb sniffing dogs alerted authorities to material in both vehicles but no explosives

[01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:55.910]
were immediately found. EJ Piccolo the FDLE said authorities blasted open with a peer to be a

[01:39:55.910 --> 01:40:00.430]
backpack taken from one of the cars and a robot was being used to search the vehicles. Bomb squad

[01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:05.410]
technicians and protective blast suits also removed a suitcase and plastic bags from one car and

[01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:09.330]
searched the interior in the trunk. We're taking it very seriously until we can eliminate the

[01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:13.810]
possibility of a threat or verify that there wasn't legitimate threat Piccolo said. Piccolo said

[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:17.010]
the men in the vehicles had not been arrested but we're being detained he also said all three

[01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:20.930]
were US citizens would not identify them any further although there was a slum and there was

[01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:25.450]
Arabic handwriting found on papers inside one of the cars. Florida police said they tracked down the

[01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:29.910]
cars after one of them ran a toll plaza. John Vagnardi of the Florida Highway Patrol said the

[01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:33.770]
men were uncooperative when they were stopped and refused to allow a search so the authorities

[01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:38.050]
brought in the bomb sniffing dogs. The cars both of Illinois licensed plates remain on

[01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:43.050]
in the state 75 about 50 yards apart. The FHP shut down the 20 miles stretch after one o'clock

[01:40:43.050 --> 01:40:47.070]
this morning when the vehicles were stopped and like I said the Alley in both directions is closed

[01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:51.570]
right now. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation had issued an advisory for two cars yesterday

[01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:56.390]
after woman at a show knees restaurant in Calhoun, Georgia in the northwestern part of that state

[01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:59.910]
told police she overheard three men and Middle Eastern descent discussing terrorist plans

[01:40:59.910 --> 01:41:04.550]
Wednesday night. CBS Radio News reporter Michael Hibben said the woman apparently reported

[01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:08.910]
the men were bragging that they were going to inflict damage in South Florida and reportedly

[01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:14.190]
said they would let Americans mark the September 11th anniversary and then strike on Friday the 13th.

[01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:18.930]
The highway patrol said the road was blocked off from the toll booth east of Naples to state road 29.

[01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:25.930]
Ever take state road 29? Not that I know of. Now that's the shortcut. That's the

[01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.630]
triple of them. It's like a bearing man. You can go through there about 400 miles an hour.

[01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:33.570]
It's an old two lane highway. If you're like going over to West Coast you know if you're

[01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:37.150]
like going over to Tampa to Bernstake House to pay respects to the late Bern Lackser

[01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:41.370]
we're figuring out over the same pit to hang out with some of those old people on the shuffle

[01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:47.930]
board courts. Sounds fun. What is it? I said that sounds fun. Oh it's great. Those are the

[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.490]
grandparents of the people living in the surfside. I'm telling you boy you're sure

[01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:57.470]
facts in me just a pile of stuff here man. A pile. First one that's coming through. Huh?

[01:41:57.950 --> 01:42:03.290]
There's a pile of snake coming through. Wow look at this. This thing goes on and on by Alicia

[01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:09.450]
Solomon. Oh oh. More than the Jewish stuff. Don't be saying Jewish stuff on the Jew holidays. Okay

[01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:15.990]
I'm on. Now did I interrupt? What did I do? Did I interrupt my reading? I think I did. Didn't I?

[01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:24.230]
Oh here's the Georgia guys. The robot that has been provided by Metro Day. No these aren't

[01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:29.570]
the Georgia guys. This is back on the alley. Anyway now where where the hell was I? See this is bad

[01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:33.470]
interrupting your reading in the middle of an important article. It's gonna mark the spot.

[01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:37.750]
Yeah right. Here it is. This is from the preface. The name of the book is Forbidden Truth by

[01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:44.950]
John Charles Bersarding-Heeham Deskay. The International Best Cellar banned by the Ben Laden family.

[01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:50.670]
The purpose which they wrote goes on the say since 1998 the professional newsletter intelligence

[01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:54.170]
online had published several investigations of these charitable associations and companies

[01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:58.710]
with Saudi, Pakistani and United Arab Emirates origins which without giving them too much

[01:42:58.710 --> 01:43:03.370]
away without giving too much away finance del Qaeda. Each time our sources trembled. Some

[01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:07.310]
begged us to promise them we would no longer cover the subject but 9-11 changed everything.

[01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:11.330]
Well some of it loud enough as lieutenants became public figures. Their story was shown on hundreds

[01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:15.190]
of television programs and gradually the reasons behind the emergence of their movement and its

[01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:19.610]
expansion over the course of the past 10 years became fundamental questions for our understanding.

[01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:24.470]
After asking how was it possible everyone did everybody wanted to know why was it possible?

[01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:29.250]
The book Forbidden Truth seeks to bring together the first brief responses. Published for the

[01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:33.570]
first time in France November 14 2001 it brought together three years of investigations

[01:43:33.570 --> 01:43:38.310]
of the political channels financial networks oil stakes and secret diplomatic deals slowly created

[01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:42.450]
room for the maneuver for this group of nostalgic terrorists of the holy war when their crude

[01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:46.930]
ideology swearing as much by the Quran is by the Kalashnikov. After the attacks we tried to

[01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:50.490]
publish it as quickly as possible because at the moment when the military operations were getting

[01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:55.270]
underway in Afghanistan it seemed important precisely not to focus on Afghanistan. It was more

[01:43:55.270 --> 01:44:00.630]
matter of looking closer to home. We wanted to decipher this badly controlled nexus without which

[01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:04.990]
Osama bin Laden's companions would have rained just distant armed cranks praying in the desert.

[01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:09.830]
We wanted to dissect this entanglement of negligence and political interests and calculations from

[01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:14.150]
the park hay floors of the foreign office in London to the marble floors of the Texas oil companies

[01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:19.570]
in Houston and to the fitted carpets of Fadushia recumbenties in Geneva. In fact appendix seven of

[01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:23.370]
this book originally commissioned by the French intelligence services was the basis of a French

[01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:27.710]
parliamentary report that resulted in the closing of several so-called Islamic charities. The

[01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:31.730]
report was handed over to George Bush by Jacques Girard Thuring as first visit to the US in the wake

[01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:36.590]
of 9-11 but at no time did we imagine the consequences of the revelations contained in these pages.

[01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:40.790]
Once worse we never once wanted this book to become party to the investigations that were going

[01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:45.370]
on right under our eyes. That would have been a waste of time and effort but its contents overtook us.

[01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:50.590]
We had taken stock of it in December 2001 when several days before Christmas a committee of

[01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:55.170]
special inquiry of the security council of the UN moved to hear us. It's mission to reconstruct

[01:44:55.170 --> 01:44:59.070]
a money trail thanks to which bin Laden has been able to pursue his activities. The hearing took

[01:44:59.070 --> 01:45:03.790]
place in Paris and a quiet annex at UNESCO headquarters. It focused exclusively on the financial

[01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:07.810]
networks and parallel diplomacy that it followed the Taliban and Osama bin Laden to gain an

[01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:12.510]
aura of power. What transpired was two hours of tight technical discussion in the presence of eight

[01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:16.030]
diplomats who had recently discovered the extent of these collusions and who did not hide their

[01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:21.010]
embarrassment before the seriousness of the charges level at Saudi Arabia. From India to the US this

[01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:25.030]
panel of investigators represented the gamut of leading nations all of which at one time had gone

[01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:28.910]
greedily fishing opting to preserve their relationship with the monarchs of the Gulf or their

[01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:33.250]
pipeline projects in central Asia over the fight against terrorism but henceforth they forced

[01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:38.030]
themselves to examine it sometimes to the point of fear. As the book has been covered by the foreign

[01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:42.190]
press reactions of a different sort of reached us aggressive one sometimes in the form of insults.

[01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.050]
French bankers, American oil companies and Persian Gulf businessmen, like you're recently

[01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:50.130]
in sconce and financial paradises in Europe or the Antilles didn't take well as such as spilling

[01:45:50.130 --> 01:45:54.450]
of the beans. These were the men whose fortunes derived from family secrets and maybe a few words

[01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:58.710]
exchanged on the tarmac at private airports. One of them in not the least yes I've been

[01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:03.510]
lawden brother of Osama a Swiss citizen of just one year hate of an ever our

[01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:08.130]
berefts of offshore companies stepped up litigation using all the possibilities afforded under Swiss

[01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:11.790]
freedom of press laws to stop the book's publication on the grounds that he disapproved of our

[01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:15.850]
general approach. The court that pronounced the act of censorship didn't seem to have taken into

[01:46:15.850 --> 01:46:20.430]
account the text context. This is proof that not all truths should be spoken especially in the land

[01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:24.990]
of secret banking Switzerland. Nevertheless despite the unexpected support of the Swiss justice

[01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:29.490]
system yes long been lawden did not escape an investigation a money laundering watchdog at the

[01:46:29.490 --> 01:46:33.350]
French finance ministry spotted suspicious transfers being made through one of his accounts

[01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:39.410]
an action was quickly brought in March 2002 by magistrate Renau van Roombike a specialist

[01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:43.170]
in financial cases at which we were asked to appear as witnesses in our capacity as authors

[01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:48.050]
in this book. Swiss police carried out searches across the country on March 27 probing the money

[01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:51.970]
laundering allegations the operation involved searches at the headquarters of nine companies and

[01:46:51.970 --> 01:46:56.650]
forehomes in Geneva, Bern, Zürich and Zurich a week later been lawden's villain can in the south

[01:46:56.650 --> 01:47:01.570]
of France was also searched at van Roombike's request. Beyond these developments we felt that after

[01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:05.310]
nine eleven with investigations like this one there were others something was transformed

[01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:09.370]
perceptions perhaps a sense of urgency a general impression that from now on world affairs

[01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:13.330]
were more interest. After finally terrorizing us the terrorist have surrendered some of their

[01:47:13.330 --> 01:47:17.710]
vigilance to our societies with the endless debates and exchanges provoked by this book it seems

[01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:21.850]
to us that a new wisdom for the long term was essential. People no longer joke about the power

[01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:26.330]
struggles and many of our rivalries that plague our planet. Everyone must be mindful the consequences

[01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:30.490]
of a hatred left to rot on the other side of the world just because there was no immediate interest

[01:47:30.490 --> 01:47:35.210]
to keep a rich country there. However over there in that other world where the unthinkable emerge

[01:47:35.210 --> 01:47:39.750]
were educated and fanatical young boys became capable of flying planes in large buildings in

[01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:44.110]
that part of the world what has changed nothing or very little. Certainly there's a plethora of

[01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:48.290]
military options underway to destroy the terrorist camps certainly the contemptible Taliban regime

[01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:53.210]
has been disintegrated having benefited from far too long for the benevolence of some western

[01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:57.630]
quarters in the generosity of oil companies evidently even in the middle of Afghan mountains the

[01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:01.550]
private or powerful political and financial connections their one time allies now rectifying

[01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:06.250]
their mistakes the masters of the country became once again masters of their goats. With the

[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:09.730]
spectacle of the fall of the Taliban and the barbarian of the final trap del Qaeda Legion

[01:48:09.730 --> 01:48:14.810]
in Afghanistan a conviction ceases us we witnessed the rightful vengeance inflicted on this

[01:48:14.810 --> 01:48:19.850]
rabble and still not quite how does one erase that vision almost burlesque of the head of the Taliban

[01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:24.850]
mullah Omar saving himself that is running away from a city on a simple mohid in a country that

[01:48:24.850 --> 01:48:29.290]
had been for several weeks under the control of western allies the executors of low deeds have

[01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:34.850]
been routed but their pay masters remain unpunished who are they Islamic bankers located in the

[01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:39.370]
United Arab Emirates those chief clerics installed as the ruling spiritual powers in Saudi Arabia

[01:48:39.370 --> 01:48:43.470]
who's in trees we described several Saudi princes close to the world palace who's hidden

[01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:48.630]
alliances we devolved those in charge in Pakistan eager to promote a strong Sunni regime on the other

[01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:53.430]
side of the border in particular the ball truth ugly but undeniable is that Arabic peninsula that

[01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:57.290]
is home to the main supply of oil reserves consumed by the industrialized nations is the power

[01:48:57.290 --> 01:49:01.790]
rest in the hands of dictators of the sands whose pension for nepotism and jerman takwisay guaranteed

[01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:06.330]
us 50 years of reliable and easily corruptible middlemen who are able to fill their coffers on our

[01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:12.350]
fuel purchases and their arms acquisitions in the region these amirs and kings that keep their

[01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:16.350]
people in a permanent state of submission fear have always held up the korean to legitimize their

[01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:20.490]
position and have always been prepared to compromise with the most radical clerics to ensure that no

[01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:24.990]
one dislodges from their palaces here they are now acting shocked and surprised to learn that one

[01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:29.550]
of the their faithful soldiers or one of these mullahs Osama bin Laden has behind the new world

[01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:34.030]
disorder that's ovexes they're which western partners it's the mesh of these secretive

[01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:37.670]
relationships it's the influence of religious extremists in those countries in which the health

[01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:42.110]
of our trade rests it's our willful blindness before those sovereigns whose very archaism the

[01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:46.510]
bases islam it's the inconsistency of them financing the radical aims throughout the world through

[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:50.790]
foundations aided by the petro dollars we throw at them these are the realities that explain in

[01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:54.950]
depth the growing power of Osama bin Laden at the same time they bring to light the irresponsibility

[01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:59.430]
of what euphemistically we call in our country parallel diplomacy as if to convince ourselves that

[01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:03.970]
mistedes that the mistedes that are necessarily incorporates remain parallel to our concerns

[01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:11.250]
that one should not be confused with the other herein lies our mistake 237 votes on our pool today

rouse state I don't know look at that editors at time Warner's People Magazine found themselves

[01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:50.570]
in controversy yesterday after the weekly published a photograph showing former first daughter

[01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:58.350]
Chelsea Clinton and an apparent a roused state Clinton has shown erect as she is embraced by her

[01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:03.450]

[01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:40.070]
like that but we are under orange alert you do remember that anyway getting back to this it says

[01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:44.590]
publishing the provocative photograph of the media shot Clinton is the latest attempt by new people

[01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:48.170]
editor Martha Nelson to heat up the magazine the snap has featured near the front of the book

[01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:51.750]
in the September 23rd issue it's on page 24 by the way in case you want to know

[01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:57.850]
but the controversial shot of Clinton pulled mixed reviews even from within the magazine I work

[01:55:57.850 --> 01:56:03.010]
here I found it in very poor taste of people staffer told the drudgery port from New York why don't

footnote in a reference to pump up traffic of the news stand else editor Nelson also runs

[01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:33.370]
an aggressive stalker rocky photograph of pop star Justin Tinkerbell who's captured in a close-up

I can do today the prologue says the interview took place at the Oak Bar in the New York class

[01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:25.870]
of hotel a place is dark and austere as the lives of those who behind the scenes are leading the

[01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:31.010]
fight against terrorism in late July 2001 I met with John O'Neal on business O'Neal was the

[01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:34.990]
former head of anti terrorism in the U.S. who become deputy director of the FBI's New York office

[01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:40.110]
in charge of national security at the age of 49 after having dedicated half his life to the FBI

[01:58:40.110 --> 01:58:45.370]
he joined the New York flagship office a position covered by coveted by FBI agents we had first

[01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:49.090]
met a month earlier in Paris a group of French anti terrorist experts and I had met with O'Neal

[01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:53.770]
to share information on a kindest financial networks we had dinner at Shabin Waan the lame array

[01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:58.270]
area at the same table occupied not long before by Hillary Clinton Madeline Albright the deputy

[01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:03.030]
director of the direction on Davis surveillance they twer whatever that is dst in charge of anti terrorism

[01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:07.710]
and Elaine Marceau the former chief prosecutor of the terrorist with a parcade de Paris the highest

[01:59:07.710 --> 01:59:12.290]
prosecution authority in France I gave O'Neal my report to the economic network of the bin Laden

[01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:15.670]
family of which he had heard during the dinner and we agreed to meet in New York the following month

[01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:20.090]
to discuss the report New York had become John O'Neal's territory he knew every nook and cranny

[01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:24.410]
from the historic stake houses to the china club from little Italy to the bars frequented by movie

[01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:28.430]
stars and film directors following him through the city one would think he owned the place he was

[01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:33.150]
welcomed everywhere as a friend he was also never off duty constantly juggling his cell phone and

[01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:37.390]
palm pilot as if to remind himself of his central mission accompanying him on his rounds was also

[01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:42.530]
an opportunity to discuss our business together John O'Neal was a rebel in a world where the

[01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:46.990]
president and his administration called the shots in charge of investigating active terrorism by

[01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:51.110]
the al-Qaeda organization he went to Yemen in October 2000 after the attack on the west's

[01:59:51.110 --> 01:59:55.890]
school in which 17 U.S. servicemen died he lambed the obstructionist attitude of young American

[01:59:55.890 --> 02:00:00.570]
among American diplomats there and of course the investigation became clear that diplomats from

[02:00:00.570 --> 02:00:04.770]
the state department FBI investigators didn't share the same approach the diplomats wanted to

[02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:09.010]
comply with the eminite regime in order to calm political relations while the FBI wanted to solve

[02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:13.250]
the crime and find those responsible for the attack as quickly as possible it was apparent that

[02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:17.990]
these two visions these two cultures could not coexist after another dispute over the FBI agents

[02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:22.130]
carrying of arms and turning over second level suspects to the American authorities the American

[02:00:22.130 --> 02:00:27.130]
ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bo-Deen for bad John O'Neal and his team of rambos as the eminite

[02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:31.430]
authorities called them from entering Yemen this despite the fact that according to O'Neal the FBI

[02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:35.270]
had in hand all of the evidence needed to implicate Osama bin Laden's terrorist network in the attack

[02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:39.850]
sitting in the china club at the top of building overlooking Manhattan John O'Neal recounted

[02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:43.390]
that he did exchange with the American ambassador his disappointment in the state department's

[02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:47.750]
impotence feigned or not and above all the threat of Osama bin Laden for him everything originated

[02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:51.590]
in Saudi Arabia and everything could be explained and solved through this prison all of the answers

[02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:56.010]
all of the clues allowing us to dismantle Osama bin Laden's organization can be found in Saudi Arabia

[02:00:56.010 --> 02:01:00.390]
he told me emphasizing the inability of American diplomacy to get anything out of King Fod

[02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:05.490]
concerning terrorist networks the reason there was only one corporate oil interests could this

[02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:09.170]
single explanation keep the US from investigating one of the principal terrorist networks in the world

[02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:13.270]
yes for the simple reason that the American administration had refrained from using the investigation

[02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:18.190]
as a means of putting pressure on its Saudi friends since George W's election the FBI was even

[02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:22.090]
more politically engaged O'Neal said and that could be felt even on his own investigations regarding

[02:01:22.090 --> 02:01:26.130]
bin Laden Saudi Arabia has much more pressure on us than we have toward the kingdom he said

[02:01:26.130 --> 02:01:30.190]
considering the US's dependency on its oil and thus the state department need to have a secure

[02:01:30.190 --> 02:01:34.910]
and stable Saudi Arabia during investigations of the attack on a military installation in Dharan on

[02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:40.950]
June 25th 1996 which killed 19 American soldiers O'Neal went to Saudi Arabia himself to convince King Fod

[02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:45.070]
to get the Saudi authorities to cooperate but that was a lost cause because Saudi officials

[02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:49.630]
interrogated the principal suspects themselves while the FBI was relegated collecting material evidence

[02:01:49.630 --> 02:01:54.390]
from the bomb site as for the relations between Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia the conclusions of my report

[02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:58.210]
which was commissioned by the French intelligence service did not surprise O'Neal and confirmed

[02:01:58.210 --> 02:02:02.710]
that bin Laden had close ties with high ranking personalities and families of the Saudi kingdom in July

[02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:07.330]
2001 contrary to their public statements he believed however that the chances of getting the

[02:02:07.330 --> 02:02:11.450]
Saudi to cooperate were slim and he called into question the FBI's extremely political stance

[02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:15.890]
in this area as well as that at the interior level coming from one of America's top specialists

[02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:20.110]
in these matters John Neal's revelation shed light on the potential danger of O'Neal and

[02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:23.990]
they tell us in clear terms that the fighting against terrorism was not the government's number one

[02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:27.870]
priority was certainly it was essentially out of resentment and because he knew that nothing

[02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:32.310]
would change his strong beliefs that O'Neal left the FBI in August 2001 to take position as

[02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:36.150]
director of security at the World Trade Center on September 11th he was meeting on the subject of

[02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:39.670]
security in the twin towers when the first plane at the building he left a call for help and

[02:02:39.670 --> 02:02:43.150]
coordinate the arrival of the police before going back into the building he had evacuated the

[02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:47.370]
occupants as if to save the thousands of New Yorkers who were so dear to him he died in the effort

[02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:51.570]
John O'Neal's testimony continues to be an essential piece of the puzzle in the fight against

[02:02:51.570 --> 02:02:55.150]
terrorism it shed light on the two principal stumbling blocks for the Western confronting these

[02:02:55.150 --> 02:03:00.130]
networks oil and its geographic strategic importance and Saudi Arabia and its religious and

Hey, you called, Bob?

[02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:14.590]
I'll kick you into the family.

[02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:16.830]
It's like something you've seen before.

[02:17:17.250 --> 02:17:17.810]
Oh, boy.

[02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:19.250]
Some of mom's got rid of it.

[02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:20.170]
What are you going to do?

[02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:23.270]
Eat the great Satan's and that's a haunt.

[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.210]
Um, no, Bob.

[02:17:25.590 --> 02:17:27.630]
Uh, just build up my strength for the jihad.

[02:17:28.170 --> 02:17:29.110]
I see you.

[02:17:29.370 --> 02:17:31.910]
Stop building up and stop blowing up there.

[02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:34.410]
When the son of a jackal gets the son of his own,

[02:17:34.650 --> 02:17:37.450]
he'll larity ensues on Al-Kaeda in the family.

[02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:39.590]
Only on Al-Jazeera TV land.

[02:17:39.930 --> 02:17:41.450]
So you notice the sheriff says that they were uncooperative.

[02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:43.370]
No struggle, but they weren't cooperative.

[02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:45.430]
Didn't want to give me any information, but they're not suspects.

[02:17:47.090 --> 02:17:51.970]
They're not suspect at this time, which is why they got the bomb robot going into the second car now.

[02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:53.610]
Because they're not suspects.

[02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:55.270]
Okay, Cliff Gorman, you wonder who he was?

[02:17:56.090 --> 02:17:56.430]
Okay.

[02:17:57.570 --> 02:17:59.110]
Because you guys didn't find out for me.

[02:17:59.730 --> 02:18:00.710]
But it's just as well.

[02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:02.050]
Because then I wouldn't have done a search on here.

[02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:04.390]
Cliff Gorman, he was an actor, played a bit parts.

[02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:06.570]
TV, you guys, the parents, is law in order.

[02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:07.890]
He was on law in order a bunch of times.

[02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:09.830]
New York news, murder, she wrote, which I don't want.

[02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:10.830]
Spencer for hire.

[02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:15.550]
See, if we saw Cliff Gorman, you know, if we saw a picture,

[02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:16.590]
oh, yeah, that's Cliff Gorman.

[02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:18.390]
Don't you think?

[02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:19.310]
Yeah, sure.

[02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:20.150]
No, we wouldn't.

[02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:22.350]
And the movie, he was in King of the Jungle,

[02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:28.650]
Ghost Dog, the war of the samurai, uh, 60s, the 60s,

[02:18:29.290 --> 02:18:30.410]
down came a blackbird.

[02:18:30.510 --> 02:18:32.110]
Oh, he was in a lot of movies, a lot of bit parts.

[02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:35.050]
Uh, forget me not, the, forget me not murders,

[02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:36.030]
the return of iron sight.

[02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:37.470]
Oh, most of these were TV movies.

[02:18:38.090 --> 02:18:38.410]
Huffa.

[02:18:39.670 --> 02:18:40.470]
Why was it a good movie?

[02:18:40.570 --> 02:18:41.090]
Did you see that movie?

[02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:41.890]
No.

[02:18:42.330 --> 02:18:43.090]
Who was in that movie?

[02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.910]
I don't know.

[02:18:45.170 --> 02:18:47.650]
God, I think, uh, wasn't Robert the hero in that movie?

[02:18:48.130 --> 02:18:48.450]
Okay.

[02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:49.570]
Well, anyway, it was a good movie.

[02:18:50.090 --> 02:18:51.710]
Uh, you didn't see the movie, Huffa?

[02:18:51.930 --> 02:18:52.530]
No, I didn't see that.

[02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:53.270]
It was excellent.

[02:18:54.290 --> 02:18:56.510]
A night in the city, Tehran Track 9,

[02:18:56.770 --> 02:18:58.250]
Prestige of Honor, it said, well, there you go.

[02:18:59.370 --> 02:19:00.590]
Okay, that takes care of that.

[02:19:00.590 --> 02:19:02.990]
He's a, but he's not, I don't know, he's small potatoes.

[02:19:03.210 --> 02:19:05.310]
You don't put him up there with Kim Hunter with Johnny and I just do you?

[02:19:05.430 --> 02:19:06.090]
You don't know that category?

[02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:06.350]
No.

[02:19:06.470 --> 02:19:07.110]
I don't think so.

[02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:07.830]
No way.

[02:19:08.530 --> 02:19:10.670]
Okay, explosion of chemical plant near Houston, Texas.

[02:19:10.830 --> 02:19:11.770]
South Florida today.

[02:19:12.470 --> 02:19:13.990]
We will have more on that just ahead.

[02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.350]
Yeah, okay.

[02:19:14.510 --> 02:19:15.550]
So there's some pictures on CNN.

[02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:18.530]
While we're still trying to find out more about what's going on on the alligator rally,

[02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:19.710]
which is still closed, by the way.

[02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:21.730]
Now we can get lightened up a little bit.

[02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:23.610]
Get to some of these other stories now that I finished reading

[02:19:23.610 --> 02:19:24.970]
8,000 pages from that book.

[02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.610]
I'm serious.

[02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:26.310]
I need oxygen.

[02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:29.350]
But I just think that that book is, uh, you know,

[02:19:29.350 --> 02:19:30.750]
of course they're going to be skeptics out there.

[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:31.730]
Oh, there we go again.

[02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:33.830]
It's not just anti-bush, it's anti-clinton.

[02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:36.170]
It's anti-al the corruption of the, and the whole thing,

[02:19:36.310 --> 02:19:36.630]
OIL.

[02:19:36.810 --> 02:19:37.790]
That's what it's all about, baby.

[02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:39.650]
OIL, MO, NEY.

[02:19:40.590 --> 02:19:43.270]
And I'm sitting here thinking about that scene in the movie Network.

[02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.630]
Boy, that petty Cheryewski.

[02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:47.370]
He was one of the most brilliant people of our time.

[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:50.710]
That movie was so, so far ahead of its time, like 30 years ago.

[02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:54.330]
And Robert Duval is screaming about the Saudi deal.

[02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:55.870]
And of course Howard Veele gets on television.

[02:19:56.050 --> 02:19:57.670]
I want you to call the White House right now.

[02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:58.430]
And he goes to that...

[02:19:58.430 --> 02:19:59.770]
I'm as mad as hell!

[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:01.470]
I'm as upset as I think this anymore!

[02:20:01.570 --> 02:20:01.830]
Oh!

[02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:03.450]
The Saudi deal's got to be stopped.

[02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:06.390]
Right now, of course, they had all the loans where the Saudis,

[02:20:06.450 --> 02:20:08.990]
and all of that, Robert Duval, is moaning and groaning at the bar there,

[02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:12.150]
and pushing the bartender to punk aside to see the thing on TV.

[02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:13.410]
And he's having nervous breakdown.

[02:20:14.370 --> 02:20:17.230]
Because the Saudis basically were taking control over, uh,

[02:20:17.610 --> 02:20:20.070]
over the UBS, which at that time was the other big network.

[02:20:20.530 --> 02:20:20.910]
Remember that?

[02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.430]
Yeah.

[02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:24.310]
You didn't see network.

[02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:25.190]
No.

[02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:26.870]
Why is wrong with you, man?

[02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:30.670]
No wonder you were living in that little tiny world of yours with your Guile Baron,

[02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:33.850]
your goddamn double baked beans or whatever they call that.

[02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.270]
Yummy.

[02:20:34.810 --> 02:20:35.430]
Refried beans.

[02:20:35.790 --> 02:20:36.310]
Oh, God.

[02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:37.610]
What are your crap in your brains?

[02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:38.950]
You're blaming it on shoneys.

[02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:42.690]
Let's see, you're running spots for Calvary Church.

[02:20:42.810 --> 02:20:43.450]
You have to be kidding.

[02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:44.270]
What does that mean?

[02:20:44.650 --> 02:20:46.370]
I have no clue, but there's two factors on that.

[02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.870]
Calvary Church?

[02:20:49.770 --> 02:20:50.350]
Oh, there it is.

[02:20:50.490 --> 02:20:51.250]
It's Calvary Chapel.

[02:20:51.570 --> 02:20:52.190]
Well, don't ask me.

[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:53.350]
It's probably Adam Taranigan.

[02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:55.410]
You know, Adam, if it's not a cult, it's some kind of a church.

[02:20:55.410 --> 02:20:56.830]
I have no idea what that is.

[02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.090]
Okay?

[02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:58.470]
I've got nothing to do with that.

[02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:59.010]
I don't listen.

[02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:00.690]
I'm busy doing stuff here during the breaks.

[02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:03.130]
And I'm supposed to worry about what the recorded spots are.

[02:21:03.370 --> 02:21:04.510]
Hey, it's QAM, guys.

[02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:05.770]
We'll put anything on here.

[02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:07.710]
If somebody will pay us, we don't give a crap what it is.

[02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:10.290]
If the guy they malchite would buy some spots we take their money.

[02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:10.990]
We don't care.

[02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:12.330]
We're bunch of grave robbers.

[02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.810]
Here's another one.

[02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:15.170]
I knew you can't talk about this.

[02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:15.630]
What the hell?

[02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:16.370]
I don't know.

[02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:19.310]
I know it's not Bokobrine, behind me.

[02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:21.150]
Bokobrine's not doing this spot.

[02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:24.190]
Maybe he started a cult.

[02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:30.370]
Oh, brother, there's so much stuff coming on here.

[02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:31.710]
You guys will have to wait till Monday.

[02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:32.690]
I'll get to all of this stuff.

[02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:33.010]
Okay?

[02:21:34.350 --> 02:21:37.130]
And they expect me to be sitting here listening to the guy named recorded spots.

[02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:39.430]
Although I did hear that one spot that keeps cutting in and out,

[02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:40.550]
which I think he just played it again.

[02:21:41.610 --> 02:21:42.970]
I don't know which one that is.

[02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.550]
You know the one I mean?

[02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:44.350]
Yeah, that club.

[02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:46.330]
Yeah, boy, the audio keeps cutting out.

[02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:47.190]
And the same thing.

[02:21:47.430 --> 02:21:47.970]
We don't care.

[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:48.650]
It's life.

[02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:49.530]
There wasn't a purpose.

[02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:52.050]
That's intentional, I believe.

[02:21:52.410 --> 02:21:52.790]
It is?

[02:21:52.970 --> 02:21:53.210]
Yeah.

[02:21:54.690 --> 02:21:56.310]
Well, I don't want to say that it's stupid,

[02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:58.050]
but it sounds pretty stew- it's annoying.

[02:21:58.730 --> 02:22:00.950]
Sounds like there's a glitch, especially on this station,

[02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:02.750]
where we're so used to having that happen and thinking,

[02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:03.570]
oh, there we go again.

[02:22:03.850 --> 02:22:06.790]
More technical screw-ups, because we got that crappy equipment,

[02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:08.550]
although we do have the audio vault.

[02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:09.330]
That was an effect.

[02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:11.090]
I see.

[02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:12.130]
Well, it sure affected me.

[02:22:12.430 --> 02:22:13.510]
Here's something that might affect you.

[02:22:13.690 --> 02:22:14.670]
By the way, how's that pool coming?

[02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:16.850]
292 votes were approaching 300.

[02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:20.370]
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today?

[02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:21.690]
Yes, your almaphart.

[02:22:21.690 --> 02:22:23.310]
At least in double digits now, he's got 11,

[02:22:23.470 --> 02:22:25.290]
but he's been sucking wind in last place all day.

[02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:28.290]
Ariel Shiroin 17, the Pope 31.

[02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:31.550]
Osama Yamama 42, Saddam Hussein 85.

[02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:34.230]
He's getting close, and George W106.

[02:22:35.410 --> 02:22:37.350]
Levi's trousers protect your testicles.

[02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.730]
Oh!

[02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:39.770]
Now, where did this come from?

[02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:40.150]
Do we know?

[02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:41.710]
I don't know what the publication is from,

[02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:43.730]
but what differences do they make because it's so enlightening?

[02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:47.270]
Levi's trousers introduce a new range of slacks

[02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:49.410]
with mobile phone anti-radiation pockets.

[02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:52.110]
The trousers will be introduced next year in the UK

[02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:53.730]
under the company's docker's brand,

[02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:55.770]
and could cost as much as 100 pounds

[02:22:55.770 --> 02:22:57.130]
at 140 bucks a pair.

[02:22:57.690 --> 02:22:59.910]
The phone pockets are lined with special material,

[02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:01.630]
which Taylor's able to prevent radiation

[02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:02.990]
from phones reaching the skin.

[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:05.330]
140 bucks a pair.

[02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:07.170]
Of course, the company isn't saying that radiation

[02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:08.770]
from mobile phones is dangerous or anything.

[02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.670]
No, no, no.

[02:23:09.770 --> 02:23:11.790]
It says it's merely responded to customer concerns

[02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:14.690]
about radiation emissions from mobile phones.

[02:23:15.430 --> 02:23:17.530]
And since the slacks also have some waterproof coating

[02:23:17.530 --> 02:23:18.750]
as well and come in different colors,

[02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:20.950]
that's colors with a U, and sizes no doubt.

[02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:24.030]
In May, the UK government published a report

[02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:25.570]
which found that some mobile phones,

[02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:28.070]
shields can significantly reduce exposure to radiation.

[02:23:28.610 --> 02:23:30.270]
Test on some products found that many of the shields

[02:23:30.270 --> 02:23:32.510]
are devices can reduce exposure to radiation by large amounts.

[02:23:32.970 --> 02:23:35.370]
However, any reduction is often linked to a similar reduction

[02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:37.990]
in mobile phone performance leading to a weaker signal,

[02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:40.850]
which can lead people to be shouting more to be heard.

[02:23:40.930 --> 02:23:43.170]
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't mind shouting a little less

[02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:45.170]
if you're protesting your nuts.

[02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:48.790]
Speaking of nuts, Nick Nolte charged with the U.I.

[02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:49.590]
He's got a little problem.

[02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:53.510]
A drooling, droopy eyed Nick Nolte was arrested on suspicion

[02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:55.910]
of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol Wednesday.

[02:23:56.470 --> 02:23:59.830]
After police allegedly spotted his black 1992 Mercedes vans

[02:23:59.830 --> 02:24:01.630]
swirving across a Malibu highway.

[02:24:02.170 --> 02:24:04.750]
An officer making a traffic stop on the Pacific Coast Highway

[02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:06.970]
heard tire squealing and saw the vehicle driven

[02:24:06.970 --> 02:24:08.390]
by Nolte approaching rapidly,

[02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:11.030]
weaving across all lanes into opposing traffic

[02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:13.870]
set California Highway Patrol spokesman, Leland Tang.

[02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:16.710]
When he pulled over, Nolte, who plays the heroin-addicted

[02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:18.190]
robber and is upcoming move with the good thief,

[02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:19.870]
seen completely out of it, Tang.

[02:24:19.930 --> 02:24:22.070]
Said he was drooling with droopy eyes.

[02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:25.710]
He looked very much like he was under the influence.

[02:24:26.350 --> 02:24:27.670]
According to the AP, Nolte's 60,

[02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:28.850]
Monday failed a field sobriety.

[02:24:28.970 --> 02:24:30.870]
Test remain at custody till about 8.30 p.m. Wednesday.

[02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:32.470]
At which time he was cited and released.

[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:34.930]
Kind of like a bet on guiding light.

[02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:38.210]
Oh, by the way, Mondays today guiding light goes to 10 o'clock

[02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.530]
in the morning.

[02:24:38.530 --> 02:24:39.310]
We're going to have to tape it.

[02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:40.110]
God damn it.

[02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:41.890]
Just when it's getting pretty intense, too, dammit.

[02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:43.170]
Man.

[02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:46.570]
And when Michelle is co-zing up the bill now,

[02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:48.690]
the boyhood girlhood, Chummers,

[02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:50.270]
whatever the hell they were, they're starting to get a little bit tight.

[02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:53.870]
And when Ed is starting to co-ze up the Cassie a little bit, huh?

[02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:55.190]
Getting pretty tense, isn't it?

[02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:58.050]
He was extremely puzzling and cooperative, Tang.

[02:24:58.130 --> 02:24:59.630]
Said apparently there were even a few passives by,

[02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:01.630]
and one of the passives by stopped and took pictures.

[02:25:01.970 --> 02:25:03.410]
The actors, publicists, Arnold Robinson,

[02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:05.130]
had no media comment.

[02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:06.330]
Can't imagine why.

[02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:08.630]
Pouring out fit, bitch for an Amster.

[02:25:10.050 --> 02:25:11.650]
An Adult Entertainment Media Company

[02:25:11.650 --> 02:25:13.750]
wants to buy these song swapping service Napster

[02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:15.810]
and has offered more than $2.5 million worth of its stock

[02:25:15.810 --> 02:25:18.250]
for the Now DeFunked Company that's with an N.

[02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:21.830]
Private Media Group, Inc., a publicly traded adult entertainment site

[02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:24.890]
based in Spain, offered a million shares for Napster's assets.

[02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:28.030]
Shares of Private Media, which distributes its adult media content

[02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:29.650]
directly and through a network of local affiliates

[02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:32.030]
and independent distributors, ended yesterday's session

[02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:34.070]
at $2.41 on NASDAQ.

[02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:35.590]
In a statement, Private Media says

[02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:38.070]
I want to use the Napster trademark to offer millions of adults

[02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:41.030]
while the ability to swap adult-oriented content for free.

[02:25:41.430 --> 02:25:43.530]
And at the same time, again, access to top quality content

[02:25:43.530 --> 02:25:44.270]
at a reasonable price.

[02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:45.790]
That sounds appealing, don't it?

[02:25:47.490 --> 02:25:48.750]
See, they're both on it already.

[02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:49.630]
They're both looking for it.

[02:25:50.370 --> 02:25:54.630]
Private Media claims to own the largest library of adult-oriented content

[02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:57.290]
in the world with global copyrights to the content.

[02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:59.370]
And Napster, which had once had a cult following

[02:25:59.370 --> 02:26:01.590]
of some 60 million, was forced to show it down last year

[02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:03.350]
after major record labels commits to federal drugs

[02:26:03.350 --> 02:26:04.790]
and violated copyright laws.

[02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:07.430]
And after used a networking technology called Peer to Peer,

[02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:09.730]
which allows users to share a file.

[02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:15.390]
$156 at $5.60 WQM can't wait for that.

[02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:18.230]
The meantime, all we have is Cliff Gorman.

[02:26:18.490 --> 02:26:19.490]
Well, that'll have to do for now.

[02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:22.450]
If you love your home, but you need more space,

[02:26:22.650 --> 02:26:23.970]
here's how you solve that problem.

[02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:25.750]
Do what a lot of other smart people are doing

[02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:27.910]
and call our friends at strictly additions.

[02:26:28.130 --> 02:26:29.670]
Whether you're having a baby in another room,

[02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:31.410]
if you're converting a car port or patty

[02:26:31.410 --> 02:26:33.630]
into a living space, maybe you went into business for yourself

[02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:35.230]
and you want to make an office in your home.

[02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:37.470]
All you have to do is call the good people at strictly additions.

[02:26:37.470 --> 02:26:38.670]
They'll take care of all of it for you.

[02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:41.830]
There you're one stop shop, more space for your place place,

[02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:43.530]
with an absolutely worry-free approach

[02:26:43.530 --> 02:26:44.870]
to expanding your living place.

[02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:48.610]
And space, those no-shows by the contract is not going to happen.

[02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:51.150]
In complete work, no way, no unexpected bills,

[02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:53.170]
no worries about the job not getting done right,

[02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:55.270]
and they take care of every single last detail.

[02:26:55.650 --> 02:26:57.490]
They drop your blueprints, they get the building permits,

[02:26:57.850 --> 02:26:58.910]
handle all the inspections for,

[02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:00.790]
they take away all the hassle, just leave it to them.

[02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:03.090]
Strictly additions about an ED-5 step approach

[02:27:03.090 --> 02:27:04.390]
to total customer satisfaction.

[02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:07.050]
Number one, call to schedule a free project evaluation

[02:27:07.050 --> 02:27:08.030]
appointment right in your home,

[02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:11.030]
where a project estimator will determine the scope of your addition.

[02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:12.850]
Number two, schedule a bit of employment

[02:27:12.850 --> 02:27:14.890]
in their convenience room, where you'll get a detailed proposal

[02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:16.450]
on the exact price for your work.

[02:27:16.850 --> 02:27:18.510]
Number three, you select your finishing touches,

[02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:20.750]
go to contract, number four, reviewed the design,

[02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:22.290]
architectural drawings, and then number five,

[02:27:22.290 --> 02:27:23.110]
you sit back and relax.

[02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:25.550]
As your dream addition moves ahead on schedule,

[02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:28.150]
with unbeatable quality, it's as simple as all of that.

[02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:32.190]
So give strictly additions to call at 954-791-8100.

[02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:34.490]
954, what is it again?

[02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:36.110]
791-8100.

[02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:37.350]
Look for the rad and yellow pages,

[02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:39.290]
they're licensed, they're mature, they do spectacular work.

[02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:41.210]
Tell them that neon-tortedly to call strictly additions

[02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:42.950]
at 954, we'll get it right this time.

[02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:44.990]
791-8100.

[02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:47.130]
Line line and local.

[02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:51.210]
We're sports radio five-sixty, C-A-U-A-S.

[02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:54.150]
Hey, there's Steve Goldstein,

[02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:55.990]
but you can call me Galsy.

[02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:57.790]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to...

[02:27:57.790 --> 02:27:58.990]
Wait a minute, I am in town.

[02:27:59.310 --> 02:28:00.770]
It's the 12th of one hour!

[02:28:01.170 --> 02:28:01.370]
Sat!

[02:28:11.310 --> 02:28:14.910]
It's nine o'clock on a Sunday night,

[02:28:15.350 --> 02:28:18.070]
and I'm gonna watch HBO.

[02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:23.170]
There's some dumb show about a funeral home

[02:28:23.170 --> 02:28:26.350]
where Tony and Big Pussy go.

[02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:33.050]
I've had to wait over a year and a half

[02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:36.650]
to see if that Russian guy is dead.

[02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:41.350]
But when I turn on the tube, I'm sure getting screwed

[02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:45.090]
because they're showin' our list instead.

[02:28:45.090 --> 02:28:50.090]
Goon-bag, goon-bag, a-ra-ra-ra.

[02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:55.230]
Goon-bag, a-ra-ra-ra.

[02:28:58.190 --> 02:29:01.790]
Where the hell are the sopranos, man?

[02:29:02.530 --> 02:29:05.110]
I've waited too long for this thing.

[02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:09.650]
I wanna see all the Enthildion

[02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:13.310]
in the back room of the fight of being.

[02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:19.850]
It's been so long since the last episode.

[02:29:20.350 --> 02:29:23.090]
There's so many things I forgot.

[02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:26.270]
Dip on it, get whacked.

[02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:28.270]
It's furious, smoke and crack.

[02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:31.390]
And as Tony still sails us to God.

[02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:38.150]
So I pick up the latest TV guide

[02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:41.970]
and that's when I start feeling fine.

[02:29:42.970 --> 02:29:46.770]
Thank God HBO's bringing back the day goes.

[02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:50.430]
Each and every Sunday at nine.

[02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:56.710]
Oh, it's season four of the sopranos, man.

[02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:59.810]
Good thing they're bringing it back.

[02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:04.610]
If I had to wait even one second more,

[02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:08.250]
I'd have my cable guy whacked.

[02:30:09.010 --> 02:30:10.190]
Hey, forget about it.

[02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:12.150]
It's about bringing time, ain't it?

[02:30:12.310 --> 02:30:14.590]
Number three, you're gonna all be a once-in-one baited breath.

[02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:16.630]
One day, what is that? Sunday? Sunday.

[02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:19.170]
Sunday, for pranos. Am I gonna be watching that?

[02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:20.310]
No. It's not every night.

[02:30:20.430 --> 02:30:23.070]
The ones from last year, I can watch about two minutes and then move along,

[02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:25.710]
watch the racing from Mohawk and wherever else.

[02:30:26.410 --> 02:30:27.510]
Rarsha ready to attack Georgia.

[02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:30.290]
I went on the channel seven new website during the break

[02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:33.770]
to see if they had like a more complete story on the thing on the alley.

[02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:36.450]
And lo and behold, here's this story.

[02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:41.230]
Early in the show, I read a thing about Russia and a punetang

[02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:44.150]
and bush making a tit for tat on Iraq and Georgia.

[02:30:45.610 --> 02:30:47.330]
Rarsha ready to attack Georgia, it says.

[02:30:48.250 --> 02:30:50.830]
Rarsha's military is ready to launch attacks in Georgia to flush out

[02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:53.890]
Chechen militants, believe to be based in a remote mountainous region,

[02:30:53.970 --> 02:30:55.990]
defense minister Sergei Ivanov, on Thursday.

[02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:57.170]
What team does he play for?

[02:30:57.790 --> 02:31:00.610]
Georgia's been under Russian pressure for months to take action against militants

[02:31:00.610 --> 02:31:03.150]
and the Pankisi gorge, but it's probably a quip military,

[02:31:03.430 --> 02:31:06.390]
which has only about 17,000 men, has launched only one operation

[02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:09.210]
which produced few results, the detention of 13-led criminals

[02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:10.710]
and once suspected Arab militants.

[02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:13.790]
The pressure increased yesterday with a release of details of a letter,

[02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:16.930]
President Poon Tang sent the world leaders outlining Russia's complaints

[02:31:16.930 --> 02:31:19.930]
about Georgia's inaction and asserting Russia's right to launch attacks

[02:31:19.930 --> 02:31:23.390]
in line with the UN Charter in training countries to self-defense.

[02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:26.770]
The Georgian parliament sent a statement yesterday to the UN,

[02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:29.890]
NATO and other international organizations saying that Poon Tang has placed

[02:31:29.890 --> 02:31:31.510]
in front of Georgia the threat of aggression.

[02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:34.550]
Evenov, meanwhile, told reporters, specific attack proposals

[02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:36.830]
would be presented to Putin in the near future.

[02:31:37.150 --> 02:31:40.030]
He said such strikes may not be needed if Georgia takes appropriate measures

[02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:41.870]
the Interfax News Agency reported.

[02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:44.570]
How do you like that?

[02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:49.070]
Says the Russian attack could trouble relations with the US,

[02:31:49.090 --> 02:31:51.190]
American troops have been based in Georgia since May,

[02:31:51.650 --> 02:31:53.930]
given giving anti-terrorism training to the Georgian military.

[02:31:54.210 --> 02:31:57.290]
However, however, it says the timing of Putin's letter to world leaders

[02:31:57.290 --> 02:32:00.670]
coming as the UN General Assembly with the President Bush make his case

[02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:04.270]
for military action against Iraq, indicated Putin wants to draw parallels

[02:32:04.270 --> 02:32:07.650]
between the Russia, Georgia and the US Iraq disputes.

[02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:11.450]
Russia has vehemently opposed any unilateral action by the US against Iraq

[02:32:11.450 --> 02:32:14.030]
and it's unclear if the Kremlin would abandon its objections

[02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:17.590]
if the US gave tacit approval to one of the South in Georgia.

[02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:18.270]
How do you like that?

[02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:19.490]
Like that story I read earlier.

[02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:22.610]
Probably a lot of people out there saying, oh yeah, that's just a bunch of propaganda, right?

[02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.610]
Right.

[02:32:24.610 --> 02:32:28.450]
Have handed in what they say is their identity.

[02:32:28.770 --> 02:32:31.750]
All of that men of Georgia and Pakistani and their weight in descent.

[02:32:32.390 --> 02:32:33.390]
They have been provided.

[02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:34.330]
I do like that.

[02:32:34.410 --> 02:32:36.510]
That two are naturalized US citizens.

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:37.950]
One is a US citizen.

[02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:45.110]
But they're saying use the words appear to be Kelly because we could find out that this documentation is fake.

[02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:46.670]
There's always that possibility.

[02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:53.030]
So 99% sure we're okay here but there's always that 1% chance that this is these are fake documents.

[02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:59.590]
And yes, they were medical students according to a variety of officials that I spoke to today and they were in school.

[02:32:59.730 --> 02:33:02.650]
Not here in the United States but in Dominica in the Caribbean.

[02:33:03.370 --> 02:33:10.090]
And I was also told by a US official that it appears that they were on their way to a medical conference in Miami.

[02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:16.450]
At least that is a story that I didn't told them and they're corroborating.

[02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:23.450]
There's no specific information linking these individuals to any terrorist activity.

[02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:25.250]
That's why their names are not being released.

[02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:27.830]
That is why there are no charges brought.

[02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:30.570]
They are being held for questioning at this point.

[02:33:30.930 --> 02:33:31.610]
That is it.

[02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:37.750]
They are not being as you said and very important to underscore here not being called suspects or being held at the suspect.

[02:33:37.970 --> 02:33:39.350]
Nobody is ever a suspect.

[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:40.370]
Come on, quick kid enough.

[02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.750]
Okay.

[02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:47.150]
I say we fry them all just you know let's rev up all sparky one more time and fry the three of them just to be on the safe side.

[02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:51.250]
Something that's going to be safe and sorry that's what John Akscroff says let's fry them.

[02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.870]
Right.

[02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:53.170]
Sounds good to me.

[02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:55.490]
Voters be trade.

[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:58.370]
This was an editorial in yesterday's hero which I never got around to.

[02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.550]
What a mess.

[02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:02.510]
And by the way I should point out before I read this.

[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:04.530]
Janet Reno is playing hardball baby.

[02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:09.590]
She's got the big hard balls out and she says hey just hang on a minute cowboy.

[02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:11.450]
Let's recount some votes here.

[02:34:12.490 --> 02:34:15.090]
Whole bunch of votes in day that didn't get counted allegedly.

[02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:17.650]
I think a whole bunch of dead people are still trying to get the vote.

[02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:21.570]
So let's wait and be sure and make sure that everybody got their fair chance to vote.

[02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:23.930]
So if we can try to make up those 8100 votes.

[02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:26.190]
Oh it's so sad.

[02:34:26.570 --> 02:34:26.970]
What a mess.

[02:34:26.970 --> 02:34:29.650]
In the first day why votes into the 2000 presidential election.

[02:34:30.010 --> 02:34:32.970]
We in South Florida have embarrassed ourselves again says the hero.

[02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:36.090]
We completely bought an important election while the nation watched.

[02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:41.230]
Counties throughout the state reported some problems but the most severe and damaging occurred in date and brown.

[02:34:41.470 --> 02:34:41.730]
Wow.

[02:34:42.570 --> 02:34:44.190]
Simply put there was no excuse.

[02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:47.430]
None for what happened to day and scores of our polling places.

[02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:49.650]
Some precinct openings were delayed for hours.

[02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:52.130]
Poll workers weren't familiar with new touchscreen computers.

[02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:54.530]
Precincts closed before the extended 9pm deadline.

[02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:56.630]
Computer voting cartridges were misplaced.

[02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:57.590]
Both were erased.

[02:34:57.990 --> 02:34:59.370]
Poll workers quitted and chew up.

[02:34:59.610 --> 02:35:00.470]
Voters returned away.

[02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:02.630]
Party identification cards were in short supply.

[02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:04.750]
Voters were denied or no vote meant.

[02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:06.630]
That was on the OK rights referendum.

[02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:10.370]
In short most of what could go wrong did go wrong in these two counties.

[02:35:10.810 --> 02:35:14.530]
Blame this in blame for this inexcusable electoral meltdown must go to the county election supervisors.

[02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:18.050]
Whose primary responsibility is to plan and organize elections.

[02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:24.470]
It might be argued and probably will be that the state failed to give county supervisors enough resources to guarantee a relatively error.

[02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:26.810]
For election but that would just be a lame excuse.

[02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:34.010]
After the 2000 election debacle state lawmakers passed new laws that dealt with some of the more egregious problems discovered in punch card validating.

[02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:39.310]
Florida also allocated $20 million for new electronic voting systems, modernizing voting in every county.

[02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:43.050]
Elections supervisors may assert correctly that they didn't get all the money they requested.

[02:35:43.430 --> 02:35:46.450]
But the mandate from lawmakers and voters was resoundingly clear.

[02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:48.730]
No more screw ups.

[02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:53.230]
Proof that doing the job is possible was evident in the performance in other counties across the state.

[02:35:53.230 --> 02:36:00.770]
In populous Hillsborough County for example, election supervisors worked out kinks in the new touchscreen system with a trial run involving thousands of computers and voters.

[02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:06.610]
In Pasco County poll workers would have been 12 hours of training on procedures and new equipment compared to four hours in date.

[02:36:07.950 --> 02:36:09.250]
Four hours in date.

[02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:19.630]
Data officials say they were hampered by last minute changes in computer software applications which left little time for training in Broward election supervisor Miriam Olafant.

[02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:24.510]
As battle incessantly with county commissioners about funding and voting machinery.

[02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:31.230]
Wednesday, Miami Mayor Alex Pingapakain you called for a fact finding investigation by the county's inspector general.

[02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:33.530]
It will be overseen by an independent civilian panel.

[02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:40.710]
The inspector general should quickly analyze what went wrong and why and make recommendations that can be implemented before the November general election in Broward.

[02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:42.990]
Miss Olafant called for a similar process.

[02:36:43.410 --> 02:36:46.330]
Both are worthy efforts that can prevent a recurrence albeit after the fact.

[02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:50.950]
Obviously the focus of Broward and data officials must be to prevent a similar disaster in November.

[02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:56.210]
Obviously, nevertheless, the harm done to voters in the primary election is unforgivable.

[02:36:56.550 --> 02:37:05.130]
Few activities that citizens participate in or as critical to democracy is voting yet thousands of voters have been disenfranchised by officials lack of planning and poor organization.

[02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:08.650]
This debacle is an unconsumable betrayal of all self-vote voters.

[02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:09.350]
How do you like that?

[02:37:09.850 --> 02:37:12.390]
The self-righteous up and a hero says and they're absolutely right.

[02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:15.590]
Unconsumable, unacceptable, appala crap is what it was.

[02:37:16.530 --> 02:37:19.310]
You can smell it a million miles away. I can smell it all the way up here.

[02:37:20.290 --> 02:37:22.310]
See if they've had or Josh Friedman's in a building again.

[02:37:23.790 --> 02:37:25.110]
Is he still there, by the way?

[02:37:25.410 --> 02:37:25.530]
Yeah.

[02:37:26.250 --> 02:37:30.210]
Well, let me ask you one, they may sound ridiculous. Let me ask you one question about that.

[02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:30.690]
Why?

[02:37:31.450 --> 02:37:31.870]
Yeah, why?

[02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:33.530]
I don't know.

[02:37:34.450 --> 02:37:36.590]
Well, they had to have somebody on MSNBC, I guess.

[02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:39.910]
Anyway, it's 11 past noon at 5.60.

[02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:44.070]
You and the men, these three men of Jordanian, Pakistani and Iranian descent.

[02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:53.330]
They may have no connection to any formal terrorist group who may just be sympathizers to a cause or may just think you know what?

[02:37:53.350 --> 02:37:53.670]
Or maybe not.

[02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:54.990]
Quick conjecturing already.

[02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.890]
They may be this.

[02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:57.490]
Let us know when you got something.

[02:37:57.610 --> 02:37:59.750]
I realize you asked, well, there's got a lot of time to fill on there.

[02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:03.610]
And the picture of the two cars sitting there on a goddamn alley isn't really all that exciting.

[02:38:03.970 --> 02:38:05.150]
And even they are a little robot.

[02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:07.950]
The bomb-sniffing robot there isn't all that exciting anymore.

[02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:10.390]
Even the dogs were, they ran out.

[02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:10.950]
Do you know what that is?

[02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:13.090]
The bomb-sniffing dogs, they took off.

[02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.970]
They said, what's for lunch?

[02:38:14.370 --> 02:38:14.910]
Let's get out of here.

[02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:17.710]
Here's the guy that's always ready for a good lunch.

[02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:19.550]
Tom Laman and Helen Pontiac GMC.

[02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:21.870]
And they added again down there are good friends one more time.

[02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.950]
Zero percent financing continues.

[02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:27.250]
That's right, with a proof credit from GMAC, you can get right now as I speak.

[02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:33.070]
Zero percent financing of the 36 month on all, 2003 Pontiac and GMC models.

[02:38:33.370 --> 02:38:37.730]
And of course, the fact that they slipped out into this coffee means the 2003 Pontiac and GMC's.

[02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.890]
Oh!

[02:38:38.130 --> 02:38:38.450]
Are here.

[02:38:38.850 --> 02:38:42.930]
Or take a rebate of up to 4 grand and all 2002 Pontiacs or GMC models in stock.

[02:38:43.430 --> 02:38:47.430]
Check out the complete line of GMC SUVs, including that very exciting spiffy envoy,

[02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:51.130]
voted by now, you should know by now, voted by Motor Trend is the SUV of the year.

[02:38:51.430 --> 02:38:53.370]
And check out the all new Pontiac 5 SUV.

[02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:54.890]
It's a real gas ghost.

[02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:57.770]
I mean, it's got the power of a sports car at a fraction of the price.

[02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:01.430]
Helen's also got a great selection of dependable pre-owned cars, trucks and SUVs.

[02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:04.970]
And if some other clown in town turned you down for credit when you tried to buy a car,

[02:39:05.310 --> 02:39:05.970]
forget about that.

[02:39:05.970 --> 02:39:09.550]
Forget about that place because Halib Pontiac will find some way to work your deal.

[02:39:09.930 --> 02:39:13.270]
So if you want an unbeatable deal on Pontiacs and GMC's, this is always the place.

[02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:17.330]
And when you go down there, you'll discover why they've been went and business in the same place for so long

[02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:19.090]
because they treat you right and they make an unbeatable deal.

[02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:24.270]
134 or 136, Ohio, that's the US one across from the falls, open every day seven days a week.

[02:39:24.670 --> 02:39:27.510]
Halib Pontiac GMC, we are professional grade.

[02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:34.230]
My, my, and local, this is 4205-60, E-way-2-A-M.

[02:39:36.210 --> 02:39:38.350]
Holy cow, Aaron's coming.

[02:39:41.930 --> 02:39:47.970]
Hi, I'm Jeff Bush and I'm just like all of you out there, except I'm rich.

[02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:50.270]
Very, very rich.

[02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:54.050]
I've got more money than any of you will ever see in your whole life,

[02:39:54.510 --> 02:39:58.190]
without ever having to earn a penny of it like you four losers have to do.

[02:39:58.730 --> 02:40:02.550]
But hell, we co-op running against, so why not vote for me?

[02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:06.150]
You know, I'm so rich I paid the Jewish journal to back me.

[02:40:06.610 --> 02:40:10.890]
Boy, even for a rich spoiled kid like me, that's it me back abundant.

[02:40:11.530 --> 02:40:17.170]
I want to be your governor for the same reason a dog licks his balls because I can't.

[02:40:17.730 --> 02:40:23.590]
I want to relate to the little guy, like people who have to do their own shopping, things like that.

[02:40:24.350 --> 02:40:26.390]
Difficult for me because I'm rich.

[02:40:26.890 --> 02:40:29.370]
So let's work together to build a better Florida.

[02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:31.650]
Vote for me, Judd Bush.

[02:40:32.890 --> 02:40:33.830]
Because I'm rich.

[02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:37.070]
I've heard my little devil come in and do it like Jeff Bush, think I...

[02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:38.910]
217 and 560 W.

[02:40:39.010 --> 02:40:40.470]
Here, what's the guy Cliff Gorman, right?

[02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:42.530]
Right, never heard of him.

[02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:46.550]
I almost forgot his name, so he just doesn't qualify.

[02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:49.730]
But over the weekend, I'm sure that we got like a long weekend, not a long weekend,

[02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:52.210]
but we've got the rest of today and tomorrow on Sunday.

[02:40:52.570 --> 02:40:56.470]
We can find some of their famous, famous person who can complete the trilogy.

[02:40:57.490 --> 02:40:59.890]
Do we have like a time limit on what period they have to die in?

[02:40:59.890 --> 02:41:01.190]
I guess like within a couple of days.

[02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:05.590]
Final show, Church allowed five priests to continue work despite many allegations.

[02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:09.830]
Newly released personnel files of five priests show they are signs of Boston

[02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:12.290]
who was told about numerous allegations of sex abuse against the priest,

[02:41:12.690 --> 02:41:15.930]
some dating back four decades, but allowed the priest to continue in parish work.

[02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:16.370]
Oi!

[02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:21.410]
The documents made public yesterday detail multiple allegations against the Reverend Robert V. Gale,

[02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:25.370]
who was arrested last month for allegedly raping a boy in the Church rectory.

[02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:29.370]
At St. Jude's parish in Waltham over four years prior to the 1980s,

[02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:31.730]
when the boy was 10 to 14 years old.

[02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:37.010]
The documents also describe allegations made against the Reverend's John Atwater, Richard Coglin.

[02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:38.990]
I guess they used to call him Father Coglin.

[02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:41.570]
George J. Rosencrant and Joseph Welch.

[02:41:42.050 --> 02:41:45.070]
Many of the allegations are contained in correspondence sent to three church supervisors,

[02:41:45.470 --> 02:41:48.310]
Bishop John McCormick of Manchester, New Hampshire, and it goes on.

[02:41:49.010 --> 02:41:52.150]
The documents were obtained by attorneys who represented approximately 250 people

[02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:53.710]
who claimed they were abused by priests.

[02:41:53.710 --> 02:41:57.210]
There were a number of occurrences with the knowledge of the supervisors of the Archdiocese

[02:41:57.210 --> 02:42:01.250]
going back pretty far, and yet they don't remove the priest at Attorney Jeffrey Newman.

[02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:04.190]
The records when you look at them as a group are really quite profound

[02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:08.410]
in detailing this specific factual basis on which they could have taken them out of the purses

[02:42:08.410 --> 02:42:12.330]
and put them where they would have had no contact with children or simply retired them.

[02:42:12.690 --> 02:42:16.010]
Donna Maurissi, Rhymes Wood Cissy, the spokeswoman for the Archdiocese,

[02:42:16.170 --> 02:42:17.910]
whose name was heard eight million times in the last few months,

[02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:20.610]
didn't immediately return phone calls and wasn't for comment.

[02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.910]
We can't imagine why.

[02:42:22.690 --> 02:42:23.990]
She's busy old Donna.

[02:42:25.410 --> 02:42:29.510]
Editorial, and yesterday's Palm Beach Post, even angrier than the hero, I believe,

[02:42:30.010 --> 02:42:35.570]
or at least equally pissed off, Florida became the unruly guest at Wednesday's National Funeral

[02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:38.830]
while Americans observed moments of silence, visited places of worship,

[02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:42.170]
pretended memorial services, and otherwise paid tribute to the Democratic feedums

[02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:44.130]
that separate the U.S. from those who would destroy it.

[02:42:44.430 --> 02:42:47.750]
Florida looked once again like the stumble bomb state that can't get democracy right.

[02:42:48.090 --> 02:42:50.350]
There was somebody, if I can interrupt this, there was somebody last night,

[02:42:50.350 --> 02:42:52.690]
I think, on a hard ball with Chris Matthews.

[02:42:52.810 --> 02:42:54.370]
I don't remember who the guest was, but he was saying,

[02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:57.630]
oh yeah, he said, you know, things that the election in Florida went pretty well,

[02:42:57.630 --> 02:42:59.790]
at least as compared to any other Latin American country.

[02:43:00.730 --> 02:43:01.910]
Oh, yeah.

[02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:05.490]
I mean, we've been getting every shot, and of course, we don't care anymore,

[02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:06.430]
because we're used to it.

[02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:08.270]
I mean, you know, we can't shame us.

[02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:09.230]
Well, I Greg Reed.

[02:43:10.270 --> 02:43:13.910]
A signing blame the Palm Beach Post says, however, is not as easy as it might seem.

[02:43:14.570 --> 02:43:17.650]
Obviously, election supervisors in Broward and Dave counties get a large portion.

[02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:21.090]
David Leahy, one of the day charterer, is appointed by the County Commission,

[02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:22.910]
has done the job since 1981.

[02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:25.630]
Oh, why we have no idea.

[02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:28.270]
Miriam Allefant was elected two years ago in Broward.

[02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:29.590]
Each hit of normal was coming.

[02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:32.650]
They, in the 65 other supervisors, knew that after 2000,

[02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:36.210]
new coverage and public attention would magnify even normal glitches

[02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:38.350]
in the first major test of a new system.

[02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:42.210]
It is inexcusable, however, when voters can't get to the system.

[02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:44.650]
Dozens of Broward and Dave precincts open late.

[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:46.210]
Pull workers didn't turn on machines.

[02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:47.370]
We didn't know how to operate them.

[02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:49.510]
Republicans and Democrats got each other's ballots.

[02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:52.530]
Some voters plan to ask for provisional ballots and didn't get them.

[02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:56.270]
In date, some of the affected precincts were in the same African-American neighborhoods

[02:43:56.270 --> 02:43:58.210]
where voters still believe they were disenfranchised,

[02:43:58.650 --> 02:44:00.930]
screwed over in the 2000 presidential election.

[02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:04.170]
If nothing else, chaos to the South-made Palm Beach County,

[02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:05.690]
where problems were minor, look good.

[02:44:06.270 --> 02:44:10.050]
Election supervisor Theresa Lapour was late with complete results, however,

[02:44:10.410 --> 02:44:13.530]
apparently because she didn't use enough of the laptop computers that tabulated votes.

[02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:17.050]
But Governor Bush was wrong to absolve himself and the legislature.

[02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:21.590]
Ultimately, Tuesday's troubles were a factor only in the Democratic primaries for Governor Attorney General,

[02:44:21.930 --> 02:44:23.810]
which happened to be the two major statewide races,

[02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:28.990]
each is very close and neither will win and will get a majority until this year partisan primaries went to a runoff.

[02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:33.150]
As part of Florida's post-2000 election reforms,

[02:44:33.570 --> 02:44:36.790]
the legislature and Governor Bush eliminated partisan runoffs for this year only.

[02:44:37.310 --> 02:44:41.310]
The intent was to hurt any Democratic candidate for governor who might finish this strong second,

[02:44:41.310 --> 02:44:44.730]
and then slain shot the victory in the runoff and game momentum to challenge Governor Bush.

[02:44:45.090 --> 02:44:47.510]
That's how Ruben Asquit and Governor Bob Graham became governor,

[02:44:47.810 --> 02:44:49.130]
and Lawton Charles got to the West Senate.

[02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:51.950]
Add the runoff, and much of this new controversy goes away,

[02:44:52.310 --> 02:44:54.850]
the state would know who's in the runoff, who came in first wouldn't matter.

[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:59.230]
There'd be no talk among Bill McBride and General Reno's advisors about how they're looking at legal options,

[02:44:59.410 --> 02:45:03.830]
but he dire and Scott Madder's would be gearing up for the chance to go against Charlie Christopher Attorney General, Christ.

[02:45:04.290 --> 02:45:08.630]
We also note that Governor Bush chose to call Tuesday's election shameful because people couldn't vote.

[02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:13.270]
He showed no such outrage in 2000 when many of the same Floridians complained that their votes had been counted.

[02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:16.670]
Then of course, Governor Bush was on the side that didn't want the votes counted.

[02:45:16.990 --> 02:45:18.990]
He won't be wanting counted in November either.

[02:45:21.690 --> 02:45:25.070]
In fairness to Florida, this state has enacted election reform for itself,

[02:45:25.210 --> 02:45:27.410]
while Congress is still arguing over how to do it for the nation.

[02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:30.610]
California's Riverside County, which pioneered the use of touchscreen machines,

[02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:34.150]
had many of the same startup problems, such as workers not turning machines on soon enough,

[02:45:34.450 --> 02:45:35.930]
elections in that county now run smoothly.

[02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:40.050]
Also, there were examples throughout the state that a competent supervisor can run trouble-free elections,

[02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:40.970]
even in large counties.

[02:45:41.390 --> 02:45:46.790]
Hillsborough County, which has 519,000 registered voters, and has the same machines Palm Beach County bought,

[02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:51.490]
had minor issues in the handful of precincts, and all results in were in by 2 a.m. even with a 2-hour extension.

[02:45:52.050 --> 02:45:55.230]
Some changes, though, would help to avoid some of the problems that cropped up this time.

[02:45:55.690 --> 02:45:59.310]
The legislature should require that the once-in-10-year special redistricting sessions

[02:45:59.310 --> 02:46:03.630]
that take place as soon as census information is available, which is roughly 18 months before general election.

[02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:06.930]
New maps this year were in final until barely two months before the primary,

[02:46:07.250 --> 02:46:09.170]
thus forcing tough deadlines in large counties.

[02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:13.090]
To deal with shortage of poll workers, more than 100 in Palm Beach County quit over the weekend,

[02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:15.510]
counties should have to train county employees with the job.

[02:46:15.850 --> 02:46:18.070]
They would be reliable and most would be available on short notice,

[02:46:18.350 --> 02:46:20.490]
and most of them would be out of the age of 200 by the way.

[02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:23.430]
Election supervisor should extend the voting period.

[02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:26.250]
Counties could open limited number of universal polling places at malls,

[02:46:26.490 --> 02:46:30.210]
and courthouses in the previous Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, then open all polling places Tuesday,

[02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:32.150]
or voting could take place Tuesday and Wednesday.

[02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:34.250]
The state could pick up some of the extra expense.

[02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:39.010]
The danger of chronic ballot bungling is that frustrated voters will become cynical non-voters,

[02:46:39.210 --> 02:46:44.030]
with political line drawing making so many races uncompetitive, thus reducing turnout.

[02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:48.350]
The state cannot afford to lose any more people whose participation in politics doesn't turn on

[02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:49.510]
on how much money they contribute.

[02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:52.630]
Writers for Leno and Letterman will thank Florida for new material,

[02:46:52.930 --> 02:46:55.350]
but there's nothing funny about what the state says.

[02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:57.050]
The pissed off Palm Beach Post.

[02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:57.990]
Let's hear it.

[02:46:58.810 --> 02:47:00.370]
It's part of their crappy sports section.

[02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:02.830]
How's the, let's see, U.S. remains on higher alert.

[02:47:02.930 --> 02:47:06.190]
We know that orange alert, and there's the little bomb-sniffing robot.

[02:47:06.310 --> 02:47:10.110]
Other casual nature of the technicians out there.

[02:47:10.390 --> 02:47:12.530]
Authorities expect highway to be close for some time,

[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:15.610]
so if you're going to go over and try to collect, like an unpaid bill from the beesleaves,

[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:18.130]
you better fly, okay? Or else just forget about it.

[02:47:19.170 --> 02:47:22.030]
Suggest that indeed the fact that if you try to collect money from the beesleaves,

[02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:23.250]
I'd just say forget about it.

[02:47:23.250 --> 02:47:24.310]
Wouldn't be anywhere near that car.

[02:47:24.690 --> 02:47:25.090]
You're okay, good.

[02:47:25.850 --> 02:47:27.990]
Broward Commissioner, this is in the Sun Central this morning.

[02:47:28.110 --> 02:47:30.110]
Defends Ole Fanth, but urges series of changes.

[02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:31.970]
Like I said, it's in the Sun Central from yesterday.

[02:47:32.930 --> 02:47:33.810]
A Broward Commissioner yesterday.

[02:47:33.970 --> 02:47:35.650]
Well, how's that possible? I guess I must have been overnight.

[02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:38.930]
A Broward Commissioner yesterday came to the defensive and vettel election supervisor,

[02:47:38.930 --> 02:47:42.370]
Miriam Ole Fanth, and urged a series of changes to get her office in the county

[02:47:42.370 --> 02:47:45.130]
through the November, I say fire her ass right now.

[02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:45.430]
Oh!

[02:47:45.690 --> 02:47:47.530]
Okay. And David Leahy, both of them.

[02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:49.670]
If it's somebody in there with a half of brain,

[02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:51.990]
who's going to do things right, we only got like, what is it?

[02:47:52.050 --> 02:47:53.230]
November 5th is how many weeks away.

[02:47:53.370 --> 02:47:53.770]
Not too many.

[02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:58.590]
Twenty, twenty seven, then you got about seven or eight weeks away.

[02:47:58.730 --> 02:47:59.430]
Maybe less than that.

[02:47:59.970 --> 02:48:00.630]
Who the hell are we kidding?

[02:48:01.350 --> 02:48:02.170]
Fire both their ass.

[02:48:02.310 --> 02:48:03.850]
Get somebody in there, get this thing organized.

[02:48:04.170 --> 02:48:04.710]
Get it done right.

[02:48:04.810 --> 02:48:06.790]
Get a bunch of poll workers in there under the age of a thousand.

[02:48:08.250 --> 02:48:09.830]
And let people vote, God damn it.

[02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:11.110]
Black, white, purple in between.

[02:48:11.250 --> 02:48:12.530]
Even a few Republicans, not too many.

[02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:17.150]
There's Spidey Web of Intrigue, stretched from LA to New York to Japan.

[02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:18.790]
But following 18 month investigation,

[02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:20.670]
four stolen Spider-Man costumes,

[02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:23.790]
valued at $50,000 each, and one Batman suit,

[02:48:23.890 --> 02:48:24.830]
valued at 150 grand,

[02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.750]
had been recovered.

[02:48:25.970 --> 02:48:26.470]
Thank God.

[02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:29.790]
LA County Prosecutor, say a coin to a report in daily variety.

[02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.570]
Aren't you relieved?

[02:48:31.050 --> 02:48:31.230]
Shoot.

[02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:32.070]
God.

[02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:34.970]
That Batman outfit, I bet you that, what's his name?

[02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.410]
What's his name?

[02:48:37.490 --> 02:48:38.170]
See, I've got a...

[02:48:38.170 --> 02:48:38.290]
What's Batman?

[02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:39.810]
The one from the TV.

[02:48:40.030 --> 02:48:41.290]
Oh, we don't care about the ones from the movies.

[02:48:41.430 --> 02:48:42.150]
There are too many of those.

[02:48:42.370 --> 02:48:42.830]
They were all bad.

[02:48:42.990 --> 02:48:43.750]
They were, yeah, okay.

[02:48:44.530 --> 02:48:44.810]
Yeah.

[02:48:45.330 --> 02:48:45.690]
That's it.

[02:48:46.110 --> 02:48:46.610]
I've got it.

[02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:48.150]
And I'm wise, thank you.

[02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:49.270]
I thought he said it out loud.

[02:48:49.270 --> 02:48:51.030]
I mean, Bert Ward, I wouldn't forgive, but Adam,

[02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:52.450]
while I was probably hyperventilating,

[02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:54.030]
I'm under a lot of pressure here today, you know?

[02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:55.470]
There's Mark Potter, how's she doing?

[02:48:55.570 --> 02:48:56.850]
And they have to treat it this way.

[02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:58.450]
You've had that conversation with Kelly,

[02:48:58.910 --> 02:49:00.410]
who talked about the same thing,

[02:49:00.610 --> 02:49:03.790]
and this gentleman here underscores that same point,

[02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:07.110]
that they have no choice when they get this kind of information.

[02:49:07.850 --> 02:49:10.850]
People here praise the woman in Georgia for what she said.

[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:11.790]
They defend.

[02:49:11.930 --> 02:49:12.310]
See that?

[02:49:12.490 --> 02:49:14.230]
Like I said, even though you're picking on her,

[02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:15.570]
give her the congressional medal of honor.

[02:49:16.450 --> 02:49:17.250]
I wasn't picking on her.

[02:49:17.390 --> 02:49:19.250]
Yeah, you were saying some cost-thick thing,

[02:49:19.250 --> 02:49:19.610]
you were saying about her.

[02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:22.270]
You said that Yahoo, bitch, or something like that.

[02:49:22.410 --> 02:49:24.110]
Maybe you just muttered it under your breath.

[02:49:24.110 --> 02:49:24.590]
I heard it.

[02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.550]
You heard it.

[02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:27.750]
By the way, they also cut those spider men off, too.

[02:49:29.370 --> 02:49:30.550]
That was in the first sentence,

[02:49:30.670 --> 02:49:32.190]
if you had been paying real close attention.

[02:49:32.410 --> 02:49:33.070]
Oh, see, I missed that.

[02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:33.450]
I was really paying attention.

[02:49:33.450 --> 02:49:36.430]
Yeah, you got to pay real close attention.

[02:49:36.730 --> 02:49:39.010]
Listen, I know you're not fooling me that when I'm doing these shows

[02:49:39.010 --> 02:49:41.450]
from remote locations, from here in Amsterdam,

[02:49:41.730 --> 02:49:43.130]
and around the world, in the Yannemsville.

[02:49:43.270 --> 02:49:45.090]
I know that you guys have been there playing part cheesy

[02:49:45.090 --> 02:49:45.850]
and screwing around.

[02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.930]
We're playing life.

[02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:49.370]
Probably, you know, chasing Doreena around the room.

[02:49:50.910 --> 02:49:53.130]
1226 at 560, WQA.

[02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:54.490]
I was going to say I can get even with you,

[02:49:54.570 --> 02:49:55.370]
but I think I just did.

[02:49:55.930 --> 02:49:58.690]
Are you sick of being taken advantage of by real estate agents

[02:49:58.690 --> 02:50:00.130]
and brokers when you're looking to sell your home?

[02:50:00.350 --> 02:50:00.830]
You sick of that?

[02:50:01.230 --> 02:50:03.770]
Well, if you are, check out SaveRealty.com,

[02:50:03.790 --> 02:50:04.550]
and here's how this works.

[02:50:04.970 --> 02:50:06.450]
You retain the right to sell your home.

[02:50:06.610 --> 02:50:08.950]
You can also show and sell your home to buyers who call you directly.

[02:50:09.310 --> 02:50:11.610]
And if you sell your home this way, you pay only 1% commissions,

[02:50:11.610 --> 02:50:12.270]
and that's it.

[02:50:13.090 --> 02:50:15.730]
SaveRealty.com cooperates with all MLS realtors.

[02:50:15.730 --> 02:50:17.450]
You can also show your home to realtors.

[02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:19.370]
And if they sell your home, you only have to pay the realtor

[02:50:19.370 --> 02:50:21.730]
the commission they traditionally charge for bringing you a buyer.

[02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:23.430]
The bottom line is, you save money.

[02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:27.190]

Here's that number one more time for the West Coast.

[02:50:46.690 --> 02:50:48.970]
954-788-2660.

[02:50:49.730 --> 02:50:51.250]
My name is Luke.

[02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:53.710]
This is 430560.

[02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:55.570]
You weigh 2A.

[02:50:57.570 --> 02:50:59.790]
Dear Fred, be very afraid.

[02:51:00.050 --> 02:51:02.250]
John, you have been a star for more than 25 years.

[02:51:02.430 --> 02:51:04.330]
I have been asking you for 25 years today.

[02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:06.290]
You never want to why today.

[02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:07.490]
What am I doing right?

[02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:10.970]
Well, I just feel that when you get a lot of offers,

[02:51:11.290 --> 02:51:12.170]
you want to do them.

[02:51:12.170 --> 02:51:14.930]
So you really think it was meant to be?

[02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:16.090]
Oh, very much so.

[02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:17.290]
Look at this.

[02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:19.930]
I'm feeling her breath.

[02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:24.530]
What I can tell you is what I observed to be true.

[02:51:25.170 --> 02:51:31.670]
At first glance, this is a border on gruesome at the moment.

[02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:33.770]
I cry for you.

[02:51:34.270 --> 02:51:36.790]
For you is the only.

[02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:39.770]
If they more accept number 11.

[02:51:39.770 --> 02:51:40.630]
This is young.

[02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:43.850]
Is your real proudiness done from Rodeart, who eats the chonies?

[02:51:44.250 --> 02:51:46.570]
They said they had attended a party in Chicago,

[02:51:46.570 --> 02:51:47.410]
the night before,

[02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:49.970]
and that they needed to quit stopping

[02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:52.770]
because they were five hours late.

[02:51:54.750 --> 02:51:58.590]
And then I just naturally, my curiosity, I just kept listening,

[02:52:00.170 --> 02:52:01.990]
and something else was said.

[02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:04.890]
They were kind of huddled together there

[02:52:04.890 --> 02:52:05.990]
over the booth talking.

[02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:08.590]
And then one guy said,

[02:52:09.450 --> 02:52:11.130]
do you think that will bring it down?

[02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:14.630]
And I looked at my son,

[02:52:14.770 --> 02:52:16.290]
and we were just looking at each other.

[02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:18.790]
And he said, well, if that don't bring it down,

[02:52:19.570 --> 02:52:20.630]
I have contacts.

[02:52:20.890 --> 02:52:22.410]
I'll get enough to bring it down.

[02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:28.950]
And to me, that meant they were planning to blow up something.

[02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:33.510]
And as you listen to the words there of a unison,

[02:52:33.510 --> 02:52:36.670]
the woman who called authorities about a possible terrorist attack

[02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:39.010]
on the US, we take you live to the scene where...

[02:52:39.010 --> 02:52:40.030]
Now we don't want to go to the scene.

[02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:41.830]
Delta flight to Miami-C and I just reported

[02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:42.670]
it has been diverted.

[02:52:43.210 --> 02:52:43.890]
Did you hear that?

[02:52:44.310 --> 02:52:44.850]
Yes, I saw that.

[02:52:45.330 --> 02:52:45.470]
Yeah.

[02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:47.690]
Did they say where it was coming from or anything else?

[02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:48.830]
No, I just say it was diverted.

[02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:51.710]
Okay, well, you know, they're unhightened alert in your area.

[02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:53.350]
Aren't you glad that you're there and I'm here, by the way?

[02:52:54.310 --> 02:52:55.070]
Yeah, really glad.

[02:52:57.810 --> 02:52:59.770]
Hey, listen, they're under heightened alert, the port,

[02:52:59.930 --> 02:53:01.530]
and all, you know, just to be on the safe side,

[02:53:01.530 --> 02:53:05.170]
because this thing on the alley could be the beginning of a plot that they're, you know, uncovered.

[02:53:05.490 --> 02:53:08.530]
And certainly, if there were some kind of a plot, there wouldn't just be three gypsies,

[02:53:09.450 --> 02:53:11.250]
you know, driving down from Calhoun County, Georgia.

[02:53:11.730 --> 02:53:12.350]
You thought I would have said?

[02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.350]
Yes.

[02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:15.230]
So everybody's like under heightened alert.

[02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:17.730]
And of course, you got the proper stormers on the way,

[02:53:18.690 --> 02:53:21.070]
and you got the election to still hang it up in the air.

[02:53:21.430 --> 02:53:23.230]
Like I said, being here is not so bad.

[02:53:24.370 --> 02:53:26.050]
Green's band sees depressing effects.

[02:53:26.210 --> 02:53:27.190]
Oh, I'll tell you one thing.

[02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:29.630]
He was speaking yesterday and you watched that marketer...

[02:53:30.450 --> 02:53:31.890]
It was incredible.

[02:53:32.610 --> 02:53:37.070]
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress yesterday that depressing effects on the American economy

[02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:40.330]
still linger from the terror attacks on the stock market's steep plunge.

[02:53:40.770 --> 02:53:44.770]
But Greenspan rejected Democrats' suggestions that President Bush's future attacks had to be deferred

[02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:46.470]
because of the return to federal deficits.

[02:53:47.070 --> 02:53:51.090]
Economic fallout from the terrorist attacks on the huge drop in stock prices is still being felt

[02:53:51.090 --> 02:53:54.070]
as the economy tries to make a full recovery from last year's recession.

[02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:58.730]
Greenspan told the House Budget Committee as stocks were in a freefall while his lips moved.

[02:53:58.730 --> 02:54:01.850]
Today's economy appears to have stood the set of blows well,

[02:54:02.050 --> 02:54:04.750]
although the depressing effects still linger and continue to influence

[02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:07.130]
and particularly the federal budget outlook he said.

[02:54:07.470 --> 02:54:10.090]
For the federal budget, the outlook has moved from black to red ink,

[02:54:10.450 --> 02:54:15.190]
projections of a decade of surplus into $5.6 trillion have been replaced with estimates

[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:17.970]
of a return to sizable deficits over the next several years.

[02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:25.290]
And the dog clearly alerted in the opinion of his handler at the case where he gets false profits.

[02:54:25.290 --> 02:54:26.350]
Now it has been designated.

[02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:27.770]
And it won't be like a fallout this year.

[02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:31.070]
We've deleted the false positives we've deleted while we may be from residents

[02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:32.850]
and you can't see it like that.

[02:54:33.350 --> 02:54:34.290]
And the manuals are clear.

[02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:35.530]
You didn't have to find that.

[02:54:35.850 --> 02:54:36.770]
I'm not a bomb technician.

[02:54:37.330 --> 02:54:39.010]
I sent either one of those issues.

[02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:39.810]
Now let me ask you this.

[02:54:39.930 --> 02:54:41.690]
Is 46, 7 or 10 like I'm sure?

[02:54:41.810 --> 02:54:44.650]
Because it's a new hour anyways, like the general news time for some of them.

[02:54:45.210 --> 02:54:46.410]
Are they on top of this thing?

[02:54:46.570 --> 02:54:47.870]
Because maybe we'll get further up there.

[02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:50.270]
Because they seem to be hell-bent on CNN and put on it.

[02:54:50.370 --> 02:54:52.750]
And just hanging out there on the alley and talking to the same people,

[02:54:52.750 --> 02:54:55.610]
this piccolo guy over and over and over again.

[02:54:55.970 --> 02:54:58.610]
And the other one car ran through the tool booths without paying the tool,

[02:54:58.690 --> 02:54:59.370]
which was really brilliant.

[02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:00.770]
And it said them and so on.

[02:55:00.850 --> 02:55:01.970]
All these things we already know about.

[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:03.150]
Is there anything on the other channels?

[02:55:03.310 --> 02:55:04.170]
Well, the time channel four.

[02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:04.890]
Yeah.

[02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.870]
I don't have channel seven.

[02:55:06.990 --> 02:55:07.950]
Why do you keep saying that?

[02:55:08.050 --> 02:55:09.250]
How come channel seven not here?

[02:55:10.090 --> 02:55:10.450]
No.

[02:55:11.070 --> 02:55:11.810]
It's not on the truck.

[02:55:11.810 --> 02:55:12.710]
Are there anything on seven?

[02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:14.150]
Seven is the same thing.

[02:55:14.330 --> 02:55:17.210]
They're showing a picture of the two cars with the cute little robot,

[02:55:17.210 --> 02:55:18.590]
you know, picking around in there.

[02:55:18.690 --> 02:55:19.930]
It is a cute little robot.

[02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:22.950]
But even a robot turned tail a little while ago and said,

[02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:24.290]
hey enough of this crap, I'm getting down to here.

[02:55:24.450 --> 02:55:25.590]
Even a robot's getting fed up.

[02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:27.130]
Because they're not finding much of anything.

[02:55:27.490 --> 02:55:28.930]
But they did find the Islamic writing.

[02:55:29.070 --> 02:55:31.050]
But of course, it really shouldn't be too surprising.

[02:55:31.050 --> 02:55:33.070]
If one guy is from Iran, one guy is from Iraq,

[02:55:33.250 --> 02:55:33.970]
and the other from Pakistan.

[02:55:34.350 --> 02:55:36.750]
The fact they found papers with Arabic writing in the cars,

[02:55:36.890 --> 02:55:38.350]
I don't think it's like a major revelation.

[02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:39.190]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:55:41.130 --> 02:55:44.370]
In other words, if the three guys were Chinese and they found Chinese writing,

[02:55:44.530 --> 02:55:46.210]
it probably wouldn't be a big surprise.

[02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:48.070]
But nevertheless, they're going, blah, blah, blah.

[02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:50.830]
I like to find out more about the Delta flight where it was coming from,

[02:55:50.970 --> 02:55:52.850]
why it was divergent, where it went to.

[02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:54.350]
That's what I like to find out more about.

[02:55:54.470 --> 02:55:56.110]
But we'll have to wait until they're going to be ready to tell us.

[02:55:56.530 --> 02:55:57.770]
And as soon as they do, we'll tell you.

[02:55:58.550 --> 02:56:00.310]
Murder charge in Timberlake fan depth.

[02:56:00.490 --> 02:56:01.970]
This is a grotesque story we had the day.

[02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:03.770]
They're George's trying to make fun of, by the way.

[02:56:04.050 --> 02:56:04.790]
A couple of days ago.

[02:56:05.250 --> 02:56:06.050]
Yeah, that was crazy.

[02:56:06.330 --> 02:56:07.270]
That was terrible, George.

[02:56:08.050 --> 02:56:09.930]
A motorist has been sure, that's probably why he got sick,

[02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:11.270]
because God was punishing him.

[02:56:11.350 --> 02:56:12.090]
Oh, God.

[02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:15.090]
A motorist has been charged with murder for allegedly hitting a woman

[02:56:15.090 --> 02:56:16.870]
who was waiting outside a radio station.

[02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:19.570]
The group of fans to see pop star Justin Tinkerbell.

[02:56:20.390 --> 02:56:21.690]
Cameron Albert Dutie.

[02:56:22.010 --> 02:56:25.470]
21 was charged Wednesday with one kind of murdering Ann White, 21.

[02:56:25.850 --> 02:56:28.850]
He remained jailed on a million dollars bail pending a September 26th

[02:56:28.850 --> 02:56:30.210]
of Raymond in Superior Court.

[02:56:31.350 --> 02:56:34.630]
I think his punishment they should like make him sleep with Justin Tinkerbell

[02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:36.170]
for a few weeks, and then fries ass.

[02:56:37.330 --> 02:56:40.510]
White was standing on the sidewalk outside the studios of Kiss FM

[02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:41.930]
in neighboring Burbank, Monday night.

[02:56:42.170 --> 02:56:45.310]
When a pickup backed up and hit her, the woman was pinned out of the truck

[02:56:45.310 --> 02:56:47.970]
which then went forward and dragged her about a block police said,

[02:56:48.350 --> 02:56:50.210]
Dutie was stopped about a block away by police.

[02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:53.850]
Police said Dutie didn't know the woman apparently did not attend the hitter, right?

[02:56:54.310 --> 02:56:55.930]
Not like backing up into a crowd.

[02:56:56.270 --> 02:56:59.390]
The radio station was hosting a special late night interview with Tinkerbell.

[02:56:59.730 --> 02:57:02.350]
The instinct, singer, is promoting his upcoming solo album.

[02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:04.710]
Aren't you going to go out and buy that right away?

[02:57:05.250 --> 02:57:05.990]
I'm leaving right now.

[02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:09.130]
Yeah, if you're leaving right now, it's not because of the album,

[02:57:09.370 --> 02:57:10.150]
because you're getting panicky.

[02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:11.730]
Don't get panicky now, okay?

[02:57:11.730 --> 02:57:12.830]
What is this?

[02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.970]
Yeah.

[02:57:13.970 --> 02:57:16.510]
What is this invoice you just sent me?

[02:57:17.070 --> 02:57:17.470]
An invoice?

[02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:20.350]
Outlet store purchase order.

[02:57:20.650 --> 02:57:21.330]
Or you know something?

[02:57:22.270 --> 02:57:23.670]
This is an ad.

[02:57:24.350 --> 02:57:25.230]
Can you believe this?

[02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:28.750]
This is the first time this has happened on my fax up here.

[02:57:29.130 --> 02:57:31.750]
Here's an ad, like you get them at home on your fax all the time.

[02:57:31.850 --> 02:57:32.890]
I don't know if you do, but I sure do.

[02:57:33.530 --> 02:57:33.950]
Yeah, sure.

[02:57:35.150 --> 02:57:38.890]
Outlet store purchase order from some joyed in British clients, Surrey BC.

[02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:40.910]
Well, stick that up your ass, baby.

[02:57:41.070 --> 02:57:41.950]
Purchase this, you idiot.

[02:57:42.250 --> 02:57:44.410]
How do you like that in the middle of this important radio show?

[02:57:44.730 --> 02:57:48.190]
And I hear the fax machine puking over here, and I assume maybe it's something very urgent

[02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:51.170]
or important or not as the case may be, but at least like to have the chance.

[02:57:51.450 --> 02:57:52.150]
And it's an ad.

[02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:55.050]
Jesus, Kate Christ.

[02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:58.090]
Powder and Ohio Tower from nail gun.

[02:57:59.150 --> 02:58:01.190]
This is another bit of nervousness they had the other day.

[02:58:01.250 --> 02:58:04.050]
Well, the substance that was sniffed by bomb detecting dogs,

[02:58:04.310 --> 02:58:06.350]
leading to the evacuation of a state office tower,

[02:58:06.350 --> 02:58:09.030]
was a powder used in nail guns, police said, yesterday.

[02:58:10.250 --> 02:58:13.150]
No nail gun was found in the van where the two dogs detected the powder,

[02:58:13.310 --> 02:58:16.810]
but the company that owns the vehicle often uses 22 caliber nail guns,

[02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:19.370]
with cartridges containing smokeless nitrate powder,

[02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:21.190]
state trooper, Lieutenant Gary Lewis said.

[02:58:22.210 --> 02:58:25.410]
The search into our evacuation of the 41st Surrey James A. Road State Office,

[02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:29.150]
tower, which houses about 4,000 people, came on a first anniversary of the 9-11 attacks.

[02:58:29.470 --> 02:58:32.870]
The evacuation was ordered after a worker said the van's driver told her,

[02:58:32.970 --> 02:58:34.010]
I'm here to hide a bomb.

[02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:35.510]
Oh, God.

[02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:38.590]
Where's the governor?

[02:58:39.530 --> 02:58:40.630]
Such as he is.

[02:58:41.290 --> 02:58:43.210]
That nation devices are mean like that in the car.

[02:58:43.930 --> 02:58:49.950]
But in this time of heightened vigilance, I think that it is important to show that this system works.

[02:58:50.310 --> 02:58:54.310]
And I'm very proud of law enforcement officers across the state that found it very well.

[02:58:54.430 --> 02:58:54.590]
Great.

[02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:57.890]
And the citizen in Georgia deserves high praise as well.

[02:58:58.370 --> 02:58:59.470]
You're just a stone.

[02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.650]
She's the best.

[02:59:01.570 --> 02:59:02.870]
That's the initial problem.

[02:59:03.070 --> 02:59:04.650]
It's still ongoing investigation.

[02:59:04.830 --> 02:59:05.550]
Yeah, we know that, Chip.

[02:59:05.710 --> 02:59:07.410]
Like we expected, what's he going to tell us?

[02:59:07.470 --> 02:59:08.750]
Nothing. That's what he's going to tell us.

[02:59:08.930 --> 02:59:10.470]
This guy's never been sawdust, man.

[02:59:10.870 --> 02:59:12.150]
All he knows is he's trying to...

[02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:14.450]
He's got in contact with his buddies in Dave County.

[02:59:14.770 --> 02:59:15.990]
Let us in! Let us in!

[02:59:16.110 --> 02:59:17.750]
And they're trying right now to help Janet out.

[02:59:18.050 --> 02:59:21.090]
We'll find her if we need 50,000 more dead people to vote.

[02:59:21.370 --> 02:59:24.490]
We'll find him because Janet's going to win by hook or most likely by crook.

[02:59:24.850 --> 02:59:26.610]
Because that's the way most elections in this state go.

[02:59:26.610 --> 02:59:29.890]
Find her local. This is my city.

[02:59:30.330 --> 02:59:31.770]
The radio's all yours now.

[02:59:32.530 --> 02:59:33.490]
Kill him.

[02:59:35.370 --> 02:59:36.490]
Get push.

[02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.630]
Get the money.

[02:59:38.010 --> 02:59:41.790]
He tell present over 748 of the greatest songs of love.

[02:59:42.050 --> 02:59:44.750]
Especially for the lady in your life by Jerry Lewis.

[02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.470]
Ready.

[02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:49.990]
When I meet you, I find me.

[02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.630]

[02:59:50.670 --> 02:59:52.070]
Nobody loves dogs for your lady.

[02:59:52.290 --> 02:59:54.210]
All interpreted by the love might serve himself.

[02:59:54.210 --> 02:59:56.790]
And inimitable superstar entertainer Jerry Lewis.

[02:59:57.070 --> 02:59:59.050]
And you'll get your favorite ladies love songs.

[02:59:59.090 --> 03:00:02.530]
Ladies ladies ladies ladies ladies.

[03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:05.310]
Cross by six, seven, no fairs.

[03:00:05.310 --> 03:00:08.650]
It's an amazing company of up 748 love songs for your lady.

[03:00:08.830 --> 03:00:12.590]
All digitally remastered and all performed by the masterful superstar Jerry Lewis.

[03:00:13.050 --> 03:00:16.710]
I just scared everybody to join me on KTL Reckon.

[03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:20.270]
And we play a very special musical tribute to the lady.

[03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:22.530]
You'll get this Arrowsmith classic.

[03:00:24.470 --> 03:00:26.570]
And you'll look like a lady.

[03:00:27.770 --> 03:00:29.610]
And you'll look like a lady.

[03:00:29.630 --> 03:00:30.210]
It's Jerry.

[03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:33.970]
It's a little old lady with a pair of tweezers.

[03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:37.250]
And Helen, where do you think never sound it better?

[03:00:37.770 --> 03:00:40.910]
That ain't no way to treat a lady.

[03:00:41.310 --> 03:00:43.790]
No way to treat your lady.

[03:00:44.310 --> 03:00:45.330]
The woman.

[03:00:46.050 --> 03:00:49.870]
And listen to Jerry's amazing interpretation of his superhero hit from the King of Pop.

[03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:53.990]
You are the ladies with my wife today.

[03:00:54.730 --> 03:00:56.390]
The ladies with you.

[03:00:56.490 --> 03:01:00.370]
You are the ladies with a night in Jerry Lewis.

[03:01:00.730 --> 03:01:01.870]
I am a man.

[03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:04.430]
I'm a man in Jerry Lewis.

[03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:06.890]
That's 748 fabulous ladies on.

[03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:09.290]
I'm 35 CD's or 143 HD.

[03:01:09.930 --> 03:01:13.030]
All remixing glorious miles from the original cassette masters.

[03:01:13.450 --> 03:01:14.710]
And it's a collection you'll cherish.

[03:01:14.990 --> 03:01:17.610]
Your friends will love and your lady will never forget.

[03:01:17.610 --> 03:01:21.230]
It's all yours for 17 easy payments of only 32.95.

[03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:22.870]
And it's only from KTOT record.

[03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:26.390]
You can sell it KTOT.

[03:01:26.690 --> 03:01:27.150]
We go.

[03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:29.510]
341 votes on our poll.

[03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:32.530]
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world of the day?

[03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:34.090]
George W. Bush, 121.

[03:01:34.970 --> 03:01:36.210]
It seems to be pulling away again.

[03:01:36.990 --> 03:01:38.130]
Sodom who's saying 98.

[03:01:38.650 --> 03:01:39.970]
Osama Yamama 55.

[03:01:40.490 --> 03:01:41.330]
The Pope 35.

[03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:42.610]
Ariel sure owns 17.

[03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:44.970]
And yes, her Amphard is got 15.

[03:01:44.970 --> 03:01:48.110]
He's starting to move up on Ariel and he's probably uncomfortable about it.

[03:01:48.210 --> 03:01:49.510]
It was almost amusing.

[03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:50.970]
You don't want nobody to laugh or cry.

[03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:54.270]
Were you listening to any of the audio from the question answered deal?

[03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:57.170]
A little impromptu press conference with Governor Jebster?

[03:01:57.530 --> 03:01:57.670]
No.

[03:01:58.090 --> 03:02:00.890]
And one of the Goopal reporters who was almost in the state of hysteria.

[03:02:01.170 --> 03:02:02.650]
Governor, what do you want to tell the people at home?

[03:02:02.650 --> 03:02:04.370]
You want to tell them to calm down and just relax?

[03:02:05.010 --> 03:02:06.470]
I mean, it's time like the year was going to have a stroke.

[03:02:07.350 --> 03:02:09.470]
So everybody out there just calm down.

[03:02:09.930 --> 03:02:11.090]
Okay, don't get all bent out of shape.

[03:02:11.130 --> 03:02:11.590]
Be afraid.

[03:02:12.310 --> 03:02:13.050]
Be very afraid.

[03:02:13.050 --> 03:02:15.450]
Yeah, beside that just calm down.

[03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:17.150]
What an idiot this guy was.

[03:02:17.250 --> 03:02:17.770]
Just relax.

[03:02:18.130 --> 03:02:21.550]
Okay, I mean, if the world's going to end, believe me, we'll be the first ones to know it.

[03:02:22.750 --> 03:02:24.910]
E-mails allegedly tell more about shoe bomb mission.

[03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:28.010]
Court documents alleged that accused shoe bomber Richard Reed.

[03:02:28.090 --> 03:02:28.470]
Remember him?

[03:02:29.370 --> 03:02:29.470]
Yep.

[03:02:29.970 --> 03:02:30.730]
Lovely looking guy.

[03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:36.310]
Used an email account to plot with an unknown associate and compose a will just to find his mission

[03:02:36.310 --> 03:02:38.350]
in the days before he tried to blow up a jet over the Atlantic.

[03:02:38.350 --> 03:02:40.930]
The email establishes and reads own words.

[03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:45.870]
His expectation that he'll die doing is part of the ongoing war between Islam and disbelief,

[03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:49.150]
prosecutors say, and a brief file late Wednesday in US District Court.

[03:02:49.770 --> 03:02:52.770]
The filing quoted from the emails as they appeared, including misspellings.

[03:02:53.270 --> 03:02:59.030]
The motion in support of the using the emails as evidence and Reed's trial also included portions of two FBI interviews.

[03:02:59.110 --> 03:03:04.130]
In those interviews, Reed told agency picked US target because of military action against the Taliban and Afghanistan

[03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:05.850]
and Israeli treatment of Palestinians.

[03:03:06.410 --> 03:03:08.030]
America is the problem without America.

[03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:09.410]
There would be no Israeli tool agents.

[03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:12.370]
After he was arrested at the Logan International Airport on December 22.

[03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:18.330]
Reed 29 is scheduled to go on trial November 4 on charges that include attempted murder, attempted destruction of an aircraft,

[03:03:18.570 --> 03:03:20.090]
and interfering with the flight crew.

[03:03:20.810 --> 03:03:27.190]
Reed, a British citizen allegedly tried to set off set fire to West Nicarious on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami.

[03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:33.890]
Airby, peace of craft, story, everything, depressing, everything, morbid, everything, negative, everything embarrassing.

[03:03:34.250 --> 03:03:35.870]
It all comes back to San Florida.

[03:03:36.730 --> 03:03:41.250]
As we know, he was subdued by passengers and flight attendants, taken into custody when the jet was rerouted to Boston,

[03:03:41.610 --> 03:03:42.790]
and of course they took away his matches.

[03:03:44.870 --> 03:03:47.250]
Memo warned priests against meeting kids.

[03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:49.130]
This is in the St. Pete Times today.

[03:03:50.470 --> 03:03:56.150]
In a 1994 memo, while the Vice-East of St. Peter'sburg recently reassured Catholics that it knew of no prior allegations

[03:03:56.150 --> 03:04:02.150]
of sexual misconduct by priests charged in May with sexually abusing boys, but there's always a butt in these stories.

[03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:08.670]
In 1994, the Vice-East discovered the Reverend Robert L. Schaufel had met alone with children and areas where they weren't allowed.

[03:04:09.690 --> 03:04:16.710]
In a November 21, 1994 memo, one of Schaufel's supervisors worried about bringing children to a church rectumry and his room without other adults present.

[03:04:17.090 --> 03:04:21.970]
The memo was released yesterday by panelists and prosecutors after a public records request by the St. Pete Times.

[03:04:21.970 --> 03:04:29.710]
At the same time, Schaufel 54 was assigned to Holy Cross Church in St. Peter'sburg where he served for 10 years ending in July 2001.

[03:04:30.090 --> 03:04:32.390]
His supervisor, my senior John Neff, told him in the memo,

[03:04:32.390 --> 03:04:40.490]
I'm confident that you did nothing more or illegal, but that this action was very important and potentially dangerous for your reputation that of the other priests in the rectumry and all of us.

[03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:47.610]
Officials of the DICC, young priests, have a seminary school race concerns with them after seeing Schaufel bring children to his rectumry.

[03:04:49.850 --> 03:04:51.710]
Maybe it was served in Schufel, I'd buy you.

[03:04:51.770 --> 03:04:53.790]
Thanks so many little piece. Can't hurt.

[03:04:54.570 --> 03:04:59.590]
Two-faced charges in plain diversion, besides the thing in Ohio, this was the other event that took place on Wednesday,

[03:04:59.590 --> 03:05:01.890]
that everybody was like kind of peeing their pants about.

[03:05:02.470 --> 03:05:09.230]
Two airline passengers appeared before a federal magistrate yesterday on charges they interfered with crew members on a flight that was diverted to Fort Smith, Arkansas.

[03:05:09.890 --> 03:05:12.790]
The men around suspicions on Northwest Airlines flight because they ignored,

[03:05:13.290 --> 03:05:20.810]
because one ignored a flight attendant's request to leave a restroom and is traveling companion later insisted on using the same restroom according to an affidavit filed with a complaint.

[03:05:21.790 --> 03:05:25.130]
I remember the story we had the other day said that there were like three of them jammed in there at the same time,

[03:05:25.130 --> 03:05:28.050]
which how do you get three people in the same toilet on a plane?

[03:05:28.270 --> 03:05:28.630]
It's impossible.

[03:05:29.090 --> 03:05:34.210]
I mean maybe three timmies or three Irvey Villesheys possibly, if one of them is standing up on the toilet.

[03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:38.870]
The pilot of the Vegas-bound flight landed in Western Arkansas where the men were detained Wednesday,

[03:05:39.010 --> 03:05:42.930]
flight was from Memphis, Tennessee. Authorities initially said the men were of Middle Eastern descent.

[03:05:43.250 --> 03:05:49.590]
US attorney Tom Gehne said yesterday the men were of Indian descent, one of them a US citizen who were headed to Las Vegas for vacation.

[03:05:50.290 --> 03:05:54.190]
The prosecutor said he could find no ties among the men to any terrorist organization.

[03:05:54.190 --> 03:05:59.410]
The federal magistrate said another hearing next week for the two men grew a deep wander, 48 of Pennsylvania,

[03:05:59.690 --> 03:06:02.790]
and her render sing, 41, maybe no captains sing of Jersey.

[03:06:03.290 --> 03:06:06.050]
They made no statement in court except to answer questions that were returned to jail.

[03:06:06.450 --> 03:06:09.530]
They were appointed attorneys. Two other passengers initially detained were released.

[03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:14.910]
In the affidavit flight attendant Deborah Summers said wander went to the restroom shortly after takeoff.

[03:06:15.210 --> 03:06:18.710]
She went to check on him. Wonder had her shirt off and was shaving with a disposable razor.

[03:06:19.150 --> 03:06:21.370]
She said he ignored four requests to return to with Seat.

[03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:26.790]
Summers said she became a lombard and sing wanted to use the same restroom and she told him it wasn't working the affidavit set.

[03:06:26.930 --> 03:06:33.330]
The flight attendant said she was concerned because she had been trained at an explosive device could be assembled from components carried by separate individuals.

[03:06:33.490 --> 03:06:39.170]
Nice go on sweetheart. Nice go on. Send him back to Bombay or somewhere. Send the Sri Lanka that will teach him.

[03:06:40.390 --> 03:06:43.910]
So evidently they run in a spot now on CNN so we can all take a breath and calm down you think?

[03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:46.770]
We can really cook.

[03:06:46.770 --> 03:06:51.850]
Well no because when I go to a commercial break you know obviously there's not like breaking and impending it.

[03:06:51.930 --> 03:06:53.250]
Yeah if you know what I'm talking about.

[03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:59.610]
We are sports radio feisty UAM.

[03:07:01.530 --> 03:07:03.810]
Friday you first good.

[03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:07.630]
This is former vice president of the United States Al Gore.

[03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:14.910]
I have recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion to take pot shots at the president.

[03:07:14.910 --> 03:07:27.010]
I have reappeared much like pucks the tawny fill the groundhog creature that reappears each year to determine whether or not we'll have an early spring.

[03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:36.970]
I wish it to be known but it was I who was responsible for saving the lives of those nine miners in Pennsylvania over the weekend.

[03:07:37.970 --> 03:07:43.350]
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it as not to appear a spotlight hog.

[03:07:44.130 --> 03:07:48.310]
However I feel the American people have a right to know the truth.

[03:07:49.210 --> 03:07:56.510]
Here's what happened. Upon hearing of this unfortunate accident I will race to the scene.

[03:07:57.550 --> 03:08:03.530]
I lowered myself into the mine using an old Ron Popeo pocket fisherman and some bailing wire.

[03:08:04.530 --> 03:08:08.310]
Down down down into the depths of darkness I think.

[03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:14.110]
Never thinking of my own safety but rather of the safety of those men on the ground.

[03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:20.990]
When I reached the miners they said to me hey you're the guy that invented the internet right?

[03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.710]
I said yes.

[03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:32.050]
We all had a Mike's hard lemonade which I brought with me down into the hole and then we sat around and reenacted the fart scene from blazing saddles.

[03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:34.290]
How about you should know the truth.

[03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:43.490]
Now much like the groundhog creature pucks the tawny filth I'll flink back into the darkness of oblivion until I am needed again.

[03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:45.270]
This is Al Gore.

[03:08:46.050 --> 03:08:46.830]
Flipper hero.

[03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:49.250]
You know I don't think it was unistone at all I think it was Al.

[03:08:49.450 --> 03:08:54.010]
It was probably Al Gore over her those three scumbags because he probably you'd find him in shoneys.

[03:08:54.470 --> 03:08:58.530]
From 56 at 560 W.com we got the mad dog at one Hank's gonna be longer three.

[03:08:59.390 --> 03:09:01.210]
530 is the day of want to set you with Hank.

[03:09:01.570 --> 03:09:04.370]
Marlins on deck 630 is that season just refuses to win.

[03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:05.810]
Marlins in the brave 705.

[03:09:06.170 --> 03:09:08.570]
Edike after baseball and ESPN radio.

[03:09:09.230 --> 03:09:10.350]
Oh are we desperate overnight.

[03:09:10.510 --> 03:09:15.130]
Okay here's the recap honest or in case you were asleep in case you're just wondering let's summarize the whole thing.

[03:09:15.430 --> 03:09:16.410]
Which I think that's a great idea.

[03:09:17.270 --> 03:09:18.030]
Yeah what's going on.

[03:09:19.130 --> 03:09:25.310]
Official shut down to 21 mile section of alligator alley and detained three men and two vehicles early today after an alert about ledge plans to stay

[03:09:25.310 --> 03:09:27.110]
a terrorist attack in South Florida.

[03:09:27.650 --> 03:09:34.490]
Farm sniffing dogs ordered authorities to material in both vehicles but no explosives were immediately found said EJ piccolo of the FDLE.

[03:09:35.230 --> 03:09:40.810]
Explosive charges were used to blast open order to be a backpack taken from one of the vehicles at mile marker 92 near Naples.

[03:09:41.290 --> 03:09:42.870]
No explosives were found in the bag.

[03:09:43.250 --> 03:09:46.750]
The information we have is very specific piccolo said whatever that means.

[03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:52.390]
He said the three people in the two vehicles both with Illinois license plates had not been arrested but were being detained.

[03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:53.490]
They're not suspects.

[03:09:54.150 --> 03:10:04.370]
Bomb experts continue to conduct a careful search of the vehicles that was being broadcast live by CBS for another TV stations and 12 PM officials said one of the two vehicles have been declared clean of any explosives.

[03:10:04.810 --> 03:10:09.330]
This is from the Sun Sentinel website so naturally they're promoting CBS for because that's their partner in crime.

[03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:20.210]
The two bomb squad technicians in hoods and protective blast suits removed the suitcase and plastic bags from one car and searched the interior and trucker robot was also brought in to videotape the car and the atoms in the truck.

[03:10:20.210 --> 03:10:22.710]
The robot was also used to unload some of the atoms in the trunk.

[03:10:24.050 --> 03:10:27.190]
CBS for later tentatively identified the three men as medical students.

[03:10:27.470 --> 03:10:29.430]
They're from Jordan, Pakistan and Iran.

[03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:31.070]
All three are in the country legally.

[03:10:31.310 --> 03:10:33.230]
Two of them are naturalized the TV station be saying.

[03:10:33.610 --> 03:10:38.350]
Also CBS for reported some of the items in the backpack that was exploded were believed to be medical related.

[03:10:39.050 --> 03:10:43.470]
One of the two cars stopped at Black Honda registered to a man in Hanover Park in Illinois, some of them were Chicago.

[03:10:43.470 --> 03:10:50.510]
US law enforcement authorities have been on a heightened alert since Tuesday when the outside identified a high risk of terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9-11.

[03:10:50.810 --> 03:10:53.770]
Early to yesterday, that's wrong.

[03:10:53.950 --> 03:10:57.590]
Oh, that's wrong. It says early Thursday. It was early Friday because it was 1 o'clock this morning.

[03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:59.210]
There is a mistake in the Sun Sentinel.

[03:11:00.430 --> 03:11:01.970]
And probably CBS for too.

[03:11:02.310 --> 03:11:05.750]
Early this morning the FHP shut down a 20-mile stretch of I-75.

[03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:08.410]
Shortly after one of the vehicles were stopped in Karnier County.

[03:11:08.410 --> 03:11:09.970]
It was still almost 12 hours later.

[03:11:10.350 --> 03:11:14.390]
The highway patrol said the road was blocked off from a tool moved east of Naples to state road 29.

[03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:20.150]
A spokesman for the FAA Southern District said some flight restrictions have been imposed over the scene.

[03:11:20.530 --> 03:11:24.830]
There's a temporary flight restriction in place that they request a Carter County Sheriff's Department.

[03:11:25.230 --> 03:11:29.770]
And that is within a three-nautical mile radius of the location in question and below 3,000 feet.

[03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:34.330]
The restriction meant only law enforcement or a criminal in the direction of the Sheriff's Department could fly in the area.

[03:11:34.330 --> 03:11:39.070]
One of the cars stopped to pay the dollar tool County Sheriff Don Hunter said the second did not.

[03:11:39.330 --> 03:11:42.190]
Now why did they keep saying the tool is a dollar? Am I wrong about that?

[03:11:43.410 --> 03:11:49.190]
It used to be a buck when you staffed to pay at both ends but now when you're coming back you don't have to pay the tool when you come east.

[03:11:50.510 --> 03:11:55.110]
You only pay it. Right? You only pay it. I don't know why. I think it's like a buck at a half or two, but whatever it is.

[03:11:55.230 --> 03:11:59.730]
I couldn't be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time in my life. And it's only nitpicking but I just don't understand why they keep saying that.

[03:12:01.410 --> 03:12:07.710]
Anyway, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had issued an advisory for the cars late yesterday after a woman and her husband stopped either to show

[03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:10.950]
these restaurant in Calhoun County in Georgia and the Northwest from part of that state.

[03:12:11.270 --> 03:12:17.130]
Eunice Stone told police she overheard them at three men in Middle Eastern descent discussing terrorist plans in English and Arabic last night.

[03:12:17.650 --> 03:12:23.590]
Wednesday night the Georgia woman said the men were talking about amounts of explosives and war in the Americans would cry on 913.

[03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:28.430]
She said the men talked in normal levels of the table next to them and listened to a lattice-like structure.

[03:12:28.690 --> 03:12:33.130]
She said she heard them laugh about Americans morning 911 and said she heard other alarming comments including,

[03:12:33.410 --> 03:12:38.130]
well if they're morning 911 what are they going to do about 913? She asked.

[03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:46.270]
So just calm down, relax. Mark Potter, CNN, CBS News Board, the Sun Central, everybody's got it under control and I'm sure the mad dog will scream it all out for you.

[03:12:46.310 --> 03:12:47.170]
Bye bye bye!

[03:12:47.170 --> 03:12:52.010]
The Georgia Show on 5-6-9-2-A-S, Miami for Margarita.

[03:12:52.210 --> 03:12:53.450]
Only in the banana rip-
