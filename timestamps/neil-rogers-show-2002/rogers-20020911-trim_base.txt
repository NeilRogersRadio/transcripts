[00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.860]
Even most of the intelligence leading to the yesterday's press conference came from European

[00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.040]
police departments or from L. Cater members apprehended abroad and a draft United Nations

[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.760]
report recently found little evidence that US efforts to hold L. Cater financing have

[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.580]
had much impact.

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.140]
And with the courts, the S. Croft Justice Department's credibility is even lower than with the

[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.460]
public.

[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.740]
Consider the top secret foreign intelligence surveillance court not exactly a hotbed of

[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.800]
liberal sentimentality.

[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.680]
Meeting in a guarded locked room on the highest floor of the Justice Department, this is

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.440]
the court which in 25 years has never met a wiretap it didn't like.

[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.940]
Its judges routinely consider the most sensitive national security questions and have signed

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.540]
off on over 10,000 warrants.

[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.540]
So when a secret court publicly kicked John Ascroft and the teeth of the decision reached

[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.960]
last month, it was clear that something was going on.

[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.240]
The court was set up in the aftermath of Watergate and the revelations of FBI abuses in

[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.180]
the 60s and 70s to make sure that the kind of raw intelligence needed for foreign intelligence

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.680]
would not be abused in criminal investigations or politics.

[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.440]
In fact, the court has not once rejected a national security wiretap application and

[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.440]
has cased by case a prosecutor's.

[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.460]
But when the Bush administration asserted that the US-A Patriot Act allows a wholesale

[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.700]
bluring of the line with criminal investigators directing national security investigations,

[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.080]
the judges went ballistic revealing 75 recent cases in which FBI agents misled the court

[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.540]
a troubling number of inaccurate FBI of the affidavits and repeated violations of the

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.060]
court's orders.

[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.880]
The judges point, Ascroft and the FBI are not to be trusted with new power when they've

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.240]
abused the power they already had.

[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.160]
Finally, the court concluded the post-USA Patriot policies proposed by Bush are not reasonably

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.900]
designed to protect the privacy of law-biting citizens.

[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.820]
Ascroft's spokeswoman Barbara Comstock made much of the fact that these documented abuses

[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.940]
happen on Bill Clinton's watch, but that's precisely the judges point.

[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.700]
The abuse of power transcends particular administrations, so ready is the FBI to lie in order

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.460]
to distract the limits of legal surveillance that the court now refuses to accept testimony

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.860]
from the FBI agent in charge of monitoring Hamas.

[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.900]
Blonde is that reviewed by the surveillance court was it was a love letter compared to

[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100]
the reception of the administration's secret deportation hearings received just a few

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.900]
days later when another unanimous panel of federal judges, this and appeals court in Cincinnati,

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640]
slammed the Justice Department's secret deportation hearings.

[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440]
Democracies die behind closed doors, wrote Judge Damon Keith for the US Court of Appeals

[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.140]
for the Sixth Court.

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.360]
Last year, the INS began deportation hearings against Bobby Hadad, head of a Muslim charity

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.140]
whose assets were frozen after 9-11.

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.960]
Ascroft had asserted the unilateral rights to close it up to deportation hearings to

[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.780]
the press and public, and asserted challenge by Detroit newspapers and US representative

[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.240]
John Connyers of Michigan.

[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.200]
The ruling by the Sixth Circuit panel could not have been more on ambiguous with a judge's

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.520]
own sense of urgency and outrage clear from the speed with which the ruling was issued

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.740]
just three weeks after argument.

[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.140]
The executive branch seeks to uproot people's lives outside the public eye behind a closed

[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.660]
door wrote Judge Keith, who was appointed the public court by Democratic President Jimmy

[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.000]
Carter.

[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.880]
But when government begins closing doors, it selectively controls information that rightly

[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.280]
belongs to the people, selective information is misinformation, he said.

[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.400]
An even broader case on secret immigration proceedings is on the Docket League of this

[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.980]
month in Philadelphia, where a district judge had an all-immigration proceedings nationwide

[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.620]
open to the public in the absence of a good reason for secrecy.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.780]
What's going on is that Ascroft's entire post-attack legal strategy, a strategy built on broad

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.380]
domestic surveillance and a broader secrecy, is collapsing of its own extremity.

[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.380]
It's no exaggeration to say that the nation's federal judges, many of them appointed by

[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.400]
President Reagan and Bush One, are now an open-roving at the measures embraced by the

[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.540]
current Bush administration measures which these judges perceive as a naked power grab

[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.880]
by the executive branch.

[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.940]
Both the surveillance immigration rulings may clear that the Bush administration's

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.900]
post-911 policies are not just assaults on story-eyed civil libertarianism, they're

[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.040]
undermining public safety.

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.880]
It's hard to fight terrorism when judges can't believe the Justice Department of the FBI

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.820]
when police agencies can't develop trusting relations in the immigrant communities because

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.040]
a fear of deportation or secret charges.

[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.460]
It's hard to avoid the conclusion that far from being a wartime consuliary, Ascroft has

[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.820]
turned out to be a colossal failure even on the administration's own terms, leading the

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.680]
White House down a succession of blind alleys.

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.600]
Secret military tribunals, secret deportations and secret wire-type expansion have all

[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.300]
turned into highly publicized failures.

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.960]
Congress, which last fall rolled over for the USA PayTradect, is finally beginning to

[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.580]
ask questions.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.380]
The Proposed Home Line Security Department is frozen in the U.S. Senate, and in the House

[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.880]
with Concent Congressman James Sensen, the conservative Law and Order Chair of the

[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.360]
House Judiciary Committee, says he is ready to start blowing a fuse over the administration's

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.480]
addiction to secrecy, and I'm session would restoring the imperial executive.

[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.040]
There is ample evidence that Ascroft has lost his White House support.

[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.560]
Recent news reports promoting the anti-terrorism labor of solicitor General Ted Olson suggests

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.260]
the stage is already being set for a successor.

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.280]
Religious conservatives want Ascroft's effective clack, now bridled his plans to let the FBI

[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.320]
spy on religious communities and follow their financial trails.

[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.560]
Politically Ascroft is a man without a country, a liability of the Bush administration,

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.220]
an irration to Congress, and an embarrassment to the conservative constituency which sponsored

[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.440]
them.

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.780]
It's clear that in the weeks and months after 9-11 Ascroft and the Bush administration

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.040]
repeatedly misread the tolerance of today's courts and public, in the same New York

[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.220]
talk in which she prophesied new restrictions, Justice O'Connor, the conservative Reagan

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.460]
appointee, issued a pointed warning, unheeded at the time, of the need to maintain a fair

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.060]
and just society, with a strong rule of law at the time when many more are concerned with

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.240]
safety and a measure of vengeance.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.000]
A year after Al Qaeda's attacks, the honeymoon with Ascroft's vision of security is over.

[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.520]
Right, SprooShaparro on Salon.com.

This is 5.50.

The radio is all yours now.

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.540]
Q and M.

[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.540]
Good Catholic for 15 minutes.

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.140]
Is that so much to ask?

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.440]
Are you looking for a new career?

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.540]
Uh huh.

[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.740]
Do you like D-Dream?

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.040]
Huh?

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.740]
Are you able to maintain consciousness through hours of mundane work?

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.580]
Then get ready for an exciting career in airport security.

[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.380]
Due to recent events airport security people are in demand like never before.

[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.840]
And until the federal government takes over we're looking for special people like you

[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.480]
to make our country feel safe.

[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.360]

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.920]
right away and it just under $6 an hour.

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.280]
After 20 minutes of intense training you'll be diligently watching the scanning machine

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.360]
and you don't even have to know what you're looking for.

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.480]
Hey, it's like watching television but there's only one channel so I don't have to decide.

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.380]
Great.

[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.820]
And if you last on the job for more than two weeks you'll get a cool wand to wait for people's

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.100]
bodies.

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.080]
Cool.

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.080]
It's like the lightsaber from Star Wars.

[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.520]
New car, air of your father.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.400]
That's so-

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.140]
Why wait?

[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.760]
Join the world of airport security today.

[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.800]
Like me.

[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.220]
Dude, that was scary.

[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.820]
10, 17 and 5, 60 WQ and we proved that George is a little off his feet today.

[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.180]
You actually facts me from the squirgler.

[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:51.760]
Yeah.

[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.780]
He facts me that fact, huh?

[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.180]
Right.

[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.180]
The little squirgler, what do you think I read it?

[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.820]
It's about me.

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.560]
But I didn't read it.

[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:57.940]
Oh.

[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.140]
Did you rip me down?

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.000]
I don't care what it did.

[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.300]
I don't think I was always crap counting the facts.

[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.380]
Why do you read facts from nut cases, George?

[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.540]
You see you're still learning.

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.320]
Just like those calls you take when you do the show, I understand.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.740]
You know you're facing them out.

[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.700]
But you definitely, this is not something that needs to be phased out.

[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.740]
You just cut it out.

[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.600]
Just cut it out of your life.

[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:17.860]
All right.

[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.400]
When you see that writing, just your met cannon.

[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.020]
Consider the source.

[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.480]
Getting uptight and sensitive at your advanced stage.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.300]
I think you're a little sensitive.

[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.200]
I thought it was hysterical.

[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.620]
I don't think it's anything because I don't read those facts.

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.560]
It's from the squirgler.

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.800]
But anyway, George read it so keep in common.

[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.220]
I should be fired by the way.

[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.180]
I see there you go again.

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.500]
You're quoting the squirgler.

[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.680]
I'm a liar.

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.820]
You better be accountable for what you say on the air, Mr. like Mo.

[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.840]
He's accountable.

[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.060]
Anyway, here's the fact that says I was going to give this out and help people get off their ass and vote.

[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.500]
But with what happened yesterday, why even bother?

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.740]
It was going to give one out.

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.360]
I rather let my dad grandma, grandmother cast my vote if she hasn't already.

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.980]
Great show and George was great this summer.

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.580]
He should have his own show if he learns which fact is to read or not.

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.600]
Yeah, I think George in the morning would be good.

[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.500]
I think that would be sweet irony.

[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.660]
You know, long toilet stay triggers airplane security.

[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:10.920]
Sweet.

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.160]
Here's a good story.

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.680]
This is funny.

[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:13.840]
This is great.

[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.120]
A passenger, this is from Berlin.

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.240]
A passenger who spent a long time in an airplane toilet yesterday or today.

[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.520]
Today.

[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:20.580]

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.440]
Prompted a security alert and full search of the Lufthansa plane the airline said.

[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.400]
It was quite amusing.

[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.600]
Lufthansa spokesman Thomas Jack now said it was on the toilet for quite some time.

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920]
That was enough reason to alert the federal border police.

[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.800]
The man went to the toilet after the plane landed in Berlin's Tegel Airport from Frankfurt.

[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.660]
Tegel Airport is about the size of the room you're sitting in by the way.

[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:39.920]
Oh, okay.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.380]
His lengthy stay prompted the flight attendant to alert security officials.

[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.960]
He was in there a long time.

[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.200]
The border police detained the man once he had emerged and conducted a thorough search

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.940]
of the plane which didn't produce anything unusual.

[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.920]
Spokesman Lars Rebels said.

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.420]
Maybe just an unusual aroma.

[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.640]
Jack now said the incident only occurred because of a heightened security around the

[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.100]
University of 9-11 attacks in the US.

[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.400]
The neighborhood put people up a pitbull's nerves on edge.

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.260]
He said, thank God it turned out to be nothing.

[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.200]
Well, if he was in a long time, I hope it was more than just nothing.

[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.840]
That's not a good word about it.

[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.560]
Mind me, that story I told you about the guy in the plane on the KLM plane that time.

[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.200]
Right.

[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.620]
In business class kept getting up and he'd go in there for like 15 minutes and he'd come

[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.340]
out and sit in this chair seat and his head was wobbling around like he was a stone

[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.620]
or something.

[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.960]
And he'd go back in there again.

[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.640]
Now when he came out was he all sweaty.

[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.020]
I don't know.

[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.740]
I wasn't that close to him and I didn't want to smell him.

[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.480]
Okay, I don't know.

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.500]
What does that mean?

[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.160]
Oh, nothing.

[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.380]
Just sometimes if it's really strenuous, you beat up, you get sweat on your back.

[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.660]
Oh, maybe it was a drug thing.

[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.780]
You know, that could be too.

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.500]
I'll ask you a while.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.000]

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.880]
Maybe he was in there like doing stuff.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.360]
I don't know, maybe he was like in there doing himself.

[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.460]
I don't know what he was doing, but he was in there many times for a long time.

[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.860]
28 airport workers arrested in Houston.

[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.220]
Hi!

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.060]
I'm reloading my St. Pete Times website here.

[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.100]
By the way, I'm reloading that page.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.940]
And the blue lines are just sitting there.

[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.860]
It's lovely.

[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.660]
I don't expect anything.

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.540]
In fact, you know something.

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.460]
We're going to go through the whole show today and still out having new votes from

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.060]
Dade or I mean, what's going on in Dade and Broward?

[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.600]
You assholes.

[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.480]
David Leahy and Miriam OlaFant.

[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.720]
SikhaFant.

[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.140]
I'm a what those go 6526 sounds like a familiar number made the same number of

[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:14.400]
precinct.

[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.100]
We have less than 200 precincts yet to be counted.

[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.220]
All of which I believe are in Dade and Broward.

[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.460]
Maybe still at one in Palm Beach, but that's small potatoes.

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.480]
Dade and Broward, where Chris Janet was walloping McBride.

[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.640]
I would say 3 to 1.

[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.380]
Well, let's see.

[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.640]
Where do I have it written down?

[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.660]
Broward 64 to 28, which is like well over 2 to 1.

[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.620]
And Dade 69.4 to 21.6, which is more than 3 to 1.

[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.740]
So the fact that McBride's at by 19,000 some odd votes, it's going to be razor tight,

[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.840]
all depending on where those precincts are and how many votes there are containing.

[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.020]
Something, you know.

[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.140]
When you think we have at least an analization of that.

[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:51.600]
Something.

[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.860]
And I can actually go in there and get you the precinct numbers that remain.

[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.960]
But it doesn't mean anything to me.

[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.280]
We'd have to dig up Ed Cohen's body and bring him back.

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.660]
Well, Ed, what do you think?

[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.620]
Precinct 301.

[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:10.360]
I was with a great day as well, with those election night murder coverages.

[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.200]
Man, authorities arrested 28 workers that pushed in their cutting out of their report

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.960]
on charges of violating federal law and obtaining security badges.

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.900]
They said, we don't need no stinkin badges.

[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.660]
The US Attorney's Office announced.

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.100]
The 28 workers are among 143 airport workers

[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.200]
and that it on those charges in august in early september

[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.420]
a west were a west warrants have been issued for those not taking the custody on

[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.720]
monday the attorneys office said

[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.360]
ten of those arrested monday are charged with too-pollety council

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.700]
project news of a social security number and line to a federal agency

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.380]
they had applied for an obtained bluer gray airport security badges which

[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.900]
allow the word to access secure areas of the airport

[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.900]
including ramps gates the tarmac in around airplane

[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.100]
no what was it we had the story as to it whether that was my mean for a

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.900]
lot of the island uh... pomegranate

[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.400]
right after we were saying pomegranate was a lot of problems don't think

[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.360]
uh... we decided they do and of course we have that

[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.520]
pedophile priest in the del Rey Beach today

[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.400]
they got some serious problems there in pomegranate county

[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.780]
how's our own poll doing is the next amazing part of it with our low

[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.440]
technology

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.640]
and we still have a poor where the numbers actually change hundred and fifty

[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.300]
three votes

[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.760]
if the election for governor being held right now today this moment and you

[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.980]
can actually catch your vote which

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.400]
well good luck to you film a bright ninety five

[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.600]
jabbo is thirty two neither twenty six so still like about almost exactly three

[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.480]
to one in this crowd

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.900]
which looks pretty promising to me doesn't it

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.980]
because when we do the ones about like for president between the judge

[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.500]
george w and the goal in this one that one

[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.460]
uh... you know george we still have a few of the uh... w people out there

[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.440]
although maybe those people are with us today you think

[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.880]
maybe those people are watching wall-to-wall coverage of the ceremonies

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.980]
there you go let's get patriotic what do you say let's just do the show

[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.700]
see that's my deal let's just do the near-right right now

[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.900]
i know that's revolutionary

[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.840]
and i know we don't want to get just get sucked in and go along with the program

[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.160]
and do it everybody else you know this uh...

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160]
it's an orgy of a misery is what it is

[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.580]

that i said i'd have to read

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.340]
and then once i get done with i think that we can play bits of the show and

[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.040]
of course if they're in i'll keep checking believe me this is the one

[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.500]
place that there are any new results on the election you'll hear him right

[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:49.740]

because that's something we can give you that the not the same old craft

[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.860]
that everybody else is doing today which i'm just grossed out by

msnbc is desperate there was a and i still say even a lot of pat Buchanan's

[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.580]
very he's he's besides being a fascist and i'll not see pink he's not a

[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.740]

[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.980]
bill press it's uh... it's a far better show them when they were on crossbar

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.400]

filmic brides five ninety six four seventy two janitor you know five seventy

[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.440]
seven three to less than twenty thousand separate the two state wide

[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.140]
and all remaining precincts that have yet to be counted are still mysteriously

[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.160]
in my immediate and and there's still and i don't know what they're doing

[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.840]
maybe that's the site maybe somebody else has it

[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.220]
you think that's the only one i'm looking at okay

[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.400]
if you had any idea how many times i got during the middle of the night

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.900]
how long i i stayed up to lack of midnight

[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.300]
because i'm being not just to be conscientious but because i'm interested okay

[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.520]
i wanted to see about the gay rights thing which by the way the uh... the

[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.840]
christians lost what a shame although a lot closer than anybody predicted

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.360]
and that's because of the cuban vote the cuban hate vote

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.340]
might have gone might have gone it's a you they can't help it

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.780]

i shot the chauffeur yeah they said it was a suicide

[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.380]

[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.580]

[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.320]
well they're gonna go out there and hire Dennis Miller

[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:34.020]

camp then that's 34 to 5 60 W. Creme here's a bizarre fact it says it's and it'll

[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:04.340]
can i ask you a question sure what's wrong with young ron it says Neil is suds the same person

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:10.260]
is Ron brewer hey suds are you the same person as uh Ron brewer good ale oh no he's not the same

[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.900]
person as Ron brewer i take that i would take that as an insult if i were suds yeah and we don't

[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.940]
know what they're doing suds i guess is living off of pans in in income and probably watching a

[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.480]
lot of we runs a stard wreck and uh whatever else you like Gilligan x Island and the rick now what

[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.120]
did rick tell us uh he was gonna do he's hanging out he's got an office somewhere in like

[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.720]
rowered county and he was waiting to do the summer show but that didn't work out oh that's right

[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.580]
rick actually was calling around trying to get a hold of me and i didn't return his calls because

[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.340]
naturally that would have been like stabbing you in the back and since already one person did that

[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.980]
oh now you'll be getting another squiggly facts you probably got enough holes in the back even

[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.840]
Julia season ever had as many slits in the back as George's god how's Roger McElan doing by the

[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.900]
no i mean uh rick only was the inquiring because i had mentioned that that it was a possibility

[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.880]
because Greg hates you like poison i was looking to alternatives for uh you felling in

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.800]
and kind of and low and behold George did that magnificent job we did the poll a couple of days

[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.000]
ago the audience was ecstatic except for that one guy who's a major rassol i hate you like poison

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.200]
and voted four thousand times i checked the uh numbers again by the way for those who are waiting

[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.580]
on pins and needles about the election returns from date and nothing nothing 6526

[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.040]
that's the number of precincts that have encountered see i can look all over the place but

[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.720]
the bottom line is that the ones that are most updated it comes right from the state anyway so it really

[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.880]
doesn't make any difference so whether it's the sun sentinel or the saint p time the herald

[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:40.620]
forget about it anyway robert g kaiser writes the long and short of it the war on terrorism began so

[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.420]
well then the focus changed what is the bush administration aiming to do now he asks in a

[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.640]
Washington post this past Sunday he writes amid the hoopla surrounding the anniversary of 9-11

[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.080]
three questions c-map why did the bush administration veer off the course except for itself a

[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.740]
year ago when president bush promised to rally the world to fight a war against terrorism and

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.760]
did so magnificently but only for a while why has the administration now chosen and neglected

[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:08.720]
friends as it pursues its enemies or rather the enemy most easily targeted satan Hussein why is

[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.500]
the west voting with a new doctrine of preemptive war so radical that has no precedent in international

[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.260]
law or american history and why hasn't this flirtation provoked our politicians to gnawk

[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.980]
a serious national debate first of all congress we're still too close to these events to see them

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.880]
clearly but it's not too soon to see that the bush administration's initial surefootedness

[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.040]
has given way to a stumbling comesiness this has been a bad summer for american diplomacy it

[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.760]
isn't easy for the world's leaning power to alarm all of its allies in a matter of months but

[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:40.660]
this is what the u.s. has done for purposes that remain mysterious the administration has accomplished

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.280]
this despite a successful beginning of the military campaign set off by the attacks on

[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.760]
new york and washed in a year ago not only did the president rally allies and every kind of

[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.060]
joint and elaborate efficient international coalition but the russian president put in new

[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.040]
september 11 to finally abandon the pretense and russia and america could revive their cold war

[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.180]
rivalry he allied his for his country firmly with the u.s. then with an a to alliance two central

[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.900]
asian republics whose veckistan and kyrgyzstan former parts of the soviet union welcomed us

[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.520]
bases on their territory creating a new geopolitical reality no government on earth openly took the

[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.060]
side of al-Qaeda that first phase was triumphant the anxiety of last fall that somehow american

[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.740]
its allies would be stymied in afghanistan as the soviets were two decades earlier now seem silly

[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.300]
routing al-Qaeda and its protected the taliban regime in kubble proved remarkably easy

[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.980]
watching joyful afghans dancing in the streets was a joyful experience the first phase has cost

[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.320]
more than thirty billion dollars in fifty one american lives but the initial mission was accomplished

[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.840]
no more taliban no more safe haven for al-Qaeda but the campaign stalled in early december when

[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.740]
american commanders decided not to send u.s. troops into the mountains around tora bora and

[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.280]
osama been not in the skate at least that was the conclusion of american intelligence since then

[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.600]
the war hasn't gone very well key al-Qaeda leaders remain at large presumably including been

[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.020]
loud and though he may be dead whether without him our enemy can still operate a new u.n. study

[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.840]
concludes that al-Qaeda is by all accounts fit and well and poised to strike again at its leisure

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.200]
it is sobering to consider how much we still don't know about al-Qaeda to your men and investigators

[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.940]
have apparently established that the nine eleven plot was hatched in hamburg and a cell led by

[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.280]
hope mohammad at the pilot of one of the planes that the world trade center who was at the superior

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.980]
unknown who in al-Qaeda's hierarchy helped plan the attack or approved it unknown what was

[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.200]
been loud in this personal role unknown what did the pilots authors hope would be its result

[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.720]
what are their strategic goals if any unknown though been loud in this past comments suggest some

[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.080]
answers such as pushing the pushing the west out of Saudi Arabia he's pushing push in Saudi

[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.280]
Arabia like Jackie Bales know your enemy soldiers like to say but we still have a lot to learn

[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.220]
about al-Qaeda the u.s. government has repeatedly advertised its own ability to penetrate or

[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.960]
understand al-Qaeda by issuing any number of brightly colored lords orange alert today and warnings

[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.140]
that a new attack was imminent those wrong predictions suggest grave deficiencies in American

[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.020]
intelligence a subject are political figures of generally avoided multi-lateralism was critical

[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.380]
for the administration's early successes in the war on terrorism which makes it all the more

[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.880]
surprising that the Bush administration abandoned it so quickly beginning with a December

[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.960]
decision withdraw from the 1972 abm treaty a succession of policy choices revive the

[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.560]
administration's reputation for unilateralism and infuriated old allies why did this happen

[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.380]
the answer begins with the White House itself if we know remarkably the little about al-Qaeda we

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.760]
should also acknowledge ignorance about many of the inner workings of this administration this

[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.980]
is a secret of American government in eight months in office before 9-11 it took out a public

[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.260]
view a series of decisions that made allies wonder if it cared about their concerns one of those

[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.540]
shortly before 9-11 was to scuttle a long negotiated enforcement protocol of the international

[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.260]
convention on biological weapons ironically now a dead letter as the world gets increasingly

[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.380]
anti about biological weapons the abm treaty decision particularly upset the French and

[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.860]
Germans who consider the fact the foundation of nuclear arms control it was followed in January

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.380]
by Bush's announcement in his state of the union speech that Iran Iraq North Korea constituted

[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.500]
an axis of evil this infuriated Europeans trying to build bridges to Iran and South Koreans in

[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.680]
Japanese trying to work with North Korea the administration stuck by the term although it

[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.900]
would never explain how these three unconnected nations constitute an axis and alliance of two or

[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.120]
more countries to coordinate their foreign and military policies according to one dictionary

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.180]
definition but the most important decision that fit our allies anxiety about revive the American

[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.540]
unilateralism was last June's change of course on the Middle East for many years the US and its

[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.020]
allies have different on how to best achieve an Israeli Palestinian peace the US has long been more

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.760]
sympathetic to Israeli governments than many Europeans have but there was a qualitative change

[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.340]
during last year the context for it was the war on terrorism i guess i better do the breakout

[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.500]
finish it okay so i guess we better do the break

when the is all count the glare from his head is lining me

thicky V

[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.860]
it

[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.820]
It's a lot of chatter by the way for that.

[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:41.700]
I think that is a lot of chatter going on between January and November.

[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.400]
We've got some staggering news.

[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.420]
It's 10.46 in the morning.

[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.540]
The polls have been closed since before Jesus was a baby.

[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.620]
They promised us the stories that I read said,

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.540]
I'm going to get around to it.

[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.440]
They're all hanging out at the Xavier Suarez house.

[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.920]
But here it is 10.46.

[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.380]
There isn't one vote that's changed.

[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.180]
Isn't that enough to infuriate you?

[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.800]
Of course, the more time they let go,

[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.740]
the more hanky-panky they can keep pulling her.

[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.340]
I don't want to sound cynical.

[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.820]
That's a magnificent point.

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.300]
Anyway, getting back to this story, which is a lot of good questions.

[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.720]
Robert Kaiser's column in Sunday's Washington Post.

[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.920]
He says,

[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.120]
President Bush has said from the outset that the terrorists available

[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.720]
responsible for the 9-level attacks hated America because they hate our freedoms.

[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.300]
But the available evidence doesn't support this explanation.

[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.040]
In Laden's own statements and the personal histories of participants of 9-11 plot

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.660]
suggest there are more specific reasons for the terrorist hatred.

[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.800]
They include American support for regimes that they detest in the Arab world,

[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.600]
American bases on Arab territory, especially in Saudi Arabia,

[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.720]
and American support for Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory,

[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.400]
and for Israel's military campaign against the Palestinians.

[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.160]
Psychological alienation from modern Western culture,

[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.220]
and radical interpretation of Islam adds spice to this deadly stew.

[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.300]
By ignoring the items on this list and denouncing an enemy that hates us for what we are,

[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.980]
not for what we do and say, or what they think we do,

[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.600]
President Bush has created an all-purpose bad guy who's existence allows him

[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.000]
to sidestep any examination of American policy.

[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.140]
But Al-Qaeda is led by Arabs from the Middle East and is deeply rooted

[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.060]
in Middle Eastern policies and intrigue.

[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.320]
Its grievances, however, irrational, come from there.

[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.520]
The administration acknowledged the Arab connection,

[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.460]
early on, by recognizing a need for improved public diplomacy in the Middle East,

[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.720]
to better explain US policy to Arabs and improve America's image in the region.

[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.200]
But the problem as American specialists in Arabs pointed out went beyond imagery and explanation.

[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.720]
Arabs have real grievances against the US, first of all, connected to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.080]
This past spring, the intensification of violence from suicide bombings

[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.680]
and Israeli retaliations created a Middle East crisis,

[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.740]
Ariel Sharon and his colleagues used the crisis to press their view

[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.680]
that the Palestinians killing Israelis were no different from the Egyptians and Saudis

[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.920]
who flew airplanes in the World Trade Center in Pentagon.

[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.920]
The answer, Amafar, the Palestinian leader, is Arab and Laden Sharon said.

[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.880]
Israel's objective obviously was to persuade America to make Arab fat its enemy too.

[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.600]
The Bush administration initially resisted, but by June,

[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.800]
when Bush declared that Arab fat had to be replaced,

[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.680]
the US had aligned its policy with Sharon's unverturally all operational questions.

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.400]
The administration continued to say a favorite early creation of a Palestinian state,

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.880]
and opposed Israeli settlements in the occupied territory,

[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.260]
but this rhetoric had no visible effect on Sharon,

[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.960]
who has demonstrated no interest in a compromise with the Palestinians.

[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.020]
Judging by the public statements and public commentaries of Arab officials and analysts,

[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.100]
they now see no significant difference between Bush and Sharon on the Palestinian issue.

[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.300]
Bin Laden himself has written the script so it suits the goal of dividing the US from the Arab world,

[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.760]
including the Arab states that we've long considered our friends.

[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.300]
Potentially the most significant act of American unilateralism this year was President Bush's declaration

[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:49.080]
at West Point in June that the US would reserve the right to act preemptively against groups or nations with terrorist intentions.

[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.580]
The war on terror will not be won on the defensive,

[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.980]
we must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt its plans,

[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.120]
and confront the worst threats before they emerge.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.800]
This is the only path of safety, this is the path of action, and this nation will act, he said.

[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.580]
Thus began a summer of talk about preemptive war against Iraq.

[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.720]
Israeli Zintoni Blair, Britain showed some sympathy for the idea,

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]
but dozens of other international leaders expressed doubts.

[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.800]
So remarkably, did a long list of senior Americans who had served in the earlier administrations,

[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:18.000]
including George Herbert Walker, Bush's two secretaries of state, James Baker, the Third Line Lawrence Eagleberger,

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.800]
and his national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.

[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.120]
Their unusual public statements were evidence of profound disquiet and the upper reaches of the American establishment

[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.440]
where the idea of a unilateral preemptive war caused deep alarm.

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.880]
Last week, the ground began to shift somewhat.

[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.340]
Bush said he would make a speech on Iraq to the UN and would consult with the other permanent members of the Security Council.

[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.740]
He promised to wise Congress to approve any military action,

[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.500]
there was lawyers that argued earlier that such approval wasn't necessary.

[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.340]
He also promised to build a case against the Iraq and public, which politicians in both parties said he had to do.

[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.420]
But all of this had the flavor of, after the fact cosmetics, Bush gave no hint he was prepared to change his mind

[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.760]
about forcing regime change in Iraq.

[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.300]
What is the purpose of poking an American finger in the eye of just about every country in the world?

[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.200]
What does the administration hope to gain by emphasizing unilateral options from declaring war with our Congress

[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.100]
to telling other nations to sign up or get out of the way,

[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.160]
does such bullying ever pay off in politics, domestic or international?

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.620]
In a democracy voters want to participate.

[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.160]
In a community of nations, governments want to participate.

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.580]
The issue was in whether or not to fight terrorism, a new poll of Americans and Europeans released last week showed strong support

[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.180]
from military action against terrorists.

[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.300]
But the same poll showed equally strong sentiment,

[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.120]
and any such action should be taken in concert with allies and with the support of the UN.

[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.260]
The Americans questioned this poll demonstrated a lack of enthusiasm for this administration's foreign policies,

[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:40.020]
a warning in an election year, only 20% of Americans favored invading Iraq without the support of our allies and the UN as well.

[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.240]
On question after question, large majorities prefer acting with allies to acting alone.

[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.060]
But public opinion hasn't even affected because the country hasn't had a debate about its global status.

[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.600]
The US became the only great power dozen years ago, but we've never really come front of the implication of this fact.

[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.480]
Our political classes largely taken a buy on the biggest question of our time.

[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.800]
How should the US relate to other countries and international institutions on what terms should we engage with the rest of the world?

[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.680]
And what kind of armed forces and what sort of diplomacy has preemptive war become acceptable?

[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.920]
The attacks of 9.11 announced they profound change in the world.

[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:16.260]
They set us on a new course, but our politicians have let us down by failing to engage the country in a great discussion of the huge questions we face.

[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.000]
When we mark the anniversary of horror which we're doing today, we still won't know where we are going or why.

[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.780]
Right, Robert Kaiser?

[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.540]
I think he's got a point here. Do we know where we're going?

[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:45.440]
No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No

se meinemold.

[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.420]
And I look at my computer there.

[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.000]
Right. we're done

[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.360]
So in the same damn thing.

[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.420]
Someday can drive

[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:28.780]
away from

[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.960]
recordings as

[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.380]
him his story on before.

[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.680]
Arrayan yesterday in Detroit's 36th District Court.

[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.740]
Oshewski stood mute in court where he appeared in the street clothes and went out of

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.520]
a pre-scaler that Detroit FreePair has reported on his website.

[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.140]
He was released on a $10,000 personal bond and then I was scheduled to appear for a preliminary

[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.800]
examination September 22.

[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.720]
Oshewski's attorney, S. Allen Early, said the accusations against his client are false.

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.880]
He emphatically states that his innocent of these charges early said, father is totally

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.080]
shocked about these allegations.

[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.380]
Oshewski who stepped down from his Florida parish is accused of abusing Albert Green,

[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]
a former Detroit resident who now lives in Washington.

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.320]
Green, now 44, ledges that elected Oshewski molested him in Detroit rectumries and on trips

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.040]
out of state to Las Vegas, San Francisco and Disney World.

[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.380]
Tim Cosnoff on a green's lawyer said Oshewski served as Green's foster parent in the late

[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.500]
1960s when Green's mother became ill.

[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.020]
Albert is one of the most grievously damaged child sex abuse survivors that I've ever encountered

[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.260]
and I've dealt with hundreds of them in Cosnoff has said.

[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.960]
Oshewski is one of four men charged August 27 with criminal sexual conduct under a

[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.520]
provision in Michigan's statute of limitations, the priest alleging his conduct dated from

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.600]
the 1960s to the 1980s.

[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.880]
At least 30 Catholic priests in Michigan have been removed, suspended or have left their

[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.040]
duty since January, one among those sexual abuse, etc. and so on.

[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.460]
How do you like that?

[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.280]
Every single day we get either updates on old ones or brand new ones like that one in

[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.300]
Delray Beach, we had yesterday on the beach.

[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.260]
On the beach.

[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.680]
Meeting young boys on the beach for our fun and games.

[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.760]
For a blow job is basically what a boil down to.

[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.700]
That's what it was.

[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.300]
Oral is moral.

[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.680]
Let me take a look at that thing again.

[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.340]
Well, I mean, I don't know about you, but it's just a little bit frustrating to me.

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:16.760]
What do you say?

[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.480]
A little bit frustrating.

[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.920]
I'm trying to get the audience out there and myself some updated numbers on here so

[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.600]
we can see what else going on here.

[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.120]
And instead they got the oxygen out in Dayton Broward and they're trying to revive the

[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.760]
guy damn bodies that they dug up this morning.

[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.740]
So those bastards can make a mark on a ballot or do something.

[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.460]
Or maybe they're just having a tough time getting the list of names of those people out

[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:37.680]
again.

[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.460]
You know, the dead people?

[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.020]
They should have saved them from last time.

[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.980]
Well, they were trying to, but there was a little bit of investigation.

[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.340]
Maybe they had to lock them away in a lock box somewhere.

[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.720]
Maybe they're trying to find out who's got the key to the lock box.

[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.040]
I still say, go to Xavier Suarez's house.

[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:51.960]
Guaranteed.

[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.000]
He's probably got several copies.

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.000]
1056 at 560.

[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.420]
Nobody come.

[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.660]
We got the mad dog in one hand.

[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.700]
He could treat 635.

[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.980]
You got your Marlins on deck.

[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:00.920]
Would they end that already?

[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.200]
That Marlin crap, Jesus.

[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.700]
Why don't you guys just stop already?

[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.040]
And by the way, we don't want to hear all you dumb jocks pontificating about how horribly

[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.000]
the attack was last year.

[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.240]
We know how horrible it was.

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:10.580]
Okay.

[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.240]
We know.

[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.900]
Marlins in the Philly 710 tonight, Eddie K after the baseball game, and you'll mark overnight.

[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.180]
The dirty boys.

[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.460]
Hey, listen, if you want to start losing some weight, the beast says he's going to get on

[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.780]
a scale Friday or nearly does it on Thursday, but he's not going to be there tomorrow, right?

[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:24.300]
Right.

[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.060]
What's he going to be doing tomorrow?

[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.520]
Don't know.

[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.000]
Probably some harry cool stuff wouldn't surprise me.

[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.500]
But at any rate, I'm afraid the beast gets on a scale.

[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.140]
He lost 53 pounds in last count.

[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.080]
I guarantee you.

[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.100]
I give Georgia's personal guarantee that he's got at least 55, well, on a way to 60 pounds.

[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.960]
I was just thinking about this last night when he gets to the 100 pound lost mark, we're

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.000]
going to have a gigantic party.

[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.300]
We're going to have like, of course, he won't be able to eat any of it, but we're going

[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.400]
to have like a big feast and force him to sit and watch.

[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.340]
You can lose all the way to like he's done with balance for life.

[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.100]
That's how he's doing it.

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.440]
The no problem weight loss program.

[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.000]
No problems because you don't have any decisions to make other than just fill out that little

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.080]
menu they send you for every day.

[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.480]
You have two choices for every meal.

[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.000]
That's it.

[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.180]
You don't have to count calories.

[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.540]
You don't have to count carbohydrates.

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.440]
You don't have to walk up and down the aisles in the supermarket with your shopping cart,

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.760]
wondering what the hell can I eat and still lose weight because they bring you that little

[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.280]
black sack every morning is dependable as the weather in the South Florida.

[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.760]
And inside that black sack are three delicious gourmet meals made with the best ingredients

[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.160]
you'll find anywhere, two delicious snacks and little bottle of water as well.

[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.920]
So get with the real weight loss program.

[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.780]
Not some drastic or crazy diet regimen.

[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.620]
Something that will really watch, hopefully you'll watch the weight just fly off your body.

Fred, be very happy.

[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.460]
I'm a new club.

[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.600]
I'm a key embroidering goal.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.500]
A sure and full.

[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.260]
I wear it everywhere.

[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.020]
I go round the other A.D.A.

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:39.700]
to sit out.

[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.320]
I want to say.

[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.360]
Don't be true to your show.

[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.360]
I'm a star.

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:44.860]
I'm a star.

[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.360]
I'm a star.

[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.380]
I'm a star.

[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:47.840]
I'm a star.

[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.560]
I'm a star.

[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:48.620]
I'm a star.

[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:48.940]
I'm a star.

[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:48.940]

[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:49.520]
I'm a star.

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.120]
I'm a star.

[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.880]
I'm a star.

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.080]
I'm a star.

[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:55.580]
I'm a star.

[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.260]
I'm a star.

[00:43:59.020 --> 00:43:59.220]
I'm a star.

[00:43:59.660 --> 00:43:59.780]
I'm a star.

[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.520]
I'm a star.

[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:28.400]
I'll be ready to pray I'll be steady now my girlfriend's at the altar is acquired now she'll be singing away

Be true to your show

[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.280]
One family has captured the imagination of all of America.

[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.360]
It's El Cata in the family.

[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.600]
The feelings of the insides,

[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.880]
non-believers go to hell,

[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.120]
living in the cave that smells.

[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.180]
See you on the day.

[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.560]
Osama bin Laden's favorite son,

[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.660]
Ta'ad, is taking over the family business.

[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.460]
Funny business, that is.

[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:51.760]
Ah!

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.800]
Oh, shut up, even you think that.

[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.080]
And where is that no good meat,

[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.600]
turban son of mine?

[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.660]
Hey, you cold pup.

[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.480]
El Cata in the family.

[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.720]
It's like something you've seen before.

[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.700]
Oh, boy.

[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.120]
Some of mom's got ribs.

[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.060]
What are you going to do?

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.040]
Eat the great Satan's and death.

[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.320]
Hey, hey.

[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.020]
Um, no pup.

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.520]
Uh, just build up my strength for the jihad.

[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:17.880]
Oh, jeez.

[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.840]
Stop building up and stop blowing up there.

[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.360]
When the son of a jackal gets his son of his own,

[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.340]
he'll larity ensues on El Cata in the family.

[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.480]
Only on Al Jazeera TV land.

[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.660]
All right, our final segment with well-famous binocook.

[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.040]
Let's go to Eile in Melrose Park.

[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.280]
Go ahead, Eile.

[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.160]
Yeah, binoc, hey, what's your take on him, hurry, king?

[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.040]
Well, well, they could pose a threat this season.

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:45.760]
Yeah.

[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:57.120]
If they're strong enough, they could have the potential to blow to blow your house down.

[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.380]
I think you, man, college, stay in being home.

[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.040]
Yeah.

[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.640]
I think you're right.

[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.420]
But they'll be wearing panties under their uniforms this season.

[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.020]
But other than that, I don't know.

[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.520]
I just think I forgot.

[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.120]
Spiking and efficiency.

[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.680]
You're up with binocahead.

[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.000]
Good, good, yeah, yeah.

[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:22.920]
Fine, fine.

[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.480]
That's good, binocahead.

[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.300]
Oh, I want to know what your take is on the Rose Bowl,

[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.940]
Art Bowl, Finger Bowl, Toilet Bowl, and a Fiesta Bowl.

[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.520]
A-ah!

[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.200]
A-ah, a mino.

[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.080]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.300]
I just fell down.

[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.560]
And this phone gets heavy, you know.

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.880]
He wants to know about the Fiesta Bowl.

[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.480]
Well, you know, I had a Fiesta, yeah, yeah.

[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.020]
An old-smobile, yeah, yeah.

[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.260]
Body, a body new in 53.

[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.180]
Had a clock in the steering wheel, yeah.

[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:56.780]

[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.460]
Spiking, trailer, pocket, stays, hereup with binocahead.

[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.780]
Hey, binocahead.

[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:05.720]
Binocahead.

[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.440]
Yeah, yeah, that's super much, much too cold.

[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.660]
Hey, binocahead.

[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.540]
You think my last plane around on me, because I prefer Sparta?

[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.020]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.300]
Of course, you know, you know, my wife went down on many men

[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.340]
until she eventually went down on the Titanic.

[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.060]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.240]
That was a swing cruise, you know.

[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.100]
That ain't how I acted, binocahead.

[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.720]
Oh, you're right.

[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.340]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:36.320]
You know, I'm just stupid when it comes to that, you know.

[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.500]
I just don't know, yeah, yeah.

[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.320]
Thanks, binocahead.

[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.380]
Oh, you're right.

[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:49.300]
I could never, it's just, you know, I have these azaleas blooming out my ass.

[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.580]
Gee, thanks for being nice to me today, mo.

[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.380]
Hey, don't mention it, Goldie.

[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.640]
You're not going to get raped again today, I am old.

[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.800]
Yeah, you know why?

[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:57.900]
Why is that, mo?

[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.840]
Because rape's not funny, but I ain't going to be a mean man no more.

[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.300]
If they think that's funny, it's fine by me.

[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.400]
Wow, you really changed your way.

[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.940]
Ah, if I get about it, I'm turning over all new fig nutan leaves.

[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.760]
You have a nice day of power and nice, my cuttly friend.

[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.400]
Hey, mo, look out for that truck!

[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.560]
Ah, look out, look out, look out, look out!

[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.900]
Mo look like a shapeless pile of gold.

[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.720]
Ew, ew.

[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.660]
Does your mind respect high-sourish you?

[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.180]
I wasn't even told before that bastard boosted my shoe.

[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:42.140]
I don't want to say I'm glad outside of being a messy old shmuck, he wasn't bad.

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.880]
It's a mahala.

[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.480]
Oh, how is David dead?

[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.900]
Oh, how is David dead?

[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.960]
But his weakness is all how is David dead?

[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.860]
But his weakness is all how is David dead?

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.940]
But his weakness is all how is David dead?

[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.180]
And now it's the continuing episodes of Bieber and Butthead.

[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.600]
That's cool.

[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.440]
Look, I'm stroking my wieners.

[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.760]
Yeah, I know that feeling.

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.140]
Ah, I bet you feel pretty good, I'll be.

[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:16.800]
Oh sure.

[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.100]
Tune in next episode when Butthead hangs out with Bieber's mom.

[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:20.980]
Did you fart?

[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.060]
Yes, I did.

[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.080]
That was nice too.

[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.980]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.400]

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.400]

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.400]

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.400]

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.400]

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:05.500]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.140]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:07.300]

[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.920]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.280]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:10.840]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.300]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.380]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.940]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.140]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.100]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.840]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.100]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:20.100]

[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:20.380]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.740]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.060]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.380]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:38.800]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:38.800]

[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.400]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.480]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.800]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:41.800]

[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:42.720]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.180]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.360]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:44.640]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.700]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:46.700]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.780]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.760]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:51.720]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.360]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:52.780]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:52.780]

[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.040]
I'm so sorry.

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.040]

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.040]

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.040]

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.040]

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.480]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.120]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.140]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:04.140]

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:04.280]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:04.860]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.340]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:06.860]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.520]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:09.980]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.260]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:11.540]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.060]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.700]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:15.940]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.420]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:17.760]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.880]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.000]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.240]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.100]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.860]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:22.920]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.000]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.000]

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.000]

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.000]

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.000]

[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.360]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.660]
I'm so sorry.

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.680]
Here's your brand, honey.

[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.560]
When again?

[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.000]
It tastes so crappy.

[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.620]
You know, I'd give my immortal soul

[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.800]
for a brand that tastes good.

[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.240]
I heard that.

[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.760]
The Algebra, Lord of the Underworld!

[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.300]
What are you doing here?

[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.140]
I heard you're not eating your fiber, Bob.

[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.620]
Perhaps you'd like to try a new Bealza brand.

[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.380]
What's so great about Bealza brand?

[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.900]
Well, one bowl of Bealza brand

[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.680]
has all the fiber you'll need to keep regular.

[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:57.640]
But the best part is it tastes great. Wow! Besides, if you don't eat your fiber, your bottles will clog with running meat.

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.300]
Your intestines will flow with transistors and bloodshed from the image.

[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.960]
Okay, okay, I get the points. So I'll eat my brand. There's a good fellow.

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:10.480]
Thanks, O Desolate One. There's no problem. And now about your immortal soul, Bob.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.640]
Fiel's a brother. I'm just kidding. Fiel's a brand.

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.520]
Because good health shouldn't cost you your soul.

[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.980]
Oh, the peanut butter left some on it. But that's the reason it's left some on it.

[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.860]
And that's the reason it's left some on it. And that's the reason it's left some on it.

[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:08.520]
My past body is rather break in this way. My power is losing control.

[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.500]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[00:54:37.500 --> 00:55:07.060]
Oh, Mark, oh, man, you're in the color of your neck You can see by two mountains yellow and mortality没迫慎哦 See, here's how it feels.

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.000]
information that we got as weak as it is on the election.

[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.240]
It looks like it makes some numbers up if you like, but we ain't got nothing.

[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.120]
Nothing new.

[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.380]
The bride is still about 19,000 votes ahead.

[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.980]
The gay rights, the feet, not going to happen today counting nothing to feed for those

[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.780]
born again Christians.

[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.300]
There's good moralists.

[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.520]
But it was a closer than it should have been.

[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.060]
Thanks, of course, in large part almost entirely to the Cubans.

[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.500]
Like Amy Schaefer would say, it was Cubans.

[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960]
So you better get your act together, okay?

[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.800]
All you Cubans was out there, including George.

[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:41.360]
What?

[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.840]
Like I said, 12 minutes after 11.

[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.440]
So like I said, the first two hours we did the usual stuff and now from now we'll

[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.380]
want to clock, we'll play bits.

[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:50.720]
Excellent.

[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.640]
My feeling is call me crazy because I was even chuckling during that.

[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.180]
But if I can give people a few chuckles today, that'll be a public service.

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.980]
I'm not going to, there's nothing we can do on a show.

[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.060]
First of all, we couldn't even take calls if we wanted to because we're a technical

[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:03.460]
joke.

[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.780]
We couldn't take phone calls.

[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.880]
Secondly, I don't want to hear anybody other asshole calling.

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.180]
Oh God, what's America?

[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.160]
I don't want to hear that.

[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:16.420]
And thirdly, what are we going to add that you can't get on NBC or CBS or see this thing

[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.800]
that you faxed me about which I'll use tomorrow?

[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.220]
The best memorial is genuine freedom.

[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:21.680]
Yes.

[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.600]
And after World War II, after Pearl Harbor, you were later they didn't celebrate.

[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.340]
See, the reason that we have to have this stuff now is because of the 24 hour news network.

[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.580]
That's why we've got it.

[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.260]
You do understand that they've reshaped the way everything happened?

[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:36.700]
Of course.

[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:37.700]
For their convenience.

[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.460]
They've got to have some events to cover.

[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.280]
So we've got events.

[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.160]
Hey, speaking of an event, how about that crappy job you're working on right now that you're

[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.040]
very dissatisfied with.

[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.560]
You don't even have two nickels to rub together.

[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:50.100]
If you want to start making some real money in the computer business, here's the way to do

[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.240]
it.

[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.840]
You heard me tell you about the large number of great jobs that are out there waiting

[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.220]
for you.

[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.140]
How do you get there?

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.840]
How do you find a school that will train you for it?

[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.520]
Well, there's only once to Penn to school.

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.300]
It's got four convenient locations all over Dayton, Broward.

[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:04.960]
One, it's got certified Microsoft instructors convenient day evening and weekend classes.

[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.640]
There's one school that's got full-time job placement department over 30 years experience

[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.960]
with a school that can complete your program, get certified in just four short months.

[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.040]
It's hands-on training and that, of course, we're talking about fast train.

[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.520]
Todd Wreckle tell you all about it.

[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.620]
In fact, what we're going to start doing when we do the spot from now on, we'll give

[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.220]
their number and we'll give his home number, too.

[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.960]
And his cell phone number and his bookies number as well.

[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:24.640]
That's right.

[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.460]
You've heard us talk for a long time for a couple of years now about fast train.

[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.140]
Stop listening and start doing.

[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.520]
Get off your butt, pick up the phone and call fast train and get yourself under

[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.000]
a real career and a really fat, big paycheck.

[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.020]
Call fast train 1-866 fast train.

[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:43.100]
That's 1-866 fast train or check them out on the web at fast train.com.

[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.600]
Yeah, is this a newspaper?

[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.140]
Yes.

[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.420]
I would like to run an ad.

[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.600]
Okay, yeah.

[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.580]
For tomorrow's paper.

[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:06.920]
Ah, it's possible.

[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:07.920]
It's possible.

[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:08.860]
Maybe you'd be interested.

[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:09.500]
Maybe.

[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.260]
Okay.

[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:10.480]
Yeah.

[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.500]
Well, I'm thinking of my nuts on your chin.

[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:13.080]
You what?

[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.100]
I'm thinking of my nuts on your chin.

[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.720]
Your nuts on my chin.

[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.680]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:18.240]
Huh.

[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.460]
Interesting ad.

[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.440]
Is it an advertisement?

[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.060]
Yeah.

[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:21.680]
Yeah.

[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.920]
My nuts on your chin.

[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:23.840]
Any interest?

[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:24.600]
Yeah.

[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.180]
Really?

[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:25.680]
Yeah.

[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.900]
Mine nuts on your chin?

[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:27.740]
Interesting.

[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.360]
What's the reference to?

[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.280]
Mine nuts on your chin.

[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.680]
You're nuts on my chin, I can't.

[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.020]
Well, nuts.

[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:34.980]
I got a nut farm.

[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:36.960]
No way.

[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.300]
I don't know.

[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.200]
It's a...

[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.000]
Oh.

[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:04.560]

[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.620]
Oh.

[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.080]
Oh.

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.140]

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.140]

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.140]

[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.800]
Oh.

[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.400]
Oh.

[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.660]
Oh.

[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.100]
Oh.

[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:16.860]
Oh.

[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.180]
Oh.

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.180]

[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.800]
Oh.

[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.080]
Oh.

[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.020]
Oh.

[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.960]
Oh.

[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.600]
Oh.

[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.800]
Oh.

[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:34.100]

[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.420]
Oh.

[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:42.620]
Oh.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.460]
Oh.

[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:45.980]
Oh.

[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.160]
Oh.

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.160]

[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:49.520]
Oh.

[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:51.620]
Oh.

[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:52.700]
Oh.

[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:53.720]

[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.180]
Oh.

[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.160]
Oh.

[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:55.580]

[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:57.180]
Oh.

[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:57.260]

[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:57.460]

[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:57.940]
Oh.

[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:58.060]

[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:58.400]
Oh.

[00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:59.160]
Oh.

[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:00.640]
Oh.

[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.740]
I'm trying to find my radio on the other day and cut Uncle Neil's program, whatever it was.

[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.020]
And it is the silliest thing I've ever heard in my life.

[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.360]
If the children were around, it's horrifying.

[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.020]
I'm surprised.

[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:14.780]
It's a producer.

[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.200]
You let that go on the air.

[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.000]
I've heard other complaints about it, even from the... from the health there.

[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.760]
I wish it rectified that and do something about it.

[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.580]
No need to be taken.

[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.420]
God's name is vain.

[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:24.900]
Let them.

[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.740]
And the...

[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.760]
It's gratifying women.

[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.140]
No.

[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.040]
Well, how about you?

[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120]
We need to check that out.

[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.860]
Thank you very much.

[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.560]
Like would be so very hot.

[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.440]
If I were a bumble-bloch, this one women do a lot.

[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.360]
Who presents a panty spot?

[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.520]
They get fancy and they pitch.

[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.360]
When they have the theory it's...

[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.460]
Who stops gushing out the splot?

[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080]
They slide in a bumble-bloch.

[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.080]
Shots in women speak in touch.

[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.220]
Not for me, I don't like that.

[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.120]
Long as they are not too wide.

[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.060]
I feel comfortable inside.

[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.000]
Loopy up the slide we in.

[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.820]
In that sometimes the sea begins.

[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.600]
What I'd like to be a nut is to be a bumble-bloch.

[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.520]
A ram.

[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.860]
Like me it's rolling out.

[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.280]
What's out low?

[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840]
Is it between your eyes now?

[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.740]
There's no me in the hole.

[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.640]
What I do to pleasure you.

[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.620]
But I buy praise inside your tomb.

[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.540]
But I would shout aloud like cock.

[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.060]
Because I'm a dude, a dude, a dude.

[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.300]
You'll find I'm a perfect fit.

[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.340]
And I'd like to take a good look.

[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.480]
And presents like these pants.

[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.000]
But I buy water up on my class.

[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.240]
I heard a commercial on your station.

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.800]
Yesterday about one o'clock in the afternoon.

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:12.640]
Something about a voice would speak out if someone approaches your automobile.

[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:19.720]
And a voice of a big black something or other would come out and say,

[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.420]
get away from my automobile or you're too close to my automobile.

[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.940]
You big MF.

[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:35.260]
I object seriously to a profanity like that on the radio.

[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:42.340]
And I object to the profanity and that type of advertising.

[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.480]
I believe in free speech, but that's too far.

[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.480]
If I don't hear with ovens to this complaint from you,

[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.340]
I will send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission.

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:03:02.240]
Because no kind of language is certainly not acceptable on public radio.

[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.900]
It might be alright between individuals, but not on the radio.

[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:15.400]
You can call me back on Mr. Eisen, the EIS-EN.

[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.640]
Thank you.

[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.300]
Car theft is on the rocks.

[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.760]
In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.

[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.720]
What can you do to protect your car?

[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.960]
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.

[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.180]
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.000]
But a big black guy named Ben can.

[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.280]
Get away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.560]
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system,

[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.600]
and even less than you'd pay for the club,

[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.600]
you can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.

[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.940]
Get away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.680]
It's simple to use.

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.680]
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out.

[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.200]
And he does the rest.

[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.300]
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them.

[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.160]
Get away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.240]
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.

[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.360]
It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much.

[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.700]
Get away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.880]
That's about it.

[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.940]
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.660]
It got him to protect my car.

[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.240]
It's the best investment I've ever made.

[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.220]
My name is it isn't that great.

[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.420]
There have been a lot of car thefts.

[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.440]
I can't tell you how many times I've heard you'd away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.900]
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben, protecting my car,

[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.140]
let's me sleep better at night.

[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.140]
Call now, 1-800-1-Big-Guy.

[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.580]
That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-I.

[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.340]
And instead of hearing this...

[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.800]
You'll hear this.

[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.940]
Get away from the car, mother f**k.

[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.940]
Oh, Jeff Rimmal.

[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.800]
It's old Jeff Rimmal.

[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.680]
The pups must be flying.

[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.720]
Calls now the show is silent.

[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.660]
We just got rolling.

[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:18.540]
And now all the colors are gone.

[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.380]
Hey, let me ask you something.

[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.520]
Did you know what's fall?

[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.880]
Yeah, it's that time you really got to clean up the neighborhood.

[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.040]
Heh heh heh. Sure you do.

[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.400]
You got leaves piling up and sometimes, hey, you got something bigger than leaves you got to get rid of.

[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.180]
That's when you need sopranos, leaf and body bags.

[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.040]
From the same family that made its name from Holland trash, rats and stool pigeons all over Jersey.

[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.100]
Okay, throw me in there, but he got it.

[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:02.300]
Hey, these industrial spend bags is 30 to hold anything from leaf to limbs.

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.240]
And ain't, not for none, ain't talking about trellage, you know?

[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.440]
Heh heh heh.

[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:12.660]
Best of all, sopranos, leaf and body bags, they're not only leaked through, they're completely self-proved.

[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.760]
Well, almost, hey, Foley, give me that shovel of me.

[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.580]
Anyways, like I was saying, you had a problem?

[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.000]
We got a solution.

[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.260]
sopranos, leaf and body, big.

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.780]
The bag that'll make yard work around your house, a real hit.

[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.800]
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it again.

[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.780]
This Sunday, all the sopranos.

[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.300]
So what, no f***ing deal?

[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.160]
Hey!

[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.420]
Well, mate.

[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.280]
It's not my f***ing deal.

[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.200]
It's just his ass.

[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.380]
Here comes the prosack.

[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.440]
You want to take the lips over the tits.

[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.040]
Tuttle f***ing goop.

[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.180]
You know, motherf***ing.

[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.560]
You've got a real f***ing attitude problem.

[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.240]
But you take me in the f***ing head.

[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.200]
The words that come blowing out your race.

[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.680]
Pretty sure, I'm getting it, Shelby.

[01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.960]
There's two things I'm good at.

[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.920]
It's full of vents and sputting good f***ing jobs.

[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.640]
I might not be able to wipe my own ass.

[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.160]
You know that.

[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.480]
You're born to these f***ing.

[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.800]
I'm a babbling idiot.

[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.060]
Can you just shut the f*** up without us?

[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:10.960]
Stick it up your ass.

[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.480]
I would touch like f***ing off.

[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.580]
Get yourself under the vaporizer.

[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.160]
You're stupid motherf***ing, you know that?

[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.200]
You f***ing piece of s***.

[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.700]
Oh, man, please.

[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.060]
Don't start with the main business.

[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.420]
What the f*** is your problem?

[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.360]
Or the f***ing audience with the pope?

[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.080]
I bet you're very good to your mother.

[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.020]
F*** you!

[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.900]
F*** what?

[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.440]
You f*** you.

[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.620]
Are you f***ing calling me?

[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.780]
Don't f***ing day, huh?

[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.500]
It's nothing but a bracket for the Jews.

[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:37.720]
Yeah, it's Christ.

[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.280]
How you doing?

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.420]
F***ing no thing.

[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.020]
Eat your money, God.

[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.540]
I can't eat, Dad.

[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.600]
It's got cholesterol.

[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.060]
Can I just get some macaroni and gravy?

[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.200]
You f*** you.

[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.900]
You f*** you.

[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:49.700]
You f*** me.

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.240]
I don't like that kind of talk.

[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.460]
Anybody else want a mouth off?

[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.280]
F*** this.

[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.500]
I'm going to bokeh.

[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.060]
I think I'm finally inspired to start watching this.

[01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:58.520]
I'm not sure, you know.

[01:07:59.140 --> 01:07:59.780]
I know you're not.

[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.220]
I might be.

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.500]
I might have put me over the edge.

[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.860]
287 votes on our poll.

[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.500]
By the way, any new results on the election?

[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:05.800]
No.

[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.100]
No.

[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:06.660]

[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.040]
I'm just, it's almost noon.

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.320]
Why am I so stupid?

[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.260]
You know, why am I so naive and believe in that something is going to happen on that?

[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.380]
I'm going to sit here glued to this till 1 o'clock.

[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.260]
Nothing is going to change.

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.420]
Nothing is going to happen.

[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:23.040]
They're like, you know, they're still trying to revive the dead people just long enough to put their finger on it.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.340]
287 votes on our poll.

[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.760]
If the election for governor were being held today, who would you vote for?

[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.300]
Phil McBride, 175, 61% for Billy.

[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:32.640]
Oh!

[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.880]
Who's got that slim lead against old Janet, shaky old Janet?

[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.820]
Oh, yeah, 175 from McBride.

[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.020]
57 for Jim Bush.

[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.620]
That's a little more than 3 to 1, you know that?

[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.160]
And neither one of 55.

[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.180]
55 people who are disgusted with a whole damn thing.

[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.900]
And after yesterday, who the hell can blame them?

[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.320]
A display of an aptitude seldom seen in the history of the subhuman race.

[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.680]

My life and love.

[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.000]
This is 425-60.

[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.280]
You weigh it, you weigh it.

[01:09:59.340 --> 01:09:59.980]
Run.

[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.820]
Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Rambo Forward 5.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.080]
How are you?

[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.080]
John, Rambo's still alive.

[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.260]
I wanna make movies for him 5.

[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.080]
My life and going great plan to Hollywood's broke.

[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.840]
Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke.

[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.220]
First blood came in 82.

[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.320]
That's when I heard my penis and it never ever grew.

[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.140]
Rambo 2 was in 85 late.

[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.740]
Rambo 3 was in 88.

[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]
Sure, it's in 1.

[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.560]
And 2 is my gun.

[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.660]
I did not make this movie with my son.

[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.200]
It was in 5 and daylight, the tunnel movie.

[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.840]
A little bit of cash is what I need.

[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.800]
I gotta get a load from the power of creed.

[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.160]
I gotta have another movie.

[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.060]
Or a Broadway show like Della Hien.

[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.640]
I guess nobody ever saw Kaplan.

[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:57.940]
It was still good.

[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.280]
I guess I understand.

[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.220]
My whole life is about to cave in.

[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.100]
All I got left is Jennifer Flavian.

[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.400]
Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rambo Forward 5.

[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.560]
Check it out.

[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.960]
So call me up.

[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.240]
I really need a script.

[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.080]
I can do dialogue or keep it zipped.

[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.880]
I like comedy.

[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:23.580]
Action.

[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.840]
Adventure and drama.

[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.560]
The only thing I will not do is have sex with a llama.

[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.340]
So give me a break for goodness sake.

[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.160]
I used to be an Oprah and I can't get on Ricky Lake.

[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.700]
Right now I got a one man showin' full Pepsi.

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.960]
Basically I'm a lot of boy Gypsy.

[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.420]
A little bit of cash is what I need.

[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.320]
I gotta get a load from the power of creed.

[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.660]
I gotta have another movie.

[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.620]
Or a Broadway show like Della Hien.

[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.960]
I guess nobody ever saw Kaplan.

[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.460]
It was stupid.

[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.940]
So I understand.

[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.360]
My whole life is about to cave in.

[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.020]
All I got left is Jennifer Flavian.

[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.780]
That's why ladies and gentlemen,

[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.740]
I need to make Rambo Forward 5.

[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.680]
But I'm a Hollywood.

[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:09.840]
Absolutely.

[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.140]
We got one more precinct.

[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:20.760]
Oi!

[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:21.600]
Oi!

[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.560]
The way I move around when I go to,

[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.560]
I cause I'm a movement number two.

[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.260]
I'm the toilet seat, I swing and swing.

[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.980]
Do the mamba beat the radio play.

[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.720]
So I'm going out on road and I'm all cool.

[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.500]
So just one thing I gotta do.

[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.400]
A little bit of tape for the show like me.

[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.080]
So I can make my high knee nice and clean.

[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:45.880]
Welcome.

[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.760]
I don't have to push, I'm in control.

[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.580]
When I move inside the side of the toilet bowl,

[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.360]
I never have to spray, it comes out whole.

[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.040]
It looks a little like a to see roll.

[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.960]
I just wait through the left, it's way to the right.

[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.680]
From King's ring, King can tell you why.

[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.320]
Not only are you burning calories,

[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.200]
but you never ever get a big red ring.

[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.720]
That's why big black guys,

[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.240]
who can't use the exercise.

[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.400]
You have some fun when they hit the bomb mode,

[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.200]
open number two.

[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.220]
Hey look at me, Alan, I'm doing the mamba.

[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:42.840]
Come on, George.

[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.160]
I'm going to go where we're going.

[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.520]
He's cut off and stuck it.

[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.000]
I'll cut off, cut off.

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.240]
Don't go to bed if you're putting that gun to her head.

[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.340]
No, no, don't do it.

[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.420]
Don't do it.

[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.440]
Don't do it.

[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.440]
Don't do the crime if you're not good at lying.

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.900]
No, no.

[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]
Don't do it.

[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.660]
When there's no alibi's,

[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:35.900]
you can blame everything on the parrot.

[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.440]
Play the arm, the white bird.

[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.140]
Hope that bird don't flow,

[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.060]
your cover no, no, no.

[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.980]
Stoppins, have a board,

[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.520]
I don't even think that play is crucial.

[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.040]
Packs are at an eye for nation.

[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.740]
That means from my vantage point,

[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.260]
they're shaped like a letter I.

[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.880]
It's kind of like the June tale advances.

[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.860]
That has got to be the most fricking,

[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.280]
frackest stupidest thing I ever heard.

[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.080]
First and the secondary,

[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:20.920]
and tightly, the outcome of this game is invariably contingent on how adroitly they do put the thing in the thing.

[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.800]
Are you watching the sink and I'm watching the June tale?

[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.300]
So now it's time for a transcendent mid-game interview.

[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.000]
So, Binky, are you happy?

[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.240]
I hate no big cue in the game,

[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.760]
and I had it up to here with your show.

[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:37.720]
Hope that.

[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.640]
All right, sportsman,

[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.680]
dolphins, are in a critical situation.

[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.240]
They need this field goal,

[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.180]
if they expect to win this game.

[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.720]
And they're going to die mouth.

[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.860]
So, let's go to the fold, shall we?

[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.780]
Fast, steady and galleously.

[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:55.660]
What do you know?

[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.260]
What do you say?

[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.740]
You're great game hounders.

[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.520]
Thank you.

[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.860]
When you take them to Orleans.

[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.160]
Well, if you ask me.

[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.000]
And do you mind if we call the game here?

[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.080]
Why, or what happens?

[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.960]
If they missed the field goal,

[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.920]
go to the world.

[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.520]
Let's go to our sideline, report him.

[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.140]
Take it away, Gildi.

[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.640]
At the ball.

[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.740]
Is this pressure-painted gold coasting that sucks?

[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.500]
And it does sound down.

[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.680]
What is the pain?

[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.660]
That's the cue.

[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.460]
That's the cue, how it is.

[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.780]
I, I, I had about all I can take of this.

[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.780]
What are you talking about?

[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.300]
Sit down and shut up.

[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.740]
You see this hand?

[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:31.180]
Yeah.

[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.260]
I'm going to take this hand and brush your head like a peanut.

[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.560]
You want me to kiss your ass?

[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.660]
I don't kiss nobody.

[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.660]
You get your head, talk me up.

[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.060]
You're not going to fight me.

[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.060]
You're almost everywhere in the moment.

[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.660]
There's some reference to how you fight.

[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.780]
I guess that's just a coincidence.

[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.620]
And by the way, we got one more precinct like I blurred it out.

[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.700]
Aren't you excited?

[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:02.420]
Uh-huh.

[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.300]
That's right by, uh, let's see, December 14th, 2004.

[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.000]
We'll know who he is going to run against.

[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:08.460]
You have boys.

[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.920]
Now, I hope, I hope that not hallucinating.

[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.160]
Wasn't the number 6526 that I kept going?

[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:16.640]
6526.

[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:17.380]
Right.

[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.420]
Now it's 6527.

[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:19.840]
Oh, right.

[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.080]
Yeah, it's all to be got one more.

[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:27.420]
So, and I, I didn't bother looking enough because I don't want to get distracted here and get like off, uh, off the whole deal.

[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.960]
But, uh, I have a feeling that's that last precinct from Palm Beach.

[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.060]
I know it's not from Dave.

[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.180]
Because there's no change in the date numbers.

[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.300]
And it could be from Barbara, but I have a feeling it's the last one in Palm Beach.

[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.500]
They finally got that last one counted.

[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.680]
And Dave and, uh, still nothing.

[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.800]
Still, they latent 70,000 votes.

[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.260]
You're right.

[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.420]
So, the actual total, Bill McBride, 596-551.

[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.680]
596,000, 551.

[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.440]
And Janet, she be having 577, 437 for Burtral, Janet.

[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.600]
So, there's a difference of 19,114 that McBride's ahead.

[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.100]
You got that?

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:02.000]
Got it.

[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.040]
19,114.

[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.120]
And the tension is building.

[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.020]
You could like cut it with your toenail.

[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.820]
We'll have another precinct before the day is out.

[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:17.600]
22 noon at 560 WDQM VIP Sportsbook.com is a name that ought to ring a lot of bells.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:18.960]
Can you ring me a bell?

[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.320]
Because VIP, there you go.

[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:21.780]
That's the one.

[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:25.720]
The only sportsbook endorsed by all the industry watchers group since 1996.

[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.840]
We got a copy crisis, by the way.

[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.060]
Of course, on this day, on the anniversary of 9-11, nobody's going to pay any attention to that, are they?

[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:33.160]
No.

[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.660]
On a solemn day like this.

[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.060]
Did they pay attention to what you're yesterday?

[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:36.380]
No.

[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.300]
No, because yesterday was the day leading up to this.

[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:42.680]
The casino Times News recent issue says you can look what you just won't find

[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.840]

My name is VV.

My name is VV.

[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.760]
In toy stores now, from the makers of Tickle Me Elmo.

It's the all new Take That Thing Out of Me Elmo.

[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.560]
Mom, Elmo's taking my temperature with his hands.

[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.600]
The new Take That Thing Out of Me Elmo and coming soon, the vibrating Elmo.

[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.600]
Mom, I think I'm falling in love with Elmo.

[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.100]
In toy stores now.

[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.320]
Wow, wow.

[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:26.980]
Hey, not faded.

[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.960]
You've been down a while and it's nothing but missing me.

[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.140]
Not faded.

[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.900]
If it stays where it's at, you've got to find more that's ain't gonna be.

[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.120]
The market's just a bear in these.

[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.100]
I've been saying it's back on rev on you.

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:00.260]
I'm gonna say to find stronger, less you.

[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:08.260]
You've turned the market faded and recovery is overdue.

[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.740]
I'm a agent.

[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:32.860]
My current memories pretty soon, they'll put depends on me.

[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:40.880]
So agent, I can no longer be cause you see my prostate went on me.

[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.420]
But still I think I'm 23.

[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:51.500]
I'm outdated, I found 82.

[01:21:53.520 --> 01:22:00.280]
And I've got to keep my deep hand with you.

[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:07.600]
Yeah, I'm so aged, but I can still keep rocking you.

[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:19.040]
Man, my car is so dirty and I've got to meet an important client this evening.

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.720]
Well, just take it to a car wash.

[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.300]
You know, I don't really like to because those machines, they scratch the paint job.

[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.440]
I'm not talking about any car wash.

[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.340]
I'm talking about sparkle clean.

[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.640]
So only place in town to get a hand job.

[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.060]
They give hand jobs there?

[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.080]
Not any hand job, but the best hand job in town.

[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.920]
And it's all done while you wait.

[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.780]
I love a good hand job.

[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.300]
Then you'll love sparkle.

[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.100]
With every five hand job, you get a free lubing.

[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:48.080]
So when you need to feel like a million bucks, get a lubing hand job from sparkle clean.

[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.000]
We are the best.

[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.040]
Oh, yeah, you are.

[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.380]
You're the best.

[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.480]
I do think you can wash the car too.

[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.500]
It's going to be too soon.

[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.560]
Where are you?

[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:01.700]
We got the worst in the town.

[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.360]
Hey, school, pick up the beat.

[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.060]
Pick up the beat.

[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:05.800]
Pick up the beat.

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.140]
It's not the same car as you now.

[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.740]
It's not the same car as you now.

[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.680]
Okay, school, let's get with it.

[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.720]
Looks like we've got another mystery on it.

[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.180]
We'll screw that.

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.760]
We'll take the girl this way.

[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:21.940]
Yeah, I know.

[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140]
And school me a meal.

[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.000]
Go the other way.

[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.580]
Oh, school, school.

[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.500]
Hey, school, we found the school.

[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.040]
There's a school, we found the school.

[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.840]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:36.500]
Let's go.

[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.680]
I think it's girlbeat.

[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.540]
I think it's girlbeat.

[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.360]
I think it's girlbeat.

[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.400]
Girlbeat, guys, really.

[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.980]
I think it's girlbeat.

[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.820]
I think it's girlbeat.

[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:47.380]
You sure?

[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.920]
I'm wondering if you could say it again.

[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.680]
Girlbeat, guys, really.

[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.220]
This is a girlbeat dance floor, isn't it?

[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:53.640]
There's no one.

[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.220]
Yeah.

[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:58.460]
Why don't you try dancing on it instead of my beat?

[01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.100]
Oh, no.

[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.300]
It's true.

[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:00.760]

[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:01.620]
It's true.

[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:02.900]
Oh, it's not me.

[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.880]
It's true.

[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.720]
Oh, it's not me.

[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:07.560]
It's true.

[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.020]
Oh, it's not me.

[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.020]
It's true.

[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.200]
Oh, it's not me.

[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:10.460]
It's true.

[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:11.660]
It's not me.

[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.080]
Oh, and now we are moving to troll.

[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.520]
Just stand on the floor.

[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:17.340]
Hey.

[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.460]
Hey, Scooby.

[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.760]
I found the cyber phone.

[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.400]
Shaggy, get a hold of yourself.

[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.440]
Come on, Shag.

[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.160]
Let's dance.

[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:30.980]
Let's go.

[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.360]
Wait a minute.

[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.040]
I think I found the clue.

[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.780]
Why can't I think I'll get a hand-made or not?

[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.380]
Crazy boy.

[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.340]
Not even a movie.

[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.680]
We're almost out.

[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.260]
Shaggy.

[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.900]
Go, Scooby, go.

[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.500]
You know we got a mystery.

[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.420]
It's time for Scooby to come here.

[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.680]
You made all your act.

[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.300]
Don't roll back.

[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.400]
It's Scooby, do it.

[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520]
You come through your phone.

[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.020]
I had it time for Scooby.

[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:56.580]
Yeah.

[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.240]
Scooby, say it.

[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.940]
Hey, Scooby, pick up the beat.

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.720]
I'm thinking this mystery is pretty close to being solved.

[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.780]
Scooby, get tried.

[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.900]
That's gonna be maybe the sixth?

[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.140]
Nice.

[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:09.060]
That's all.

[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.040]
Scooby,IT TRY!

[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:13.880]
That's gonna be exactly the sixth.

[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:15.700]
I think it's roman.

[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.000]
Rover, we die, Rover, we die, Rover, we die.

[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.980]
Ger brass, we are range, we are now.

[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.940]
Oh no, that's me, we are range.

[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.200]
We are range, we are now.

[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.280]
Scooby, go.

[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.640]
Forward, you are react, you are.

[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:31.860]
Move, we are now.

[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.800]
Scooby, finish playing the Pete show.

[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.620]
Drop, take your gun!

[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.560]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.200]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.400]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:44.900]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.840]
You're not big, I'm crazy!

[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.000]
For what I'm about to say!

[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.960]
But the modules just in the NFL

[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.940]
All stuff they're mocking!

[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.600]
For just have my crudies

[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.260]
With slow and thirsty young

[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.460]
And try not to make it helpless

[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:12.520]
For dread, terror, gun, and bond

[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.460]
And you may see

[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.460]
I have no thought

[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.340]
But it's been to me right all

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.440]
This is what makes them even

[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.740]
And I am never the man's boss

[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.160]
Who?

[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.840]
It's what those jobs do face and throw

[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.480]
They're all bad reasons

[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.260]
They're all bad reasons

[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.100]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.840]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.720]
Oh, they get angry!

[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.400]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.280]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.060]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.780]
Troys, they get angry!

[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.520]
They get angry!

[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.000]
Welcome back to the Mohawah David Show

[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.640]
We're a juckful Azani but good clean family fun!

[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:01.220]
You know that pipe smoke and jizz-guzzle of things rape as funny?

[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:02.420]
Is that funny?

[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.940]
Plains crashing into buildings as funny too, huh?

[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:05.420]
What?

[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.180]
Since when it's gang rape funny?

[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.400]
Especially when it's me getting my teeth back red

[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.320]
What a juckish!

[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.740]
Hey, how about the hurricane?

[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.960]
No, no, no, no, don't go tap there so when I talk

[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.440]
This is important! They don't know comedy!

[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.860]
I'll show them comedy!

[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.420]
Today I brought my collection of Lumbernavna tapes

[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.300]
Lumbernavna, you're more on!

[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.240]
They even named the restaurant after Lumber!

[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:27.920]
Uh-oh!

[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.540]
Ah, you clueless muck!

[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.700]
We'll get back to that later.

[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.680]
Right now it's time for our transcendent mid-show snack!

[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.540]
Bring the morning mayor his food!

[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:38.640]
Woo!

[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.740]
Ah, here they are!

[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.060]
My favorite place to die!

[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.560]
Zai gote subboka!

[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:45.880]
Diggin' up everybody!

[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.600]
Hmm, what is it, schmint?

[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:48.920]
Looks like a donut?

[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.560]
Troys are devained embryos from plantarine hood in the hood!

[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.000]
Oh, cool backstab!

[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:55.660]
Well, that's good!

[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.900]
Try it with the cocktail sauce.

[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.140]
Hey, hey beast! We'll play that Alice Cooper record!

[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:02.820]
Okay, dude!

[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.680]
Dead baby!

[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.040]
Can't stay a tear all the things!

[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:12.440]
There's a little atmosphere for you to help it go down the gullet!

[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.240]
The egg, baby, I've really digged that Alice Cooper seed!

[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.360]
I'm wit!

[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.540]
And I'm hip!

[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:20.980]
I'm a hepster!

[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.860]
If these ponds only know what was going on.

[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.220]
Yeah, I've got some more transcendent here.

[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.320]
I've cleaned your pellet this.

[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.520]
Thanks, ma'am.

[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.880]
Alright, when we got the meathead mad dog coming up at one,

[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.900]
followed by that fat Jew right after the queer in the spritz.

[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:39.740]
What's that?

[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:40.620]
It's a clay!

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:41.540]
It's a clay!

[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.240]
It works!

[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.460]
It's headed right for your ass, ma'am!

[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.080]
My son was watching your program on the um,

[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.420]
on the whammy on my amy.

[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.360]
The date was 15.

[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.860]
And I don't like to have no,

[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.120]
it's just some kind of anti-crystance or something.

[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.420]
Because now my son wants to worship the devil

[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.880]
because he thinks he's cool.

[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:10.220]
And he also wants to just as ladies and ballistic on now.

[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:14.220]
I don't know if the whole channel 69 is the anti-crystance channel.

[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.820]
Um, please, I'm really concerned.

[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.660]
And I would like to know if you're the anti-crystance.

[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:20.420]
Thank you.

[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.580]
And please, if I see you somewhere,

[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.060]
I wouldn't even stop and give you water

[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.400]
because now you turn my son into a baguette

[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.840]
and you made my son serve the anti-crystance.

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:32.640]
Thank you.

[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.060]
And have a nice day.

[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:36.880]
Yes, I am.

[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.640]
Oh, that as well, please go away.

[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.400]
Find a new way to attack up a baguette.

[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.820]
Go home and eat your whole home.

[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.620]
Until you explode.

[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.620]
Just like your fat, fat churned ladies

[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.120]
have to fight you seed down the plane.

[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.120]
Spending your fingers that have yellow stain

[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.940]
from sea tools,

[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.920]
and sea urges.

[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.040]
After Diggy Puno.

[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.220]
I'm proud to be fat, disgusting, and tasty, always.

[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.380]
You make the shutter, women smile.

[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.880]
They like a cow, who's fat and fat.

[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.960]
And things smelly, fat, so repulsive and mild.

[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.900]
Your body cheese smells like a crap, but

[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.440]
after it was occupied by a passenger,

[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.000]
need a shoe or two, get into your car.

[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.320]
Dush or two, got m-y.

[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:56.760]
Onkins squeal, onkins squeal, onkins squeal, fat ladies.

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.060]
Isn't with your lover less mean?

[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.720]
Lover in a darkness tree between her knee.

[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.840]
Match with tailors, yeets.

[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.180]
Smell fishy to me.

[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.900]
That's enough of killing that moist and tasty fat.

[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.300]
Max Petetti, you've read it a long time, too, no?

[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.860]
I love it.

[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.440]
Anyway, I'm in check, and I'm looking.

[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:26.660]
We still have that one more precinct.

[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.540]
I'm thinking between now and the next 20 years,

[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.720]
we can have another precinct.

[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.980]
We'll just postpone the election.

[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.880]
Maybe that's what Jeb is counting on.

[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:36.140]
We can't fight the dead people, but we just won't have a winner

[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.100]
in the Democratic primary.

[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.600]
So we'll postpone it a few years.

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.240]
In the Sun Central website, it's just kind of like sitting there.

[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.820]
See, most websites on real newspapers,

[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.560]
like in a Boston Globe.

[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.860]
They have a thing, Boston.com, and you cook that on.

[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.660]
And they got updated news throughout the day.

[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:52.900]
Do they have that?

[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:53.160]
No.

[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.100]
Once in a great while, you'll see on the Sun Central,

[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.700]
they'll say, new and red, new.

[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.540]
Like, here's a new story.

[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.100]
Can you believe it?

[01:31:59.140 --> 01:31:59.260]
No.

[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.320]
So far, let's see.

[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.520]
Here's the same old story, election system criticized.

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.220]
It's deja vu all over again.

[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.320]
Let me just click the one thing, vote totals,

[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.420]
because I really don't have time.

[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.700]
Vote totals, here we go.

[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.480]
Same old crap.

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.680]
Hey, speaking of same old crap, how's Todd Dreck doing?

[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.140]
Have you heard the news about the 3.95% mortgage?

[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.640]
It's true if you were thinking about it.

[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:18.620]
Well, stop thinking.

[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.640]
Do something smart.

[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.600]
Don't be like Todd Dreck.

[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.360]
Be smart.

[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.480]
Because now is the smart time to purchase a home.

[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.800]
Are we financially resisting?

[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.620]
Home at the unbelievable, unbeatable, low rate of just 3.95%.

[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:33.580]
If you have a 7.5% mortgage, the 3.95% rate would save you over 3.5%,

[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:37.560]
or over 3,500 bucks, the first year we're low on a $100,000 mortgage.

[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.620]
Don't make things hard.

[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:39.700]
Make them easy for yourself.

[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.820]
I pick it up that instrument and calling financial group, 1-800-940L-E-N-D.

[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.480]
That's 1-800-9405363.

[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:51.640]
Getting you a mortgage someplace else will cost you thousands of dollars each year.

[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.000]
Think of all the money you're going to save when you have a 3.95% mortgage financial group

[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.980]
self thousands of people just like you use.

[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:02.960]
But you're financing in the best possible position by getting yourself a 3.95% mortgage

[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.840]
call financial group today right now 1-800-9405363.

[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:11.060]
That's 1-800-9405363.

[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.580]
There's an equal housing lender.

[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:15.720]
Credit restrictions do apply and don't forget rates are subject to change

[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.800]
if you wait 2-1-1-1.

[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.880]
We're supporting you 5-16-2-1-1-1.

[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.300]
You a.

[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.680]
They're state goldstein but you can call me Kelsey.

[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.760]
Whenever I'm in town I listen to, wait a minute I am in town.

[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:32.520]
It's the 12th of 1 hour.

[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.080]
Sad.

[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:43.060]
And now, on the campaign trail with George W. Bush.

[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:49.460]
Today, America's candidate addresses the unionized workers at South Carolina's

[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.020]
turbine town factory.

[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.800]
Great to be here in Nevada.

[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.620]
South Carolina Nevada.

[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:03.460]
I want to be your president because I can relate to the ignorant blue collar worker.

[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.460]
Don't say that.

[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.040]
The ignorant worker all over the world.

[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.080]
Hey Bush, what are you know about working?

[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.200]
Never have worked today my entire life.

[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:21.060]
Hands, smooth, silky palm olive.

[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.560]
You're soaking in it.

[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.880]
Let's go to the next question.

[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.160]
Yo, mate!

[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:27.620]
Yes sir.

[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.060]
Yeah, well you going to go and melt water.

[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:31.340]
Good question.

[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.400]
Important substantive marijuana legalization.

[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.080]
No, absolutely not.

[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:40.820]
Cocaine.

[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:41.820]
Yes.

[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:48.420]
E.C.P. heroin, probably barbituous andphetamines with out of doubt.

[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.520]
With out of doubt.

[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.100]
Not.

[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:51.980]
Now you.

[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.680]
What are you going to do for the black man?

[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.520]
Thanks for asking.

[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.180]
First thing I'd like to do.

[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.520]
See me one up close.

[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.720]
Not too close.

[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:00.560]
No touching.

[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.460]
Perhaps maybe get a lot, lot.

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.320]
Can I get a lot, lot.

[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:04.880]
Well, I turned to him.

[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:05.780]
Thank you very much.

[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.200]
We got to go.

[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.300]
You got to go.

[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:11.040]
Oh, again, faint trail with George W. Bush.

[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.880]
Oh man, they're never going to get any.

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:15.440]
What am I going to do?

[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:16.900]
Check it out.

[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.280]
I'll never have a date because I was shy.

[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:26.240]
Never had a chance to pull on a chase because I was shy.

[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.000]
So what do you think I'm playing after this, man?

[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.200]
All right.

[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.420]
You got me your hooker and I know why.

[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.220]
Why would you get to see me?

[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.000]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.260]
Cause I was shy.

[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:36.800]
Cause I was shy.

[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.720]
Because I was shy.

[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.700]
Never had a club.

[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.420]
And it was a dime.

[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.700]
She reached down the road, my love.

[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.160]
And it came alive.

[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.760]
She said she knew me twice.

[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.400]
And we were an extra five.

[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.280]
There was a dime.

[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.460]
There was a dime for an extra five.

[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.960]
Forget about it.

[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.240]
I know she loved the flavor by the looking around.

[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.300]
She said please return the flavor on zip and her fly.

[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.580]
And don't even go.

[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.260]
I guess I should have known by the hair on her thigh.

[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.000]
Why, man?

[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:21.440]
Yeah.

[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.160]
It was a guy.

[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680]
It was a guy.

[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.680]
It was a guy.

[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.440]
I like to take his nuts and put them in their vines.

[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.600]
She crushed her nuts and her nuts.

[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.240]
We're staying here by the doochie when you need advice.

[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:39.560]
On their color butt.

[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:44.240]
I got a bunch of ripups by a transverse tie.

[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.120]
I beat up a guy.

[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:48.740]
I beat up a guy.

[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.120]
I beat up a guy to get a coat.

[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.220]
Roll another plant.

[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:57.980]
Yeah.

[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.800]
I beat up a guy.

[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.960]
That's right.

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:27.960]

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:27.960]

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:27.960]

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:27.960]

[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.080]
My wife still messed up and I know why why

La la la, la la, I was gonna go to class

Before I got her, come on, y'all

[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:47.360]
I could have cheated and I could have passed

[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.020]
But I got her, ah, ah

Hey, I'll come and lay away.

[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:15.300]
It won't work.

[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:17.760]
You gotta use the stairs just to put more on.

[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.280]
You've done that fast.

[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:19.700]
Did you?

[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.500]
You're stupid, fat-toy.

Oh, hi, how is this stairs?

[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:25.040]
That's right, Rotando.

That's all.

[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:29.460]
All right.

My wheelchair.

[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.420]
Somebody help me.

[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.240]
Hey, how about you, Pali?

[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:53.800]

[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:57.060]
Sorry, I got fired.

[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.360]
I'm gonna die.

[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.480]
You see, I might get the idea, Pali.

[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:02.920]
I'm not sure.

[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:04.060]
Is there a foot?

[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:04.740]
It's around.

[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.660]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.240]
Maybe I can hide in the pit.

[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:10.220]
You mind?

[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.440]
Yeah, my ass.

[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:11.920]
Yeah.

[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.140]
You can't let me.

[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:14.320]
You can't let me.

[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.460]
I know, save me.

[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:16.240]
Stop it, Pali.

[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.860]
I'm talking to my friend.

[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.500]
I'm kinda queer, hey.

[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.340]
Sorry.

[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:21.800]
Mine.

[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.540]
Nice knowing your high boy.

[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.960]
Just remember, Delby, your kid.

[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.940]
Put your arms around a memory.

[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.200]
I can't even put my arms around you.

[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:31.560]
Stop.

[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.800]
You have to do all those.

[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:34.020]

[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.000]
I can't.

[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.100]
I feel like it's buying his bloodline.

[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.180]
In a Poseidon adventure.

[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:47.840]
But at least he got to look up and tell his demon,

[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:48.380]
Stuy.

[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.900]
And shout at my face in her day.

[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.100]
But she gave him hell of a laugh, didn't she?

[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.060]
Oh, damn.

[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:00.420]
You made it.

[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.420]
Well, the way down is dead.

[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.540]
May I have your attention, please?

[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.880]
This was a false alarm.

[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.060]
And it's been a real fire.

[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:09.780]
This is the thing.

[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.340]
We were not serving high boy.

[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:13.680]
And the next thousand tailgate party.

[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.340]
Everyone, back to your arms.

[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.140]
This everyone, back to your arms.

[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:20.940]
Fuck you, Pali.

[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:36.800]
Oh, yeah, I got that something.

[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:40.520]
I'm aching in my glass.

[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.860]
Yeah, you, an aching boy.

[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.960]
And I'm your name, Blame.

[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.640]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:50.920]

[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:50.920]

[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.220]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:58.540]
They seem so sweet to me.

[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.960]
With their burned little cans.

[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:02.620]
Right, go.

[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.420]
Little boys need to be with me.

[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.300]
Cause I'm an emblem.

[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:09.520]
I'm a bull.

[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.340]
Yeah, I'm a name, Blame.

[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.960]
Yeah, I'm a name, Blame.

[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.740]
Hey, little kid, I'll give you candy.

[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:23.520]
And I'll ride.

[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.120]
You can sit on my lap and I will.

[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:30.600]
Let you drive.

[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.400]
Let you drive.

[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.580]
Let you drive.

[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.400]
Yeah, you shake your mouth in.

[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.680]
When you wear your little pants.

[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.540]
Don't tell a little secret.

[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.360]
Cause I'm your name, Blame.

[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.420]
Oh, right.

[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.220]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.880]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:05.300]
And when I shower, I'll invite you inside.

[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:10.920]
And when I touch your little part,

[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:16.680]
I get high, I get high, I get high.

[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:22.220]
Oh, yeah, I got that something.

[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.840]
I'm aching in my glass.

[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:29.380]
Yeah, you, an achy boy.

[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.420]
And I'm your name, Blame.

[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.320]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.980]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.160]
Yeah, I'm your name, Blame.

[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.640]
Boy, the way that Napster played.

[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:53.480]
Not a single pet we paid.

[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.900]
Two damn free turns, sure was bright.

[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:59.540]
Times were the days.

[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:03.500]
And we found our dead bed.

[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:07.320]
Every June from R.D.M.

[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:10.120]
Mr. Wages, New one day,

[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.780]
That website would be condemned.

[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.380]
To make CDs or types.

[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:21.140]
That's the fans' belief of weight.

[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:25.320]
See, that sucks we have to play.

[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.060]
Those were the days.

[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:35.660]
Saturday night on CBS, eat it, and back from the dead.

[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.460]
It's the 20th anniversary of all in the family.

[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.600]
All looky dead, if you need a job, Jellie Wee.

[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.140]
Daddy, don't be such a coach.

[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:47.760]
Now, what ever happened to my little girl?

[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:48.920]
Look at this.

[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.620]
Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh?

[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.660]
Maybe have a salad once in a while.

[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.540]
Daddy, don't you know how many of the world's people

[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.260]
have never had a decent meal?

[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.440]
Again with a charity spira.

[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.040]
Well, it's true.

[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.420]
So why don't you send them the bones from the taiki

[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.260]
you had for breakfast, huh, what a...

[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.100]
Oh my goodness.

[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.620]
I can't believe it.

[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:14.500]
I can't believe it.

[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.260]
The taiki was pushing up days.

[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:18.740]
Oh, now watching.

[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.860]
The last episode was a little bit dream.

[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.360]
It seems so bad to me.

[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.600]
Look, who was it back there, Bidett?

[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.040]
Push the dead off and get me in at a B.

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.020]
That's 20th anniversary of all in the family.

[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:33.680]
Saturday night on CDF.

[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:36.920]
Brought to you by IBS Home Car Span in school,

[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.260]
where you can learn auto mechanics,

[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.320]
done repair, all back to school.

[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.720]
Guys, we're going to double pay.

[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:57.300]
No no votes.

[01:53:58.780 --> 01:53:59.540]
Thanks.

[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:01.560]
You're welcome.

[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.480]
Every time I have you, you got yours.

[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.960]
I can't tell no to say how much peace, Lord.

[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.080]
All that you can't, broad as his brain.

[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:17.680]
Inside his nose nothing else.

[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.380]
Three names of the days of oxygen.

[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:30.140]
That's why George always thought he had no days of oxygen.

[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:37.300]
He bought a team to inhale the surface line.

[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.260]
He was born into money, but he's some kind of dumb.

[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:54.180]
Without his evil, he was the honest, fun, soul.

[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:57.880]
Life of the party is his polished day.

[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:02.400]
It's a blast, it's a two-cell sport of grace.

[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.840]
And a nasal oxygen.

[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.260]
That's the reason he's forever weak.

[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:13.340]
He has no nasal oxygen.

[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:20.340]
I bought my ticket, then I'm holding my passport tight.

[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:38.200]
560 WQAM presents the Moen Jo Show.

[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:41.180]
Meetings tank bad with our last failure.

[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:42.980]
We're going to try this now.

[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.380]
To get in touch with Moen Jo.

[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:48.960]
What's the point?

[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.820]
Welcome back to the Moen Jo Show.

[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.160]
What do you know?

[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:56.820]
It's nice to be here.

[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.020]
You don't mind this 18-hour shift, fuck it.

[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.980]
You were getting paid extra for this.

[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.680]
They said they're going to...

[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.320]
You're stupid.

[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.880]
You're stupid.

[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.500]
Just like that guava-loven spit, your buddy over there.

[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.780]
Come on, we didn't even get started.

[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.700]
Shut up, you want to walk my show?

[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.040]
You'll do as you're told.

[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.300]
Get over here.

[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:23.300]
That's right.

[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:24.640]
Come here.

[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:26.920]
Get over there.

[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.080]
Get over there.

[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:34.300]
Get over here.

[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:34.960]
I'm over here.

[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:35.560]
I'm over here.

[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:36.480]
I'm over here.

[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:39.560]
Come here.

[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.420]
Why don't you go outside and wait for it to snow?

[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.320]
Not just a man, I don't have to.

[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.560]
I said go wait for it to snow.

[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:55.100]
Get the QAM van ready for my appearance at the Hollywood Fashion Center.

[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.560]
Don't worry, it's an automatic.

[01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:58.780]
Amscray.

[01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:01.180]
No, no, not K.

[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:03.800]
That'll be very good, sir.

[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:04.440]
K.

[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.880]
Trust was giving me some...

[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.240]
Play it and fall on the ceiling.

[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.160]
Don't stop feeling it and it'll mean me like...

[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.900]
Turning blue and turning, could go...

[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:28.020]
I guess I died at 57 years old.

[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.900]
I'm going to be...

[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.720]
I'm going to be...

[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:37.100]
Oh...

[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:37.500]
What?

[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.520]
What?

[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:42.140]

[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:48.180]
I'm going to get you to blow deep down.

[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.560]
Oh...

[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.680]
No, no, no.

[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.600]
It's anyone there.

[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:56.380]
Stop getting this bloody room.

[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:03.180]
Don't tell rumors, it's spinning around.

[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:07.360]
I passed out on the...

[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:07.840]
...crowd.

[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:12.300]
Who don't stop the next...

[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.720]
I guess they don't need me anyway.

[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.660]
I'm going to get out of here.

[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.980]
I'm going to get out of here.

[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:22.040]
Ready to go.

[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:29.460]
Drop 25, 65, 62, I'm 35, 75 votes on our pool.

[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.040]
Hey, how come we know our numbers, huh?

[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.760]
That's because we don't need to have any dead people to bring out.

[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.920]
375, who would you vote for if our governor for the election were being held right now?

[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:43.600]
Bill McBride, 220, Jeb Bois, 78, and neither one of them is 77.

[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:44.960]
78 times three is what?

[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.740]
We're almost three to one.

[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.500]
Any new votes on the governor's?

[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:50.640]
No.

[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:53.680]
1227 at 560, WQM.

[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.280]
It's the dog days of summer, still, even though it's September 11th.

[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:57.980]
It's still hot as hell?

[01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:58.580]
Yes.

[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.300]
I told you, it's hot as hell.

[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:04.800]
And if you're tired of all that, what is it, how does hell have to do with your hair blowing out of control?

[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:05.720]
Can you tell me?

[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:06.420]
No.

[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:08.420]
Well, but I will tell you this, it's beautiful.

[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:10.600]
It's like 72 and sunny here today, but it's windy.

Line and local, we're sports radio 560-CUA-M.

[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:38.840]
Pullin' forward with out from our eyes old sports bag radio WQHL.

[02:00:48.500 --> 02:01:01.220]
Oh, they want us to find a way, the reimbursed four-backed fame from 200 years ago when they were slaves.

[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:09.660]
It must, when I only have a whole little hole, a pit hole and a pinch of skull.

[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:21.220]
So if you want to ask me how here's what I gotta say, you've got to kiss a nigger good heart.

[02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:24.960]
Till the back you started for it's slave in her mom.

[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.520]
Yes, a nigger good heart.

[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.980]
And that forever mudd into it's dead and tall.

[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:41.880]
If I was born a day 102, hold it, blazing something I do.

[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.400]
But what for dead people dead to you, I have to take the plane.

[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:52.780]
We'll just settle for an old money act.

[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:53.520]
Okay.

[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.380]
With a piano spell, it's carrying it back.

[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.680]
It's hit a 40 acres and a mule, I have a better way.

[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:07.100]
You've got to kiss a nigger good heart.

[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.460]
And one on how a parent organ frame up to.

[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:15.200]
Yes, a nigger good heart.

[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.540]
And that's your institution for a slave in you.

[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:23.280]
Yes, a nigger good heart.

[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.560]
And till that you started for it's slave in her mom.

[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.320]
Okay, you've got it.

[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.380]
Yes, a nigger good heart.

[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.740]
And that forever mudd into it's dead and tall.

[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:39.140]
See you tomorrow, Holly?

[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:42.860]
Oh, yeah, you two will go to have a good day of paradise.

[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:43.380]
Okay.

[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:44.360]
We did not already play that one.

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.240]
Yeah, I think so.

[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:49.160]
Sorry.

[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:55.600]
A adopted rose, he got one more.

[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:01.320]
What are two more, you'll be just like your hero.

[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.800]
Be a Pharaoh.

[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.320]
Forget about it.

[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:11.660]
Oh, now we know the only thing in your belly is gravy.

[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.440]
All these kids make us real mad.

[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:20.200]
Cause there is something with you that can't be had.

[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.100]
It's called a dad.

[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.860]
Your children can't win.

[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.740]
You don't have a need for a man when you're a lesbian.

[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:31.840]
Yeah.

[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:38.120]
Oh, there's a new rosy child.

[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:41.940]
She's got a way to keep them coming.

[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:44.540]
You and me, you remember?

[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:45.600]
Wait a while.

[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:49.180]
A top thin rosy or a barren woman.

[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:53.100]
You better hope that your show keeps going.

[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:57.200]
Cause when it's done girl, we won all the kids.

[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:06.120]
Give them back, give them back, give them back their babies.

[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:09.620]
Wow, this is a shock.

[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:10.340]
Am I this exciting?

[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:11.840]
Indeed.

[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:13.720]
Guess how many more precincts we got now?

[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:14.920]
One, three.

[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:16.200]
Woo!

[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.980]
We started this morning.

[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:20.460]
It's a little, it's Florida babies, so it's a little slow.

[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:25.780]
Especially date and, so now we're up to 6,530 precincts out of 6717,

[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:29.280]
which means there are, let's see, a 13187.

[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:30.880]
How many of these seven precincts left to go?

[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.240]
Wait, and we have no idea how many votes are in them.

[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.200]
Follow what I'm saying?

[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.260]
40 cents.

[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:36.620]
I'm saying who knows?

[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.780]
Filmic bride, 596, 744.

[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:41.060]
Okay?

[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.520]
Janet, Reno, 577, 930, and the Darrell.

[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.400]
By the way, thanks Darrell.

[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:47.840]
Thanks for throwing a monkey wrench in there.

[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.640]
See now, somebody's gonna make something out of that.

[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:51.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:51.980]
I don't know.

[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.040]
Somebody's gonna make something because I said monkey wrench.

[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.740]
Just, it's just one of those things is what it is.

[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.260]
So anyway, what's the difference now?

[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.760]
18,000.

[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:05.120]
She picked up a little bit on that, on that blip.

[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:07.520]
She picked up, it was, what was the difference?

[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.060]
19,000, 1,414.

[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:09.720]
I wrote it down.

[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.600]
Well, I'll figure it out.

[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:11.460]
You figure it out?

[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:12.820]
No, I'm not.

[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.460]
Oh, that's right, because you're a weak in math.

[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.080]
577, 930, it's my one strong suit.

[02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:22.740]
418, so it's 18,000, 888, 14.

[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:26.740]
So she picked up like 300 votes in three precincts.

[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:27.500]
Okay.

[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:27.860]

[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:30.960]
Now, so if you like what, what you can't do that,

[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.020]
but just assuming she gained 300 votes in our Hamae left,

[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.140]
oh, this thing is gonna be tighter than a witch's ass, man.

[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:40.520]
This thing is gonna be so damn tight.

[02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:43.140]
And of course, when you get it down to like within a few votes either way,

[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:44.520]
then it's really easy to fix.

[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.560]
In fact, that's probably why this is taking so long.

[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:50.780]
They have to go back and find the formula from two years ago.

[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.200]
When they get it right down to the very nip and tuck,

[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:57.140]
and then they bring in the big guys to knock the door down.

[02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:58.040]
Let us in.

[02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:58.840]
Let us in.

[02:05:58.860 --> 02:05:59.760]
You know, all of the Jeb's guys.

[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.180]
So there you go, 6530.

[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:03.620]
You think I'd have just tried one more time.

[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:04.880]
Maybe they're loading in now.

[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:05.220]
Huh?

[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:06.200]
That's free to try.

[02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:07.260]
Oh, look at that.

[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:07.500]
Nothing.

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:09.660]
6530.

[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.120]
Okay, it's 22 to 1 at 560WQ.

[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:13.840]
Oh, we got the mad dog.

[02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:15.260]
Now, what's the story with the rest of the day there?

[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:16.540]
They're gonna be as morbid as Mosho.

[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:17.080]
What's this morning?

[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.520]
We don't know.

[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:19.940]
Well, that's what Clarence was saying.

[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:23.180]
Hey, Clarence, I'm sorry if we wounded your feelings or something.

[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.540]
But we planned this.

[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.060]
And you know something else I was just thinking?

[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:26.520]
What?

[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.840]
But before I got sidetracked by looking at those new numbers,

[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:31.200]
I'm thinking because this Wednesday is Humpty,

[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:32.900]
it's the middle of the week, all those other clichés.

[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.460]
I'm thinking like from 11 to 1 every Wednesday.

[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:36.680]
Hey.

[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.380]
What do you think that's a good idea?

[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:39.300]
It's a wonderful idea.

[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:40.120]
Seriously.

[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.520]
Or Monday or Friday.

[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:44.380]
No, no, no, no, no, that would not be good.

[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.680]
I'm just saying Wednesday, middle of the week, 11 to 1.

[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.380]
Two hours of stuff.

[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:50.180]
I'm about fun and games are some good laughs.

[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:51.400]
Love it.

[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:52.900]
Would save my throat a little bit?

[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.680]
I think it's a swell idea.

[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:58.100]
Well, let's put it to committee and the answer is yes.

[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.640]
Here's the place where the answer will be yes.

[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:01.880]
If you're trying to lose some weight with that,

[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.440]
then that's the lights of West Boker.

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:05.120]
When you go into a regular supermarket,

[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:08.100]
you go up and down the aisle and maybe in some supermarkets,

[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.420]
they're like a little tiny section of what they call diet foods.

[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:11.380]
Forget about it.

[02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:12.880]

You know who lives in Boker?

[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:21.260]

Oh, that the Lord even loves neo-rodgers.

[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:47.720]
She won't go down, but it is up again.

[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:49.620]
You're never gonna keep the town.

[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.020]
She won't go down.

[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:52.220]

What it is up again?

[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:06.420]

You're never gonna keep the town.

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.160]
How long is it up to you?

[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:08.920]
It's up to you.

[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:12.400]
With you, so you must play.

[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:13.740]
He's trying to whisk his drink.

[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:14.900]
He's trying to block the drink.

[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.900]
Needed hard to drink to get her into.

[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:19.340]
He tells her that it really makes him feel good.

[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:20.520]
He tells him that he's over the gut.

[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:21.380]
What the hell is over the gut?

[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:21.680]
What?

[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:35.060]
You're never gonna keep the town.

[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:37.660]
She won't go down, money to jump again

[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:41.060]
You're never gonna keep me down, she won't go down

[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:44.100]
Money to jump again, you're never gonna keep me down

[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:46.720]
She won't go down, money to jump again

[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.700]
You're never gonna keep me down

[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:51.860]
You won't go down, money to jump again

[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.200]
Every guy's dead day is a news in 40

[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:02.620]
We have a yellow light

[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:06.800]
They have something to hide

[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:10.620]
Not how they, but if you lay their eyes

[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:12.620]
What's really heavy?

[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.740]
Kind of surplus you, and you fool

[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:19.060]
Like the yellow light

[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:23.200]
The light, the color for free you're right

[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.620]
And that is why we have a yellow light

[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:34.640]
Got explained at the length of what he's like to

[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.560]
What he's like to reach his cat in sex

[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:43.400]
With a dead of no friends and doodles or two

[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:47.320]
And he's a guy dead

[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.740]
What's the future of the day?

[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.880]
Have a yellow light

[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.460]
What's that height?

[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:55.820]
Something they can't define

[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:00.200]
That's why we have a yellow light

[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.380]
A big light, every time they're crazy

[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:08.140]
You are funny, we have a yellow light

[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:16.740]
That's why we have a yellow light

[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:20.760]
A big light, every time they're crazy

[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.300]
You are funny

[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.960]
With a little look as I address

[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.920]
I am for her full number

[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:38.700]
I am for her, her trails

[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:41.300]
What you want to know please

[02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:44.740]
Am I a mad to me?

[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.920]
She said I gotta leave you

[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:50.760]
I got somewhere else to be

[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:55.300]
She said I'm gonna run from you

[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:58.140]
I got somewhere else to be

[02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:01.680]
Don't know where I can't run from you

[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:06.040]
That's it, hold my hand

[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:11.720]
Hold my hand

[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:17.800]
Hold my hand

[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.260]
Hold my hand

[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:24.500]
Hold my hand

[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:26.580]
Hold my hand

[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:35.340]
560 WQA is proud to announce how her David is dead

[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.460]
Hey, they killed how it

[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:41.800]
Forget about it, consequently after days of intensive shock therapy

[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.520]
Management emerged with a brand new lineup

[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:46.500]
For the vacationing Howard David

[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:51.460]
Starting tomorrow, wake up with the Joe Markinsund Joe

[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:56.220]

[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:59.140]
With Periodic Sports updates by Yieldy

[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:01.900]
That's the Joe Markinsund Joe

[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:05.900]
Now on 560 WQAM

[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.960]
We're down in Jamaica in the catapoean

[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.700]
Take out the best burp that you ever seen

[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:25.680]
Ask anybody in that table

[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:29.880]
They tell you this is country where the gun's a beautiful

[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:30.660]
Are you sure?

[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.780]
Perhaps the man has some he wants to sell

[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:38.540]
And from a mile away you can detect the smell of smoke

[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:42.380]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.220]
He lights up the spliff and choke

[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:50.120]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.860]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:57.960]
The gun's a few good

[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:04.000]
You've been carrying lots of herb in the gunny sack

[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.040]
Smoke it every day until your lungs turn black

[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.960]
With all the money that we have made

[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.580]
Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid

[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:19.560]
American tourists come here and say

[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.900]
Got nothing like this tender U.S. hey they smoke

[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:28.280]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.640]
They light up the spliff and choke

[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:35.340]
They begin to cough and choke

[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.220]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:43.340]
They're gunny, be good

[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:49.480]
Mama Delphus on you are an ostomans

[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:53.340]
You like to smoke the giant spliff whenever you can

[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:57.140]
Many people coming here from miles around

[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:00.920]
To bite the herb for you by the ounce of new ground

[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:04.660]
Raster man say to her, mama you're right

[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:09.240]
They gun, just be good tonight and then they smoke

[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.240]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:17.020]
They light up the spliff and choke

[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:22.180]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:24.580]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:27.040]
You're waking here these numbers man, you're gonna puke

[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.660]
Not that there's new numbers but I extrapolated

[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:33.660]
She picked up 300 votes and was last to 3%

[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:36.960]
So if you extract and those were from Broward not dating

[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.800]
She's doing better than date

[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.320]
So if you extrapolate 183 precincts on count it and divided by 3

[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:43.580]
In other words for every 3 if she picked up 300

[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:46.320]
She would gain 18300

[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.620]
Before we get in McBride was leading by 18814

[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:52.560]
You

[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:54.220]
How do you like that?

[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:54.720]
I know

[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:55.940]
It sounds sinister to me

[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:57.220]
It's what it sounds like

[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:59.800]
Anyway Northwest Airlines speaking of sinister North

[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:01.880]
West Airlines plane diverted to Fort Smith Arkansas

[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:04.720]
After report of suspicious passengers

[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:07.800]
A north west airline jet was diverted to Fort Smith's airport

[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.740]
Today after 3 passengers locked themselves in a bathroom

[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:12.980]
A lot of stuff going on in the bathroom sunny's planes

[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:13.380]
Yep

[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:16.480]
The other passengers departed from the plane safely

[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:20.300]
Flight 979 and Airbus A320 traveling from Memphis to Vegas

[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:22.260]
landed at Fort Smith late this morning

[02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:24.660]
Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert be saying

[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:27.580]
Police and firefighters surrounded the aircraft no one was reported injured

[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:30.560]
Jim Harris a spokesman for governor Mike Huckabee said the three men

[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.020]
appeared to be of middle eastern descent

[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:36.440]
The Bush administration raised the nation's terror world while we know that

[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.680]
The State Department of Emergency Management said some sort of negotiations were held between officials

[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:43.100]
And the three passengers and one of the planes bathrooms

[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.640]
Passengers were taken out maybe they're having a party in there

[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:49.520]
Passengers were taken off and then negotiating through the bathroom

[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:52.180]
Said Jennifer Gordon a spokeswoman for the department

[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:55.060]
The FBI was interrogating the three men according to the TSA

[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.780]
It wasn't clear who reported suspicions to the airline

[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:01.140]
The TSA said the three men have been acting strangely on the plane

[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:05.220]
But gave no specifics beyond saying that the three locked themselves in a bathroom

[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:10.060]
No other air traffic in the air was affected since the Dave Stiegman spoke to him for the TSA

[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.400]
Wow

[02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:14.940]
Anyway, no reason to get panicky, you know what I'm saying?

[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.000]

An attack on our country one that unfolded before our very eyes

[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:22.540]
