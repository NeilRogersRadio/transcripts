[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.020]
Hi, it's Peewee Herman. Take it from me. They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.720]
Don't look. Oh, Jeff, is that you in there? Yeah, I am Pauly. I'm making.

[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.380]
That's your Greg? Yeah, Jeffer is always in the finest of men's wear. I hope you don't mind to

[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.980]
fight Barrow the adjacent star. What are you doing in the staff's turtle? Oh, I was in the area.

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:45.820]
No time to waste, you know. So, what's new, high boy? I'm fat. Yes, yes. Are we really up for sale, Greg?

[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:56.600]
What's a say? How about them, Dalphin? I guess it's true what they say. And what's that? Your

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.540]
do-do-do doesn't speak. Why, of course. Always of the likeful aromatic bouquet with the freshness of morning dew.

[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.620]
Each drop sliced with cigar cutter perfection to the shape of a Hershey's kiss.

[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:21.500]
Yeah. Yeah. You know, in that moment, this is doing a wonderful job.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.260]
I hope you think that forced Brooklyn ease makes them sound so so knowledgeable.

[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.460]
Wouldn't you say? Well, gotta go. Bye.

[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.100]
Bye. 903 at 560 WQM. That brings back those awful memories. I never got to see it. They splatter around the wall. Remember that?

[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.480]
Oh, in the tea room. You lucked out. Oh, brother. I don't think I'd have ever recovered from that. Look at that. The sun is shining.

[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.980]
Okay. Look at that. There's a little bit of sunshine, a little bit of blue sky. All weekend long. I'm talking to people there, including this morning.

[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.860]
Oh, it was so cold here this weekend. What a bunch of pussy's, man. What's wrong with you guys?

[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.960]
I didn't say it was cold. Don't we have any real people down there like any real men? He meant like me?

[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.880]
Yeah, the head you didn't. You said it was a real chilly. It was a cool. Everybody I talked to. Boy, cheer was freezing here this weekend.

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.240]
Saying like it was a good thing. Yeah. 30 degrees when the high the high Saturday here was 30. The high yesterday was 30 speaking to Jeff.

[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.440]
And we got about three, four inches of snow on the ground. Let's hear it. How right? So long with that. Don't bother me.

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.200]
Long you don't have to shovel it. You don't have to drive in it or be shoveling it.

[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.300]
1218 votes. Pretty lame response on a pool over the weekend. I thought I was pretty lame. Don't you?

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.260]
To be expected. Yeah. And you want to know why? Because we didn't have enough negatives in there. I forgot where I was talking to.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.280]
When you forget about soft floor to see that's what happens when you out of touch. That's what Tom Jikker says.

[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.160]
Tom Jikker's got a nice puff piece about why 100 today. Absolutely nothing.

[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.420]
Tom, you're a loser baby. Let's face it. You're so out of touch. It doesn't make any difference. What's going on around you? Totally oblivious.

[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.300]
But that's all right because we sure want any wouldn't want any more free publicity for us would we? That would be bad. Now we're not going to do that after I ripped it. That little bald head bastard.

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.640]
And your buddy Kevin bastard over there at the heralders another one for you oblivious in a dream world in a vacuum.

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.780]
From 118 votes we asked over the past month which of these things about Neil showed you enjoy the most.

[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.600]
See they don't like something like positive like that. That's a don't give him too many chances to say something really hostile.

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.200]
The phone calls are back. This is the shocker to me especially after Friday that last hour. And by the way Eddie, Steve and whatever your name is. What's his name Steve want?

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.180]
McGowan Steve it is Steve and maybe he's the drug guy. Maybe for all we know. Now.

[00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:11.180]
You know what I'm going to say. But I'm going to say that.

[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.380]
Well just the way it is I got a lot of stuff here today. Not more periodicals on audio. Yeah.

[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.320]
None of the above I liked it better before 241 19.7% well that 20% of the audience may be a little bit more pleased today. It just so happens all the new tabloids came out yesterday.

[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:39.200]
I got stuff about OJ buying titties for his girlfriend. That's what the globe says anyway OJ by $7,000 boobs to make lover look like Nicole and we got just all kinds of good stuff.

[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.380]
Wednesday comedy bit noon to one hour 197 16.1% like that the best.

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:56.940]
Less reading 148 more filling and less reading 12% 148 and the tone is better 144 11.7% proving that we could put any selection on any pool any day.

[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.780]
It'll get a whole bunch of votes. Does anybody know what that means the tone is better. No, I like this tone. Yeah. I like this tone myself.

[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:18.180]
But anyway, the tone is better. What does that mean? Can anybody tell us of course now they like your complexion and oh speaking of what they like and what they don't like. Let me say this with all due respect to my close personal buddy Mo.

[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:32.400]
I thought about it for at least six seconds over the weekend. Our line before I told you four seconds. I thought about it for about six seconds over the weekend about might be in sloppy and a slab and this and I wear the same stuff on and you know what?

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.740]
Maybe not be the same stuff but it always pretty much the same and that's me. See I'm a slab and I'm not going to come in there when I come back. I'm not going to end there dressed up in a zoo suit. It's a radio show.

[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.600]
If I want to come in there in a burlap sack. Does the audience know it? Of course not. Yeah, guarantee you when you walked on the street. People don't point and snicker.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.260]
See, see there you go again. There you go again. Just like water. Just like Reagan said a water mondail.

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:12.040]
Look what happened to water mondail. Who exactly? There you go again. Starting in again. Yeah, they say they say it all depends if it's in the summertime.

[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:21.220]
I like right now when you were in a heavy leather coat or a jacket whatever because it's colder than crap out there. Nobody sees what you're wearing underneath. You just somebody with a person.

[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.940]
I got to tell you there's some crazy people here too. Saturday it's 30 degrees out there. It's like an inch and a half a snow already on the ground. The snow is continuing to come out at a pretty good rate.

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:43.420]
And there's people walking outside here with sweaters on. Do you follow what I'm saying? Right. I'm not talking about like a heavy sweater. I'm just like a sweater. You know? Yeah. Yeah. See it.

[00:06:43.420 --> 00:07:12.280]
And I'm thinking what is wrong with you people? I mean, I know you're a little bit unless it gets like 20 below or something Fahrenheit. These people are bizarre. So anyway, I'm just going to be the slab that I am. I'm not going to put on any ears for anybody. And I'm not going to like go out and get a whole new wardrobe, but especially for inside the building. I'm a slab. That's me. Okay. So my and my pants aren't wrinkled. No shirts. Maybe they are a little bit. That's because my maid is a crappy job. Okay. Oh, sorry, Genie. Hey, you bought a bunch of new shirts a few years ago.

[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:28.220]
Yeah. And that's that's the next point. Okay. Since I took so much crap about it, especially from George and others. The way I the way I dress now, which may not be all that great compared the way it used to be with those. Yeah, with those falling off juke pants. I'm a fashion plate compared the way I used to be.

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.880]
So if I was like Moe would have been there in those days, he'd say boy, this guy sure is butch stuff a little bit. At least the way he dresses anyhow. Follow what I'm saying. That's.

[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:49.420]
Now remember what we did on Friday. I said the first call of the day determines the tone for the day. Huh? It's the pace call. Here's our pace call today from Miami. Hello. Yeah. I think the reason why I was able to those boots were there.

[00:07:49.640 --> 00:08:05.080]
So she looked just like Nicole where he could kill. I love it. I see that was good. I like the tone of that. That was magnificent.

[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:23.520]
That was great. Now you see if we can get a lot of calls like that, I'd never read anything on here again. We just take calls all day. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority in spite of the response in this pool here. I don't want to pee on your parade folks, but the response on a pool was a disheartening at best. Okay.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:37.440]
A year old pornography investigation is led to the filing of criminal charges against two Hollywood actors Paul Rubens, best known as P. We Herman, sports court and veteran actor character actor Jeffrey Jones of Ferris Bueller's Day off. We had the Jeffrey Jones part on Friday.

[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:49.820]
Rubens was charged with one misdemeanor kind of possessing materials depicting children under the age of 18 engage in sexual conduct said. Anna Garcia, she spoke with the city attorney's office. He's surrendered to authority. Friday was released on $20,000 bail.

[00:08:49.820 --> 00:09:16.560]
Jones who played the up had principal and comic foil to Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day off, was charged with having a 14 year old boy, not a good idea, Jeffrey. A 14 year old boy to pose for sexually explicit photos, a felony, as well as Mr. Meener possession of child porn. He was freed on $20,000 bond after surrendering Thursday. Rubens 50 and Jones 56 are acquaintances and both cases stem from the same police investigation said LA County D a spokeswoman Sandy Gibbons.

[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:26.620]
Rubens could face as much as he or she and $2,500 fine of convicted. If Jones be convicted, he faces up to three years in prison and would have to register as a sex offender for a life.

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:38.720]
Hiring a 14 year old boy to pose for sexually explicit photos, like I said, probably not a real good idea. Then we got this story here, which is enough to make me want to blow my brains out or blow something.

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:08.640]
The reason I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not a woman, I'm not

[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:59.300]
I vote for Bush, I vote for Gore, I leave the country, I wouldn't vote or I'd blow my brains out, I think five excellent choices If the 2004 presidential election pits President Bush against Al Gore, I vote for Bush, I vote for Gore, I leave the country, I wouldn't vote or I'd blow my brains out That'll be on there momentarily

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:10.960]

Come on stop breaking my balls

You're good

[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.860]
That's a hundred thousand

[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.760]
I let one speak out

[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.440]
I feel the duplow

[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.420]
I lifted my legs

[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.500]
It smells like an egg

[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.200]
Now my clothes are so tender

[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.340]
Try to hold in your fire

[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.320]
I'll try but that's kind of hard

[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.800]
Don't go breaking apart

[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.840]
And don't buy those hot pots

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.220]
Don't go breaking apart

[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.100]
Don't go breaking apart

[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.520]
Don't go breaking apart

[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.480]
Don't go breaking apart

[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.460]
I need 15-560-2M

[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.060]
So, uh, Q-M is on North Koreans, they got the bomb

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.840]
They got a nuclear weapon is what they announced yesterday or over the weekend

[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.960]
And then last night on 60 minutes, there's that awful puff piece with Bob Woodward

[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.780]
who's plugging his new book about El Presidente

[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.280]
And they got the bushmeister on telling everybody about how much he hates Q-M is on

[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.080]
Which at least he knows the names now, which I think is his definite right direction

[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.400]
Don't you have to flash cards, lots and lots of flashcards

[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.780]
Yeah

[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.380]
Nine votes, the poll is up

[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.040]
We have preliminary results, okay?

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.120]
Let's, uh, if the 2004 presidential election pits president Bush against Al Gore

[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.180]
I'd vote for Gore for

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.680]
I'd vote for Bush too

[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.280]
I'd blow my brains out of pair

[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.300]
I'd leave the country one and I wouldn't vote none

[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.300]
Oh yeah, sure

[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.620]
I wouldn't vote none

[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.620]
I didn't vote this last time, but that's only because it was already a done deal

[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.460]
Didn't I tell you that the jebster was ahead 15 points

[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.980]
You wound up winning by 13 points

[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.980]
What a tragedy, what a travesty

[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.780]
And also, well, let's be forget this depressing Gore story

[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:46.740]
I was thinking just before the show, you know, then I mentioned you this morning that a good place to be in the foreseeable future would be like Geneva, New York

[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.640]
Yeah, or if Salani, Michigan, or any other little bump for it

[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.460]
And yeah, you see the people who live in rural areas now, they don't have to be all uptight

[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.600]
Can you imagine?

[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.600]
And I realized that there will be studies done because every for some strange reason we can always appropriate certain

[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.520]
Enormous amounts of money, millions and millions for these studies

[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:11.460]
But there will be somebody doing studies about the stress factor for people who live in New York or DC or in other major metropolitan urban areas

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.600]
As opposed to people who live like out in the boondocks

[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:14.880]
Right

[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.100]
In fact, they basically want to play Billy Joe Royal and out down in the boondocks

[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.720]
Which they've already done studies like that

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.640]
Yes

[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.180]
And obviously the people that live in rural areas are way more laid back and easy going

[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.600]
Well, no, not just laid back, but they have less stress

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.020]
Right, let's crash, let's crash, that's why they're laid back

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.660]
Because they don't have to worry about somebody dropping a lot of bomba, see unskynectating New York

[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.420]
I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon

[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.700]
Should we press our luck on the phone thing here?

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.440]
Why not?

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.860]
Because I think, you know, you never know, I could be in for a tremendous surprise

[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.620]
Well, because the lady in L.A.D.

[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.000]
Hello

[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.400]
Hey, no

[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.380]
Yes, ma'am

[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.120]
I'm calling only because, well, I really don't have all that much to say

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.040]
But one is that I really get to listen to you and if the joy when I do

[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.840]
Yes it is

[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:07.760]
And my question is, there is oftentimes in between your show a guy who does advertising for you guys

[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.980]
Like he does a simple green ad and he does something else

[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.840]
What did they find these people?

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.080]
It's the worst voice you have ever heard

[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.060]
You mean Tommy?

[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.060]
I don't know who it is that I have like a...

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.180]
I have like a...

[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.940]
Like a squeaky voice that sounds almost like a girl

[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.280]
Yeah, I would turn it off and go to another station

[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.500]
It is horrible

[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.240]
Uh-huh

[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.520]
That's just my complaint

[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.800]
Well, he works cheap though

[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.380]
Well, that's probably why

[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.900]
Well, listen, it's always good to hear you

[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.680]
Plus, Pussy, he has naked pictures of several people, management level people

[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.180]
He has naked pictures of them with billy goats

[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.780]
Well, I guess then he's going to be on there for a while

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.660]
Yeah, he will

[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.380]
Okay

[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.300]
Alright, you know, have a great day

[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.740]
Thanks, sweetheart, have a great day

[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.560]
And quit ripping Tommy, we like Tommy a lot

[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.560]
Tommy's one of our people, okay?

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.780]
He's one of our super spies

[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.080]
Tommy is up and down a hallway

[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.940]
In fact, he's usually bumping into the water Nazi

[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.100]
He ever seen the times when they're like coming from different directions around a hallway

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.160]
And they're like bumping into each other?

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.660]
No, I miss that

[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.240]
Oops!

[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.200]
Oops!

[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.660]
As they got the ear to the door, you know, that kind of thing

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.240]
Leave Tommy alone, okay?

[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.840]
He's got a squeaky voice, but he's a good guy

[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.640]
He can't help himself

[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.880]
He's a little, you know

[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.720]
I always told you about Tommy, he never agreed with me

[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:17.980]
He sounds...

[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.440]
He sounds fay, okay?

[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.700]
He sounds fay

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.240]
He says, Bush's they come, he's got a nice girlfriend, I guess

[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080]
Have we ever seen her?

[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.720]
Oh yeah, I've known Don for years

[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:27.980]
Don?

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:28.520]
Don

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.340]
Oh, Don

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.240]
I'm trying to help you, Tommy

[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.360]
Yeah, Tommy, this guy's got the shovel

[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.080]
He's bearing you this morning, Tommy

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.380]
Come in here and beat him up a little bit

[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.320]
I think you can handle it

[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.740]
As in the morning, Don

[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.960]
Yeah, that's terrible

[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.120]
42 votes, score 13, Bush 11

[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.440]
I blow my brains out eight

[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.380]
I leave the country five

[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.500]
I wouldn't vote five

[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.380]
Now the honesty is starting to seep through a little bit

[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.660]
It's seeping, okay?

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.580]
You can relate to that

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.540]
Those are your people out there who are squeezing your bag

[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.220]
Hard this morning

[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.160]
Because they keep telling this boy

[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.660]
It's going to be really ugly, especially if we invade Iraq

[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.920]
It's going to bring all hell loose, okay?

[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.100]
And then you wonder, well, how come we're doing it then?

[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.220]
Well, you know, but you're going to have to die

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.880]
We're going to have some spectacular attacks

[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.400]
It's just kind of strange, and it was made to you really wish that you were in the Des Moines, Iowa

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.820]
I think it'd be safe there, wouldn't you?

[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.040]
Or maybe, maybe Omaha

[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.000]
I see Omaha is big enough that it's not like a little, you know, right?

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.900]
Omaha is not bad

[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.280]
They got the great steak houses, but what else do they have in New Landmark?

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.920]
And of course, after this horrible attack, maybe we'll have some of that great irradiated beef

[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.100]
At those steak houses

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.260]
Where you'll be safe

[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.420]
Here's Homestead, hello

[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.760]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.480]
All right

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.680]
I got a couple questions

[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.860]
I don't get a chance to listen as much

[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.560]
Because I usually drive the truck up in the center part of the state

[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.460]
A Ricken said, I'm here anywhere in the country

[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.300]
No, no, they're on the pitch

[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:59.100]
The other question is, what's bigger, a major asshole or a general asshole?

[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.700]
I'll tell you what, when you finish looking in the mirror, call us back and let us know

[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.400]
A ranch general Schwarzkoff, he'll tell you, oh no, you can't say that!

[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.780]
Oh, there he goes again, picking on our right wing heroes

[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.560]
Old Normie, that'd be a good pull question to take one day

[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.360]
Kennis Masamacho, a Normie Schwarzkoff or Norma Kent

[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.160]
Maybe we'll do that one tomorrow

[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.880]
Speaking of polls, most say, girl be on the end

[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.440]
You know, interesting thing about the phones

[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.400]
Now, Friday, for some reason, toward the latter part of the show, we had a little bit of a Thursday

[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.660]
Now, these calls so far, these three calls are sounded like these people are right on my balcony out here

[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.260]
You know, yeah, no problem

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.380]
And there shouldn't be any problem

[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.680]
I mean, shouldn't it call so I'm just like you're punching it up right there?

[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.240]
Right there

[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.400]
They always have before

[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.500]
I mean, it's coming down a wire either way

[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.860]
Right, but for some strange reason on part of Thursday and then Friday that last hour

[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.100]
I guess it was just destined to be crap the last hour, you know?

[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.340]
I don't know what that's all about

[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.700]
By the way, congratulations Dolphins, be the girls team

[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.240]
A little girls team and I told you that, poor Naveen Paul, he's looking his wounds there

[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.460]
That defense, very suspects, we heard, I told you they weren't going to be the waiters out there last night

[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.480]
Didn't I tell them that on Friday?

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.240]
I guess I did

[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.320]
Did I tell them that Carlos?

[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.640]
Yep, I said no chance, no way Jose

[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.140]
And poor Tom Brady, man, that kid's, he's doing it

[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.060]
He does it for me, I'll tell you that

[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.460]
And all this crap that goes on, you know, just like last week's unbelievable

[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.160]
Come from behind, pay to your victory over the bears, one of the most phenomenal performances in history

[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.280]
No credit on this radio station because you want to know the one word that describes why?

[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.260]
Jealousy

[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.620]
That's what it's all about

[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.300]
Mad Dog, all these other sports that are done there station

[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.640]
They would lick pounds of dog excrement to have Tom Brady be the Dolphin quarterback

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.880]
And you know that, is there any doubt about that?

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.340]
No

[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.580]
No, no doubt

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.480]
They would kiss his grits to have him beat a quarterback

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.040]
I mean, Ray Lucas, yeah, he played a good game against the old girls

[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.580]
I'll tell you, I watch him and he's still a sophomore, it's the word that comes to mind, you know

[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.460]
He just, I don't know

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.380]
Yeah, he's not bad

[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.320]
He's not not bad, but he's not the, I don't know

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.700]
For like a sandalot team, he looks pretty good

[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.080]
He just don't impress me all that much, but he did a very good job yesterday

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.840]
I'll grant you that against a very, very embarrassing team

[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]
He was very adequate

[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.940]
Yeah, that's a good description

[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:12.480]
With the next presidential election two years away, undeclared candidate Elle Gore is trailing in a new poll

[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.660]
Trailing or not, Gore's name likely will be on about most people think this is going to CNN

[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:23.080]
A CNN slash time poll, conducted on November 13 and 14, shows that two thirds of the public think Gore will be the

[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.840]
likely Democratic nominee in 2004

[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.960]
Oh my God

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.200]
But half-surveys said the former vice president won't win the White House, only 41% of the day will form a election where hell today

[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.880]
I'll be honest with you, 41% isn't all that bad against the incumbent

[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.580]
I'm not saying that I want him on air, but that really isn't all that bad

[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.240]
Especially when you consider the fact that he actually got a half million more votes this last time in the fixed election

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.480]
The poll was conducted by interviewing 1,000 six people including 454 Democrats

[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.540]
It had a maximum error margin of plus or minus 6% of his points, Maso Manos

[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.440]
Most Democrats surveyed said they'd like to see Gore run for president

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.080]
Really, pure respondents said it would benefit the party if he won the nomination

[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:07.940]
Among Democrats, 61% would like to see him run again, little more than half of those 55% said it would be good for the party to have him on a firm to be on the ticket

[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.880]
Does this make any sense to you? If 55% said it would be good enough to have him on the ticket, then only 41% said they vote for him

[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.300]
Does that make any sense to you?

[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.660]
Nope

[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:20.940]
Okay

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.900]
So like I said, take that poll and stick it up Paul Azanzas, okay?

[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.920]
I know for that CNN crap, but we like our poll today though because it gives you several choices

[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.160]
Including of course, pulling your brains out or moving to Dubuque Iowa, which where you'll be safe

[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.080]
See, those survivalists, we always laughed at them, you know the ones that got all the candles stored up

[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.180]
Huh? I used to when I used to live around them

[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.060]
Right, and now you're starting to say they might have been on to something that bastards

[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.300]
Yes, indeed

[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.660]
This corn sure is special, it's been sitting on the can for about 30 years, but it's still okay

[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.400]
Got a lot of good preservatives in there

[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:51.740]
Right!

[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.420]
You're laughing man

[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.220]
No, no more

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.140]
What was that stuff that Dick Kavett used to advertise? Top shelf, was that what it was called?

[00:22:59.240 --> 00:22:59.800]
I don't know

[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.840]
Yeah, Kavett

[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.720]
Dick Kavett

[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.740]
You better get with it

[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.140]
I've heard his name before

[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.220]
Top shelf, it's like the little and that stuff would last like forever

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.120]
Little on-trays, you never tried that stuff

But, uh, no, but it lasts forever

9-32-5-60 WDQ

[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.180]
You notice Carlos how that collar enables this disappeared on line 9?

[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.440]
Yep

[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.860]
You notice how cleverly I just did that during that the bit

[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.600]
Anyway, no, because I already know who that is

[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.860]
You probably don't believe me do you?

[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.200]
I remember that call from New York that came in

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.500]
And I told you was the guy the uh, a bullied guy

[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.400]
Right, I know him

[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.020]
All I have to do is see where it's from and what line it's on

[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.620]
And I can tell you exactly who it is

[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.560]
Man arrested at Miami Airport with hidden gun

[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.860]
A Haitian man has been arrested for attempting to board a flight from Miami to Haiti

[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.080]
While allegedly to carrying a handgun and 50 bullets hidden in the DVD player authority said

[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.280]
That'd be a good pull question

[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.860]
Where would you rather hide your bullets in the DVD or in your DVDs

[00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.930]
Andre Riggüins, who's a legal US resident, was being held yesterday at the

[00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.130]
Federal detention center in Miami, pending initial appearance in federal court today

[00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.990]
Said FBI spokeswoman Judy Orwella

[00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.210]
Riggüins was arrested Saturday at Miami International before boarding an American

[00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.930]
Airlines flight to Port-au-Prince the Haitian capital, she said

[00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.910]
A security screener found the gun after stopping Riggüins for a second look at his carry-on

[00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:14.190]
Luggage

[00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:19.390]
Inside the bag the screener found a DVD player that held the handgun and ammunition which were wrapped in

[00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.030]
Four line duct tape he said he needed it for protection in Haiti

[00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.610]
I believe him

[00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.070]
Riggüins, 33, was charged, well wait a minute but he's a US citizen

[00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:39.170]
Yeah, he was charged with attempting to carry weapon on to an airplane or Riggüins drove to Miami from Jonesboro, Georgia and

[00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.410]
That he lives in Georgia with his wife a US citizen too

[00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.190]
Hey stay in Jonesboro, Georgia you'll be safe

[00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.610]
Right? I guess I don't know where it is

[00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.490]
Now seriously I think that would be an interesting pull question to take course there's so many possibilities

[00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.590]
You know thousands of them but with all these scared things all these warnings now

[00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.790]
We're still under yellow light by the way yellow light nobody panic yellow light

[00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.670]
Anybody get all nervous that's what Tom Ridge said this morning you look at him when he's on there

[00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.030]
They hit him on CNN a little clip

[00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.570]
And don't you feel safe no don't you feel secure when you see him

[00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.470]
Would that kind of like blank look on his face

[00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.590]
Where do they find these people seriously where the hell do they find these people

[00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:25.170]
He's he's almost is imposing his Tommy Thompson but not quite the old cheesehead the old water from a crit guy

[00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.290]
Good golly miss Molly and of course I don't want to go into it

[00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.850]
Let's let's start it up. No we had that one great call to get us started here this morning

[00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:39.510]
Right and then that woman ripping into poor Tommy which I think is very very unfortunate why why did she do that

[00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.570]
A lot of people do you know but no but you notice we don't get a lot of women call us but a lot of them are so

[00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.450]
Bitchy they're always like pick it on people

[00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.110]
Women never heard of them

[00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:53.650]
God damn it how come you can't be pleasant like the women here

[00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.550]
They're all like it's like everybody else they're pleasant

[00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.570]
They hold the door for everybody else they like you know they're just pleasant

[00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.790]
Morning how are you you know people you don't know people you've never seen before

[00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.170]
And you hopefully you'll never see again

[00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.790]
But they're nice they're polite but South Florida is this ugly nasty streak

[00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.490]
Let's rip somebody think out we know through that on the show

[00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:19.650]
Do we ever we absolutely never doing now George wants to know how it gets about that that's part of our policy just like that

[00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.730]
QA and dress code that we got yeah that Moe is going to be enforcing

[00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.610]
I can't wait to get back there just for that reason alone so I'd come in as sloppy as I want to be

[00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.770]
Are you going to wear a QA and dress

[00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:33.430]
I might have to try to get a straight about a guy I kid in the dress too that's later on in my pile

[00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.070]
Which I better get going here

[00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.470]
I think I'm going to use this one next because this

[00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:45.430]
See you always are let me making fun of things that I say and then come to find out I had my thumb on it

[00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.510]
Moriah puts the moves on out here's a picture this is in the star this week

[00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:55.150]
And the tabloids by the way come out here at least several days ahead of when you get them down there

[00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.390]
They may be published right in your backyard there in Lantana

[00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.990]
But they come out for some strange reason everywhere else in the world like a week ahead

[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.630]
This is the November 26 star page 18 and here's the picture of

[00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:13.350]
Moriah carries a former heartthrob Mexican singer Luis Miguel who by the way turned her down again second time

[00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:19.030]
Said you kid me you're not going to look at that thing get out of here bitch and here he's she's like all

[00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:25.050]
Cuzzle cuddled up in his lap and her smooching you know good photo opportunity

[00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.870]
Moriah puts the moves on P Diddy

[00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:28.990]
Oh yeah

[00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.790]
Member P Diddy and JLo

[00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:38.030]
Yep and now P Diddy's with Moriah who was formerly with Luis you start are you starting to put the pieces of this puzzle all together

[00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.050]
Okay, it's starting to paint a picture for you

[00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.750]
Does there seem to be something consistent going on here?

[00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.410]
And let's see who was it that was doing and reekay supposedly here recently?

[00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.770]
And reekay and a cornucova

[00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.330]
Oh yeah they're still doing it

[00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.390]
Yeah right it's a it's a big circle jerk is what it is

[00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.670]
Okay hey if that's wishful thinking great go with it I'm telling you right now

[00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:08.350]
I don't want to I don't want to name any individual names but I just want to say this just generally not connected with any name

[00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.250]
Necessarily spoken so far but maybe there's an awful lot of faghags out there

[00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.570]
Okay, okay, okay

[00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:24.070]
Troubled Moriah carries obsessed with hip hop mogul Sean P Diddy combs and determined to get her to get him to make a new woman out of her

[00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.090]
Haha

[00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.270]
Moriah believes that P Diddy and only P Diddy can wave a magic wand

[00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.130]
and restore the luster to a tarnished startup inside his reveal

[00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.910]
and they add that it's dressed diva is using every opportunity to see and be seen with combs

[00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.370]
When Moriah spotted the rapid prasaria to party October 28th in New York's Roseland Ballroom

[00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.850]
she was all over him as these close up and personal photo show

[00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.450]
Yeah, he's kissing her not on the cheek but like on the hair

[00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.250]
You know what I'm saying? In other words, he hasn't even brushed the hair back away from her cheek.

[00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.710]
No skin content. You can't get any more personal and up close than that.

[00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.370]
Mariah was gushing all over Puffy and I witnessed El Star. He gave her a peck on the cheek,

[00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.310]
but she couldn't keep her hands off him. It looked like she wanted everyone to see her with Sean.

[00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.430]
Mariah's motivation is simple.

[00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.990]
Says the source close to the 30-year-old singer. She's sick with worry over her career.

[00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.850]
And probably the fact she can't sing for Schmidt don't help either.

[00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:21.350]
Her mission is to receive a total musical makeover from P. Diddy, who made a name for himself producing music ranging from

[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:26.770]
Hardcore Gangster rap to bubble gum team pop and by cultivating artists like former lover Jennifer Lopez.

[00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:32.790]
When through the rain the first single from Mariah's new charm bracelet album came out in September it bombed.

[00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:38.030]
All right, still of self-ream Mariah retired today her place in music history to be assured.

[00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:43.170]
She sold more than 125 million albums worldwide, which to me is enough to make me puke my guts out.

[00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:50.170]
Her last major hit was Heartbreakers 99, which was number one for two weeks and stayed on Billboard magazine's top 40 chart for 14 weeks.

[00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:59.970]
But since then Mariah's career has been an entails spin for much publicized emotional and physical breakdown in July 2001 following her breakup with Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

[00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.590]
Landed her in a Connecticut mental hospital for weeks.

[00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.370]
A mental hospital.

[00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.070]
Things looked even grimmer after briefly with Rachi rapper M&M.

[00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:19.310]
The embarrassment of having virgin records pay her $30 million to buy their major for $80 million contract and her flop glitter soundtrack album.

[00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:23.970]
Flop bom una bomba grande compounding her problems.

[00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.550]
Mariah saw comfort and food and gained a huge amount of weight.

[00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.310]
She had to check herself into an exclusive fat farm earlier this year.

[00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.470]
So she's not in the nut house.

[00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.510]
She's in the fat farm.

[00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:38.970]
But inside her style star that music business pals recently confronted Mariah and told her bluntly that she's not selling because she's boring.

[00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.570]
They said you have to spice it up and stop feeling sorry for yourself.

[00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.150]
She's a source.

[00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:48.750]
They also put it out how Jennifer Lopez's musical career sword after she hooked up with 33 year old P. Diddy.

[00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.190]
Now Mariah is obsessed in getting the same treatment.

[00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.930]
Her publicist Cindy Berger says the couple's dealings are strictly business for now.

[00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.350]
They're friends.

[00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.590]
That's all I can tell you said Berger.

[00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.730]
But sources post-Amariah say she said in having P. Diddy take her under his wing.

[00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.710]
If he has wings does that mean he can fly?

[00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.550]
The bottom line is Mariah feels P. Diddy is strong.

[00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.530]
Successful and sexy says the source.

[00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.130]
And Mariah's eyes he be the answer to a whole lot of her problems on a whole lot of levels.

[00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.990]
How do you like that?

[00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.410]
And he's kissing her right on the old locks.

[00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.810]
This is for sweaty.

[00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:21.470]
You're bicep.

[00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.750]
You way up.

[00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:23.830]
Full Chamberlain, rate me.

[00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.610]
Oh, some are your other head.

[00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:32.730]
Evil do or the one we like the least.

[00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.210]
Yes.

[00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:43.350]
Oh, some of there's no safe place to hide you in the home Middle East.

[00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:53.290]
Oh, some of the days quickly approaching when you will just be dirt.

[00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:04.250]
Oh, some are hoping happen soon and I hope to God you hurt.

[00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.990]
Yeah.

[00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.190]
You silly fool.

[00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.530]
Well, come on, come on and level your own land.

[00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:10.870]
Well, hunch it down.

[00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.890]
You evil clown.

[00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:13.870]
Now what can't you understand?

[00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.490]
What are the books you in your grave?

[00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.570]
Drone grenades and every cave all summer.

[00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:30.770]
Miss those are coming down from the bombers and you won't have very long.

[00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.590]
Oh, some are your other head.

[00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:39.210]
Terrorist, you're a match and we're king.

[00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.150]
Oh.

[00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.270]
And I'm not afraid of you.

[00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:50.710]
You're not gonna scare me, me God, I'm strong.

[00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.090]
I am fallible.

[00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.050]
And there's a bomb.

[00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.310]
It's come right for my cave.

[00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.270]
There's a bomb coming right for my cave.

[00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.070]
Oh.

[00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.050]
It's silly fool.

[00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.250]
We'll bunker full.

[00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.470]
It's level your own land.

[00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.710]
We'll hunch it down.

[00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:06.830]
You evil clown.

[00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.650]
What can't you understand?

[00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.130]
What are the books you in your grave?

[00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.130]

[00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.410]
Drone grenades and every cave all summer.

[00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.930]
I'm 46 and 560 WDQA.

[00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.870]
I'm happy Monday to you.

[00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.330]
Totally unacceptable facts from New England Paul that I ripened Tom Brady.

[00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.150]
Hey, I tell you you're an ungrateful dickhead is what you are.

[00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.390]
Okay, get out of here, New England Paul.

[00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:30.790]
What a sour twist.

[00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.410]
Blames the game last night on Tom Brady.

[00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.450]
He's the one who lost the game.

[00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.130]
I don't think so.

[00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.010]
I've never lost.

[00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.910]
What?

[00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.690]
Said I had nothing to do with him.

[00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.230]
No.

[00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.950]
But that's a New England Paul.

[00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.350]
Another one of those knowledgeable soft food sports fans.

[00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.170]
Here's the facts.

[00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.150]
It could be one of the dumbest things I've ever read in my life.

[00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.570]
First of all, it says, did you see seven news this morning?

[00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.930]
How would I see Channel 7 news in Toronto?

[00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.550]
Huh?

[00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.930]
That's one of the great things about being.

[00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.850]
That's one of the greatest things about being here.

[00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.590]
It's not having to watch Channel 7 news or even coming across it by accident.

[00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:58.330]
Channel surfing.

[00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:04.230]
And that goes on to say news that's almost as shocking as the fact that President Lincoln's got a bad headache.

[00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.770]
Jeb Bush is looking into the recent elections.

[00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:10.050]
Somehow over 100,000 votes in Broward County were lost and not counted.

[00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.430]
The Bush games go on.

[00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.870]
Now what day was the election November 5?

[00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.310]
I should know because it was on my birthday.

[00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:16.670]
Yes.

[00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:22.230]
Within a couple of days after that, we knew that there was 103,000 votes that were not counted originally.

[00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.430]
And that they tabulated them and then come to fight out that didn't change anything.

[00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:26.890]
Remember that?

[00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.490]
Yep.

[00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.030]
So that's what that's all about.

[00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:33.630]
And here it is the 18th of November like days and days and weeks later.

[00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.830]
Hey, Neil, did you see this?

[00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.830]
Yeah, probably from time jikker.

[00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.030]
So what do you think?

[00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.670]
Ash debula?

[00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.730]
That sounds like avalanan Kansas.

[00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.310]
Yeah, I think it's a go cast for Wyoming.

[00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.850]
Although they might not like Wyoming too much because of the change.

[00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.590]
Might not be too safe there.

[00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.570]
How about Helena Montana?

[00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.210]
I've actually that.

[00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.910]
I'm gonna say to urban Helena.

[00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.410]
Keep going west into the hinterlands.

[00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.810]
How much shall be Montana?

[00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.430]
No, no, you don't understand.

[00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.330]
Just because of places urban, I mentioned Omaha.

[00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.650]
It doesn't mean that they're going to be attacking.

[00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.390]
There's not enough people or it's it's a small potatoes like cranky.

[00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.170]
But tangy never know what these crazy people are.

[00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.530]
No, they're going after the big joints.

[00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.690]
Okay, don't you understand?

[00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:13.810]
They're going after the big joint.

[00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.650]
Pentagon creates a big brother.

[00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.770]
So Uncle Sam can keep his eye on us right to report to the Guardian, the British newspaper.

[00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.190]
The model of the information awareness office in Washington DC reads.

[00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.470]
Knowledge is power in just a few months into its life.

[00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.250]
It's clear that the newly founded Pentagon off shoot aims to become very powerful.

[00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.690]
Indeed in a development which has provoked outrage across America's political spectrum.

[00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.930]
The IA has begun work on a global computer surveillance network which will allow on

[00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.150]
federal access to personal details currently held in government and commercial databases

[00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:48.370]
around the world contracts worth millions of dollars have been awarded to companies

[00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.250]
developed technology which will enable the Pentagon to store billions of pieces of electronic

[00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:56.350]
personal information from records of internet use to travel documentation lending

[00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:00.610]
library records and bank transactions and then access this information without a search warrant.

[00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.130]
The system would also use video technology to identify people at a distance.

[00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:10.090]
Total information awareness or TIA was proposed to the Pentagon by Admiral John Pointex

[00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.130]
director of the terrorist attacks on 911.

[00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.110]
A former official in the Reagan administration was convicted for his leading role in the Iran

[00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.990]
Congress scandal.

[00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.750]
Pointex was appointed head of the IAO in February.

[00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:25.150]
Implementing the proposal would require legislation which is before Congress to amend existing laws

[00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.870]
protecting people's privacy.

[00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.510]
Pointex to made his first public comment about TIA this week saying that because the

[00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.470]
organ's terrorism was global so too would be the data his agency would seek.

[00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.890]
How are we going to find terrorists and preempt them except by following their trail he says the

[00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.110]
problem is much more complex than we faced before.

[00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:47.790]
How to harness with technology the streets marks of people on the ground on a global scale he said.

[00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.070]
His remarks prompted civil rights groups to claim that countries such as Britain

[00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.970]
would be caught up in the Pentagon's network.

[00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.190]
From what little we know of the information awareness office it is clear that by comparison

[00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.350]
1984 was just a primer said me here.

[00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:05.210]
Krishigar a policy analyst at the electronic privacy information center in Washington this will

[00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.330]
entrue on every aspect of people's lives and completely change our culture.

[00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:12.250]
It's the government saying we'll collect every piece of information about you and then we'll decide

[00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.350]
whether or not we like what you're doing in other words are you using shaman are you like roll

[00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:21.250]
enough folding it over too many times huh are you wiping forward or backward with your left hand

[00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:26.190]
you're right little things like that does your chewing gum lose its flavor on a bed post overnight

[00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:31.650]
things like that former senator Gary Hart of the west commission on national security said the

[00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:37.590]
plan was a total overkill of intelligence and potentially a huge waste of money is what Gary Hart said

[00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.910]
oh and speaking of Gary Hart are you aware of the fact that they're talking about bringing his

[00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:46.650]
ass back to that he may want to run again oh no yeah you lost a little weight on that Donna

[00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:52.430]
Rice that he may want to come back 154 votes and I really have to look a scant at the results on

[00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:58.130]
this poll even though Al Gore is like a wooden like a cigar store Indian in this audience don't you

[00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:03.910]
find this results so far a little bit dubious at best yes if the 2004 presidential election

[00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:10.430]
pits president Bush against Al Gore I vote for Bush 60 I vote for Gore 42 I blow my brains out

[00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:17.570]
25 I leave the country 15 I wouldn't vote 12 just a little bit suspect I don't want to like you know

[00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.430]
P on your parade and it's a good thing I must add my psychic powers building up again you want to know

[00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:26.450]
why why because I have this huge pile of stuff I got all the tabloid I got enough stuff here for like

[00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:31.850]
400 hours and look at the phone you see any calls I know not one well if that Monday thing

[00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:36.130]
gets the old Monday excuse then it'll be the holiday excuse and then it's we got nothing to talk

[00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:42.630]
about excuse and it's that we don't like you excuse and etc and so on so that 40 and a half

[00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:46.070]
percent of people on that poll we took over the weekend said oh we'd like to show a lot better

[00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.010]
now because the call is a back while we hit a few and that's it we took whatever was on here

[00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:55.210]
and that's the end of the calls all you call suckers out there oh yeah the phone calls are what makes

[00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:02.830]
the show well where the hell are they same old crap six suspected Al Qaeda terrorists who were

[00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.290]
plotting to really sign a gas in a crowded London subway during rush hour have been arrested

[00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:12.430]
after British intelligence infiltrated the group of white public report the man off from North

[00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.190]
Africa were picked up eight days ago and accused of hatching a plan that security experts said

[00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:22.450]
would have thrown the British capital into chaos and caused serious casualties I thought they already

[00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:29.790]
were in chaos over at the gay rape thing huh well I got a big story on that in fact Prince William

[00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:34.110]
he like he collapsed from the pressure he's all been out of shape and then there are all kinds of

[00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.890]
messages on the walls in the tea room and oh just all kinds of stuff going on they're having a group

[00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:43.950]
group over there they're groping with their problems at the royal palace although British officials

[00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:48.770]
wouldn't come out on the Sunday the Sunday Times of London report the sign I plot apparently prompted

[00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.430]
Prime Minister Tony Blair early in the week to warn his countryman that something big is about to

[00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:57.910]
happen the November 9th arrest preceded the tape message purportedly from Osama Yamama warning

[00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.630]
that US allies including Great Britain could face a major new strike and Canada two way

[00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:06.190]
US officials said the London subway plot may have been part of an al-Qaeda plan involving

[00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.450]
simultaneous attacks in several countries the FBI said this week that al-Qaeda was plotting

[00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:14.790]
spectacular strikes with mass casualties that would severely damage the US economy and inflict

[00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:22.030]
maximum psychological trauma now let's play ball right right on let's go let's get those football

[00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:27.550]
games on air baby the Sunday Times quoted British intelligence agents as saying the London gang

[00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.330]
was planning to bring ingredients for a gas bomb into Britain Blair was immediately told about

[00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.070]
the plot and police shut down the terror cell the arrest by Scotland the arts anti terrorist

[00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.150]
branch followed rates of more than a half of those London addresses some of which were used by drop

[00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:46.110]
ins used as drop ins via Algerian Moroccan and Tunisian immigrants dropping for droppings British

[00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.250]
intelligence believes the gang was acting on instructions from an al-Qaeda commander in Europe

[00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.450]
this is an alarming development the paper quoted one sources saying it means al-Qaeda members and

[00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:58.610]
sympathizers are still active in Britain despite our efforts details of the plot coincided with

[00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.490]
reports of increased activity or chatter heard on terrorist networks and picked up by US and

[00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:08.290]
British intelligence don't you love when they talk about increased chatter like that yeah

[00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.590]
isn't that what he comes to mind what you're about that a lot of chatter going on

[00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.170]
Britain's were warned two days before the arrest of potential poison gas or dirty bomb attack

[00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:22.550]
but the warning was later withdrawn the release of toxic gas could have shut down most of London's

[00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:27.930]
public transport system the London underground popularly known as the tube is the world's oldest

[00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.210]
one of the most extensive subways carrying millions of passengers every day around the British

[00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:36.270]
capital in a strange twist the plot caused an Italian liquor maker to scrap an ad campaign for a new

[00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:41.630]
our I'm a reddo drink that was to take place in the London subway the paper reported the company

[00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.330]
planned to walk the smell of almonds to the underground in effort to get passengers thinking about

[00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:50.090]
the smell of amaretto but cyanide also smells like animals and officials thinking yeah officials

[00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:55.510]
feared the smell could cause panic oh my god yeah meanwhile sky news reported that three of the

[00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.070]
men arrested in London were aged between 21 and 30s and were of Tunisian or Moroccan background

[00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.430]
they were charged under Britain's anti-terrorism law for possession of articles for the

man that's I f**king am out

[00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:12.370]
thank you for calling the Rosio Dino Butterball tricky hotline to hear Rosis thanks

[00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:16.230]
giving recipes press one to hear Rosis holiday hints press two

[00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:21.070]
stop eat everything when you go to a holiday party eat the expensive food first

[00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:27.110]
eat on everyone else's mangling if there's us a people eating introduce them to someone who

[00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:32.270]
talks a lot what are you chewing for food into your pockets and first we're baggy clothing

[00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:37.570]
so when your person pockets the bowl you can sell food into your prawn pansies we're a huge

[00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:43.890]
chance to fill out food too continue with a lot of food gone to hear Rosis Vincent Purge

[00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:48.510]
techniques called one eight hundred to far fit up you know that's another good reason we're baggy

[00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.910]
clothing right there I never thought about that right great place to hide your stash candy bars

[00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:54.970]
you'll pickles

[00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.370]
coal slug

[00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:01.630]
hey never stop those old parts at all those other places they put out of business

[00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:06.710]
pumper next more sense wolfies and even if the rascal house

[00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:12.490]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.590]
pember finds hello

[00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.510]
you're listening to the test of the new

[00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:23.850]
oh my god no you're kidding here i'm not that high here's Miami hello

[00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:29.930]
I can be no advertising about what is it okay okay like I said he's not obsessed or fat no

[00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.090]
crawl strings hello hello yes sir

[00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:42.470]
all right and now you're hurting I hear you now I heard like five different spins on the

[00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:47.210]
time to cover up the whole company country with blanket hide everything what's your take once

[00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:52.810]
your final deal on it I don't I don't know where we are we give it a time is he letting inspectors in

[00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:58.150]
are they look to story if they find things well I'm glad you I'm glad you asked that because it's

[00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:03.590]
a great lead into this next bedtime story since all these people are saying you know well let's

[00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:10.010]
first of all they're not going to find anything there like if you had like a cash of weapons in

[00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.930]
your house and I said okay I'm going to come in six weeks from now I'm going to come and

[00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.870]
we're going to bring a whole bunch of inspectors we're going to find those things then we're

[00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.550]
going to throw your ass and jail you think six weeks later unless you were a total moron there

[00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:26.350]
be any guns we could find in your house oh no in fact remembering godfather two was it in two yeah

[00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:34.090]
after he shot the dawn right he took the gun up on the roof and he smashed it on the chimney

[00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:38.790]
into a whole bunch of different pieces and he threw the different parts of the gun down different

[00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:44.170]
chimneys remember that yep down the smoke stack um-hmm Iraq can make chemical weapons that

[00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:48.470]
and that guy asked me what my take was which is why he's not on anymore Iraq can make chemical

[00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:54.230]
weapons that penetrate US protective gear Iraqi scientists know how to make chemical weapons

[00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:59.610]
that can penetrate military protective clothing and Iraq imported up to 25 metric tons last month

[00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:05.810]
of a powder that is a crucial ingredient to such dusty weapons Iraq told you when the powder

[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.630]
was destined for a pharmaceutical company that a former weapons inspector says was ordered

[00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:14.270]
to have president Saddam Hussein before the 1991 Persian Gulf War to work on chemical and biological

[00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:19.710]
weapons the powder is sold under the brand named erasil has particles so small that when

[00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:25.650]
coated with deadly poisons they can pass through the tiniest gaps in protective suits this sounds

[00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:30.950]
promising don't it yeah experts inside and outside the US government say they're not certain

[00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.810]
Iraq has dusty chemical weapons uh in other words like everything else we don't know

[00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.570]
declassified US intelligence documents say Iraq produced a dusty form of the blister agent

[00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:45.270]
mustard in the 1980s and used it during its eight-year war with Iran if Iraq made and used the

[00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:50.050]
powdered form of its deadliest nerve agent vx it could kill US troops dressed in full protective

[00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:54.970]
gear according to a 1990 defense intelligence agency assessment although the military's protective

[00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:59.670]
suits have been improved since then experts say dusty weapons could penetrate the new suits

[00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:04.470]
let me say it again although the military's protective suits have been improved since then

[00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:10.390]
experts say that dusty weapons could penetrate the new suits Pentagon officials refused to discuss

[00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.750]
the permeability of the new suits or whether Iraq has weapons that could pass through them

[00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:19.750]
such information is classified they said the 1990s uh the IA document said soldiers could

[00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.590]
protect themselves by throwing rain ponchos over their chemical suits which would reduce the

[00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:27.910]
fee to fatality risk of year zero one I sprayed later wrote one gets the sense that this was

[00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:33.630]
recommended in the face of few other options the researcher Eric Crati of the private center for

[00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:39.290]
non-proliferation studies said dusty vx would be a serious danger to US troops vx is so toxic that

[00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:45.010]
in its liquid form a drop on the skin can kill within minutes the effects of dusty vx depending on

[00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:48.810]
how it gets in the body would be somewhat faster quality said it's certainly much more

[00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:54.610]
injurious and much more of a severe threat dusty chemical weapons are formed by mixing the liquid

[00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:59.270]
chemical agent with a fine powder to coat the powder's tiny particles with a deadly poison the

[00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:03.970]
particle's small size allows them to pass through the fabric of a protective suit and any tiny gaps

[00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:09.150]
around the seal of a gas mask the latest US military protective suits have a layer of charcoal on

[00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:13.730]
the in the fabric to trap any poisons in my penetrating the outer covering but particles small

[00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.970]
enough could pass through even the charcoal there I guess it's like they use on the seats in the

[00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:24.590]
airplane to catch that yeah how do they work closest analogy is no matter what happens when

[00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.350]
you go to the beach you still get sand in your shorts karate said the poisonous powder also

[00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:33.510]
would settle in the tiniest nooks and crannies of buildings and equipment making decontamination

[00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:38.590]
extremely difficult vx in its liquid form already is a decontamination challenge the sticky

[00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:44.770]
poisonous persistent cannot be easily neutralized with substances like bleach even if dusty chemical

[00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:48.970]
weapons cause no US casualties they could force American soldiers to work in clumsy protective gear

[00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:52.890]
decontaminate their equipment and avoid contaminated areas giving Iraqi soldiers time to

[00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:59.750]
his birthday party couple what a great party that was yes it was but he said that during the 80s

[00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.590]
Iraq imported more than a hundred metric tons of aerosil a brand of fume silicon dioxide

[00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:09.450]
on the money nitolic casted they just decided that they're not going to bother

[00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:13.050]
anything hard evidence of that in September the New York Times quoted their Iraqi defectors

[00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:18.390]
saying Sodom's chemical weapon scientists secretly began producing dusty vx's early as 1994

[00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:23.910]
aerosil made by the German chemical company the German chemical company the Ghusa AG

[00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:29.310]
has an exceptionally small particle size 12 nanometers that means that more than 2100 of the

[00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:35.690]
particles strung together would be as thick as a human here you think that answers at least a

[00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:41.930]
little bit of his question what's my take no what you take oh naked women spell out the word

[00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:45.730]
peace and protest against the war in Iraq how come nothing fun like that ever happens here

[00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:50.550]
alright point ray of station california which i have no idea where that is but it sounds like it might

[00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:55.170]
be like up by frisco in northern california i don't know why it just sounds like it didn't it yeah

[00:53:55.170 --> 00:54:00.230]
like we're a basis or something i have no idea concern that war against Iraq is imminent 50 women

[00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:05.690]
took off their clothes in the cold rain and lay end to end in the grass to spell out PEACE

[00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:10.710]
the unusual protest was organized in just a few days by artist Donna sheen who wanted to

[00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:14.630]
convey the desperation she said women in particular feel about the coming military action

[00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:17.970]
you know this the flood of calls we're getting from women who are really whipped up about a

[00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:23.210]
racket in the aracatech we had one woman so far and she's pissed off the tamis got a squeaky voice

[00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:30.230]
that soft floater for your folks oblivious nothing ever heard us i just thought what can i do what can

[00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:33.690]
we do it's a desperate feeling well this is what i did she and said friday and every other woman

[00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.930]
who was there felt like they were doing something for peace she and called her friends they called

[00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:42.230]
their friends and by Tuesday afternoon they were ready to pose for local photographer art rogers

[00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:46.550]
in a baseball field in this small town just north of san francisco like i said how do you like that

[00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:51.190]
it just sounds point rayas station california it sounds kind of like frisco-ish

[00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:57.870]
yes as soon as they took off their clothes the cold rain began to fall how unusual in the san francisco bay area

[00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:03.610]
by the time we'd strip with a lot of squealing and giggling and whooping and hollering it was really

[00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:08.270]
raining she said but we had fun it was very empowering all the women signed documents allowing

[00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:12.230]
their images to be sold with proceeds going to the peace movement the point rayas like the local

[00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:16.830]
weekly newspaper published a picture on thursday and george wants to see it right away right now

[00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:25.710]
214 votes on our very scientific poll are on eorages.com the two that the two thousand four

[00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:30.490]
presidential election if it pits president bush against al-Gor what would you be doing i vote for

[00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:38.850]
bush 80 gorg 64 37 percent to 30 percent from bush in this crowd i'd blow my brains out 36

[00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:43.030]
i'd leave the country 18 and i wouldn't vote 16 out of 214

[00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.950]
here's a call from miramar hello

[00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:59.170]
miramar going once going twice oh that's a that's glen in miramar see we don't even hear the

[00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:03.810]
voice and i know who it is right wing glen and get back on a poll and vote for bush again a

[00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:09.190]
couple of times glad to cut the crap go clean out your gun tom ridge statement has no new threats

[00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.450]
homeland security chief tom ridge said some day there was nothing new in a statement attried

[00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:16.910]
into al-Qaeda the threatens new attacks in Washington and new york unless america's stopped

[00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:22.210]
supporting israel and converts to islam the threats contained in that piece are the same threats

[00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:27.290]
we've been hearing now for the past year rigid tom ridge said in a tv interview it's just added to

[00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:30.790]
the totality of the threat environment within which we're working but we don't add any special

[00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.530]
credence to another and we know where it wore he said how do you like that now does that tell you a lot

[00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:42.590]
no we doesn't give us any more information but we know where it wore oh that's what tom ridge said

[00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:47.630]
director of home on security little preemptive isn't it in fact that would be a great question

[00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:55.470]
who's the better secarster indian al-Gorr at tom ridge or run ds good to think that's a toughy

[00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:01.270]
let's line them up a correspondent for the arab satellite tv station al-Gorr at

[00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:05.610]
till the a p that he received the unsigned six page document on wednesday a day after the station

[00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:09.510]
broadcast that audio tape believed made by osama yomama the u.s and other governments blamed

[00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:14.050]
been lawden for the attacks yada yada yada the arab tv correspondent yosere fauda who's known

[00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.910]
for good contacts with an al-Qaeda would only say that the statement came from his sources within

[00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:21.390]
the group but the insist that he was certain it came from the terrorist movements leadership

[00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:25.710]
ridge said the bush administration was uncertain of the source of the letter we're familiar

[00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:29.450]

[00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.250]
i have to raise a couple of eyebrows because they added all out of the crappinare and i'm not so

[00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:55.250]
sure that's going to get passed at all because the rea time delay and some other right wingers

[00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:59.310]
have added a whole bunch of extra crappin there to benefit some of their buddies in texas and elsewhere

[00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:06.350]

The same people are wanting to hear the sound of their own voice. Oh, I guess you didn't come back down Friday to meet me at the hockey game

This guy's calling from Detroit to tell me that Moe plow of Pope Poe for what was the TV guide

[01:04:56.450 --> 01:05:01.970]
Security guards overpowered in Israeli Airbus you attempted to hijack an LL flight on route from Tel Aviv to Istanbul yesterday

[01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.430]
Pulley said during the flight the man wielding a small pen knife

[01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:11.090]
Attended to break into the cockpit of the Boeing 757 but security officials thwarted his efforts LL said the statement

[01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.230]
Turkish radio and TV identified him as

[01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.270]
Tech-biff

[01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:17.950]
Fukra locked away you say that FUKRA Fukra

[01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:23.510]
LL said he was on and he was an Arab carrying an Israeli passport in all 170 people aboard that flight

[01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:27.850]
We heard people saying there was fighting and a half been a later became clear from ro5 or six

[01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:33.630]
A man ran a muck toward the pilot's cabin attacked his stewardess and tried to enter the cockpit in Israeli passenger on the plane told his

[01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.150]
Israel what is it is real army radio

[01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:40.450]
We saw stewardess running like crazy from the front of the place to the business section

[01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:43.450]
She was terrified said the pastor identified as monochem

[01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:50.310]
Security guards room to the floor with his legs spread in his face to the floor the pastors were hysterical

[01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:55.910]
But the flight attendants were very cool. They calm the stony said according to Reuters the flight took off a 15 p.m

[01:05:55.910 --> 01:06:01.810]
From Tel Aviv's venguering airport landed safely at 10 15 p.m. In Istanbul police at Attaturk airport said no one was hurt

[01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:07.790]
I wonder if dr. Attaturk was there that quack foot doctor that rumored try to hook me up with dr. Attaturk

[01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:12.170]
The suspect was arrested early today the plane was sitting empty on the ground at the airport in Istanbul

[01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:16.470]
These suspect was in custody of Turkish authorities who were questioning and before handing him over to Israel

[01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.890]
It's not clear how the man may have managed to bring a pen knife on board

[01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:23.970]
L. Allisrael's national airline is considerably most secure in the world

[01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:29.930]

Downs this week you want to go? All right

[01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.250]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you today great?

[01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.290]
How's the weather up there in Toronto?

[01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.490]
Two inches of snow on the ground cold as hell and I love it. It's great

[01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:03.750]
I yeah, I'm usually low up north and right now earlier today is like 55 degrees or something down here

[01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.450]
Yeah, everybody's like oh it's so cold. Where's sweater?

[01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:10.510]
It's gonna be 30 set our high today is gonna be 37

[01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.770]
Yeah, that's a good old Canadian winter. I'm gonna tell you to be honest with you unless it's windy

[01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:17.950]
I was thinking this yesterday because the wind subsided it was about 30

[01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:20.850]
And unless it's windy 30 isn't really all that cold

[01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:26.110]
No, it's not you know when you get used to it. How many as long as you're a wrestler or I mean if you're standing out there in a t-shirt

[01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:28.610]
It's probably not a good idea, but if you dress for what's the big deal?

[01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:32.670]
Exactly put on a maple leaf coat or something. Right. Well not this week, please

[01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:35.050]
No, not ever not this time again

[01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:40.750]
But uh, I was you know just listening in and you know that is Rayleigh airlines and to get the pen knife. Yeah

[01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:45.090]
Who who who allows themselves to be hijacked the guy with a pen knife

[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:50.750]
Well, they didn't well, I know but the fact that even made it as far as the cockpit

[01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:54.230]
Yeah, that is surprising on the LL you're right about that

[01:08:54.230 --> 01:09:00.050]
How the hell he got that through because they've got security that's tighter than a witches butt and how he got it on there beats a heck out of me

[01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:07.210]
But uh also the the cyanide gas attack thing and the the underground that was

[01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:09.090]
afforded by and

[01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.130]
15

[01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:15.250]
Is it's gonna know that at least someone's security agency works?

[01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.030]
Yeah, somewhere in the world. Yeah

Here's Miami. Hello

[01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:20.430]
Hello. Yes sir

[01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.010]
Yeah, hi. I'm at university. Miami

[01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:26.270]
I'm so sorry. I know right

[01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:32.010]
I'm just calling you probably certainly wouldn't remember me but I'm the guy who came by with a friend of mine a couple years ago

[01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:36.910]
We dropped you off uh, refer madness and the billhick city. Oh sure

[01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:43.910]
But I certainly wouldn't expect you to remember us specifics anyway. The reason I'm calling is I had a microbiology class here

[01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.330]
less semester at UM and

[01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:51.170]
Our teacher was just pissed off and fired up about how amazingly powerful

[01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:57.670]
biological weapons are and how they're totally ignored and anyway point of story is um late 80s

[01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:02.250]
They had lots of proof and information that a rat had

[01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:10.930]
The estimated total of 19,000 liters of Botox toxins and of course we all know BT toxin

[01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:14.710]
You know they're all stuffed in in their face here and anywhere else they can get a chance to

[01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:19.130]
But um it is the most poisonous material on earth

[01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:21.790]
It works on neurological pathways

[01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:27.770]
Uh, and of course they never found a droplet and just like you said you know you give them time to hide it

[01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:31.210]
It's gonna be disappearing. Oh the whole concept is stupid. Yeah, that's ridiculous

[01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:35.250]
Absolutely 19,000 liters though. That is enough

[01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:37.170]
If if not just add a

[01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:44.090]
Erisol if it's if it's done in a very direct contact which is a little out of hand if it's done in that manner

[01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:48.010]
It is enough BT to kill the entire population of the earth

[01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:53.390]
The entire population of the earth now of course the air is all it and it's not exactly a perfect

[01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:56.910]
You know installation of the body that's not gonna kill everyone on earth

[01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:59.870]
But but as you can see it's a very scary kind of thing

[01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:07.770]
But it's just it's so ignored and and the reason my teacher was so pissed off fired up is these kind of these kind of

[01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:14.330]
Attack mechanisms these biological weapons are so cheap and they're so easy to hide

[01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:19.350]
There's a thousand ways to hide and and he'd mentioned to us on a daily basis about this kind of thing

[01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:23.930]
In any way, so I just wanted to support you and what you're saying and as a final comment

[01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.690]
I hate the calls the groups serve the people are idiots

[01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:33.710]
I can't believe you were forced to listen to these idiots and waste you know, I'm out of ten calls

I don't have to I'm choosing to do it. I can do whatever now. I want that so one thing

[01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:45.330]
I'll say for this place is they don't tell me what to do

[01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:51.250]
But you know you take the pool and 40% of the people say oh well we like to cause it improves the show

[01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:55.010]
I'm based based on what I mean you've got something to say but of the people we've talked through today

[01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:59.490]
I say so far maybe three people have had something to say and the rest of Marlach either they're you know

[01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:04.370]
Making little noises or they're not there or they're playing with themselves or playing with a phone or they got something in there

[01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:08.130]
You know, whatever and that's it. That's the instead of their off of South Florida never gonna change

Absolutely and I totally understand where you're feeling and I'm so sorry. I gotta go with it

[01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:16.070]

[01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:33.450]
It's another good reason to be stirring that hornets nest like George says

[01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:37.710]
Okay, go go and get that broomstick out and start stirring up the hornets and I could hard

Well, that guy's right. He's absolutely right and maybe during the course of these days to come

[01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.590]
Maybe you'll inform us me and George and Carlos and everybody else listening

[01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:07.990]
What it is that you enjoy so much about these phone calls, huh?

[01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:10.510]
Since this audience is almost adamant

[01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:14.870]
They've got a half call just like the asshole that calls me on Friday. Well, they're paying you a lot of money

[01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:17.170]
That's what they're paying you for to take calls. Guess what?

[01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.370]
No, no, they're not

[01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.830]
No, they're not

[01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:25.430]

[01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:58.610]
Well unsettling at best glad I missed it and he's angry and he's fired up and he's pissed off and he hates this one

[01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:04.330]
And he hates that one and hates the evil doers and about the fact that he dominates in these uh, cabinet meetings

[01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:09.890]
He uh, he dominates he doesn't want and he they showed him making the statement about how well when he says something

[01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:15.010]
He doesn't have to explain it to anybody when somebody else is saying yeah when somebody else says something

[01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:17.990]
They might have to explain it to him, but that's one of the perks of being president

[01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:21.310]
He don't have to explain himself to anybody and then he went like that

[01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:22.990]
Would be able to if he had to he went

The radio's all yours

[01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:42.330]
You

[01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:46.790]
Can't think of the name of that stuff it's

[01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:50.950]
Ah, it's just completely slipping my mind. What is it called?

[01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:56.830]
I can't I know it's like a disease. It's like a disease or something that

[01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.710]
Oh, I can't think of the name

[01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:09.890]
Would you shut up your stupid duck I'm trying to read my mail anthrax now available nation what he shouldn't just ask Rummy

[01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.550]
Amtrak he knows what it is

[01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:17.530]
1046 and 560 WQ and before I get to that story that because I want to have time to strap yourself in

[01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:23.550]
All right, here's an even better one in a different way man slash the argument over Harry buttocks

[01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:24.970]
Harry who?

[01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:28.790]
This is in one of the Brit publications by the little course

[01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:34.110]
Leave it to them to be making fun of us wait till I get to that royal scandal rape story

[01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:39.450]
Amanda in the US was allegedly sliced with a knife after arguing with a friend over who had the heriest buttocks

[01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:48.690]
Police say Emanuel Nievez and Eric separator were talking with friends in Mansfield Township, New Jersey about their bums when the conversation began heated about their bums

[01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:50.930]
Don't you love those brits?

[01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:56.350]
It's alleged Nievez got soft said he pulled an iphone slash mr. separator on the head

[01:22:56.350 --> 01:23:00.750]
Mr. Separators in good condition ever being treated a hackett's down hospital

[01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:12.430]
Nievez is being held on 25,000 dollars bond charges against them include aggravated assault terrorist threats weapons offenses and criminal mischief all over who's got the heriest buttocks who's got the heriest ass

[01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:14.490]
whole

[01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:21.650]
Here we go the bait club secret handshakes now public rinsed yesterday's New York Times

[01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:28.590]
In the early days of the Bush administration allegiance to the conservative debate club known as the federalist society

[01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:30.630]
Was declared almost in a whisper

[01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:36.470]
A nominee for a top justice department post-billed by a democratic senator last year about his membership in the society

[01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.050]
Professed that he had no idea what its politics were

[01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:46.810]
Judicial nominees mean while scrambled to disavow positions they had taken before the society as critics attacked its influence in the White House members

[01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:48.710]
Complaint of McCarthyite smear tactics

[01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:56.050]
But it's if membership in the federalist society was once a source of controversy this week it became cause for a coming out party

[01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:59.530]
As several thousand members at the groups 20th anniversary conference

[01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:03.950]
Revelled in its growing influence in the Bush administration in the wake of the Republicans swept elections

[01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:11.670]
A three-day conference that concluded today at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington meaning yesterday looked at times less than a private law conference

[01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:13.070]
They just as department retreat

[01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:21.470]
No fewer than 12 senior justice department officials including John asked cropped himself and half his ten top ranking assistant attorneys general

[01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:26.110]
Gave speeches and intended seminars to give their decidedly conservative views about terrorism

[01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:33.430]
Religious freedoms and other issues law professors lawyers lobbyists and society members from around the country shared coffee and White House shaped cakes

[01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:38.330]
With cabinet members and talk legal shop with conservative icons like justice Antonin Scalia

[01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:42.510]
Can't the W's star the whitewater prosecutor and former judge Robert Bork

[01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:49.950]
Despite a budget of 3.2 million dollars and nearly 30,000 members the federalist society does not stake out official positions

[01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:55.810]
Or endorse candidates it does not bring lawsuits or file legal briefs what it does organize who say is promote dialogue about

[01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:57.970]
Constitutional principles and the law

[01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:02.890]
Along the way it is attracted conservative admirers throughout the Bush administration in the federal judiciary

[01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:08.610]
Much of these chagrin of liberal critics who say it has achieved too influential a behind-the-scenes role in governing

[01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:14.390]
David and McIntosh a Washington lawyer and co-founder of the society said this week's conference line up was the most impressive

[01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:15.170]
He could remember

[01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:23.810]
Six months or so ago Mr. McIntosh said these societies members sometimes felt as they were under interrogation by the communist honey house on American activities committee for their beliefs

[01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:29.850]
But with wider exposure and more sympathetic ears he said the group now sees a greater chance than ever before to influence legal policy

[01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:32.930]
Especially in bringing like-minded jurists to the federal bench

[01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:39.830]
That is what has these societies critics so worried especially with the prospect of several openings on these supreme courts

[01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:48.510]
The Dean Strassen president of the ACRU sparred with a system attorney general Michael Chertoff and other conservative lawyers at a federalist society debate on a Friday

[01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:55.410]
On the impact of the war on terrorism and American civil liberties miss Strassen invited as a contrarian liberal voice was in the clear minority

[01:25:56.010 --> 01:25:58.330]
These societies done a lot to advance public debate

[01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:04.970]
She said but it's very dis spiriting to me as a civil libertarian that the very conservative pro-government wing is really taken over not just the group

[01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.450]
But in a way our justice system

[01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:12.330]
Federalist society members once ticklish about such a tax seem to delight in them at this week's conference as mr

[01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:18.030]
Ascrop solicitor general Ted Olson and others lampooned the liberal voices who dread the group's influence

[01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:23.610]
There are some who would paint the federalist societies a nefarious underground cabal with secret handshakes and blood oats

[01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:24.150]
Mr

[01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:29.690]
Ascrop deadpan then his audience cackled he added I called you all here because I want to know who squealed

[01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:36.090]
Another common theme at the conference beyond the self-peridies and surefire punchlines and bill and Hillary Clinton's expense

[01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:39.450]
Was a sense of awe and wonderment over how far the group had come

[01:26:40.530 --> 01:26:45.270]
The federalist society started 20 years ago as a loosely cobbled network of conservative groups

[01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:49.750]
Rebellion against what we're seeing is ultra liberal student and faculty bodies that places like year law school

[01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:51.870]
We called mr. Bork a former law professor

[01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:58.230]
Today the society's got 140 law school chapters and 60 lawyers chapters and membership has grown by

[01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:02.950]
People in last year as its fame has spread said these societies present at Eugene Meyer

[01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:10.770]
Who would have thought 20 years ago just as Scalia said at these societies black tagila on Thursday that the little organization of students had a couple of law schools

[01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:15.790]
Would have evolved today to a power of such proportions pausing he said it could have been a grand flop

[01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:18.530]
How do you like that? I'm not

[01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.970]
lovely

[01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:29.270]
And america's sleeping baby. How about those ball games man? Let's get to the important stuff like oh Jay good segue. Thank you

[01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:35.110]
Totally we had a good oj story today and it's from the globe so it might be partially true

[01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:38.890]
oj by seven thousand dollar boobs to make lover look like Nicole

[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:43.670]
Oj Simpson is shown honorily and by the way good morning oj

[01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:49.030]
Oj Simpson is shown under the seven thousand dollars to boost his much younger girlfriend boobs

[01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:55.090]
Say inside is while still owing millions to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson among Goldman from their wrongful debt civil suit

[01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:57.850]
To celebrate the monumental occasion

[01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:02.990]
Simpson 55 and Christy protee embarked on a boo-soaked vignette mommy beach. I wouldn't this is say

[01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:06.990]
The 27 year old blonde proudly beard her new breasts

[01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:10.750]
Which the disgrace football hero bragged her at least one cup large size

[01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:15.810]
One cup size larger and even loud a fellow patron to stab a picture of her new treasure chest

[01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:19.670]
Christy has definitely had a boob job insistent insider

[01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:22.270]
She's telling everyone she has and she couldn't be happier

[01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:26.330]
Oj wanted her with bigger breasts and he's telling people that that's the way he likes his women

[01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:30.530]
blonde white blue eye and big boobs

[01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:34.990]
Last browns cousin Ralph Bauer. He's not doing it for his girlfriend

[01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:36.490]
He just wants to make her into the next Nicole

[01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:40.890]
He wants somebody who looks like her to be Nicole. I hope she doesn't eventually and up like Nicole

[01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:42.810]
In other words, they

[01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:50.250]
Sources say Simpson and protee launched their day of drinking last month around noon at a famous mommy beach waterfront bar restaurant called

[01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:54.030]
Motties, but they really got wild and crazy later at playwright a local Irish pub

[01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:57.650]
You know playwright? No, thank you better get with it

[01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:03.390]
They were bombed said one eyewitness Christy said Oj had just paid for her to get breast implants

[01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:07.690]
And she was quite happy to show them to everyone. She was really proud when she exposed herself

[01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.370]
Oj was just smiling to see the bruises from the surgery

[01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:15.650]
And while he lost his 1968 husband award is the best college football player in the Coles of State

[01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:20.230]
Simpson was strutting like a rooster over his gall pals trophy bust judging by another playwright

[01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:21.030]
Customers remarks

[01:29:21.610 --> 01:29:23.610]
According to Oj says the second eyewitness

[01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:27.270]
Christy wanted bigger breasts for a long time and he finally decided to get them for her

[01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.830]
He told me I've always liked big-tested blondes

[01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:33.090]
Anyway, I couldn't believe Oj said that. He seemed really proud of the whole thing

[01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:36.710]
He told me to cost him a few grand and she went up at least one cup size

[01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:40.230]
The second source says Simpson and protee were guzzling brinks

[01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:44.050]
noting that Oj ordered shot after shot of age whiskey at 20 bucks of pop

[01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:49.010]
After they each had more than a few he stunned people by talking Christy into pulling up for new top

[01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:53.950]
And showing off her new breasts. He said they're beautiful. Let them see what I bought. He laughed and then she did

[01:29:55.050 --> 01:30:00.990]
A third eyewitness notes the more Christy drank the wilder she became she was talking about her new breast and rubbing them

[01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:06.870]
Then she began grabbing the breast of other females in the bar all the while Oj was laughing and didn't discourage her

[01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:11.110]
And then there's a picture. I told you about this picture of him with his phony breasts

[01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:13.330]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

[01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:17.250]
This is worth seeing. I've done paid 17 of this week of the November 26th globe

[01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:20.250]
So I've seen that just just that picture alone. I'll go get it next month

[01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:27.050]
When it comes out there right at one point outrageous Simpson spotted a Halloween costume with fake breasts in the bar

[01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:31.150]
Slip them out of her shirt and I've seen he pulled them out for protein other patrons to lick the fake nipples

[01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:32.450]
And that's what the picture is

[01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:38.330]
When he did it everyone was laughing said the first eyewitness, but it was revolving to watch really sick

[01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:43.770]
While Oj's attorney Elke Lander tells globe Christy doesn't have any breast implants. It didn't happen

[01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:46.250]
Experts say there's little doubt she's had a boob job

[01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:51.310]
You can see the border of the implant and the slight tucker at the nipple where the incision was made

[01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:56.430]
It's in the New York plastic surgeon Dr. Bruce Nadeler. They look like two half grapefruit sort of exaggerated bay watch

[01:30:56.430 --> 01:31:01.530]
Look which I don't like because it's not natural. He said and certified cosmetic surgeon doctor

[01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:07.450]
Al Ali MD of the University of Iowa points out the whole bill could reach seven grand a fact that's got the brown and

[01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:08.730]
Goldman families furious

[01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:14.030]
Simpson moved to Miami two years ago to escape California's tough bankruptcy laws after he lost that civil suit

[01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:17.670]
Was ordered to pay three and a half million dollars for the 1994 debts of brown and goldman

[01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:20.770]
Oj seconds me rages browns cousin Rothbauer

[01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.870]
He owes the family millions of dollars

[01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:26.650]
But instead of paying them he turns around and spends thousands to buy his girlfriend some breasts

[01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:31.970]
This is typical of the guy. He doesn't show any remorsement of Cole's death. All he does is buy boob for his girlfriend

[01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:33.030]
How do you like that? Huh?

[01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:39.650]
You want to see a big boob Oj just looking at mirror that's all you have to do you idiot you scumbag you low life and have a great day

[01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:42.210]
By the way, do you tell me the weather's pretty crappy again?

[01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:46.890]
Oh, I don't know what it is lately because I sure hope it don't interfere with OJ's golf game, you know

[01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:47.850]
Oh, man

[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:50.090]
Yeah, I don't want to mess up your golf game OJ

[01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:54.690]
Because we want to make sure that you're having a great amount of pleasure in South Florida where every scumbag sooner later

[01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:56.550]
Fines his way

[01:31:58.150 --> 01:32:04.010]
354 votes on a pool if the 2004 presidential election puts pits president bush against Al Gore

[01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:06.050]
I think the pits was the operative term there

[01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:10.090]
I vote for bush 133 37 and a half percent

[01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:12.290]
I both for Gore 110 31 percent

[01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:15.870]
Even in this audience which it may be getting stacked there, you know what I'm saying?

[01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:18.970]
What are you getting a few a few ringers in there?

[01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:24.490]
I blow my brains out 56 I wouldn't vote 29. I leave the country 26

[01:32:25.730 --> 01:32:28.630]
As the moderate rational people of America if they're any of them left

[01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:34.490]
They just kind of sit back a little bit like this just like on election day and the boots just keep stopping and marching

[01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:38.690]
And we're gonna go blow up this one and we're gonna blow up that one and tell what the consequences, you know

[01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.230]
We need that oil real bad

[01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:50.770]

[01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:09.610]
Oh seriously what is that no seriously what do you mean transmitter maintenance every Thursday night

[01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:11.870]
This is like the third or fourth week in a row they've been doing that

[01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:16.530]
Well the transmitter maintenance was Bob remote doing peeing on the tower something

[01:36:17.850 --> 01:36:21.290]
I guarantee you that night in Amsterdam man he would have climbed up there and peed all over the tower

[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:22.370]
He was just swat

[01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:26.050]
Out of his mind, which is why I kept talking about screw in and and

[01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:29.790]
Screw in it was great. I wish I would have had a little tape recorder

[01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:35.350]
Wait till you hear this this may make you crap your pants if that other story didn't do it about the secret handshake

[01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:41.410]
Or something like that you asked media giant eyes capital radio. This is from the bdc

[01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:49.430]
The world's biggest radio company clear channel is reported to be planning a bid for two of the UK's biggest commercial radio stations

[01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:55.450]
Hey, they're like a giant octopus spreading all over the world extending their testicles and everybody's a backyard

[01:36:56.410 --> 01:37:01.810]
The American owned firm is said to be interested in buying London's capital radio along with the national station classic FM

[01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:07.430]
Queer channel owns 2000 radio stations in the west and is valued at 24 billion dollars

[01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:10.590]
Ah 24 billion dollars in their cutting corners man

[01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:18.750]
They're cutting corners, which is why what's his name your buddy in the morning is looking for a job on our station Paul Pauly boy

[01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:24.670]
You seen them lately not lately. I thought you ran into with the a sawgrass you're the night

[01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:30.430]
It already has radio interest in the UK with stakes and businesses including switch digital

[01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:35.790]
But according to the Sunday telegraph it's about to announce the sale of these stakes to clear the way up for a big bid

[01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:37.690]
There's a big one coming baby

[01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:42.750]
Roger Perry chief executive of clear channel. They wonder if he's related to Kinder Roger Crotch

[01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:46.650]
Toil the newspaper clearly we want scale and there's no point buying just one business

[01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:50.610]
You have to have a coherent strategy to allow you to consolidate the industry

[01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:57.450]
Any buyer considering a UK play has to include capital high on their list and potential candidates is the largest and most visibly said

[01:37:57.890 --> 01:38:02.350]
The slide rule has been well and truly we're not working what the assets are worth last week

[01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:09.330]
Shears and capital radio fell sharply after reported that had in annual pre-tax profits had practically cut in a half because of a slump and advertising

[01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:14.790]
Clear channel will be able to bid for the UK radio stations when the government relaxes media ownership rules in the UK

[01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:21.250]
In other words very soon how do you like that pretty soon every goddamn radio station in the world be owned by chief channel every one of them

[01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:24.310]
And people should be the program director very be one of them

[01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:33.530]
And you and everybody in the world can like take their radio out and get a goddamn my medax and just rip it to shreds and then burn the remains of it have a big bonfire

[01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:39.930]
Maybe we can get Steve doll from Chicago and we'll bring them all out back to the old Kamiski Park is that still there?

[01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:41.410]
They probably throw that down don't know

[01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:48.270]
Remember they burned all the disco records there they did while we can burn all your radios there once chief channel buys up the whole goddamn dial

[01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:49.870]
And there's nothing left to listen to anymore

[01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:54.450]
What everybody's working for like four bucks in our carlo stinky and making much right now

[01:38:54.450 --> 01:39:00.110]
Just wait till chief channel buys this radio station baby. You're gonna be paying them just to come in the doorway down there

[01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.690]
That's right there be a thing just like in a paid toilet

[01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:06.650]
You have to deposit a quarter in there just to get the door to open every morning

[01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:10.090]
Here's North Lauderdale. Hello

[01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:13.930]
Good afternoon. Neil how are you today good evening. How you doing?

[01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:15.570]
I'm doing fine

[01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:20.550]
I drove a camp here for Lauderdale and Proud County and it just goes to show

[01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:24.710]
Just the mentality of the people down here because I talk to people about things

[01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:31.270]
I listen to a lot of different stations and I hear a lot of different things and it seems that Americans truly are jumper than dirt

[01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:37.770]
Because pretty much nobody knows anything that goes on you were just talking about clear channel buying up all of these stations

[01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:45.190]
And it seems like anytime people get in my cabin I hear that I listen to NPR or when I'm listening to you and people

[01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:48.450]
Never know what's going on. They don't know what's going on in the world

[01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:50.250]
He's to live in a cave

[01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:56.390]
And there's one question I needed to ask you and I don't know why somebody mentioned it in one of the trade papers

[01:39:56.990 --> 01:40:01.130]
Is there anything going on other than NPR being so for somebody?

[01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:04.610]
Did we hear that story during this time?

[01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:07.850]
Yeah, it's something about the religious one of the TBN or one of those buying

[01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:16.550]
Oh that's what that was about these born again Christian fanatics that are buying up all these NPR small market stations right

[01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:20.030]
Also that how could you buy something that's not for profit?

[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:24.190]
No, no they're buying up the stations that carry the programming not all of them

[01:40:24.190 --> 01:40:28.870]
But just in a lot of markets a lot of cheap stations that carry NPR's programming. They're just buying that

[01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:32.970]
We're off-read in the Christian coalition right high Roberts and all those go in right

[01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:34.130]
All right

[01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:39.110]
It's it's just I don't understand it Neil because like I said I speak to a lot of people in the car

[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:41.710]
And it seems that most people nobody could stand

[01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:47.210]
GW what's going on in this country and I really don't understand what the hell they take these holes

[01:40:47.210 --> 01:40:52.130]
Wonder but the public is pulling on a neural man. Roma is burning in their fiddling. They're sitting back

[01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:56.550]
You know involved in a bunch of idiotic crap that they think is very important to them

[01:40:56.550 --> 01:41:01.910]
And they have no concept unless there are people who are traveling you know traveling people who get around the world and go places

[01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:06.530]
But other than that the rest of the people don't even know where these countries are on the map that we're talking about in the news every day

[01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:11.170]
You know it's so funny because I bring up things and I speak to people and I have some Republicans

[01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:17.390]
Why your Republican? Why did you vote what you did? Yeah, and I bring up the press got pushed in the union bank and everything

[01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:25.570]
Yeah, and nobody even hears anything and they keep on going oh well Joe Kennedy did this Joe Kennedy to that bill Clinton did this and nobody wants to take you know

[01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:30.690]
Take a look at what these people are doing and this family is evil and it's just like you said

[01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:35.030]
I didn't even have to watch what was said last night and I didn't even have to hear anything as man says

[01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:41.350]
I just look at his eyes and I just look at what he looks like and I finally figured out exactly who he looks like

[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:45.510]
Yeah, little monkey curious George who my mother used to read me a story when I was a little kid

[01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:51.450]
But the monkey was smarter because he knew what he was chasing after that hat there you go. Okay. Good luck to pal hang in there

[01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:57.090]
You say it was a train monkey something like that a lot of them train monkeys going around these days

[01:41:57.090 --> 01:42:04.590]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 the hotel you double his women are pool and there's Tom Rage who says feel safe

[01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:12.410]
If you get every airport around this country. Yeah, it's clear about the clown with a big red nose on any barge from dr. Patch Adams

[01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:18.790]
384 votes on a full of the 2004 presidential election pits president Bush against the algorithm

[01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:29.430]
I vote for Bush 142 almost 37% I vote for Gore 122 31.7% I blow my brains out 60 I wouldn't vote 32 I leave the country 28

[01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:36.450]
See now this is deceptive because 63.1% wouldn't vote for Bush. Thought I would have said right

[01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:41.670]
But this is this is the dilemma of the people who are anti-Bush and don't support all this kind of right wing crap

[01:42:41.670 --> 01:42:46.530]
That's going on in this country and that is that we don't know where to turn because Al Gore sure ain't the answer

[01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:49.030]
Because he already proved he couldn't win a fixed election

[01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:55.170]
Well, right? It's the other way come on now. No, he couldn't win a fixed election. It was fixed and he couldn't win it

[01:42:56.790 --> 01:43:01.090]
And a fact of the matter is he's gotten worse instead of better you watch him now

[01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:03.430]
You watch him now. He's more wooden than ever

[01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:10.010]
He's a caricature of himself and with all the respect of that jackass and plantation that sent me that bitchie fax a couple of weeks ago

[01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:15.750]
If you can't handle the truth too bad don't be blaming anybody else blame that emocratic party just like this last election

[01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:19.490]
That a golden opportunity right there in her hands and then they blew it

[01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:24.970]
Speaking of people going off the deep end

[01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:28.890]
There's a Cheryl seal column which I'm not going to read it on the air

[01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:33.590]
It was written just a deer two after Paul wellstone died in that plane crash

[01:43:34.130 --> 01:43:39.010]
Yeah, in which he accuses the Republican party of killing Paul wellstone and also killing um

[01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:42.070]
The former senator from Missouri with that was his name

[01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:43.390]
I forgot

[01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:45.010]
Mel Carnahan oh

[01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:47.730]
See give me about a half a second I can remember my name too

[01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:53.150]
And the similarities of the two how close they were right before the elections and their respective states in misery and

[01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:53.850]
Minnesota

[01:43:55.110 --> 01:44:00.150]
And she's got some interesting points in there and about the right wing lunatics out there and it's true

[01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:03.130]
I'm not going to say that anybody you know killed Paul wellstone

[01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:09.370]
How do we know that but the fact of the matter is that the right wing extremist now control a country and the rest of the public sits back

[01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:11.250]
Hey, what time is the ball game? I know

[01:44:11.250 --> 01:44:15.550]
American people are they have no nothing and the rest of the world laughs at Americans, okay?

[01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:20.770]
I mean, I want some of the designer clothing that Americans are wearing and they may be excited about coming to visit

[01:44:20.770 --> 01:44:24.090]
Disney World for a day or two and then they want to get the hell out and hope they get out alive

[01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:31.210]
They sure as hell don't admire the gun tohton blowing your brains out in Cali in the lack of value on human life

[01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:36.910]
And I'm going to change something here on this radio show that that's why it's so pointless for me sitting here and get all worked

[01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:40.590]
about these things and you press the guy damn buttons on the phone in here

[01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:43.190]
But I like that and well, what does that tell you?

[01:44:45.610 --> 01:44:50.110]
That's our audience man. That's QAM for it. That's the South Florida. Whatever the hell it is

[01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:54.590]
But boy talk about that game yesterday man, but I mean but I'm up

[01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:58.510]
But I'm up they can tell you the right linebacker how many times he picked his nose and how many times

[01:44:58.510 --> 01:45:02.650]
He farted during the game and what flavor it was whether we're strawberry or chocolate or vanilla

[01:45:04.290 --> 01:45:05.890]
We got the experts on that crap

[01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:10.850]
And you want to know why why because if QA and crap

[01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:14.130]
Is our middle name don't you think that would be a great slogan?

[01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:19.390]
Can you just see the advertising campaign for that we're wqa and a crap is our middle name

[01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:23.890]
We specialize in it. It's called crap with the Q I guess as a matter of fact we got crap up the

[01:45:23.890 --> 01:45:29.390]
ass is what we got we got so much of it. Yeah, that's a good idea QRAP

[01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.650]
crap

[01:45:32.190 --> 01:45:33.250]
I like it

[01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:35.390]
Maybe when Greg does those billboards for it

[01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:40.450]
Hey, let me tell you right now you've heard us talk about fast train on and on and over and over

[01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:43.230]
A lot of you folks out there are stuck in dead end jobs

[01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:49.050]
I have no idea why when you can get yourself some great training and a fantastic high paying new job while we're all still alive

[01:45:49.050 --> 01:45:55.230]
The fact is simple if you have the medication fast train can provide you with the necessary training to become a certified computer professional

[01:45:55.230 --> 01:46:00.230]
According to time magazine the demand for computer professionals is going to continue to explode

[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:04.430]
The average student completes the training in just for sure at months attending school three nights a week

[01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:08.850]
Once you complete your certification fast train can help you in getting a brand new computer job

As all in his quest for him is right and had sex with bachelor bets Helene Gwen and brook during a recent show

[01:49:47.210 --> 01:49:52.430]
The episode featured moments of a bridal patch after you squirted them to individual overnight stays in fantasy sweets

[01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:59.270]
It looked like when an Aaron had sex in their fantasy sweet one pure wrote on ABC shows Internet message board. Maybe that's why he dumped her

[01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:05.890]
First you hunker and then you dump her and that what he said yeah another bachelor watcher wrote he spent the night with all three women

[01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:11.590]
How intimate to that night get I noticed in the last scene with sweet brook there was a lot of a shot of her topless in the bathtub

[01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:18.510]
On that date where gay and brook smith a twenty-year-old college student from she's pretty hot by the way brook smith

Brook was wild by the sweeten its roaring fireplace

Breeze blown balcony and the sensuous sound of waves crashing on the beach

[01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:59.150]
The scene ended with a couple sharing a steamy foam bath and a hot tub with plenty of kissing and cuddling at one point

[01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:04.550]
The curvy blonde rolled on top of beer-tested bourgeois and viewers were left with the obvious impression that she'd removed her

[01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:10.390]
Top is her beer back was exposed to the camera after the camera stopped rolling on brook and Aaron and the hot tub

[01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:15.310]
The crew had a tough time getting them out of that tub said one insider getting them apart like with a crowbar

[01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:18.730]
They were obviously aroused and very much into the moment

[01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:23.470]
They wanted to stay in there believe me. They weren't just playing the cameras. It was very passionate moment for them

[01:51:24.330 --> 01:51:28.950]
But an exclusive interview brook maintained she kept her top on and nothing happened in the hot tub

[01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:30.630]
She says burger was a perfect gentleman

[01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:33.770]

Admits he's also into kinky sex and has practiced bondage

[01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:09.710]
I've done it before he says a bondage, but you have to be dating somebody for quite a while before you go there

[01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:14.550]
Unless maybe like your Gary conduit don't go there and while he says he said too long term relationships

Interesting, but I wanted to comment on how they they talk about not letting the Haitians in because of national security

[01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:39.730]
It'll change you think we think I'm really depressed. It's a joke. It's just a joke in fact

[02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:07.830]
Right, I mean mostly you don't want to be dirty in the middle of it. Huh until it gets dirty

[02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:10.050]
But it isn't gonna get dirty because it's all gonna wash away

[02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:14.850]
See you're trying to make a negative out of something positive mister typical that's typical George for you

[02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:16.630]

[02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:41.230]
I've got to we can waste at least three hours on Wednesday with that and then of course we got that big noon to one hour

[02:00:41.230 --> 02:00:47.670]
Sounds like a plan to meet on it sounds great. Here's plantation. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am

[02:00:47.670 --> 02:00:52.510]
Good morning, Neil. Good morning George. Hey, I don't care what the temperature is

[02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:56.210]
I am so jealous that you're up there and we're down here

[02:00:57.090 --> 02:01:01.810]
Really and if you saw the movie bowling for Columbine I haven't see I haven't seen you

[02:01:02.290 --> 02:01:05.790]
I'm moving to Canada overnight. Right. That's right

[02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:08.290]
It is um

[02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:11.930]
You know what the one the one word I used to describe it civilized

[02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:16.650]
Well, even they have a scene. Well, there's so many great scenes

[02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:17.890]
But they had a scene where they were

[02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:21.230]
interviewing some teenagers that look just like our teenagers

[02:01:21.230 --> 02:01:25.650]
You know the girl has the blue hair they got the nose rings and everything and Michael Moore says to them

[02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:28.030]
You know don't you ever get mad at your friends?

[02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:34.190]
Doesn't anybody ever piss you off? You know and they go yeah, he goes but we don't we don't just go out and shoot him like you do

[02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:35.830]
It's really funny

[02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:39.310]
But uh that movie will scare the hell out of it

[02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:43.650]
Anybody even if you don't totally agree with Michael Moore and all of it, you know

[02:01:43.650 --> 02:01:47.930]
He's like really anti-war under any circumstances. We'll go for him

[02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:53.230]
But um, he's got a great interview with Charlton Heston where Charlton Heston just gets up and walks

[02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:57.350]
And he's like following out and he goes just look at the picture and look at the picture

[02:01:57.350 --> 02:02:02.790]
It's about you know something that was killed by guns. Oh, no, he's so arrogant and Dick Clark. You'll hate Dick Clark

[02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:05.370]
Seeing this movie. I'll hate dick

[02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:06.710]
Yeah, I

[02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:13.470]
You'll see if I want to say something. I didn't even know Dick Clark was in a movie. What what what is a

[02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:19.670]
Dick Clark happened to own these businesses that paid very very low wages to these welfare to work people

[02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:22.750]
Yeah, and his companies were getting kickbacks from the guy

[02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:25.350]
Well that that was the story in the Michigan, right?

[02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:32.410]
I think it was where the little six-year-old killed of five-year-old and the father was getting on a bus every day and

[02:02:32.410 --> 02:02:36.390]
Working two jobs 70 hours. Yeah, they they were talking about that when he was on with Donahue

[02:02:38.130 --> 02:02:43.470]
Oh, I missed that show, you know because they preempted it because of sniper thing. Yeah, that was about a month ago

[02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:46.590]
And uh, I missed seeing him on that. Yeah, it was great

[02:02:46.590 --> 02:02:51.950]
But um last night and 60 minutes. I want to say something else about the people that are stupid out there not paying attention to the government

[02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:58.050]
Okay, the show they had on I know you watch 60 minutes did you see the whole thing? No, I just saw the part about bush

[02:02:58.050 --> 02:02:58.470]
Oh

[02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:02.210]
Yeah, I don't have to explain to anybody. I love that

[02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:08.230]
Um, they had about the insurance companies and how these insurance adjusters are supposed to like deny certain

[02:03:08.650 --> 02:03:11.170]
percentage of claims so the company can be more profitable

[02:03:11.610 --> 02:03:14.810]
So they have to go back and certain you know claims that are

[02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:21.350]
They don't go by the merit of the claim and whether it's justified. They just keep rejecting it to make more money

[02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:30.070]
And the fact that bush wants to push all these conservative judges in decor that are so pro business pro-terrant company will affect middle class people

[02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:31.290]
not a catch it on

[02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:36.270]
But it's true all these little tiny subtle things that they're doing

[02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:42.910]
Effects our lives because if we have an insurance claim plus effect that bush doesn't want us to sue for more than 500,000

[02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:45.750]
If anything should happen to us you know our help

[02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:49.970]
Well, these are all the things that the democrats should have been screaming about before this last election

[02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:52.710]
But because they're all such a bunch of cowards, you know, they're sitting there

[02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:53.430]
Suckin wearing

[02:03:55.130 --> 02:03:58.910]
Yeah, no clear voice and nobody stands up and says yes, we should do this

[02:03:58.910 --> 02:04:02.890]
We need another party we need a party with balls in this country. We don't have one

[02:04:02.890 --> 02:04:04.930]
Yeah, but then they'd have to be four parties

[02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:11.670]
Yeah, because there's plenty of countries that have that many and more because you have to somebody that's ultra conservative

[02:04:12.210 --> 02:04:15.410]
Ultra-level somebody that's you know to push the more to the center

[02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:18.990]
Well, good luck to us. We are. I'm having a great time right here. Not paying the attention to politics

[02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:22.170]
I'll write your name on the wall. Hey

[02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:28.170]
See you bye-bye five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:32.710]
Civilized not brutal not murderous not everybody's got guns

[02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:37.690]
And like I said there's been an epidemic of shootings here with the certain ethnic groups

[02:04:37.690 --> 02:04:39.710]
Which you don't want to say they color their skin here lately

[02:04:39.710 --> 02:04:43.990]
But they've had in the black community here in fact they had prayer services in the black churches here over the weekend

[02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:48.570]
To try to bring some of these people to their senses then it turns out there was a guy named heavy D and it was

[02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:54.030]
It was an ordered hit from like somewhere down in the west and a guns are getting shipped in here and guess what

[02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:57.110]
And this is not controversial. This is just a matter of fact

[02:04:57.910 --> 02:05:02.530]
The more guns there are around the more people are gonna get shot. How do you like that? What a concept?

[02:05:02.690 --> 02:05:05.630]
Isn't that revolutionary you think that's a highly debatable point? No

[02:05:05.630 --> 02:05:11.310]
No, and I don't hear anybody up here screaming in the oven about the fact that everybody doesn't have an arsenal of weapons

[02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:13.010]
Nobody's howl around about that

[02:05:15.170 --> 02:05:15.690]
So

[02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:24.490]
Part of the psychosis of the American mentality this obsession this love affair with guns. Let me say it again the more guns around more people get shot and killed

[02:05:25.730 --> 02:05:28.190]
The more kids that pick them up and wind up oh

[02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:30.950]
Tommy's dead stuff like that

[02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:33.850]
Is there any controversy about that?

[02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:36.230]
Nope, but don't you be saying that?

[02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:39.510]
Because those gun people come right down on your ass mr

[02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:43.290]
Don't mess with don't you f with their first amendment the second or whatever the hell amendment it is

[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:48.870]
Second even though the I know what it is I know what it is don't be correct in me mr. Oh, you'll be on a mojo Thursday

[02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:56.890]
446 votes on a poll with the 2004 presidential election pits president Bush against the algorithm

[02:05:56.890 --> 02:06:00.950]
I'd vote for Bush 167 you say that to which I say

[02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:04.950]

[02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.630]

Blow my brains out 63 to which I say we'll bring your flowers

[02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:15.350]
I wouldn't vote 36 I believe the country 32. I think I think I voted for that because you know

[02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:18.550]
I'm always out of the country good idea man excellent idea

[02:06:20.150 --> 02:06:24.970]
21 till noon, but I tell you one thing this show is flying by here today. Why not? I don't know isn't it

[02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:28.830]
All the great calls no, we had a few calls that were okay

[02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:31.210]
It's just it's just the nature of the beast man's the market

[02:06:31.210 --> 02:06:34.650]
They're just aren't a lot of good calls out there and that's why that kind of radio

[02:06:34.650 --> 02:06:37.490]
That's why I had to change the show years ago because that kind of radio

[02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:42.970]
Die that topical oh, let's talk about capital punishment. Let's argue about abortion. You know that crap

[02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:44.370]
I went out with knickers

[02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:52.710]
And as a result we have sports talk now sports holes mindless assholes arguing about ball games and who's rated number one

[02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:57.310]
Now about the hercunes and and the pit panthers and about this and about that and but it'd be but a but uh

[02:06:57.310 --> 02:07:00.990]
Yeah, it's one thing that would joy sports is nothing to be obsessed by to be overcome by it

[02:07:01.210 --> 02:07:03.370]
But you know something now that I think about it aren't we blessed?

[02:07:04.410 --> 02:07:07.250]
To be up here in Toronto. I mean some of us

[02:07:08.110 --> 02:07:13.670]
Even though the maple leaf stink and the raptors stink and the argos got their asses kicked by Montreal and the

[02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:16.630]
Playoffs here in the CFS today and we're still blessed

[02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:20.450]
I go out on the street and I say to everybody are we blessed? They look at me like only must be an American

[02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:27.370]

1145 remember that story we were talking about just before the show today. I said we won't have time for that

[02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:48.290]
Yeah about the double murders right well you'll be uh the horrendous story

[02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:51.570]
But this is now with the gun this is with the baseball bat

[02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:56.030]
So I guess when people are angry enough and when they're uncivilized enough they'll find somebody to kill each other for a Miami

[02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:57.650]
This is on a Sunsendle website

[02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:04.110]
A 17-year-old boy was charged this morning with using a baseball bat to beat to death his cousin and girlfriend

[02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:05.170]
They police said

[02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:14.530]
Jonathan no doubt of Northwest 14th court in Miami was charged with two counts of first degree murder and is being held without bond in a juvenile assessment center

[02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:16.810]
Killed in the Sunday evening attack in a house in the

[02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:25.950]
119 hundred block of Southwest 102nd court were just in Morayhan 19 of Southwest 102nd court home and his girlfriend 16-year-old Karen

[02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:29.350]
Irbina a Kelly and high student who lived in Southwest 128th court

[02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:36.150]
Investigators said no, Dell was helping Morayhan a cousin and recent Krolo re-fi graduate and Irbina paint inside a house around 6 p.m

[02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:40.010]
When he picked up a bat for some reason it killed Morayhan when Irbina tried to stop him

[02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:42.830]
He also be heard of that police said no reason was given for the murders

[02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:50.590]
Now see to me this is unacceptable

[02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:53.150]
Yeah, you know I'm saying

[02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:57.930]
Yeah, it's not acceptable and yet this goes on every single day. This is the way

[02:10:57.930 --> 02:11:01.250]
And I'm not saying it's only in the U.S. But they're sure as a hell of a lot of it

[02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:05.310]
Maybe the whole country needs a big anger management class

[02:11:05.310 --> 02:11:09.630]
Maybe that's what it is we could put it on TV and make it required watching every night

[02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:14.630]
Right like you know they talk about that 7-8 hours family viewing time or whatever and I like all that

[02:11:14.630 --> 02:11:19.910]
Maybe between 7-8 after supper they can strap everybody in and like have anger management

[02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:27.270]
You know lock up the weapons put away the baseball bat and the calm everybody's asked down a little bit

[02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:29.470]
Maybe make them take it in school or something

[02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:31.330]
pathetic

[02:11:32.810 --> 02:11:34.750]
Here's Miami. Hello

[02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:38.070]
O'Goneal. Yes, sir. How are you sir great?

[02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:46.250]
Sensation is George on is George on or what he's on drugs. I know George. I want to tell you something you're the man

[02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:49.950]
And I'm gonna tell you why I'm a spick like you are

[02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:53.310]
But you have to take it easy

[02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:54.270]
Hey, but

[02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:56.510]
When they fuck with us

[02:11:57.070 --> 02:11:58.130]
You gotta be cool

[02:11:58.790 --> 02:12:02.390]
Okay, great that was excellent. What's he talking about? I have no idea

[02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:08.910]
He said when the F with us you gotta be cool. You're the man. Okay. Yeah

[02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:13.270]
So there's our first big contribution today, which I had to dump because he used the F word, okay

[02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:18.770]
5 6 7 he sounded like one of the chronics. It sounded like a very familiar voice to me a little intro here too

[02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:25.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on where the hell is this show going to today man? We got like it's almost noon already

[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:29.690]
I'm not complaining you understand right maybe it's because I feel like alive

[02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:34.310]
You know, I was saying that to somebody over the weekend on the phone. I was talking to some poor slob that's been down there

[02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:37.250]
I guess it was my mother and

[02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:40.870]
About the fact that you feel when you're in this kind of weather you feel more alive

[02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:45.350]
Oh sure you gotta put on a little extra layer of clothing. We're heavy coat when you go out, but but you feel like

[02:12:46.290 --> 02:12:52.230]
You're alive. It's invigorating. Right when you're in that heat you feel like you want to roll into a corner

[02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:57.910]
Like you just ate a gigantic buffet and you want to roll over to the corner in a hibernate like a bear for about a week

[02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:59.410]
You know you have no energy

[02:13:00.090 --> 02:13:04.490]
But it's invigorating and you go out into the mess. I grant you they're gonna be some days when you're gonna say

[02:13:04.490 --> 02:13:07.090]
Jesus Christ we're freezing our ass off here. That's coming

[02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:10.750]
But you know, it's just the way it is

[02:13:11.110 --> 02:13:16.790]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and don't you be effing with that guy to just call either whatever you just said

[02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:17.890]
But don't be effing with that's pick

[02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:23.190]
Okay, I see I would I would have loved to find out what the hell he was talking about

[02:13:23.190 --> 02:13:29.950]
But wasn't it the you nailed that he was in coherent. I wasn't the ever gonna find a second time right here's Merimar. Hello

[02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:35.750]
Neil what's going on how you doing sir you watch 60 minutes last night? Yes, I don't know if you notice but Andy Runey on his desk

[02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:41.490]
He had a wily cocoa Bob Bob a head doll. Did he really I didn't I don't watch Andy Runey the eyebrow getting the way my enjoyment

[02:13:42.010 --> 02:13:43.990]
That's you have a good one now. Okay

[02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:47.770]
Larry cocker, but you know something you might just have had it too for all we know

[02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:53.130]
No, I didn't want to I do have it on tape though. There's the good news for us. So I taped it

[02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:57.770]
Now what that was I watched you know, that's right it started late again because the football and I was getting ready to watch

[02:13:57.770 --> 02:14:02.370]
The I was watching a little bit of hockey or something that was getting ready to watch the patriots lose the open last night

[02:14:02.890 --> 02:14:07.070]
So I watched part of the tape, but I got it in tape. I'm gonna go in here watching Andy Runey right now as a matter of fact

[02:14:07.070 --> 02:14:10.090]
How do you like that and also the segment about the insurance server buffs?

[02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:15.930]
Why George finishes the show because what did that guy say spits of a feather got to stick together something like that

[02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:23.230]
Well, I know what he was talking about. He was talking about it. Just dawned on me the calls about the Haitians and about the football drive

[02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:26.370]
That that was his response to it which wasn't very coherent. You're right

[02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:31.110]
I guess that was the best he could do here's Bokeh. Hello. I know how I

[02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:37.690]
Okay, great. Hey, I heard that word. That's unbelievable. Yeah, well that's because you were on hold see that's the benefit of being on hold

[02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:40.450]
Well, it wasn't so beneficial actually

[02:14:40.450 --> 02:14:48.370]
Yeah, but I want to ask you are you probably never read sports illustrated right? Oh, are you gonna tell me the story about Toronto and how everybody hates the

[02:14:48.370 --> 02:14:52.190]
Yeah, so you did read it huh? No, I don't read it

[02:14:52.190 --> 02:14:57.170]
But they've been talking about that up here because you know, I guess the team is so bad. We might as well talk about that story

[02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:03.850]
You know what that you know what that reminds me of it reminds me of back during the Olympics when Wayne gritsky was crying and whining about

[02:15:03.850 --> 02:15:08.590]
Oh, everybody hates Canada. They're all against this and I kept saying nobody in the world gives a crap about Canada

[02:15:08.590 --> 02:15:10.850]
Canada is about as benign as you can get you know

[02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:14.290]
Nobody gives it one way or the other and the same as two of them a believes in fact

[02:15:14.290 --> 02:15:17.550]
The least played in Buffalo on Friday night actually won a game which is rare

[02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:22.650]
There were more Toronto fans in the stands than there were Buffalo fans and that's that's the truth

[02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:26.670]
Well, there are no Buffalo fans and that's right that place is empty

[02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:33.010]
But I think the gist of the article is the preferential treatment that they get from like the referees

[02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:36.870]
I don't buy that at all. I don't buy that at all Canada. Yeah

[02:15:37.450 --> 02:15:41.310]
Don Cherry, you know, it's all made believe so all the time and yeah

[02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:45.190]
Well, that's because the Leafs are the most popular team in Canada. What can I tell you?

[02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:51.450]
Even though they stink like even though they stink and they got all these steps on there like Tom Fitzgerald and Jonas Holen

[02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:57.250]
They're Robert Reiko and a jerky jerky lumay they got a team full of steps Trevor kid. I mean, who are they kidding? You know?

[02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:58.870]
I know they they are bad

[02:15:58.870 --> 02:16:03.890]
But they would say that the league is jealous of their relative success in the last 10 years

[02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:06.170]
Even though they haven't come close to winning the cup

[02:16:06.170 --> 02:16:10.730]
Yeah, haven't won it in like almost 40 years 35 years right

[02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:15.450]
So who knows about them and actually if I hadn't read that article

[02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:19.250]
I would never have known that anyone hated the Toronto Maple Leafs

[02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:23.230]
Well, that's for illustrator. He's exactly who gives a crap

[02:16:23.230 --> 02:16:29.190]
Right. Why would they write an article about that write something, you know, about a team doing well or not worthy

[02:16:29.190 --> 02:16:32.670]
Yeah, but not that's a stupid article like that

[02:16:32.670 --> 02:16:36.490]
Well, I'm gonna put out my maple leaf jacket. That was a former protest study like that

[02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:38.730]
Go take a few slap shots in your own score

[02:16:38.730 --> 02:16:43.990]
Hey, listen, I could they could sign me up good luck to pal go leave school. What do you say? No, they stink

[02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:50.350]
They stink in pet quince as well on paper. We're pretty good. No, you're not pat you stink on paper on the ice on on a plane

[02:16:50.350 --> 02:16:51.790]
You stink on a bus

[02:16:52.970 --> 02:16:57.450]
They beat Buffalo a girls team on Friday. Whoop do you do, man? Let's get real excited about that not

[02:16:58.070 --> 02:17:02.510]
Stiff too many stiffs and a panthers they get a point here at a point there and they get bombed by San Jose

[02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:06.970]
And there's nobody there and of course this time the excuse was the weather

[02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:09.170]
I guess the weather Saturday night was really bad there was in Clement

[02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:14.050]
Hello, yeah

[02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:20.350]
Say George is nodding off again. I talked for this guy one minute hockey in this guy. You're just as bad as mo

[02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:25.470]
I don't know what I'm talking about hockey. I am done talking about hockey. That was a whole weeks quarter right there

[02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:28.370]
It was about a horn or something. Yeah, why should have like

[02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:33.610]
Okay, we're talking about the weather down there and a reason that nobody was at the game

[02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:37.770]
Even though it's at 16,000 some plus at the office deepal Macarena yet to center

[02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:42.350]
That's not talking about the weather that's still talking about the game. Well big deal

[02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:48.490]
And there's another con oh we're gonna spend all that money that we saved that 10 million dollars from pop albury

[02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:51.410]
The same thing happened here. They goost up the prices on the seats here

[02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:54.510]
You got to mortgage your house to be able to buy tickets to a maple leaf game here

[02:17:54.510 --> 02:17:58.570]
The prices are ridiculous and they keep raising the prices. Oh, well, we need that money for free agency

[02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:01.290]
Did they sign anybody of any significance? Oh, no, they stink

[02:18:01.290 --> 02:18:09.070]
Because they just keep sticking it and sticking it and stick all look at that. There's that saline Dion. Oh my god

[02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:13.450]
I kind of let people this is because she makes me nauseous. She's Canadian. We're not too proud of it, eh?

[02:18:14.670 --> 02:18:20.270]
Milletin French five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty. We're starting to get some good hockey talk now

[02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:26.230]
It's funny that he called that it was a pretty good call even though you didn't like it because I was thinking last night

[02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:28.510]
I don't know what what maybe think about it

[02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:31.790]
How the hell did I ever survive those hockey shows seriously?

[02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:38.390]
Maybe it was great remember no, you know, I'm serious. How did I ever survive those shows?

[02:18:40.170 --> 02:18:45.210]
You can't talk about hockey in South Florida if I'm talking about it's like talking about much of balls in Afghanistan

[02:18:45.210 --> 02:18:48.610]
I mean, what are we talking about here? You know, and I'm still on the air

[02:18:48.610 --> 02:18:55.070]
One of the great miracles of all time. I'm not sure which is the bigger accomplishments surviving mature sure surviving those hockey shows

[02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:57.830]
Oh, sorry remind all of my happy anniversary to the rimmers

[02:18:58.950 --> 02:19:02.330]
Saturday with their 27th wedding anniversary and feral boy

[02:19:02.330 --> 02:19:04.890]
She's got to be the best to put up with that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I know

[02:19:04.890 --> 02:19:07.890]
Just come to no rimmer and I both have the same philosophy now

[02:19:07.890 --> 02:19:10.310]
We talked over the weekend, which I'm sure surprises you

[02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:14.990]
No, and we both came to this philosophy. Okay, so how would just take the money to the bank?

[02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:19.090]
Okay, screw worrying about this one and about that one and that's my philosophy now. I don't care

[02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:22.970]
If the numbers come out tomorrow, we have a one share. You know what? I don't care

[02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:26.190]
I really mean that I just I don't care anymore

[02:19:26.190 --> 02:19:30.890]
You're gonna get paid no matter what I get paid regardless. I have nothing left to prove anymore at the stage of my life

[02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:35.530]
And what's the point? What's the point again? Oh whipped up to a frenzy this one did this and I'm okay

[02:19:35.530 --> 02:19:39.730]
Just give me the money. All right. I've already made you millions of dollars. Just keep giving me the goddamn money

[02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:44.890]
That's all that's it. We get a one share too bad. Thanks for all the promotion by the way you deserve it

[02:19:44.890 --> 02:19:49.270]
I still say Greg reed deserves whatever whatever things that happen bad with that station need deserves it

[02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:52.910]
Because they lie and they lie and they lie and they lie

[02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:56.350]
That's especially lying is their mental thing. Oh, we're gonna put up billboards. We're gonna do this

[02:19:56.350 --> 02:20:01.630]
They've been put it in writing doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean squat even Moe is gonna discover that maybe already has

[02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:05.750]
All this promotion they're gonna do for and they're gonna do this and I'm gonna do that

[02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:06.710]
They're gonna spend like crazy

[02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:09.950]
Yeah, they have meetings even when they're a lawyer when they're jeweler and they sit down

[02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:14.370]
They look you right in the face and they lie and they lie and they can't stop lying

[02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:19.670]
So like I say just give me the money. Okay, I don't give a crap what you do just give me the freaking money

[02:20:22.510 --> 02:20:24.290]
Just like Carlos that's his attitude

[02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:31.850]
And they listen to me. Yeah, just give me that big check baby. Just swing that 25 bucks in my direction. So we get over here

[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:40.190]
473 votes on a poll pretty heavy duty day if the 2004 presidential election could present a bush against Al Gore

[02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:48.850]
I'd vote for bush 178 37.6 percent. I vote for Gore 155 32.7 percent. I'd blow my brains out 68

[02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:49.670]
Said that

[02:20:50.390 --> 02:20:56.010]
14 percent good way to decrease the surplus population. I wouldn't vote 38 and I leave the country 34

[02:20:56.770 --> 02:20:58.850]
say to be on a plane to somewhere

[02:21:00.250 --> 02:21:04.150]

Come a sublante

[02:22:40.410 --> 02:22:42.370]
Mingdaing Daichingavu

[02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.310]
Hello

[02:22:44.050 --> 02:22:47.730]
I've currently blamed up to 287 and a half pounds

[02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:53.250]
Though I should say that does include the weight of my blue butterfly under gear song panty

[02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:57.770]
This somewhat depressed and thickened by my personal parents

[02:22:57.770 --> 02:23:01.990]
I try to on my voice needs to be heard

[02:23:02.530 --> 02:23:08.710]
I'm currently negotiating with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk to be the voice of his skateboard

[02:23:09.250 --> 02:23:11.130]
And it's seem to be released motion picture

[02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:14.830]
It's between me and Phil Stiller right now

[02:23:15.610 --> 02:23:17.250]
I've also excuse me

[02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:21.990]
I've also been asked to throw myself into a dumpster filled with rotten eggs

[02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:26.730]
Razor blades and fed a cheat by Johnny Knoxville and the jackass people

[02:23:27.450 --> 02:23:28.870]
I'm considering the stunt

[02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:32.670]
That we are still quite always apart on financial remuneration

[02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:37.570]
Mingda let me restate my position on the current set of affairs in our nation

[02:23:37.570 --> 02:23:43.770]
I believe we are this close from falling off the face of the earth which is not round

[02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:45.950]
contrary to popular belief

[02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:51.150]
If you walk near the ocean in Florida you can actually see the end of the earth

[02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:53.510]
I have been there. I have done it

[02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:56.190]
So until you have don't say I'm crazy

[02:23:56.770 --> 02:24:00.690]
The same disparaging remarks were made about some of our nation's greatest thinkers

[02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:03.430]
I can see my time has almost elapsed

[02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:06.170]
So let me say I have a very busy day planned

[02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:09.850]
I'm off to do some early Christmas shopping with well known a rider

[02:24:09.850 --> 02:24:13.770]
Who is asked that I wear a coat six sizes too large for my person

[02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:17.530]
She is obviously confirmed about my core body temperature

[02:24:18.090 --> 02:24:20.190]
Sweet delicate flower that she is

[02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:25.950]
Then it's up to the overeaters anonymous meeting at the meet and three here in Nashville

[02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:28.790]
My night will be rounded off beautifully

[02:24:29.370 --> 02:24:33.450]
As I hop back home make a quick change into my feedip pajamas

[02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:36.590]
Begin to sip a bottle from James Wein spritzer

[02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:39.810]
And settle into my teenage mutant in jitterdals chair

[02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:43.130]
This I watch reruns the ballots on the packs tv network

[02:24:43.130 --> 02:24:47.270]

[02:24:57.730 --> 02:24:59.510]
We got 489 votes

[02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.970]

[02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:04.270]
Although I think after playing that he made drop back in the uh, wears again

[02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:07.250]
5605 608 speaking of guns

[02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:11.410]
Little Texas high school activity there on Friday. Do you see this story?

[02:25:12.090 --> 02:25:13.830]
No in scurry Texas

[02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:18.990]
A shotgun wielding man threatened to rule east Texas high school Friday morning until students and a teacher

[02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:20.590]
wrestled into the ground authority said

[02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:24.970]
The 18-year-old man a former student at scurry rosser high school

[02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:30.370]
Window the school office in order students in the cafeteria principal Richard Sneed said oh the man again

[02:25:30.890 --> 02:25:33.790]
Why I said oh that story that story

[02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:38.490]
The man began pouring gasoline on the floor and students then helps of doing authority said

[02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:42.690]
He didn't say a word didn't really look at anybody said Courtney Robertson a junior at the high school

[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:45.610]
Everybody was crying. It was horrible. We thought we were all gonna die

[02:25:46.350 --> 02:25:49.910]
Robertson said the principal in the teacher slowly walk up to the man and grab the gun

[02:25:50.650 --> 02:25:52.070]
Then wrestled into the floor

[02:25:52.570 --> 02:25:57.030]
I shoved the barrel up toward the air Sneed said I thought it was gonna say I shoved the barrel up as

[02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:58.930]
Didn't say that though up toward the air

[02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:05.070]
I got it around his neck so I could hold him in a couple of football players and teachers came up and got the weapon security never said a word

[02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:09.330]
No injuries or gunfire reported but classes were canceled for the day

[02:26:09.330 --> 02:26:13.710]
Confident County Sheriff David Burns said the man who was in custody likely be charged with an array of offenses

[02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:15.830]
Including aggravated a solubility weapon

[02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:20.490]
Sneed said the man claimed to have planted bombs in the area in that police were sweeping schools looking for evidence

[02:26:20.490 --> 02:26:25.070]
They're explosive the school about 30 miles southwest of Dallas and rolls about 220 students

[02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:31.990]
How do you like them apples? Huh speaking of students gay students and cross-dressers face resistance

[02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:36.190]
Which you never would have expected in Tampa would you know?

[02:26:36.810 --> 02:26:38.950]
I mean what what that was wrong with Tampa

[02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:46.090]
Milton high school junior Antonio low low Williams got sent home twice after he wore a skirt to school

[02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:46.450]
Ha

[02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:51.350]
Talk about carrying something a little bit too far you think

[02:26:52.810 --> 02:26:55.810]
Especially in Tampa wasn't even a killtall bet

[02:26:56.410 --> 02:26:57.830]
School official he didn't get killed

[02:26:58.570 --> 02:27:00.070]
Just beat up maimed

[02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:04.770]
School official said that boys at tar violated the dress code by creating a distraction for other students

[02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:08.790]
Even though they said teens that were allowed to wear the opposite genders clothing if it doesn't disrupt learning

[02:27:09.450 --> 02:27:15.390]
But the 17-year-old student who said he is asexual caused the kind like Robert Gryper said he is asexual

[02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:17.710]
caused the school stance what he laughing about

[02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:21.690]
Isn't he the most asexual creature you've ever seen in your life?

[02:27:23.130 --> 02:27:28.830]
Can you imagine him with a penis when I think when I see him I don't think of asexual anything now that's what I'm saying

[02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:31.690]
I mean he's just like neuter

[02:27:31.690 --> 02:27:35.890]
The 17-year-old student who said he's asexual called the school stance discriminatory

[02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:39.010]
I'm ready to disappoint in the school system said Williams mother Carmella

[02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:42.630]
They're failing to let my child get an education all because of a dress code

[02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:44.490]
Or maybe it's because of a dress

[02:27:45.470 --> 02:27:49.670]
The Middleton flap shows the dilemma that schools can face as they grapple to how best serve

[02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:52.770]
Gay students and those who deal with gender identity issues

[02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:59.230]
For the most part it was not an issue in schools 10 or 20 years ago and many gay students didn't wear their sexual orientation on their sleeves or dresses

[02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:01.310]
And before legal concerns were raised

[02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:07.830]
See somehow call me old-fashioned, but I just can't imagine somebody wearing a dress to school a guy anyway

[02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:09.750]
And not expecting you a little bit of a hassle

[02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:13.490]
Right, I mean if you wear a funny hat if you wear the wrong t-shirt you get high right

[02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:16.730]
When I first became an educator was ignored said Harry Brown

[02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:20.430]
Pomerhauer University High School assistant principal it didn't exist at West taboo

[02:28:20.430 --> 02:28:23.770]
Then came students and successfully sued their school showing school districts

[02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:27.830]
They could be held legally responsible for fighting to protect homosexual students from harassment

[02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:30.910]
School systems nationwide have showed up millions for lawsuits

[02:28:31.450 --> 02:28:38.010]
Some school districts like Penia's County, Penala's County provide specific protection for gay lesbian students from student on student harassment

[02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:41.090]
Hillsborough County added sexual orientation to his policy this year

[02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:47.510]
Yet gay advocacy groups say how much protection and support students receive varies widely from school to school

[02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:51.770]
As Tampa president of parents family and friends of lesbians and gays jane bulls said

[02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:57.810]
Schools are not doing enough for gay teenagers students at a high risk of dropping out and committing suicide according national studies

[02:28:58.410 --> 02:29:03.250]
Five years ago bulls received a call from a Tampa student who wanted to start a club for gay teens at her school

[02:29:03.250 --> 02:29:07.570]
The girl who wore a rainbow ribbon on her blouse as she gathered signatures supporting the club's formation

[02:29:07.570 --> 02:29:11.270]
Was told by school officials that what she was doing was wrong and immoral

[02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:13.710]
Bulls recalled preferring not to name the school

[02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:16.570]
They likened the rainbow to the nazi flag she said

[02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:23.190]
It took two years, but finally the girl was allowed to organize a gay straight alliance club at her high school

[02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:26.730]
Just before she graduated the club drew 75 students at its first meeting

[02:29:26.730 --> 02:29:31.190]
Bull said people would be shocked by the frequency of the gay lesbian slurs are used in schools

[02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:35.030]
Any teacher or administrator would not allow students to use a racial slur

[02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:39.130]
But they frequently turn their back on gay and lesbian slurs bull said oh how true that is

[02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:42.550]
David Katen all boy

[02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:47.070]
Oh, are we surprised to find his name in the middle of this mess

[02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:52.250]
The anxious David Katen executive director the Florida Family Association the FFA

[02:29:53.130 --> 02:29:56.790]
agrees that schools have an obligation to provide a safe environment for all students

[02:29:56.790 --> 02:30:00.250]
But saying it's okay for boys to wear skirts to school is going too far

[02:30:00.250 --> 02:30:05.310]
He said the focus should be on studying Katen said not focused on him and what he's wearing

[02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:09.470]
Many schools have clubs and support groups for gay students to include Tampa Bay Tech

[02:30:09.470 --> 02:30:11.210]
Plant and Blake high schools in Hillsborough

[02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:12.870]
senior Allison share who

School said schools have a legal as well as a moral responsibility to make sure kids feel safe

[02:30:22.310 --> 02:30:28.350]
Recently spoke about 75 Hillsborough middle and high school guidance counselors and our schools are about learning he said learning

[02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:31.110]
We need to be learning and better don't you think

[02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:34.530]

Christina was having the time of her life and I wouldn't tell slob

[02:40:54.310 --> 02:40:57.350]
She was acting like a kid in an amusement park who couldn't get enough of the rides

[02:40:58.130 --> 02:41:03.390]
She'd get one sexy stripper straddle to cross her life and place her hands on their hips while they gyrated on top of her

[02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:07.990]
And before the stripper was even finished she was motionally for another one to come over sounds like somebody in the Tampa

She pushed herself on a couch and the clubs hottest chicks filed in one by one to entertain her

[02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:42.870]
She was screaming and letting out wolf whistles as the girl stripped in front of her

She jumped on the couch with two stir persons started dancing to her songs to the eyewitness

[02:41:56.510 --> 02:42:00.870]
Christina went nuts over one of them wrapping her arms around the girls waist and grinding her hips into her

[02:42:01.810 --> 02:42:04.430]
When the song was over Christina wouldn't let the woman leave

[02:42:04.430 --> 02:42:07.610]
She told her you have a great set of boobs and started fondling them

[02:42:07.610 --> 02:42:11.490]
Then the stripper began rubbing Christina's breast. It was a major touchy feely session

[02:42:11.490 --> 02:42:14.730]
She stayed for hours her friends practically had a drag her away

[02:42:14.730 --> 02:42:21.550]
All right, it was just last year that Aguilar was left reading when her three year old when her three year romance with dancer George Santos ended

[02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:24.770]

Priest conjures spirits heal with magical potions and cast good and evil spells

But the most controversial ritual is animal sacrifice using the blood of chickens goats pigeons doves and turtles in their ceremonies

[02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:07.570]
The first santeria church established in the US was the

the globe. It's how we come to him with our troubles and seek his guidance

[02:49:06.810 --> 02:49:12.090]
It's how we nourish our souls animal sacrifice will always be planted a part of santeria will not change

[02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:17.050]
santeria has a mystical magic side to it some people use it to place curses on other people

[02:49:17.050 --> 02:49:21.770]
Oh someone well first in santeria with dark intentions can do great harm to another

[02:49:23.610 --> 02:49:28.690]

[02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:29.450]

Whereas blessed charms and turns to waste of engulfed like LA women named merely Gonzalez for important life decisions inside her

Affleck

[02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:50.970]
Mm-hmm

[02:49:50.970 --> 02:49:57.730]
Jennifer doesn't make a move without consulting with her godmother merley who devils in bizarre satirea practices and casts magic spells on

[02:49:57.730 --> 02:50:01.050]
Jen's behalf a Lopez family in satire feels exclusively to the globe

[02:50:01.630 --> 02:50:07.290]
Globe just jam pack with crap this week everything from uh christy prodie's boobs to you name it

[02:50:08.250 --> 02:50:13.450]
Everything from the movie role she accepts to her what the wedding day with Ben Affleck is carefully mulled over by merley

[02:50:13.450 --> 02:50:17.690]
Winful with as many aspects of Jennifer's life. I wonder if she has anything to do with her welcome

[02:50:18.290 --> 02:50:22.690]
Lopez rush to get her guru's advice about Ben after they fell for each other while filming the movie

[02:50:22.690 --> 02:50:23.410]
Jiggly

[02:50:24.130 --> 02:50:28.950]
Merley wanted to be careful that Ben would likely astray and would hurt her if she didn't keep a close eye on him

[02:50:28.950 --> 02:50:31.190]
To the source and watch out for mad Damon to I think

[02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:34.850]
Jennifer asked Merley for a bindings spell to keep Ben with her forever

[02:50:34.850 --> 02:50:37.450]
After getting to know Ben Merley gave her the thumbs up

[02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:45.190]
It doesn't say where ice according to insider jalo's mother loopay is not happy about her daughter's involvement in the religion and the frick

[02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:51.730]
Is coming at a bad time because jalo 32 and Ben 30 gets along fine with loopay have officially announced their engagement

[02:50:51.730 --> 02:50:54.690]
Maybe they'll to check with pilar from passions about this

[02:50:56.090 --> 02:51:00.910]
The religion is causing major tension between janitor mom says the source loopay is a devout cat lick

[02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:03.490]
And wants to end the steer clear from satire and merley

[02:51:03.490 --> 02:51:10.190]
But sources say that jalo is not likely to give up her flirtation with santeria a frequent visitor to my any now a home town or there

[02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:13.690]
Lopez is engaged in the religions rituals in florida say insiders

[02:51:14.270 --> 02:51:20.550]
According to another source friends who visited her and my me noticed what looked like blood stains burn marks and candle drippings on the carpet

[02:51:22.130 --> 02:51:27.230]
One man one member of her family told us that she and jalo practice santeria said the insider

[02:51:27.230 --> 02:51:31.210]
She claimed that a well-known mommy practitioner named bros alita did private ceremonies for them

[02:51:31.210 --> 02:51:35.890]
I looked into the religion found that some of its members perform animal sacrifices and put hexes on people

[02:51:35.890 --> 02:51:39.650]
Jalo plays herself off as this little Catholic girl Jenny from the block

[02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:43.030]
But how does she explain participating in this strange religion

[02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:48.670]
Born in the Caribbean santeria is a blending of Catholic and African spirituality some of the more controversial

[02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:54.630]
Santeria rituals include animal sacrifice killing chickens goats pigeons dives in turtles and can actually with major life

[02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:56.290]
Versages birds weddings and deaths

[02:51:56.950 --> 02:52:01.110]
santeria priest also conjures spirits heal with magical portions of cast good and bad spells

[02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:07.570]
I believe santeria can be considered a satanic cult because they worship the underside of the spear world Satan's demons and so on

[02:52:07.570 --> 02:52:10.830]
noted san Francisco cult expert dr. Margaret singer telling the globe

[02:52:21.630 --> 02:52:22.070]
a

[02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:25.590]
gift shop that sells santeria artifacts. She's been guiding Jalo's fanatic

[02:52:26.190 --> 02:52:28.090]
Fantastic showbiz rise for the past three years

[02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:34.150]
Fanatic during each of the last four movies that Jennifer made merley was a near constant visitor on the set

[02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:37.510]
And she upto Jen's nerves with special herbs and remedies said the insider

[02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:41.750]
Another santeria remedy merley taught Jen a surefire way to fight insomnia

[02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:48.190]
Jen had preble sleeping a reviled reveals the insider some early instructor to get a huge pot and boil the petals of a dozen white roses

[02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:50.950]
With ground nutmeg and specially blessed sea salts

[02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:55.910]
When the pot is at a four-boil rolled up and smoke it now when the pot is at a four-boil

[02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:58.890]
Jennifer pours half the mixture into a hot bath and bathes in it

[02:52:58.890 --> 02:53:03.130]
After her bath when the remaining mixture is cooled down Jennifer pours it over her head in the tub

[02:53:03.130 --> 02:53:06.730]
Rince isn't and gets the best night's sleep. She's ever had she swears by it

[02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:11.310]
And Jen talked recovery alcoholic bending taking a ritualistic satire of bath too

[02:53:11.310 --> 02:53:14.590]
At first he didn't want to do it, but he felt like humoree Jen and merley reveals the source

[02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:17.390]
He wore his boxer shorts and merley gave me purifying bath

[02:53:17.390 --> 02:53:21.930]
Infused with magical love herbs and secret ingredients meant to contribute to his continued sobriety

[02:53:21.930 --> 02:53:24.310]
Jen was thrilled that he was so open-minded about doing it

[02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:27.550]
J.Lo has known Gonzalo since he was a teen according to insiders

[02:53:27.550 --> 02:53:31.850]
But in recent years the pop diva has turned from a santeria skeptic into a believer thanks to merley

[02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:37.550]
It all started as a goof since the source damn would get it cooled and take one of merley's herbal cures and feel great

[02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:41.670]
Merley was able to predict things for Jen and provide her with a flawless career advice. She started to believe

[02:53:42.210 --> 02:53:44.490]
In fact J.Lo's Pasadena restaurant merley

[02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:48.650]
Or a madre i'm sorry where merley's husband Rolando 52's a popular chef

[02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:52.590]
Is named for her spiritual godmother and not her own mom loop a claim in ciders

[02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:59.010]
Now J.Lo is a top customer at the LA Botanica buying good luck talus mints like alligator teeth one around her neck

[02:53:59.010 --> 02:54:01.790]
And asking merley to cast love and career spells in the reader future

[02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:03.650]
But she draws the line of the sight of blood

[02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:06.810]
Jen's fully aware that part of santeria includes animal sacrifice

[02:54:06.810 --> 02:54:11.530]
By sledding in the throats of the pencil's animal said the source but she doesn't want to hear about it or see it for herself

[02:54:11.530 --> 02:54:15.530]
Once you tender one of merley's Friday night gatherings a spiritual get together

[02:54:15.530 --> 02:54:18.910]
Where devotees conjure spirits cast spells and speak in tongues

[02:54:19.450 --> 02:54:23.590]
They speak in tongues and that really freaked you out for now. She prefers seeing merley privately

[02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:24.790]
I know I know I know I know

[02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:27.230]
One on one like with Robbie Benson see that movie one on one

[02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:33.250]
So you know Robbie Benson is doing J.Lo or something like that and he's still Jewish and he still looks like he's 15 years old

[02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:34.530]
He's still alive

[02:54:35.090 --> 02:54:35.490]

Why wouldn't he be?

[02:54:38.290 --> 02:54:40.930]
He had a bad heart attack and she made me have all kinds of health problems

[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:42.510]
Robbie Benson I think you put a hex on him

[02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:45.270]
I forgot when he found out his grandpa was the first rabbi in Texas

[02:54:46.430 --> 02:54:47.230]

Did you know that? No, how do you like that see better late than ever we finally learned something on this show today

[03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:30.870]
Story telling his away a life for Pantoliano says he learned the art on his mother's lab

[03:00:31.290 --> 03:00:35.290]
She loved her frightening with stories of grandpa Gus's hair trigger temper

[03:00:35.290 --> 03:00:40.510]
Grandpa Gus used to run the Italian lottery in Hoboken for veto Genevase Pantoliano explains

[03:00:41.050 --> 03:00:44.030]
Once the way in particular he'll ever forget when my mother was seven or eight

[03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:49.790]
She went to her father and told him about a guy who said at the same spot and spit it her when she walked home from school

[03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:51.490]
the next day huh

[03:00:53.630 --> 03:00:56.690]
The next day grandpa I'd be clean at in the music you him sing

[03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:05.590]
The next day

[03:01:06.130 --> 03:01:10.610]
Grandpa Gus watched from across the street as she walked by a middle-aged man sitting in the doorway low and behold

[03:01:10.610 --> 03:01:12.090]
He spit right behind her

[03:01:12.830 --> 03:01:17.850]
Without a word Gus crossed the street Jewish pistol and shot the man in the leg right in front of his daughter

[03:01:17.850 --> 03:01:23.050]
How do you like that? Oh brutal there's a good message for you if anybody spits a year kid shoot him in the leg

[03:01:23.050 --> 03:01:26.930]
Blood spattered every wrist is Pantoliano it turned out the poor guy had a

[03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:33.750]
At a sinus condition. That's why he spit at nothing to do with my daughter who stood there hysterical

[03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:35.770]
What she'd witnessed her white floss peppered with blood

Joy Pants dad a herst-river rent his mom were both gambling addicts with a racetrack just across town

[03:01:48.330 --> 03:01:52.930]
One have and been broke one habit. They left out was paying the rent instead my parents opted for packing

[03:01:53.050 --> 03:01:58.150]
Moving we moved 10 times by the time I hit high school the one place Pantoliano felt at home was a funeral

[03:01:58.150 --> 03:02:01.090]

Rees Lightning. I don't know why I want was it just from the start of a day coffee huh

[03:05:45.690 --> 03:05:49.330]
Yeah, Monday's very unusual Monday's usually terrible Monday's usually awful

[03:05:50.010 --> 03:05:50.410]
Deadly

[03:05:51.010 --> 03:05:55.150]
But for some reason today maybe it's because the dolphins won yesterday. Oh, I don't think so

[03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:58.350]
If it's because Toronto might win another hockey game this year. No, I doubt it

[03:05:58.970 --> 03:06:05.930]
But there's just something in here. Maybe JLo put like a positive my hex. I mean what not a hex but what would you call a positive spell spell? Yeah

[03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:09.010]

[03:06:11.690 --> 03:06:17.990]
Oh, and I got bad news for you though to show that not everything's perfect. Yeah, the snow on my patio is gone

[03:06:18.650 --> 03:06:22.830]
Aren't you depressed? Yeah, because it's all the way over. It's all about to 35 now

[03:06:22.830 --> 03:06:26.210]
So it's all melted. There's still some on the roof around I can see a little bit out there

[03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:31.530]
But it all melted. It's going away and then tomorrow it's gonna be like 43 and then for like three days in a row and wash it away

[03:06:31.530 --> 03:06:32.750]
Etc and so on depressing

[03:06:33.850 --> 03:06:39.970]
Let me say it again snow isn't all that bad unless you're driving in it or have to shovel it other than those two things

[03:06:40.390 --> 03:06:45.150]
That's I will I will say what I don't like an awful lot is ice you know when I give the everything is you know

[03:06:45.150 --> 03:06:47.910]
I seen you start holding on your ass because you know what a clutch I am

[03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:54.170]
Yeah, you don't need any ice to fall down exactly. I don't need any extra help. So if there is uh an ass around

[03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:55.490]
I'll find it

[03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:58.230]
